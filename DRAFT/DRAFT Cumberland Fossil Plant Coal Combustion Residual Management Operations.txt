Abstract:
TVA needs to decide how best to conduct projects to manage CCR produced at CUF on a
dry basis, which would allow for closure of the existing wet impoundments. The projects
would help support the goal established by the TVA Board of Directors to eliminate wet ash
storage at all its coal plants and supports the overall CCR management program at
Cumberland Fossil Plant. In addition to No Action, TVA considered three alternatives that
addressed several CCR management projects. These projects included the construction of
a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, closure of the ash impoundments and options for longterm disposal of future CCR (both construction of a landfill on CUF property and offsite
transport of CCR to an existing permitted landfill). All of the action alternatives would meet
the purpose and need of the project. TVA’s preferred alternative is Alternative B or C or a
combination thereof. Both alternatives would include the Construction and Operation of a
Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Closure of the Ash Impoundments (either Closure-inPlace, Closure-by-Removal or a combination of Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal)
and Construction of an onsite landfill for future CCR produced at CUF. Impacts associated
with these alternatives primarily include temporary short-term impacts during construction
and minor long-term impacts to aquatic resources, loss of bat habitat, and impacts to
0.5 acres of wetland associated with construction of an onsite landfill. However,
construction and operation of an onsite landfill is preferred over the use of an existing offsite
landfill to avoid impacts associated with offsite transport of CCR.

Summary

Summary
Purpose and Need for Action
This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addresses the management of Coal
Combustion Residuals (CCR) from the Cumberland Fossil Plant (CUF). CUF is in Stewart
County, Tennessee, approximately 22 miles southwest of Clarksville. The plant is on a
large reservation of about 2,388 acres located at the confluence of Wells Creek and the
south bank of the Cumberland River near Cumberland City. This two-unit plant was built
between 1968 and 1973.
The approximately 2,470 megawatts of generating capacity provided by CUF is important in
maintaining an adequate and reliable power supply to the north-central portion of TVA’s
service area. Accordingly, CUF is one of the coal plants that TVA plans to continue
operating in the future. The plant consumes an average of 5.6 million tons of coal annually
and produces approximately 1 million tons of CCR each year. TVA has historically
managed storage of CCR materials generated at CUF in a combination of onsite dry stacks,
wet stacks and impoundments.
With a long-standing commitment to safe and reliable operations and to environmental
stewardship, TVA began to modernize its coal ash management in 2009 including
converting from wet to dry ash storage. This effort was later endorsed by the TVA Board in
2011.
On April 17, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the final
Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities Rule (CCR Rule) in the
Federal Register. Under the CCR Rule, impoundments are potentially subject to a closure
deadline of five years, with the possibility of an extension of the closure time under certain
circumstances.
In June 2016, TVA issued a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS)
that analyzed methods for closing impoundments that hold CCR materials at all TVA fossil
plants and identified specific screening and evaluation factors to help frame the evaluation
of closures at these facilities. A Record of Decision (ROD) was released in July 2016 that
would allow future site-specific environmental reviews of CCR impoundment closures to tier
from the PEIS (TVA 2016b). TVA evaluated the characteristics of the impoundments being
considered for closure, and determined that the nature of activities identified under the
proposed closure actions are consistent with the conditions and environmental effects
described in the PEIS; accordingly, closure of impoundments at CUF can draw from the
analysis results in the PEIS.
TVA proposes to manage CCR at CUF through several projects including the construction
and operation of a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and the closure of the existing ash
impoundments. TVA is also evaluating alternatives for the long-term storage of future CCR
generated at CUF.
The purpose of the proposed action is to convert the wet storage of CCR to a dry system,
promote the future management of dry CCR at CUF and to meet the state and federal
regulatory requirements for closing ash impoundments including EPA’s CCR Rule. The
project helps fulfill TVA’s goal to convert wet CCR storage to dry. In addition, the
dewatering facilities would also foster TVA’s compliance with present and future regulatory

requirements. This includes the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
(TDEC) administrative order that requires TVA to evaluate and remediate, if necessary,
CCR risks at all of its plants in Tennessee, except Gallatin. The TDEC Order and other
environmental regulatory programs help ensure that CCR management activities at TVA’s
plants will continue to be protective of human health and the environment.
Alternatives Evaluated in the EIS
Based on an extensive analysis of options to manage CCR produced at CUF, TVA retained
the following alternatives for detailed evaluation in the EIS:
•

Alternative A – No Action

•

Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF

•

Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF

•

Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF

Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would not construct the proposed Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility and current operations for handling sluiced bottom ash would not
change. TVA would not close the ash impoundments. Accordingly, TVA would not seek
additional disposal options for dry placement of CCR generated at CUF. Rather, CCR
would continue to be managed in the current impoundments and onsite stacks for as long
as storage capacity is available. The No Action Alternative is not consistent with other
actions that TVA could be required to take in response to regulatory programs in addition to
the CCR Rule including the TDEC Order.
Consequently, this alternative would not satisfy the project purpose and need and,
therefore, is not considered viable or reasonable. It does, however, provide a benchmark
for comparing the environmental impacts of implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D.
Under Alternative B, TVA would complete a series of actions to manage CCR produced at
CUF. These actions include:
1. Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
TVA would construct and operate a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility using specialized
equipment that would operate continuously while CUF is generating. Dewatering would
involve two basic processes. In the first process, sluice water containing bottom ash
would be pumped from the powerhouse to the top of two of the three submerged flight
conveyers (SFCs) inside a tank. Within the SFC, the ash would settle out and would
then be transported up an incline allowing for natural dewatering by gravity. Dewatered
ash would be stacked and remaining water in the material would evaporate or would
drain by gravity and be collected in sumps which would drain back to the facility for

Summary

treatment. The dewatered bottom ash would be transported by truck to a permitted
landfill (either onsite or offsite). In the second process, water collected from the SFC
would be sent to one of three clarifier tanks to allow for settling of the remaining fine
bottom ash solids. Clarified water would ultimately be conveyed to a National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted outfall.
TVA may construct a recirculation system in a subsequent phase where excess water
would be routed back to the plant. Instead of discharging water from the dewatering
process through the existing permitted NPDES outfall, the effluent would be rerouted
back into the powerhouse for future sluicing operations. The recirculation system would
be contained within the existing facility footprint.
2. Closure of the Impoundments.
TVA is considering Closure-in-Place, Closure-by-Removal as well as a combination of
Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal of each of the impoundments at CUF.
a. Closure-in-Place. Under this option, the Bottom Ash Impoundment would be
dewatered, which could include decanting or drawdown which is the removal of free or
ponded liquid from an impoundment, which would include the removal of pore water
from the impoundment. These activities could require additional monitoring or meeting
additional limits from regulators. The resulting CCR material would be stabilized in
place. Following stabilization, the CCR would be regraded to promote drainage followed
by installation of an approved cover system that keeps storm water from mixing with the
CCR material which reduces risks of structural instability and groundwater
contamination. The closure option identified for the impoundments at CUF is similar to
the criteria identified in the PEIS for Closure-in-Place Category A.
For the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment, CCR material plus a foot of
underlying soil would be removed from the western portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment and the Stilling Impoundment. These areas would be regraded within the
same footprint to promote drainage and would be lined with an approved liner system
and repurposed as Process Water Basin 1 and Process Water Basin 2, respectively.
The remaining portion of the Main Ash Impoundment would be Closed-in-Place as
described above. CCR within the portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling
Impoundment to be repurposed would be removed to either an existing onsite landfill
(Fly Ash Stack) or an existing commercial offsite landfill.
b. Closure-by-Removal. Under this option, the impoundments would be dewatered and
the resulting CCR material would be stabilized. For the Main Ash Impoundment, this
would be followed by excavation of CCR material plus a foot of underlying soil,
perimeter dike material, and support structures. The dike material would be stockpiled
onsite and segregated properly if reused. A portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and
the Stilling Impoundment would be repurposed as Process Water Basins 1 and 2 as
described above.
Closure-by-Removal of the Bottom Ash Impoundment also entails dewatering and
stabilizing residual ponded areas followed by removal of CCR material, underlying soil,
and support structures within the impoundment footprint. The resulting excavation
would be approximately 40 feet in depth and would result in a loss of support for the
adjacent Fly Ash Stack and Gypsum Disposal Complex. This loss of support would

Summary-3

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

adversely affect slope stability of the adjacent facilities. As a result, prior to excavation
to remove CCR, a retaining wall would need to be constructed along the perimeter of
the impoundment to support the approximate 40-foot excavation and provide support for
the adjacent facilities.
Closure-by-Removal may also include groundwater remediation, but the necessity and
extent of such remediation will not be known until excavation is underway.
Once CCR and any affected soil is removed, the cleared areas would be backfilled to
promote drainage and then vegetated with native, non-invasive plant species. The CCR
material from the impoundments would be hauled by trucks on existing public roadways
and placed in an offsite permitted landfill.
The analysis of impacts associated with transport to an existing offsite landfill are based
on the closest landfill that can currently accept CCR material, the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill, located in Montgomery County, Tennessee. The 37-mile
haul route to the landfill would primarily use State Route (SR) 233 (also known as
Cumberland City Road), SR 49 and US 79.
Although CUF has both rail and barge facilities, these facilities are not configured and
designed to support loading and transport of CCR generated at CUF offsite. Further,
barge and rail unloading facilities are not typical near permitted landfills and are not
available at the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. As such any CCR
theoretically hauled by barge or rail for landfill disposal would still entail trucking.
Development of barge and rail unloading facilities would also result in additional
environmental impacts (land use, wetlands, water resources, etc.) and would require
additional environmental permitting. These impacts, together with the need to include
trucking to the landfill site, eliminates any advantage gained. Accordingly, these forms
of transport are not considered reasonable modes of transportation for offsite transport
of CCR at CUF.
3. Long-Term Storage of Future CCR Produced at CUF
TVA would construct and operate a landfill for disposal of CCR generated at CUF south
west of the plant site on CUF property. The selected site encompasses approximately
174 acres with a landfill footprint of about 81 acres. The landfill would be built in four
stages with a total estimated capacity of 14.1 million yd3. Based on current estimates of
energy production and consumption rates, the landfill would provide nearly 19 years of
storage capacity. The estimated capacity provides adequate CCR storage for long
range planning purposes. A two-lane paved access road would be constructed onsite to
transport CCR from Old Scott Road to the landfill. This road would tie into the existing
access road that extends from Old Scott Road to the CUF perimeter road. TVA would
pave the existing access road to support hauling of CCR to the landfill.
Under Alternative C, TVA would complete a series of projects to manage CCR produced at
CUF. These actions include:
1. Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
TVA would construct the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility in the same manner as
described for Alternative B.

Summary-4

Summary

2. Closure of the Impoundments (two options)
a. Closure-in-Place. Under this option, TVA would close the ash impoundments in-place
in the same manner as described for Alternative B.
b. Closure-by-Removal. The sequence of actions to close the ash impoundments under
this option would be the same as described under Alternative B. However, CCR
removed from the ash impoundments under the Closure-by-Removal option would be
transported to the existing onsite landfill (Fly Ash Stack) for long-term storage.
3. Long-Term Storage of Future CCR Produced at CUF
TVA would construct and operate a landfill for disposal of CCR generated at CUF
southwest of the plant site on CUF property as described for Alternative B.
Under Alternative D, TVA would complete a series of projects to manage CCR produced at
CUF. These actions include:
1. Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
TVA would construct the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility in the same manner as
described for Alternatives B and C.
2. Closure of the Impoundments (two options).
a. Closure-in-Place. Under this option, TVA would close the ash impoundments in-place
in the same manner as described for Alternatives B and C.
b. Closure-by-Removal. The sequence of actions to close the impoundments under this
option would be the same as described under Alternative B.
3. Long-Term Storage of Future CCR Produced at CUF
In contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of future ash
to a permitted offsite landfill for long-term storage. As noted under Alternative B, the
analysis of impacts associated with this long-term storage option is based on the
transport of future CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill in
Montgomery County, Tennessee.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative A:
No Action

Noise

No impact.

Alternative B: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Offsite Landfill),
Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Minor impact. Noticeable
increase in noise levels during
landfill operation. Operational
noise would be intermittent and
generally occur during normal
working hours.

Alternative C: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Existing Onsite Landfill),
Onsite Landfill for Future
CCR Produced at CUF
Similar to Alternative B for
dewatering and in-place ash
impoundment closure.
No impact to offsite receptors
under the Closure-by-Removal
option.

Indirect impact along the haul
route to the offsite landfill related
to noise resulting from transport
of CCR under the Closure-inPlace option, which includes the
potential for onsite or offsite
storage of CCR removed from the
Stilling Impoundment and a
portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment to support the
proposed Process Water Basins.
Impact would be minor, yet less
than the Closure-by-Removal
option.

Alternative D: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Offsite Landfill),
Offsite Landfill for Future
CCR Produced at CUF
Same as Alternative B for
dewatering and ash

Summary

Alternative A:
No Action

Socioeconomics
and
Environmental
Justice

No impact.

Alternative B: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Offsite Landfill),
Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Minor temporary beneficial impact
resulting from benefits to the
localized workforce. Positive
economic benefits to regional
economy due to capital
expenditures.

Alternative C: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Existing Onsite Landfill),
Onsite Landfill for Future
CCR Produced at CUF
Similar to Alternative B.
Increased workforce for
Closure-by-Removal.
However, increase is offset by
shorter duration of construction.

Minor indirect impact to ease of
movement to and from
community facilities along the
haul route associated with the
offsite transport of CCR under the
Closure-in-Place option which
includes the potential for onsite or
offsite storage of CCR removed
from the Stilling Impoundment
and a portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment to support the
proposed Process Water Basins.
Impact would be minor, yet less
than the Closure-by-Removal
option.

Alternative D: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Offsite Landfill),
Offsite Landfill for Future
CCR Produced at CUF
Same as Alternatives B and C,
but incrementally lower effect
on regional economy and
workforce.
Incrementally greater effect on
ease of movement to and from
community facilities along the
haul route associated with the
long-term transport of future
CCR to the offsite landfill.

No impact to Environmental
Justice communities.

Effects

Summary-16

No impact.

No impact.

Alternative B: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Offsite Landfill),
Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Closure-by-Removal of the ash
impoundments would have higher
risk to workforce health and
safety as well as increased risk
related to offsite transportation of
CCR (crashes, derailments, road
damage and other transportationrelated effects) than the Closurein-Place option.

Minor localized increase in air
and noise emissions. Incremental
impacts to wetland and aquatic
resources. No notable cumulative
effect.

Alternative C: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Existing Onsite Landfill),
Onsite Landfill for Future
CCR Produced at CUF

Alternative D: Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility
Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to
Offsite Landfill),
Offsite Landfill for Future
CCR Produced at CUF

Risk to workforce health and
safety related to excavation
and transport of CCR would be
similar to Alternative B.

Risk to workforce health and
safety related to ash
impoundment closure would be
the same as Alternative B.

However, under the Closureby-Removal option there would
be no risk to public safety
associated with the use of
public roads.

Risk to public safety associated
with the use of public roads to
transport future CCR would be
greater than Alternative B and
C given the projected total truck
traffic and duration of the
project.

Same as Alternative B.

Minor localized increase in air
and noise emissions. Although
air emissions would be greater
than Alternatives B and C, no
notable cumulative effect. No
cumulative impact to wetlands
and aquatic resources.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Summary

Preferred Alternative
All the action alternatives would meet the purpose and need of the project. In this Draft EIS,
TVA is identifying two preferred alternatives, Alternative B or C or a combination thereof.
Both alternatives would include the Construction and Operation of a Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, Closure of the Impoundments (either Closure-in-Place, Closure-byRemoval or a combination of the two closure methods), and Construction of an Onsite
Landfill for future CCR produced at CUF. In addition to general commentary on the other
actions studied in the Draft EIS, TVA would appreciate receiving comments on which
closure methodology should be employed.
In addition to state and federal water and waste regulations, TVA’s CCR disposal areas at
Cumberland, including the impoundments, are subject to the administrative order entered
by TDEC. The execution of the requirements of the TDEC order will necessarily drive the
decision on closure methodology as well as further potential corrective measures related to
the ash disposal areas, including the impoundments.
Both Alternatives B and C would result in minor impacts to the natural environment primarily
from the construction of the onsite landfill, but these are not significant. In addition, these
alternatives include the construction of an onsite landfill which would avoid offsite transport
of future CCR. The air emissions, noise emissions, safety risks and disruptions to the
public that would be associated with the offsite transport of CCR along public roadways
would only apply to Alternative B.

CHAPTER 1 – PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION
1.1

Introduction and Background

Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA)
Cumberland Fossil Plant (CUF) is in Stewart
County, Tennessee, approximately 22 miles
southwest of Clarksville. The plant is on a large
reservation of approximately 2,388 acres
located at the confluence of Wells Creek and
the south bank of the Cumberland River near
Cumberland City.
Built between 1968 and 1973, the two-unit
plant generates enough energy to supply about
1.1 million homes. The plant consumes an
average of 5.6 million tons of coal annually and produces nearly 1 million tons of coal
combustion residuals (CCR) each year.
With a long-standing commitment to safe and reliable operations and to environmental
stewardship, TVA began to modernize its coal ash management in 2009 including
converting from wet to dry ash storage. This effort was later endorsed by the TVA Board in
2011. On April 17, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the
final Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities Rule (CCR Rule) in the
Federal Register. Under the CCR Rule, impoundments are potentially subject to a closure
deadline of five years, with the possibility of an extension of the closure time under certain
circumstances.
In June 2016, TVA issued a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS)
that analyzed methods for closing impoundments that hold CCR materials at all TVA fossil
plants and identified specific screening and evaluation factors to help frame the evaluation
of closures at site-specific facilities (TVA 2016b). A Record of Decision (ROD) was released
in July 2016 that would allow future environmental reviews of CCR impoundment closures
to draw from the analysis results in the PEIS.
TVA has prepared this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to assess the environmental impacts of implementing
projects proposed to support dry handling and CCR Rule state regulatory compliance at
CUF. This NEPA document is intended to tier from the 2016 Final PEIS to evaluate the
closure alternatives for the ash impoundments (Bottom Ash Impoundment, Main Ash
Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment). In addition, the EIS analyzes the impacts of
construction and operation of a bottom ash dewatering facility and disposal of future dry
CCR actions (Figure 1-1).

Current Management of CCR Material
at CUF

CUF generates fly ash, bottom ash, commercial grade
gypsum, and solids from the flue gas desulfurization
(FGD) process. Historically, TVA has managed storage
of CCR materials at CUF in a combination of dry stacks
and impoundments. Bottom ash generated by the
operating units is sluiced to the existing Bottom Ash
Impoundment where most of the material settles out.
The settled bottom ash is excavated and stacked in the
Fly Ash Stack. Water from the Bottom Ash
Impoundment flows to the Main Ash Impoundment and
Stilling Impoundment before being discharged to the
Condenser Cooling Water Channel (CCW) and
ultimately is discharged into the Cumberland River
through a permitted outfall. Fly ash is transported in dry
form to the Fly Ash Stack. Gypsum is dewatered and
conveyed to an adjacent wall-board manufacturer or
disposed in the Gypsum Stack or to lined channels
where it is dewatered, stockpiled for later use, or
disposed in the Gypsum Stack (Figure 1-1). TVA
estimates that CUF generates an annual average of
approximately 282,000 tons of fly ash, 70,000 tons of
bottom ash and 629,000 tons of gypsum.

1.3

Purpose and Need

What are “CCR”?
CCR are byproducts produced from
burning coal and include fly ash, bottom
ash, and flue gas desulfurization
materials.
Fly Ash: Fly ash is composed mainly of
non-combustible inorganic material
contained in the coal. Fly ash
typically consists of fine particles that
are entrained in the combustion
exhaust gas.
Bottom Ash: Bottom ash is comprised
of the incombustible coarse particles
that settle to the bottom of the
combustion chamber of a boiler.
Flue Gas Desulfurization Materials:
The burning of coal in boilers
produces flue gas, which is the
combustion exhaust gas that
eventually exits via the stack. It is
composed mostly of nitrogen, carbon
dioxide, water vapor, and oxygen.
Flue gas also contains pollutants
such as particulate matter, nitrogen
oxides and sulfur oxides. Flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) systems or
scrubbers remove sulfur oxides from
the flue gas using limestone.
Gypsum is produced in the chemical
reaction between the limestone and
the sulfur oxides in the flue gas.

The approximately 2,470 megawatts of generating
capacity provided by CUF is important in maintaining an
adequate and reliable power supply to the north-central portion of TVA’s service area.
Accordingly, CUF was identified in TVA’s 2015 Integrated Resource Plan (TVA 2015a), as
one of the coal plants that TVA plans to continue operating in the future.
The purpose of the proposed action is to convert the wet storage of CCR to a dry system,
to promote the future management of dry CCR at CUF, and to meet the state and federal
regulatory requirements for closing ash impoundments including EPA’s CCR Rule. The
project helps fulfill TVA’s goal to convert wet CCR storage to dry. In addition, the
dewatering facilities would also foster TVA’s compliance with present and future regulatory
requirements. This includes the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
(TDEC) administrative order that requires TVA to evaluate and remediate, if necessary,
CCR risks at its plants in Tennessee, except Gallatin. The TDEC Order and other
environmental regulatory programs help ensure that CCR management activities at TVA’s
plants will continue to be protective of human health and the environment.

1.4

Decision to be Made

This EIS is being prepared to inform TVA decision makers and the public about the
environmental consequences of the proposed action. Specifically, TVA needs to decide
whether to or not to implement projects to manage CCR produced at CUF on a dry basis
which would allow closure of the impoundments. TVA’s decision will consider factors such
as environmental impacts, economic issues, availability of resources and TVA’s long-term
goals. This EIS is prepared to support TVA’s decision-making process.

Related Environmental Reviews

The following environmental reviews have been prepared for actions related to CCR
management at CUF:
Cumberland Fossil Plant Borrow Areas and Access Road Environmental
Assessment (TVA 2017a). The EA was prepared to assess the development of two
borrow sites on TVA property to be used to support partial closure of the Fly Ash
and Gypsum Stacks in accordance with their solid waste permits and other plant
operations. The EA also evaluated the construction of an access road to reach the
borrow sites. Borrow from these areas may be needed to support future activities
evaluated in this EIS.
Final Ash Impoundment Closure Environmental Impact Statement (TVA 2016b). The
PEIS was prepared to address the closure of CCR impoundments at all of TVA’s
coal-fired power plants. The report consists of two parts: Part I – Programmatic
National Environmental Policy Act Review and Part II – Site-Specific NEPA Review.
In Part I, TVA programmatically considered environmental effects of closure of ash
impoundments using two primary closure methods: (1) Closure-in-Place and
(2) Closure-by-Removal. A Record of Decision was released in July of 2016 that
would allow future environmental reviews of CCR impoundment closures to tier from
the Final PEIS. This EIS is intended to tier from the Final PEIS to evaluate the
closure alternatives for the existing ash impoundments at CUF.
Shawnee Fossil Plant Bottom Ash Process Dewatering Facility EA (TVA 2016d).
This EA evaluated the installation of equipment to remove water from bottom ash
generated at Shawnee Fossil Plant (SHF). The bottom ash dewatering equipment
proposed at Shawnee is similar to the proposed dewatering equipment for bottom
ash at CUF.
Integrated Resource Plan, 2015 Final Report (TVA 2015a). This plan provides
direction for how TVA will meet the long-term energy needs of the Tennessee Valley
region. This document and the associated Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement evaluate scenarios that could unfold over the next 20 years. It discusses
ways that TVA can meet future power demand economically while supporting TVA’s
equally important mandates for environmental stewardship and economic
development across the Tennessee Valley. The report indicated that a diverse
portfolio is the best way to deliver low-cost, reliable electricity. TVA released the
accompanying Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for TVA’s
Integrated Resource Plan in July 2015 (TVA 2015b).
Environmental Assessment for Cumberland Fossil Plant: Sale of Property for
Industrial Development (TVA 1997). This EA evaluated the sale of TVA property for
development of a gypsum wallboard plant and gypsum processing plant that would
utilize FGD scrubber gypsum from CUF. Gypsum is currently beneficially re-used at
the wallboard plant.
Environmental Assessment Development of By-Product Disposal Facilities
Cumberland Fossil Plant – Flue Gas Desulfurization Gypsum and Fly Ash (TVA
1992). This EA evaluated disposal options for gypsum and fly ash at CUF. The
selected alternative is the use of the current gypsum and fly ash stacks.

1.7.1 Notice of Intent
TVA’s 30-day scoping period was initiated on December 5, 2016, with the publication in the
Federal Register of the NOI. The NOI announced that TVA planned to prepare an EIS to
address the management of CCR at CUF. In addition, TVA published notices regarding this
effort in regional and local newspapers; issued a news release to media; and posted the
news release on the TVA Web site to solicit public input.
TVA also developed an initial project mailing list that included local and regional
stakeholders, governments and other interested parties. Letters were sent to notify those on
the list of the project. Approximately 350 postcards were also mailed to all residents within
3 miles of the plant.
TVA held a public scoping meeting on December 12, 2015, in Clarksville, Tennessee.
Approximately 10 people attended the scoping meeting. Attendees included members of
the public, media representatives and other special interest groups.
1.7.2 Scoping Feedback
TVA received six comment submissions. Of the six submissions, four were from members
of the public and two were from environmental advocacy organizations. These
organizations are:
• Sierra Club (583 individuals signed a form letter, 134 of these commenters also
submitted individual comments). Most of the comments expressed concern that
water quality be protected.
•

The Southern Environmental Law Center and nine other environmental advocacy
groups submitted a 13-page letter with 12 attachments.

Comments received addressed project alternatives, adequacy of impact analysis,
groundwater and surface water, aquatic ecology, tiering from the PEIS, and general topics.
In addition, TVA received a copy of four comment submissions which had been previously
submitted in relation to the Ash Impoundment Closure PEIS process. Those four sets of
comments were previously addressed in Appendix A of the PEIS and are not addressed
further in this document. The Final Ash Impoundment Closure Environmental Impact

CHAPTER 2 – ALTERNATIVES
2.1

Introduction

CUF produces electricity using two active coal-fired generating units (Units 1 and 2) which
produce CCR including fly ash, gypsum and/or bottom ash. TVA is considering a series of
actions to manage CCR produced at CUF. These actions include the construction and
operation of a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, closure of existing impoundments, and
management and storage of future dry CCR generated at CUF.
These actions are summarized below and are illustrated on Figure 2-1.
1. Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
TVA would construct a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility which would convert wet bottom ash
generated at CUF to a dry CCR product using a continuous or “once-through” system. TVA
may construct a recirculation system in a subsequent phase where excess water would be
routed back to the plant and reused.
2. Close Existing Impoundments
Alternatives developed by TVA to implement
impoundment closure incorporate elements of both
Closure-by-Removal and Closure-in-Place as
described below:
a) Closure-in-Place
b) Combination of Closure-in-Place and
Closure-by-Removal – Any CCR removed
from the impoundments would be
transported to an existing onsite landfill (Fly
Ash Stack), or to an existing offsite landfill
c) Closure-by-Removal – Any CCR removed
from the impoundments would be
transported to an onsite landfill (Fly Ash
Stack), or
d) Closure-by-Removal – Any CCR removed
from the impoundments would be
transported to an existing offsite landfill.

Onsite vs Offsite
In this EIS, options for management of
CCR produced at CUF include offsite and
onsite storage. These options would apply
to both existing CCR (CCR in the
impoundments) and future CCR (dry CCR
that would be produced at CUF under all of
the proposed alternatives).
Onsite: Location within the boundaries of
TVA owned property on CUF.
Offsite: A landfill location in the vicinity of
CUF which would already be permitted
to accept CCR. The analysis of impacts
associated with the offsite management
of CCR (both existing and future CCR)
are based on the closest landfill that can
currently accept CCR material, the BiCounty Solid Waste Management
Landfill in Montgomery County,
Tennessee.

3. Long-term Storage of Future Dry CCR Produced at CUF.
Alternatives developed by TVA to evaluate the management of future dry CCR produced at
CUF include:
a) Construction and operation of an onsite landfill.
b) Transportation of CCR to an existing offsite landfill.

Description of TVA’s Proposed Projects for Management of CCR
and Preliminary Alternatives

2.2.1 Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
TVA intends to transition from a wet storage system to dry storage at CUF and close all wet
impoundments containing CCR. To enable this wet-to-dry conversion, TVA proposes to
construct and operate a bottom ash dewatering facility to help manage its bottom ash,
economizer ash, and pyrites (hereinafter referred to as bottom ash).
Construction of the bottom ash dewatering facility is expected to take place over an 18- to
24-month period. The proposed bottom ash dewatering facility would be constructed within
a 30.3-acre previously disturbed site located south of Units 1 and 2. TVA has identified
approximately 128 acres including the fly ash stack and portions of the gypsum stack that
could be used for temporary equipment laydown and mobilization during construction of the
bottom ash dewatering facility and closure of the ash impoundments (Figure 2-2).
Bottom ash would be dewatered using specialized equipment that would operate
continuously while CUF is generating. Dewatering would involve two basic processes. In
the first process, sluice water containing bottom ash residuals would be pumped from the
powerhouse to the top of two of the three submerged flight conveyers (SFC) inside a tank.
Within the SFC, the ash would settle out and would then be transported up an incline
allowing for natural dewatering by gravity. Dewatered ash would be stacked on concrete
pads in piles within a storage bunker with a total combined storage capacity of 3 days/80
hours. The maximum height of the storage pile would be 40 to 50 feet at full capacity. Any
remaining water in the material would evaporate or would drain by gravity and be collected
in sumps which would drain back to the facility for treatment. The dewatered dry bottom ash
would be transported by truck to a permitted landfill.
In the second process, water collected from the SFC would be sent to one of three clarifier
tanks (72 feet in diameter and 16 feet high). Wastewater treatment chemicals would be
used to facilitate settling of the solids in the clarifiers. The chemicals to be used would be
evaluated to ensure they are safe for aquatic organisms and are not detrimental to water
quality. Fine ash solids would be pumped back into the SFC for further dewatering. Clarified
water would be conveyed to a process water tank which would supply water for use in the
dewatering system. Excess water from the process water tank would be conveyed to the
proposed Process Water Basins 1 and 2 and ultimately to an NPDES permitted outfall.
The bottom ash dewatering facility would be designed using three sets of parallel treatment
systems to provide redundancy and operational flexibility allowing dewatering to continue in
the event of system mechanical problems.
Under this alternative, TVA may construct a recirculation system in a subsequent phase
where excess water would be routed back to the plant for future sluicing or other allowed
reuse operations. The recirculation system would be contained within the existing facility
footprint.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 2 – Alternatives

During the interim period between closure of the Bottom Ash Impoundment and prior to
construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, bottom ash and gypsum fines would be
directed to standalone tanks and would be dipped or scooped for removal and placed in
trucks to be transported to either the current onsite stack or the future onsite landfill. Once
the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility is operational, the standalone tanks would be used to
support process water treatment or to support other plant needs. The tanks would be
placed within the closed portion of the Main Ash Impoundment or within the closed portion
of the Bottom Ash Impoundment.
2.2.1.1 Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility Alternatives Considered, but Eliminated
from Detailed Consideration
Boiler Bottom Ash Removal System. Under this alternative, TVA would construct a SFC
directly beneath each active boiler unit within the powerhouse. Instead of sluicing bottom
ash to a dewatering facility, the quenched bottom ash would be transported up an incline
allowing for natural dewatering by gravity. At the top of the incline, the ash would be
discharged to concrete pads (storage bunkers) for temporary storage and additional
drainage. As such, there would be no bottom ash sluice water, and there would be no need
for a recirculation system. However, there is not enough physical clearance to
accommodate the required ash conveyance equipment underneath the boiler bottoms, and
there is not enough space to locate the supporting and auxiliary equipment close to the
boiler bottoms. Therefore, this alternative would not be feasible and was eliminated from
further consideration.
Mechanical Removal Using Excavators in Settling Tanks. Under this alternative, bottom ash
would be sluiced from the powerhouse to a series of above-ground holding tanks, where
the ash solids would settle out to the bottom of the tanks. As a tank becomes filled with
solids and settling efficiency is reduced, the bottom ash would be excavated out of the tank
using mechanical excavators and allowed to dry in piles on the ground. After further
dewatering and drying, the bottom ash would be transported to the selected permitted
landfill. Effluent water from the tanks would be discharged through the NPDES-permitted
outfall. This process is labor-intensive and would result in higher uncertainty in meeting
CCR management and NPDES permit requirements. Additional measures to meet CCR
management requirements could include concrete bunkers and runoff collection in sumps.
Additional measures to meet NPDES requirements could include process water tanks.
Once these measures are added, this alternative would have the same effectiveness as the
proposed dewatering facility, but this alternative is more labor intensive and costly than the
proposed dewatering facility. Although TVA proposes to use a similar system to temporarily
handle bottom ash during the interim period between closure of the Bottom Ash
Impoundment and prior to construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, the
permanent use of this alternative was eliminated from further consideration as this would
have the same effectiveness as the proposed facility at an increased cost.
Isolation and Separate Processing of Bottom Ash and Mill Reject Streams. This alternative
involves the construction of a mill reject separation system in addition to the bottom ash
system. The mill rejects and bottom ash would be conveyed in separate sluice streams, and
each sluice stream would have its own dewatering facilities. This would increase the
marketability of the bottom ash for beneficial reuse. This alternative was eliminated for
further consideration at this time as the construction of both a mill reject separator and
bottom ash separator would nearly double the cost of the dewatering process, double the
construction period and require a larger footprint that would increase environmental impact.
In addition, given the variability of the bottom ash market, which is related to construction

13

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

markets, there is a high probability that bottom ash would need to be stored during low
market periods, resulting in logistical, storage, and transportation issues. Additionally, mill
reject handling and storage or disposal would be required.
Dry Boiler Bottom Conversion. Conversion from wet boiler bottoms to dry bottoms and
removing bottom ash in a dry state using methods that do not use water to cool the ash
such as pneumatic conveying, DRYCON™, and vibrating ash conveying, were also
considered. CUF is not a candidate for this process due to the space limitations and the
hopper arrangements in the basement of the plant. The boilers at CUF are in basements
close to the powerhouse floor. The physical clearance is insufficient to accommodate the
required dry ash conveyance and supporting equipment in proximity to the boiler bottoms.
Further, the cost of Dry Boiler Bottom Conversion systems was found to be at least an
order of magnitude higher than the wet-to-dry conversion. For these reasons, this
alternative was eliminated from further consideration.

Ash Impoundment Closure

2.2.2.1 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement
As described previously, TVA issued a Final PEIS in June 2016 that analyzed methods for
closing impoundments that contain CCR materials at TVA fossil plants. The PEIS identified
specific screening and evaluation factors to help frame the assessment of future closure
actions at TVA facilities. The ROD, released in July 2016, determined that future
environmental reviews of CCR impoundment closures at TVA facilities could tier from the
PEIS if the impoundments fit into the framework established in the PEIS. Figure 2-3
provides the conceptual framework used to evaluate ash impoundment closures to
determine if the conclusions reached from the PEIS would be applicable to the proposed
impoundment closures at CUF.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

The PEIS programmatically considered all TVA ash impoundment closures and the
environmental effects of two primary ash impoundment closure methods:
1. Closure-in-Place. Closure-in-Place involves stabilizing the CCR in place and
installing a cover system.
2. Closure-by-Removal. Closure-by-Removal involves excavating and relocating the
CCR from the ash impoundment in accordance with federal and state requirements
to an approved onsite or offsite disposal facility. The CCR may also be beneficially
used in products or structural fills.
At the programmatic level, TVA concluded that both closure options can be equally
protective of human health and the environment provided they are implemented properly. In
most situations, Closure-in-Place likely will be more environmentally beneficial and less
costly than Closure-by-Removal, especially when the amount of CCR material that must be
moved from the site exceeds 600,000 cubic yards (yd3) and the amount of borrow that
needs to be delivered to the site exceeds 200,000 yd3.
For Closure-in-Place, TVA’s analyses also confirmed EPA’s determination that dewatering
and capping impoundments would reduce groundwater contamination and structural
stability risks because the water pressure would be reduced. Compared to Closure-byRemoval, this alternative would have less risk to workforce health and safety than those
related to offsite transportation of CCR (crashes, derailments, road damage and other
transportation-related effects).
Closure-by-Removal would reduce groundwater contamination risks more than Closure-inPlace over the long term when CCR intersects with groundwater because CCR material
would be excavated and moved to a permitted landfill. However, this alternative would
result in greater impacts associated with other environmental factors (air quality, noise) and
would increase the potential for impacts on worker-related and transportation-related health
and safety.
Furthermore, as described in Part I, Section 2.3 of the PEIS, Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) has developed a comprehensive analytical tool, the “Relative Impact
Framework” (RIF) to assess and compare the potential health and environmental impacts of
the two CCR impoundment closure alternatives: Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal
(EPRI 2016). EPRI qualitatively applied its RIF to specific CCR facilities that TVA proposed
to close in Part II of the PEIS. EPRI’s site-specific analyses confirm TVA’s programmatic
conclusions about the merits of and relative differences between the two closure methods.
2.2.2.2 Tiering from Ash Impoundment Closure PEIS
This section considers the applicability and appropriateness of the ash impoundment
closures at CUF for second tier NEPA analysis under the PEIS. As such, this analysis
considers both the characteristics of the impoundments being considered for closure, and
the nature of activities proposed under the closure action. Substantial deviations in either
impoundment characteristics or the type and extent of proposed actions to conduct closure
may either negate the applicability of tiering or necessitate additional specialized
site-specific analyses.
Applicability of impoundment closures under consideration at CUF to the characteristics of
impoundment closures considered in the PEIS is demonstrated in the Table 2-2.

CUF Characteristics

Volume of CCR
Materials

The size of an ash impoundment and volume of CCR affect
closure activities, potential environmental impacts and cost.
CCR volume within ash impoundments considered in the
PEIS ranged from 10,000 to 25,000,000 yd3.

Volumes of CCR in the ash impoundments at CUF are:
Main Ash Impoundment = 1.1 million yd3
Bottom Ash Impoundment = 334,000 yd3
Stilling Impoundment = 180,000 yd3

Schedule/Duration
of Closure
Activities

Time necessary to complete closure activities at an ash
impoundment affects the reasonability of closure alternatives.
The range of closure durations determined in the PEIS were
as follows:
Closure-in-Place: Less than 5 years
Closure-by-Removal: 2.7 years to 170 years

Based upon analyses of the PEIS and the total volume of CCR in
the ash impoundments at CUF they could be closed within
5 years using Closure-in-Place.
Time to close each impoundment using Closure-by-Removal
(storage of existing CCR in onsite landfill):
Main Ash Impoundment/ Stilling Impoundment = up to
2 years
Bottom Ash Impoundment = up to 1.5 years (note: does not
include time to construct the 40-foot retaining wall along the
perimeter of the impoundment prior to excavation)

Time to close each impoundment using Closure-by-Removal to
an offsite landfill is as follows:
Main Ash Impoundment/Stilling Impoundment = up to
8.4 years
Bottom Ash Impoundment = up to 3.2 years (note: does not
include time to construct the 40-foot retaining wall along the
perimeter of the impoundment prior to excavation)

Risk to Human
Health and Safety
Relating to
Closure Activities

Closure activities entail a range of construction activities that
represent a potential risk to the health and safety of the
workforce and the public. Excavations associated with the
Closure-by-Removal alternative are dangerous as noted by
reports of accidents leading to injury or death in the industry.
As discussed in the PEIS, sites having large volumes of CCR
that are considered for Closure-by-Removal would also result
in extensive trucking operations that would increase
transportation risks.

TVA considered worker safety in the evaluation of closure options
for the impoundments at CUF. Closure-in-Place minimizes
impacts associated with onsite worker safety by avoiding
excavations and public safety impacts related to the transport of
large volumes of CCR on public roadways.
Closure-by-Removal would also require a greater number of truck
movements into and out of the site which would increase the risk
of injuries and fatalities associated with truck crashes. If an onsite
landfill is used, the potential impacts to public safety are reduced.

Surface Water
Resources

Consistent with EPA’s determination in the CCR Rule and the
results of the EPRI model, TVA anticipates that either closure
method would have positive effects on surface water, if
conducted properly. However, the results of the EPRI model
indicated that for the configuration modeled, the Closure-byRemoval alternative would have a greater beneficial impact
on surface water.
Surface water impacts would be reduced under the Closurein-Place alternative when the hydraulic head is removed and
the facilities are capped. Removal of potential additional
hydraulic inputs from precipitation, surface water run off or
other water additions to the impoundment through the
capping process will effectively reduce and control and
minimize impacts to surface water resources.

Initial screening analysis by TVA determined either closure
method would not cause or contribute to violations of any
applicable state water quality standard, violate any applicable
toxic effluent standard or prohibition, or jeopardize the continued
existence of endangered or threatened species or critical
habitats.

CUF Characteristics

Groundwater
Resources

Both Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal reduce
groundwater contamination. While Closure-by-Removal
would reduce groundwater contamination more than Closurein-Place over the long term when CCR intersects
groundwater (is in the groundwater), Closure-in-Place still
reduces contamination in such situations.

No records of releases or issues of concern are known that
represent a risk to human health from CCR constituents
associated with the existing impoundments that are proposed for
closure in this EIS. TVA is working cooperatively with TDEC to
assess the groundwater conditions near the ash impoundments
at CUF. Information derived will be used to arrive at the certified
groundwater monitoring network, which was completed in
October 2017, and the upper-most aquifer determinations for all
CCR facilities are due by October 17, 2018.
In addition to any federal requirements that may apply to the
impoundments at CUF after closure is completed, TVA will
implement supplemental mitigative measures as required by the
TDEC Order, as well as its approved closure plan, which could
include additional monitoring, assessment or corrective action
programs. However, as noted in the PEIS, TVA expects any
groundwater impacts to be notably reduced following
impoundment closure.

Wetlands

Analyses presented in the PEIS determined that for both
Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal alternatives,
proposed actions would not cause or contribute to significant
degradation of wetlands because laydown areas were
minimized and wetlands are generally lacking from ash
impoundments. Additionally, appropriate measures could be
taken to avoid and minimize or compensate for impacts to
wetlands and ensure no net loss of wetlands.

No jurisdictional wetlands are in the footprints of the ash
impoundments at CUF or any associated laydown areas.

Risk to Other
Adjacent
Environmental
Resources

The analyses performed as part of the PEIS determined that
risk of potential release and degradation of environmental
resources (cultural resources, ecological receptors, and
factors related to the human environment) was generally low
for both Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal
alternatives. However, potential air and noise emissions were
expected to be markedly greater for the Closure-by-Removal
alternative due to offsite transport and trucking operations.

Potential areas of disturbance associated with impoundment
closure at CUF would be largely confined to previously disturbed
lands. Additionally, no adjacent sensitive receptors are located
proximate to ash impoundments at CUF.

yd3,

For those sites with CCR volumes exceeding 600,000
TVA determined that insufficient time is available within the
construction schedule to effectively remove the CCR
materials by truck or rail and achieve closure of
impoundments within the 5-year period for closure.

Volume of CCR to be removed from the ash impoundments at
CUF ranges from 334,000 yd3 at the Bottom Ash Impoundment to
1.28 million yd3 at the Main Ash Impoundment/Stilling
Impoundment.
Based upon analyses of the PEIS and the total volume of CCR,
Closure-in-Place of both ash impoundments at CUF could be
accomplished within 5 years.
Closure-by-Removal to an existing onsite landfill could also
be accomplished within 5 years for the Main Ash
Impoundment/Stilling Impoundment and the Bottom Ash
Impoundment. For these impoundments, CCR transport would
remain onsite which results in a shortened haul distance, allows
the use of larger trucks, and provides TVA the ability to work
longer periods to transport CCR to the onsite landfill. However,
the closure period for the Bottom Ash Impoundment would be
extended due to the need to construct a 40-foot retaining wall
along the perimeter of the impoundment prior to excavation.
Closure-by-Removal to an offsite permitted landfill would
require up to 8.4 years for the Main Ash Impoundment/Stilling
Impoundment and up to 3.8 years for the Bottom Ash
Impoundment.

Excessive Cost

Excessive closure costs may affect the reasonableness of an
alternative. Costs for Closure-by-Removal by truck were
demonstrated to be 168 to 2,390 percent greater than
Closure-in-Place at the sites evaluated in the PEIS.

Estimated closure costs for Closure-in-Place of the
impoundments at CUF:
Main Ash Impoundment/Stilling Impoundment = $33,960,000
Bottom Ash Impoundment = $4,368,000
Estimated closure costs for Closure-by-Removal of the
impoundments at CUF (storage of existing CCR in onsite
landfill):
Main Ash Impoundment/Stilling Impoundment = $42,308,000
Bottom Ash Impoundment = $44,137,000 (Note: includes
construction of a 40-foot retaining wall to provide lateral
stability to the Fly Ash and Gypsum Stacks)
Estimated closure costs for Closure-by-Removal of the
impoundments at CUF (storage of existing CCR in offsite
landfill):
Main Ash Impoundment = $282,480,000
Bottom Ash Impoundment = $114,571,200 (Note: includes
construction of a 40-foot retaining wall to provide lateral
stability to the Fly Ash and Gypsum stacks)
Costs of Closure-by-Removal (storage of existing CCR in
onsite landfill) are estimated to range from 18 percent to over
900 percent higher than the cost of Closure-in-Place.
Costs of Closure-by-Removal (storage in offsite landfill) are
estimated to range from 693 percent to over 2,500 percent higher
than the cost of Closure-in-Place.

2.2.2.3 Deviations from the PEIS
As illustrated in Table 2-3, the volume of CCR in the Main Ash Impoundment exceeds a
threshold condition established in the PEIS to determine if it would be reasonable to
consider Closure-by-Removal of an ash impoundment (i.e., greater than 600,000 yd3).
However, the evaluation of impacts related to Closure-by-Removal in the PEIS were related
to transport of CCR to an offsite permitted landfill. TVA determined that loading operations
are highly dependent on the rate at which CCR can be safely excavated, dried and moved
to truck loading facilities. TVA considered these factors and determined the rate of truck
loading to be 100 truckloads per day. This would result in approximately 200 truck trips per
day along the haul route over a typical nine-hour workday throughout the estimated closure
period. At CUF, TVA is also evaluating Closure-by-Removal with the option to transport
CCR from the impoundments to the existing onsite permitted landfill. This facility is located
proximate to the impoundments and transport of CCR excavated from the impoundments
would remain onsite. This results in shortened haul distance, allows the use of larger trucks,
and provides TVA the ability to accommodate two 9-hour shifts per workday throughout the
closure period. Therefore, the parameters established in the PEIS related to trucking and
duration of closure, which assumed an offsite landfill at a greater distance from the
impoundment, are not applicable to the evaluation of this closure option at CUF.
Specifically, at CUF, TVA is able to use larger, 40 ton trucks as public roads would not be
utilized. In addition, TVA considered the safety and stability of the onsite landfill and the
shortened haul distance, and estimated that TVA could transport CCR from the
impoundments to the onsite facilities at a rate of 200 trucks per day over two working shifts
per day. This results in a decreased duration of closure.
Primary actions common to all impoundment closures under Closure-in-Place and Closureby-Removal were identified in the PEIS. Table 2-3 summarizes these actions and
demonstrates the consistency and applicability of the closure alternatives for the
impoundments at CUF with the constraints of the analyses performed as part of the PEIS.
As such, because the characteristics and proposed actions associated with the closure of
ash impoundments at CUF are sufficiently bounded by the conditions and environmental
effects described in the PEIS, closure of impoundments at CUF can tier off the analysis in
the PEIS. The impact of the decreased duration of closure is evaluated in the analysis of
resources which could potentially be impacted due to this change, specifically, air quality,
transportation, noise, solid waste and socioeconomic impacts.

acceptable factors of safety using
conservative assumptions. The
proposed closure grades of the
facilities will be evaluated prior to
construction, and any needed

TVA has evaluated the structural

system placement to support
cover system installation.
As noted in the PEIS, TVA would

2.2.2.4 Proposed Ash Impoundment Closures at CUF
The Main Ash Impoundment encompasses approximately 50 acres and lies west of the
powerhouse and north of the Fly Ash Stack (see Figure 2-2). The Main Ash Impoundment
was originally part of the larger ash disposal area constructed in 1969. In 1979, the Bottom
Ash Impoundment was separated from the larger disposal area by a divider dike. Over time,
the divider dike has been lengthened and increased in height to its present configuration
(elevation is 395 feet above mean sea level [msl]). The Main Ash Impoundment receives
runoff from the Fly Ash Stack and the Gypsum Stack via perimeter ditches as well as
effluent from the Bottom Ash Impoundment. The storm water, process water and effluent all
flow northwest within the Main Ash Impoundment and then under a floating skimmer to an
area where further stilling occurs (Stilling Impoundment). Finally, the decanted water
discharges through four spillways into a concrete discharge channel that leads to the main
plant discharge channel and then to the Cumberland River/Lake Barkley. The Main Ash
Impoundment (including the upstream Bottom Ash Impoundment) is currently operating
under NPDES Permit No. TN0005789 (Stantec 2016).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

25

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

The Bottom Ash Impoundment is approximately 7.0 acres and is located south of the CUF
power plant (see Figure 2-1). It currently receives sluiced bottom ash from the plant. The
settled bottom ash is dredged, removed from the impoundment, and transported and stored
in the Fly Ash Stack. The process water exits the Bottom Ash Impoundment through two
54-inch outflow pipes. The outflow pipes are located near the northern end of the
impoundment and flow into the North Ditch and then to the Main Ash Impoundment.
Gypsum fines are also sluiced to the Bottom Ash Impoundment where they settle and are
dredged, loaded and hauled to the Gypsum Stack. When the Bottom Ash Impoundment is
closed, gypsum fines would be handled in compliance with state and federal CCR
regulations and would be re-routed to the existing lined channels or a separate container
and would be excavated and deposited in the Gypsum Stack. Process discharge from the
lined channels or separate containers would be re-routed to the new lined Process Water
Basins.
The two impoundments are hydraulically connected by the North Ditch. Therefore, a joint
and sequenced closure of the impoundments is required. Ideally, the Main Ash
Impoundment would be closed prior to closure of the Bottom Ash Impoundment and North
Ditch. However, the sequence of construction has not been determined. Closure will be
sequenced properly such that CCR materials and contact water are no longer directed to
the impoundments.
Construction activities associated with closure of the impoundments would entail direct
disturbance of the approximately 50-acre Main Ash Impoundment (including the Stilling
Impoundment), the 7-acre Bottom Ash Impoundment, and the North Ditch (approximately
0.8 acre). Approximately 128 acres of laydown area including the Fly Ash Stack and
portions of the Gypsum Stack would be used as areas to temporarily provide vehicle and
equipment parking, material storage, and construction administration needed to close
impoundments.
Upon closure of the impoundments, process wastewater and storm water would be
rerouted to the proposed new Process Water Basins. TVA considered four alternate options
on CUF property for development to these facilities. A summary of attributes and issues at
each alternative location are provided below.
1. Alternative 1 – An approximately 20.5-acre site located east of the plant
• Site is not currently used for plant operations.
• This area would require extensive pumping and pipe routing to convey
process water flows to the basins.
• Pumping would be required to convey stormwater runoff from the facilities
located on the west side of the plant.
• Less than 25 acres is available at this site.
2. Alternative 2 – An approximately 14.5-acre site located north and east of the Main
Ash Impoundment
• Site is currently utilized and planned for contractor office trailer area, staging,
and parking for multiple upcoming construction projects.
• Site is proximate to the existing impoundments and would require less
routing of storm water and process water flows.

26

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 2 - Alternatives

• Located near the Cumberland River, eliminating extensive piping to the new
outfall location.
• Requires the least amount of earthwork for construction.
• May require significant reconfiguration of the West Entrance Road.
• Requires a new NPDES outfall to the Cumberland River.
• Less than 25 acres is available at this site.
3. Alternative 3 – A greenfield site located on the west side of Wells Creek
• Area is heavily wooded with an elevation range of 140 feet and would
require extensive clearing, grubbing and grading operations.
• Development of the site would result in environmental impacts to land cover,
wildlife and other environmental resources.
• Both process water and storm water flow would need to be conveyed across
Wells Creek.
• 25 acres is available for development of the Process Water Basins.
4. Alternative 4 –The Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment
• Site is an existing asset that would no longer be needed to process wet CCR
as CUF transitions to dry CCR handling.
• Previously disturbed site.
• Meets minimum size requirements.
• Previous use included control of storm water and process water.
Each of these alternative locations were evaluated. Alternatives one through three were
eliminated from further consideration based on factors related to minimization of
environmental impact, engineering feasibility and constructability.
TVA’s preferred location for Process Water Basin 1 and Process Water Basin 2 is
Alternative 4. This option, which includes repurposing the Stilling Impoundment and a
portion of the Main Ash Impoundment would maximize the use of previously constructed
assets and minimize environmental impact as the basins would be constructed in a
disturbed area that previously controlled storm water and process water.
Specific activities associated with each closure option, Closure-in-Place or Closure-byRemoval including the proposed construction of Process Water Basin 1 and Process Water
Basin 2, for the impoundments at CUF are described below.
2.2.2.4.1

Closure-in-Place – Category A Regrade Inward

Bottom Ash Impoundment
Closure-in-Place involves stabilizing the CCR in place and installing an approved cover
system. The closure option identified for the Bottom Ash Impoundment is like the criteria
identified in the PEIS for Closure-in-Place Category A: Regrade Inward. Under this
alternative, the impoundment would be dewatered and the resulting CCR material would be
stabilized in place. Following stabilization, the CCR would be regraded to promote drainage
followed by installation of an approved cover system encompassing the CCR material

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

footprints (conceptual closure plans are provided in Appendix B). The cover system would
consist of geosynthetics – soil matrix including:
•

40-millimeter geomembrane

•

Double-sided geocomposite drainage layer with nonwoven, needle-punched
geotextile

•

18-inch protective cover soil

•

6-inch vegetative cover (topsoil or sod)

Storm water drainage from the Bottom Ash Impoundment would be directed to the North
Ditch, and new pipes would be installed to convey drainage in the ditch beneath the
existing access road to the north.
Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment
Even under the Closure-in-Place option, closure of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling
Impoundment would involve a combination of closure options. Closure-in-Place would be
used for the majority of the Main Ash Impoundment by consolidation and regrading of CCR
coupled with the installation of an approved cover system as described above. A portion of
the Main Ash Impoundment and the Stilling Impoundment, however, would be Closed-byRemoval and would be repurposed as lined Process Water Basin 1 and Process Water
Basin 2. To facilitate construction of the lined process water basins, CCR from these areas,
plus a foot of underlying soil would be removed and transported to an approved onsite
landfill (existing Fly Ash stack) or offsite disposal facility. Specifically, (approximately
180,000 yd3 of CCR material would be removed from the Stilling Impoundment and
approximately 245,700 yd3 of CCR material would be removed from the Main Ash
Impoundment. A geosynthetic clay liner would be installed over these areas followed by a
non-woven geotextile cushion, and 18 inches of protective cover.
The CCR remaining in the Main Ash Impoundment would be regraded and compacted to
support the final cover system. The final cover system described above would be installed
in the portion of the Main Ash Impoundment that would be Closed-in-Place. The Western
Perimeter Dike would be lowered to elevation 379 feet, and the material would be used as
part of the protective cover in the final cover system. The divider dike between the Main
Ash Impoundment and the Fly Ash Stack would remain and would be closed with the
geomembrane cap system. New storm water outfalls would be constructed to direct storm
water runoff from the closed impoundments either west to Wells Creek or east to the
existing discharge channel. The North Ditch would be closed by excavating any material in
the ditch and covering with the geomembrane cap system described above.
2.2.2.4.2 Closure-by-Removal – Transport to Existing Onsite Landfill
Closure-by-Removal involves excavation and relocation of the CCR from the impoundments in accordance with federal and state requirements to an approved onsite or offsite
disposal facility. Under this alternative TVA would dewater and stabilize residual ponded
areas followed by removal of CCR material, underlying soil, and support structures within
the impoundment footprint.
The dike material would be stockpiled onsite once segregated properly. The divider dike
between the Main Ash Impoundment and Fly Ash Stack will remain in place and would be

28

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 2 - Alternatives

closed with a geomembrane cover system. A portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and the
Stilling Impoundment would be repurposed as Process Water Basins as described above.
Closure-by-Removal of the Bottom Ash Impoundment also entails dewatering and
stabilizing residual ponded areas followed by removal of CCR material, underlying soil, and
support structures within the impoundment footprint. However, in contrast, the resulting
excavation would be approximately 40 feet in depth and would result in a loss of support for
the adjacent Fly Ash Stack and Gypsum Disposal Complex. This loss of support will
adversely affect slope stability of the adjacent facilities. As a result, prior to excavation of
CCR, a retaining wall would need to be constructed along the perimeter of the
impoundment to support the approximate 40-foot excavation and provide support for the
adjacent facilities.
Closure-by-removal may also include groundwater remediation, but the necessity and
extent of such remediation will not be known until excavation is underway.
Once CCR and affected soil is removed, the cleared areas would be backfilled as
necessary to promote drainage and then vegetated with native non-invasive plant species
to avoid the introduction or spread of invasive species. The CCR material from the
impoundments would be hauled and placed in an existing onsite landfill (the Fly Ash Stack)
which is permitted to receive this material.
2.2.2.4.3

Closure-by-Removal – Transport to Offsite Permitted Landfill

Under this Closure-by-Removal alternative, activities would be the same as described
above except excavated CCR would be transported and stored in an offsite permitted
landfill. The offsite landfill would be previously permitted to receive CCR and would have
sufficient capacity. The analysis of impacts uniquely associated with this alternative are
based on the transport of CCR to the closest landfill that can currently accept CCR material,
the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill (see Section 2.2.3 below).
2.2.3 Long-Term Storage of Future Dry CCR Produced at CUF
CCR, including fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum, are currently stacked in separate facilities
at CUF. Based on estimates of future energy production and consumption rates, and
beneficial reuse of gypsum and fly ash, TVA estimates that minimum capacity of approximately 13.4 million yd3 is needed to support long-term operations at CUF. TVA considered
options for suitable sites for management of future dry CCR produced at CUF including
construction of a landfill within the vicinity of CUF (offsite), construction of a landfill on CUF
property (onsite landfill) and the transport of CCR at CUF to an existing offsite landfill.
2.2.3.1 Construction of a Landfill Within the Vicinity of CUF
TVA previously conducted a regional landfill siting study (TVA 2010a) that considered
options for development of new landfills for disposal of CCR from 11 TVA facilities,
including CUF. The study considered potential landfill sites in a broad area that included
Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. Subsequent facility planning
considerations led to the examination of potential landfill options that would consist of a
smaller landfill that would serve the site-specific needs of CUF. Options more distant from
CUF were not acceptable due to considerations related to property access, unwilling
landowners, higher transportation costs, and potential impacts associated with
long-distance CCR transport (e.g., air, noise).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

29

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

A subsequent draft landfill siting study report (TVA 2010b) was prepared for CUF which
narrowed the focus of a potential new landfill site from a regional approach to locations in
the vicinity of CUF. Five sites were evaluated, and TVA selected two to be carried forward
for further analysis. These two sites were immediately southwest of CUF with one being
immediately adjacent to CUF in Stewart County, and the other being a bit further south in
Houston County. The other three sites were eliminated primarily because of their greater
distance from CUF, which posed problems for getting access to the properties. Additionally,
some land owners were not willing to sell these properties.
In July 2011, TVA conducted an additional landfill siting study (TVA 2011a), which more
narrowly focused on the two sites recommended in the 2010 study. As mentioned above,
one site was immediately adjacent to and southwest of CUF (identified as Site 8) and the
other was a little further southwest (identified as Site 9). The closer of the sites, Site 8, was
determined to be the best suited site for a new landfill facility because: (1) it is closer to
CUF than Site 9; (2) it is easier to design than Site 9, which requires relocation of a public
road; (3) it affects less property owners than Site 9; and (4) it has a lower total cost.
TVA has accepted the results in the previous siting studies and has eliminated the construction of new landfill within the region and the proposed Site 9 from further consideration.
2.2.3.2 New Onsite Landfill
In June 2015, TVA conducted a landfill siting study (TVA 2015) that narrowed the focus of
the July 2011 study to more specific locations within Site 8. The 2015 landfill siting study
identified five onsite alternatives and selected a landfill site in a topographic valley between
the ridges located on the western portion of the CUF property just south and west of Old
Scott Road. This site was selected because: (1) it has less than the average amount of
stream impacts; (2) it is generally isolated from the public eye, which is desired by local
residents; (3) it avoids floodplain impacts; (4) it can be accessed without leaving TVA
property (access from CUF requires only one crossing of a public road – Old Scott Road);
and (5) it facilitates mitigation of the Brunsoni Furnace site, which is an archaeological site
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
In development of the proposed landfill project site, TVA optimized its location by
considering the following:

30

•

Impacts to Wetlands – The proposed layout and design of the landfill avoids all
wetlands associated with the floodplains of Wells Creek and Scott Branch. Potential
options for onsite development that consist of a “lateral fill” type design east of the
proposed location would result in additional impacts to wetlands.

•

Visual and Emissions-Related Effects to Residential Communities – Selection of an
onsite location for landfill development avoids potential impacts associated with high
frequency offsite truck traffic and its associated emissions. Development of the
landfill using a valley-fill design minimizes visual effects.

•

Regulatory Floodplains – Floodplains mapped by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) are located east of the proposed landfill area and as
such, landfill development would result in no significant impacts to floodplains.

•

Sensitive Species – Biological surveys conducted within TVA properties have
identified potential use of the proposed landfill area by sensitive bat species.
However, in development of the landfill site, TVA would commit to seasonal

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 2 - Alternatives

restrictions regarding removal of trees that may be suitable for summer roosting bat
habitat such that impacts to sensitive species would not be anticipated.
•

Cultural Resources – Several cultural resource sites are known to exist on the CUF
property. A house that is listed on the NRHP is located along Old Scott Road east of
the proposed landfill site; if the landfill is developed, it will avoid this site. One site
characterized as being the site of a former Brunsoni Furnace is located with the
“limits of disturbance” of the proposed landfill. To address this issue, TVA initiated
consultation with the Tennessee State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) for
approval of the research design and the development of a Memorandum of
Agreement regarding mitigation activities (Appendix D). Response from the
Tennessee SHPO is pending.

•

Impacts to County Road – Potential options for onsite development that consist of a
“lateral fill” type design east of the proposed location would interfere with borrow site
operation and potentially result in closure and relocation of Old Scott Road to the
east of its present location. Relocation of this road would result in further potential
impacts to floodplains, wetlands and intermittent streams. Therefore, the
development of the “lateral fill” type design east of the proposed location was not
considered further.

•

Cost – Selection and development of an onsite disposal facility is a low-cost option
that contributes to TVA’s commitment to provide cost-effective power to users in its
service area.

In consideration of the above factors, TVA proposes to construct and operate a landfill for
disposal of future dry CCR generated at the plant within the boundaries of TVA owned
property on CUF (onsite). This site is located approximately 1.2 miles southwest of the plant
site on CUF property. The selected site encompasses approximately 174 acres with a
landfill footprint of approximately 80 acres. The landfill would be built in four major stages
with a total estimated capacity of 14.1 million yd3. Based on current estimates of energy
production and consumption rates, the landfill would provide approximately 19 years of
storage capacity. The estimated capacity provides adequate CCR storage for long-range
planning purposes.
The proposed landfill project area includes a leachate impoundment located to the north of
the proposed limit of waste and three storm water basins located to the north, the west and
the south of the limit of waste. Conceptual design drawings of the landfill are included in
Appendix B. Features of the proposed landfill are shown on Figure 2-4.
Excess soil material excavated during construction of the landfill would be stockpiled in a
designated borrow/stockpile area located within the landfill project area. Stockpiled soil
would be used as needed for interim cover and the final cover system. In addition, any
excess soil may be used, if needed, to support other routine maintenance and/or
construction operations at CUF. Soil material transported to CUF would utilize the existing
onsite access route.

Proposed Onsite Dry CCR Landfill at Cumberland Fossil Plant

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 2 - Alternatives

The proposed landfill would be developed to meet the TDEC Solid Waste Rules and the
federal CCR Rule requirements for new landfills. This would include the following
components:
1. Composite Liner System. The proposed composite liner system would include at a
minimum, the following components (or equivalent):
• A geologic buffer consisting of a minimum of 5 to 10 feet of soil with a maximum
hydraulic conductivity per regulatory requirements. The geologic buffer is
measured from the bottom of the liner to the seasonal highwater table of the
uppermost unconfined aquifer or the top of the formation of the confined aquifer.
•

Either a soil liner, a geosynthetic clay liner or a combination of both; a
60-millimeter high density polyethylene flexible membrane liner; and a
cushioning geotextile.

•

A 12-inch drainage layer and minimum 12 inches of protective cover between
the drainage layer and CCR.

2. Leachate Collection and Treatment System.
• A leachate collection system designed to facilitate the free drainage of leachate
would be a component of the liner. Leachate collected would be handled
separately from surface runoff. The leachate would be discharged to a leachate
pond and then would either be gravity fed via a pipe to Wells Creek (Option 1) or
would be pumped to the proposed Process Water Basin to be constructed at the
Main Ash Impoundment closure site or directly discharged to the CCW channel
(Option 2).
•

The leachate collection system is designed to remove leachate from the landfill
during its active life and the post-closure period.

3. Storm Water Management.
• New perimeter drainage ditches would be constructed to convey storm water
runoff from the new landfill area to one of three proposed storm water basins.
•

Storm water basins are designed with sufficient volume to detain runoff from the
24-hour, 25-year storm event and would discharge via new Tennessee multisector permitted storm water outfalls to Scott Branch, a tributary of Wells Creek
and Wells Creek to the north, west and south of the proposed CCR landfill site.
Drainage structures including ditches, benches, and culverts would be designed
using standards outlined in the TDEC Solid Waste Rules and the Final CCR
Rule.

4. Final Cover System. The proposed final cover design would be developed in
accordance with TDEC Solid Waste Management Rules and the Final CCR Rule,
and is anticipated to consist of the following components:
• Twelve inches of intermediate cover soil (maximum hydraulic conductivity of
1x10-5 cm/sec) over compacted CCR subgrade layer.
•

Forty-millimeter linear low density polyethylene flexible membrane liner.

•

Geocomposite drainage layer.

•

Twelve inches of cap cover soil (protective soil layer).

•

Vegetative cover (with a 12-inch layer of topsoil).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

5. Set-backs. The Tennessee Division of Waste Management requires that landfills be
located, designed, constructed, operated, and maintained such that the fill areas
meet the following minimum set-backs:
• Two hundred (200) feet from normal boundaries of springs, streams and lakes
(except that this standard shall not apply to any wet weather conveyance nor to
bodies of water constructed and designed to be part of the facility.
•

Five hundred (500) feet from wells downgradient and used as a source of
drinking water by humans or livestock.

•

One hundred (100) feet from all property lines.

•

Five hundred (500) feet of a residence unless the owner of the residential
property agrees in writing to a shorter distance.

•

A total site buffer with no construction appurtenances within 50 feet of the
property.

The proposed landfill meets each of the above minimum setbacks. Borrow and cover
material would be obtained within the landfill limit of disturbance. However, if offsite borrow
material is needed, it would be hauled from one or more established commercial permitted
sites within 30 miles of CUF.
2.2.3.2.1 Access Road
A two-lane paved access road (40 feet wide) with paved shoulders would be constructed
onsite to transport CCR from the plant to the landfill. The approximately 0.6-mile haul road
would extend from Old Scott Road to the landfill. This road would tie into the existing
access road that extends from Old Scott Road to the CUF perimeter road (see Figure 2-4)
resulting in a total distance of roughly 1.2 miles. TVA would pave the existing access road
to support hauling of CCR to the landfill. Based on the current volume of CCR production
and the use of articulated dump trucks (capacity of 20 yd3), it is estimated that 141
truckloads per day (282 truck trips per day) would be needed to transport CCR to the onsite
landfill.
A summary of the primary characteristics of the proposed landfill during both construction
and operation is provided in Table 2-4.

2.2.3.3 Offsite Disposal of Future CCR in an Existing Permitted Landfill (Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill)
Under this alternative, CCR from CUF would be transported to an existing offsite landfill.
For the purposes of this EIS, the offsite landfill would have sufficient capacity and be
permitted to receive CCR or special waste. The analysis of impacts associated with this
alternative are based on the closest landfill with available capacity that can currently accept
CCR material, the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. This landfill is located
approximately 12 miles northeast of CUF in Montgomery County, Tennessee. The landfill is
owned and operated by the county and serves central Tennessee and could receive CCR if

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

TVA obtains a special waste approval from TDEC. Capacity at this landfill can be expanded
to accommodate TVA’s requirement for long-term storage of CCR generated at CUF. Under
this alternative, dry CCR generated at CUF would be transported to the landfill by over the
road dump trucks on existing roadways.
Based on the estimated volume of CCR production and the use of over the road dump
trucks (capacity of 15 yd3), approximately 187 truckloads per day (274 truck trips) would be
needed to transport CCR to the offsite landfill to accommodate long-term storage of CCR
produced at CUF (estimated to be the life of the onsite landfill or approximately 18.8 years
for analysis purposes). The haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
would be approximately 37 miles long and primarily would utilize the following public roads:
State Route (SR) 233, SR 49, and US 79 (Figure 2-5).

Number of truckloads
needed to haul future CCR
from CUF to Bi-County

Based on the estimated volume of
CCR production and the use of over
the road dump trucks 187 truckloads
per day would be needed to transport
CCR generated at CUF offsite.
Equates to a traffic count of 374 truck
trips per work day or approximately
42 trucks per hour for approximately
18.8 years.

Over the Road Dump
Truck Traffic Volume
(existing wet CCR)

Number of truckloads
needed to haul existing
CCR from the
impoundments under the
Closure-by-Removal option
to Bi-County Solid Waste
Management.

Per the PEIS, TVA determined the rate
wet CCR can be safely excavated, and
transported offsite to be 100 truckloads
per day. Equates to a traffic count of
200 truck trips per work day or
approximately 23 trucks per hour
during the closure period (total of
approximately 12 years).

2.2.4

Modes of Material Transport Considered but Eliminated from Further
Consideration

Potential modes of transport of CCR (both current CCR and future CCR) can include truck,
rail and barge. An analysis of barge and rail transport is presented in the PEIS and
conclusions from that analysis apply to conditions at CUF. Site-specific considerations for
transportation alternatives are presented here.
Although CUF has both rail and barge facilities, these facilities are not configured and
designed to support loading and transport of CCR offsite. Further, barge and rail unloading
facilities are not typical near permitted landfills and are not available at the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill. As such, any CCR theoretically hauled by barge or rail for
landfill disposal would still entail trucking. Development of barge and rail unloading facilities

would also result in additional environmental impacts (land use, wetlands, water resources,
etc.) and would require additional environmental permitting. These impacts, together with
the need to include trucking to the landfill site, eliminates any advantage gained.
Accordingly, these forms of transport are not considered reasonable modes of
transportation for offsite transport of CCR at CUF.

2.3

Alternatives Retained for Detailed Analysis

Based on the extensive analysis of options to manage CCR produced at CUF, TVA
retained the following alternatives for detailed evaluation in this EIS:
•

Alternative A – No Action

•

Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF

•

Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF

•

Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF

2.3.1 Alternative A – The No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would not construct the proposed Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, and the bottom ash sluice would continue to be handled as described
in current operations. TVA would not close the ash impoundments. Accordingly, TVA would
not seek additional disposal options for dry placement of CCR generated at CUF. Rather,
CCR would continue to be managed in the current impoundments and onsite stacks for as
long as storage capacity is available. The No Action Alternative is not consistent with other
actions that TVA could be required to take in response to regulatory programs in addition to
the CCR Rule including the TDEC Order. As such, the No Action Alternative would not
support TVA’s goal of eliminating wet CCR storage at CUF or TVA’s compliance with
present and future regulatory requirements related to CCR production and management.
Nor would it support TVA’s plan to continue to operate CUF in the future in accordance with
the 2015 TVA Integrated Resource Plan. Consequently, this alternative would not satisfy
the project purpose and need and, therefore, is not considered viable or reasonable. It
does, however, provide a benchmark for comparing the environmental impacts of
implementation of Alternatives B, C, and D.

Main Ash Impoundment and the Stilling Impoundment would be repurposed for
use as Process Water Basins (identified as Process Water Basin 1 and Process
Water Basin 2 respectively). This would require removal of CCR and underlying
soil within the Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment.
CCR from these areas would be transported to the existing onsite landfill (Fly
Ash Stack) or offsite disposal facility, or
b. Closure-by-Removal of the Bottom Ash Impoundment, Main Ash Impoundment

removed from the impoundments would be transported and managed in an
existing offsite permitted landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill).
Following removal of CCR, a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and the
Stilling Impoundment would be repurposed for use as Process Water Basin 1
and Process Water Basin 2.

TVA’s Preferred Alternative

Activities associated with the construction and operation of the Bottom Ash Dewatering
Facility and Closure-in-Place of the impoundments would be the same for all of the
alternatives. Accordingly, impacts of these activities would be the same for all alternatives
and would be minor and primarily associated with construction activities (increased traffic,
noise, and air emissions). Closure-in-Place of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling
Impoundment would require the removal of CCR from the portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment that would be repurposed as Process Water
Basin 1 and Process Water Basin 2, respectively. TVA is considering two options for
disposal of this CCR from these areas, an existing onsite landfill or transport to an offsite
existing landfill. Impacts associated with transport of CCR to the onsite landfill would be
minor. Impacts associated with offsite transport of existing CCR to an offsite landfill would
also be minor, yet greater than those associated with the onsite landfill.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option for Alternative B, CCR removed from the
impoundments would be transported and managed in an offsite permitted landfill and under
the Closure-by-Removal option for Alternative C, CCR removed from the impoundments
would be transported and managed in an existing onsite landfill. A portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment and the Stilling Impoundment would be repurposed as Process Water
Basin 1 and Process Water Basin 2, respectively under both alternatives.
Impacts associated with construction of an onsite landfill for future CCR produced at CUF
would also be the same for Alternative B and Alternative C.
Under Alternative D, in contrast to Alternatives B and C, TVA would not construct an onsite
landfill for future CCR generated at CUF and future CCR would be transported to a
previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill) for
long-term storage.
All the action alternatives would meet the purpose and need of the project. In this Draft EIS,
TVA is identifying two preferred alternatives, Alternative B or C or a combination thereof.
Both alternatives would include the Construction and Operation of a Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, Closure of the Impoundments (either Closure-in-Place, Closure-byRemoval or a combination of the two closure methods), and Construction of an Onsite
Landfill for future CCR produced at CUF. In addition to general commentary on the other
actions studied in the draft EIS, TVA would appreciate receiving comments on which
closure methodology should be employed.
In addition to state and federal water and waste regulations, TVA’s CCR disposal areas at
CUF, including the impoundments, are subject to the administrative order entered by
TDEC. The execution of the requirements of the TDEC order will necessarily drive the
decision on closure methodology as well as further potential corrective measures related to
the ash disposal areas, including the impoundments.
Both Alternatives B and C would result in minor impacts to the natural environment primarily
from the construction of the onsite landfill, but these are not significant. In addition, these
alternatives include the construction of an onsite landfill which would avoid offsite transport
of future CCR. The air emissions, noise emissions, safety risks and disruptions to the
public that would be associated with the offsite transport of CCR along public roadways
would only apply to Alternative B.

Summary of Mitigation Measures and Best Management
Practices

TVA’s analysis of the proposed alternatives includes mitigation, as required, to reduce or
avoid adverse effects. Mitigation measures designed to avoid, minimize, or compensate for
adverse impacts associated with the management of CCR at CUF include:
•

A TDEC ARAP and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 404 permit will be
required for disturbance to wetlands and stream features, and the terms and
conditions of these permits would likely require mitigation for these proposed
activities.

•

TVA will implement supplemental groundwater mitigation measures that could
include monitoring, assessment, or corrective action programs as mandated by
state and federal requirements. The CCR Rule and state requirements provide an
additional layer of groundwater protection to minimize risk.

•

TVA will coordinate with the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Stewart
County transportation officials as needed to develop appropriate mitigation
measures to reduce localized temporary transportation effects.

•

Potential impacts to Wells Creek and/or Scott Branch from landfill leachate and
storm water discharges would be mitigated as required to meet permit requirements.

•

Forested land within the proposed landfill project area is of low summer roosting
quality for threatened and endangered bats, although it may be used as a foraging
area. Section 7 Consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is
underway. Impacts would be mitigated as required in accordance with the ESA
during Section 7 Consultation with USFWS.

In addition, TVA has identified the following best management practices (BMP) that will be
employed to minimize impacts. Any additional project-specific BMPs will be applied as
appropriate on a site-specific basis to enable efficient maintenance of construction projects
and further reduce potential impact on environmental resources including, air, surface water
and groundwater.
•

Fugitive dust emissions from site preparation and construction would be controlled
by wet suppression and BMPs (CAA Title V operating permit incorporates fugitive
dust management conditions).

•

Erosion and sedimentation control BMPs (e.g., silt fences) would ensure that
surface waters are protected from construction impacts.

•

Consistent with EO 13112 as amended by EO 13751, disturbed areas would be
revegetated with native or non-native, non-invasive plant species to avoid the
introduction or spread of invasive species.

•

BMPs as described in the project-specific SWPPP and Tennessee Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook (TDEC 2012) would be used during construction
activities to minimize impacts and restore areas disturbed during construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
3.1
3.1.1

Air Quality
Affected Environment

Regulatory Framework for Air Quality
Through passage of the CAA, Congress mandated the protection and enhancement of our
nation’s air quality resources. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the
following criteria pollutants have been set to protect the public health and welfare:
•

Sulfur dioxide (SO2)

•

Ozone

•

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)

•

Particulate matter with particle sizes are less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10)

•

Particulate matter with particle sizes are less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers
(PM2.5)

•

Carbon monoxide (CO)

•

Lead (Pb)

The primary NAAQS were promulgated to protect public health, and the secondary NAAQS
were promulgated to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse
effects associated with the presence of pollutants in the ambient air (EPA 2017b).
In accordance with the CAA Amendments of 1990, all counties are designated with respect
to compliance, or degree of noncompliance, with the NAAQS. These designations are
either attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable. An area with air quality better than the
NAAQS is designated as “attainment;” whereas an area with air quality worse than the
NAAQS is designated as “non-attainment.” Non-attainment areas are further classified as
extreme, severe, serious, moderate, and marginal. An area may be designated as
unclassifiable when there is a lack of data to form a basis of attainment status. New or
expanded emissions sources located in areas designated as nonattainment for a pollutant
are subject to more stringent air permitting requirements.
Stewart County and the surrounding counties (Benton, Christian, Calloway, Henry,
Houston, Montgomery, Trigg) are all in attainment with applicable NAAQS (EPA 2017c) and
Tennessee ambient air quality standards referenced in the Tennessee Air Pollution Control
Regulations Chapter 1200-3-3.
The proposed dewatering facility, landfill, and impoundment closure activities would be
subject to both federal and state (Tennessee Division of Air Pollution Control) regulations.
These regulations impose permitting requirements and specific standards for expected air
emissions.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

3.1.2

Environmental Consequences

3.1.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under this alternative, existing CCR management operations at CUF would continue.
Consequently, there would be no additional emissions related to project construction
activities or the transport of CCR materials to receiving landfills. Therefore, no impacts to air
quality are anticipated.
3.1.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.1.2.2.1

Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility

Construction Impacts
Under this alternative, transient air pollutant emissions would occur during construction of
the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. Construction-related air quality impacts would be
primarily related to operation of internal combustion engines and site preparation activities.
Combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels by internal combustion engines (vehicles,
generators, construction equipment, etc.) would generate local emissions of particulate
matter, NOx, CO, volatile organic compounds, and SO2 during the site preparation and
construction period. However, new emission control technologies and fuel mixtures have
significantly reduced vehicle and equipment emissions. Additionally, it is expected that all
vehicles would be properly maintained which would also reduce emissions. Therefore,
emissions from internal combustion engines would result in minor short-term local effects
on air quality due to the relatively low number of vehicles, adherence to equipment
maintenance requirements, and continued improvement of emission control measures and
fuel blends.
Site preparation and vehicular traffic over paved and unpaved roads at the construction
sites would result in the emission of fugitive dust during active construction periods. Based
on analyses presented for similar dewatering facilities proposed at Kingston (TVA 2016c)
and Bull Run (TVA 2012), it is expected that the largest fraction (greater than 95 percent by
weight) of fugitive dust emissions would be deposited within the construction site
boundaries. All TVA power plants have fugitive dust control plans as required under existing
Title V permits, and TVA requires all contractors to maintain construction equipment
properly and to use BMPs (such as covered loads and wet suppression) to minimize dust, if
necessary. Air quality impacts from construction activities would depend on both man-made
factors (intensity of activity, control measures, etc.) and natural factors such as wind speed
and direction, soil moisture and other factors. However, even under unusually adverse
conditions, these emissions would have, at most, a minor transient impact on offsite air
quality and would be well below the applicable ambient air quality standard.
Operation Impacts
Operation of the dewatering facility is subject to specific state air quality regulations and
fugitive dust regulations. The proposed dewatering facility would be operated in compliance
with state regulations.
Fugitive dust emission standards state that fugitive dust may not be emitted in quantities
that produce visible emissions beyond the property. Bottom ash would be conveyed from
the dewatering facility and stacked in a pile on a concrete pad and moistened with water as
necessary to control fugitive emissions (i.e., dust blown off the top of the pile). The ash
56

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

would be reclaimed from the storage pile and transported either to the onsite or offsite
landfill or offsite for storage and/or beneficial reuse.
Under current operations, fly ash is transported in dry form to the fly ash stack. Gypsum is
conveyed to an adjacent wall-board manufacturer or to lined channels (see Figure 1-1)
where it is dewatered, stockpiled for later use, or disposed in the Gypsum Stack. Fugitive
dust control BMPs would reduce potential impacts to air quality; the dewatering facility is
expected to comply with fugitive dust emission standards. Therefore, air quality impacts
associated with operation of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be minor and would
not exceed NAAQS.
3.1.2.2.2 Ash Impoundment Closure
Impoundment closure activities (either Closure-in-Place or Closure-by-Removal) involve
several activities that potentially would result in air emissions. These activities include
dewatering, grading and earth-moving operations, excavation and/or compaction of CCR,
and emissions from trucking. For the Closure-in-Place option, CCR within the Stilling
Impoundment (180,000 yd3) and a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment (approximately
245,400 yd3) would be removed to an approved existing onsite or offsite disposal facility.
Borrow material would be obtained onsite which minimizes emissions from the transport of
this material. However, if offsite borrow material is needed, it would be hauled from one or
more previously permitted sites within 30 miles of CUF.
Potential air quality impacts associated with activities under the Closure-in-Place option
include dust and emissions from equipment, earth-moving activities (dozing, grading, and
fill placement) and equipment movement on access roads on the site. The removal of CCR
from the Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the CCR from the Main Ash Impoundment
may result in additional onsite or offsite fugitive dust emissions or emissions from
equipment or vehicles. Any supplemental borrow material that is needed beyond the
capacity of the existing onsite borrow area would be provided by a contractor from an
existing offsite, previously permitted borrow site. Minor, localized emissions may also be
expected in conjunction with the procurement of supplemental borrow material from offsite
locations, if necessary.
As noted in the PEIS (TVA 2016b), the Closure-in-Place alternative would result in
temporary minor impacts from fugitive dust and emissions from equipment and vehicles
during construction and transport of borrow material. Relative to Closure-in-Place, Closureby-Removal would result in notably greater emissions from fugitive dust and emissions from
equipment and vehicles during construction and transport of borrow and CCR material. In
either case, air quality impacts are expected to be localized and short term, and would not
result in exceedances of NAAQS at CUF.
Regional impact on air quality would be negligible.
3.1.2.2.3

Landfill

Construction Impacts
Construction of the proposed landfill and its associated access road would require the use
of earthmoving, compacting and paving equipment as well as trucks for hauling materials.
All construction activities would be carried out onsite, and no offsite activities are
anticipated. These activities would generate fugitive dust during active construction periods
for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and impoundment closure.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

57

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Equipment potentially required for this alternative includes excavators, bulldozers, water
trucks, loaders, pickup trucks, and semi-trailers. All equipment would be used onsite, and
any air quality impacts would be limited to the immediate site area. Emissions associated
with the combustion of gas and diesel fuels would generate local emissions during the
construction period. Given the relatively low number of vehicles and equipment that would
be used for the initial construction activities, adherence to equipment maintenance
requirements, continued improvement of emission control measures and fuel blends, and
the intermittent nature of construction, emissions from construction equipment would be
minor and temporary in nature.
Operation Impacts
Operation of the proposed landfill would comply with Tennessee regulations for fugitive
emissions and CUF’s air operating permit conditions. CCR handling, transport and
placement activities would utilize methods similar to other TVA landfill operations. Moisture
conditioned CCR would be transported to the working face of the landfill using heavy-duty
dump trucks over paved access roads contained within the boundaries of the plant. Based
solely on the estimate of CCR produced daily and the safe capacity of an articulated dump
truck, TVA estimates that approximately 141 truckloads of conditioned CCR would be
transported to the proposed onsite landfill per day (282 trips). It is anticipated that all trucks
used to transport CCR would be maintained in good working condition with current
emission control technologies to minimize local air quality impacts.
Once placed within the landfill, the CCR material would be spread and compacted. The
compacted surface further limits fugitive dust. As each cell of the landfill reaches its
capacity, it would be covered with an approved cover system. Equipment used for
placement and compaction of CCR would be similar to what is currently in use at the
existing Gypsum Stack and Fly Ash Stack so there would be no substantive change in
emissions as compared to base conditions. Therefore, landfill operation air quality impacts
are anticipated to be minor, localized and long term and would not exceed NAAQS.
3.1.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, air quality impacts associated with implementation of the dewatering
facility and in-place closure of ash impoundments would be the same as identified under
Alternative B. Additionally, air quality impacts associated with the construction and
operation of the onsite CCR landfill would also be like those described for Alternative B.
For Alternative C, however, CCR removed from the impoundments under the Closure-byRemoval option would be transported to the existing onsite landfill for long-term storage.
TVA estimates that it could safely transport and deposit CCR on the existing landfill at a
rate of 200 truckloads of CCR per day, over two working shifts which equates to 400
truckloads of CCR per day (800 truck trips). The increased number of trucks that can be
used is a result of the shortened distance of transport to the existing landfill as well as the
ability to work two shifts as public roadways would not be used. Onsite air emissions
associated with excavation and transfer of CCR to the existing onsite landfill would be
increased during the closure period relative to Alternative B given additional trucks, but
offsite emissions would be notably reduced as existing ash would not be transported to an
offsite landfill for disposal. In either case, air quality impacts from emissions and fugitive
dust are expected to be localized and short term for bottom ash dewatering and ash

58

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

impoundment closures; minor, localized, and long term for landfill operations, but would not
result in exceedances of NAAQS at CUF.
3.1.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Air quality impacts under Alternative D are expected to the same as Alternatives B and C
for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, and the same as Alternative B for the ash
impoundment closure activities.
However, in contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of
future ash to a previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management
Landfill) for long-term storage.
Under this alternative, no construction-related activities would be required to develop a
landfill. Consequently, impacts from this alternative due to construction would be less than
those described for Alternatives B and C. In contrast, however, this alternative would
require the transport of future CCR daily to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
and would result in long-term emissions and fugitive dust associated with trucking
operations. Based solely on the estimate of CCR produced daily and the safe capacity of
over the road dump trucks, TVA estimates that approximately 187 truckloads of CCR per
day would be needed to transport CCR to the proposed offsite landfill. That would result in
a traffic count of 374 trips per day between the dewatering site and the proposed offsite
landfill. In addition, the 200 vehicles per day that would occur daily for approximately
12 years under the ash impoundment Closure-by-Removal option would also utilize the
same haul route to the offsite landfill. It is anticipated that all trucks used to transport CCR
would be maintained in good working condition with current emission control technologies
to minimize local air quality impacts.
Overall, air quality impacts associated with Alternative D would not result in an exceedance
of NAAQS. However, emissions from the additional trucks needed to transport CCR from
CUF to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill are expected to result in long-term
local effects that would be minor, but greater than those evident under Alternatives B
and C.
3.1.3 Summary of Impacts to Air Quality
As summarized in Table 3-1, TVA has determined that all air quality impacts related to the
CCR management projects are minor and would not have an impact on NAAQS.

Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
Affected Environment

Regulatory Framework for Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
“Climate change” refers to any substantive change in measures of climate, such as
temperature, precipitation, or wind lasting for an extended period (decades or longer) (EPA
2016a). The 2014 National Climate Assessment concluded that global climate is projected
to continue to change over this century and beyond. The amount of warming projected
beyond the next few decades, by these studies, is directly linked to the cumulative global
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (e.g., carbon dioxide [CO2], methane). By the end
of this century, the 2014 National Climate Assessment concluded a 3 degrees Fahrenheit
(°F) to 5°F rise can be projected under the lower emissions scenario and a 5°F to 10°F rise
is projected for a higher emissions scenario (Melillo et al. 2014).
Climate change is primarily a function of too much CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 is the
primary GHG emitted through human activities. In 2014, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions
totaled 6.870 million metric tons (15.1 trillion pounds) of carbon dioxide equivalents. This
2014 total represents a 7percent increase since 1990 but a 7 percent decrease since 2005
(EPA 2016a). This carbon overload is caused mainly by activities that burn fossil fuels such
60

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

as coal, oil, and gas or by cutting down forests which releases stored carbon. As more of
these gases are added to the atmosphere, more heat is trapped. This extra heat leads to
higher air temperatures near the Earth’s surface, alters weather patterns, and raises the
temperature of the oceans (EPA 2016a).
TVA has adopted a climate adaptation plan that establishes adaptation planning goals and
describes the challenges and opportunities climate change may present to its mission and
operations. The goals of TVA’s adaptation planning process are to ensure that TVA
continues to achieve its mission and program goals and to operate in a secure, effective
and efficient manner in a changing climate.
TVA manages the effects of climate change on its mission, programs and operations within
its environmental management processes. TVA’s Environmental Policy includes the specific
objective of stopping the growth in volume of emissions and reducing the rate of carbon
emissions by 2020 by supporting a full slate of reliable, affordable, lower CO2 energy supply
opportunities and energy efficiency.
Activities associated with the CCR management projects at CUF that produce CO2 are
primarily related to emissions from fossil-fuel-powered equipment (e.g., bulldozers, loaders,
haulers, trucks, generators, etc.) used during construction, transport and long-term
management of CCR.
Forested areas that absorb and store CO2 from the atmosphere via a process known as
carbon sequestration help to reduce levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Approximately
234 acres of forested land are present within the proposed landfill limits of disturbance.
There is no forested land within the footprint of either the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility or
the impoundment areas.
3.2.2

Environmental Consequences

3.2.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under this alternative, there would be no change to CCR management operations at CUF.
Therefore, there would be no impact to GHGs and climate change.
3.2.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.2.2.2.1

Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility

Construction Impacts
GHG emissions, primarily CO2, would occur during construction of the dewatering facilities.
As discussed above, CO2 construction-related emissions would occur from internal
combustion engines during site preparation and facility construction. Due to the small
number of vehicles and construction equipment involved, only a minor temporary increase
in CO2 emissions would be anticipated because of the construction of the dewatering
facilities. Such emission levels are de minimis in comparison to the regional and world-wide
volumes of CO2. Therefore, local and regional GHG levels would not be adversely impacted
by CO2 emissions from construction activities.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

61

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Operation Impacts
Operations at the dewatering facility would require the use of electricity already being
produced by CUF. The energy required to operate the dewatering facility would not
perceptibly increase the amount of fossil fuel burned or CO2 emitted at CUF and, therefore,
is not anticipated to have local and regional GHG level impacts or impacts on climate
change.
3.2.2.2.2 Impoundment Closure
Construction-related CO2 emitting activities associated with the impoundment closures
would be similar to those described for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. The
impoundment closures, however, may generate slightly greater CO2 emissions due to the
large amounts of grading, transportation of borrow material, and installation of approved
closure liner systems. New emission control technologies and fuel mixtures have
significantly reduced vehicle and equipment emissions which would minimize the impact
associated with increased levels of construction equipment use. No carbon sequestration
would be lost as the impoundment areas have no forested areas that would be affected by
closure activities.
Although the Closure-by-Removal options would use more equipment for extended periods
of time because of excavation and transport of CCR material to a permitted offsite landfill,
associated impacts would be small and temporary. Therefore, no changes to climate or
significant increases in greenhouse gases are anticipated.
It is expected that CO2 emissions would have potential minor short-term local effects on
GHG levels but overall, regional impact on GHG levels and climate change would not be
impacted.
3.2.2.2.3

Landfill

Construction Impacts
Construction of the proposed landfill would require the use of earthmoving and compacting
equipment as well as trucks for hauling materials. All construction activities would be
carried out onsite, and no offsite activities are anticipated. Equipment expected to be
required for this alternative includes excavators (two), bulldozers (three), a water truck, a
loader, pickup trucks (five) and semi-trailers. These activities would generate CO2
emissions during active construction periods. As with the dewatering and impoundment
closure projects, due to the relatively low number of vehicles and construction equipment
involved, only minor CO2 emissions would be anticipated in comparison to the regional and
world-wide volumes of CO2 generated. Therefore, local and regional GHG levels would not
be adversely impacted by the project.
EPA’s quantification tool was used to estimate the carbon sequestration that may be lost
from the conversion of forested land (EPA 2017a). Assuming 173.2 acres of forested areas
(the land cover with the greatest potential carbon sink) are completely cleared from the
proposed landfill area limits of disturbance, and forest composition and age is typical for the
east Tennessee region, TVA estimates that the conversion of these forested lands would
result in the loss of approximately 148 metric tons of carbon sequestered in one year. The
loss of carbon sequestered or stored is very small relative to the carbon sequestered in
local and regional forested areas. Overall, carbon sequestration within forests in the region
has increased due to net increases in forest areas (e.g., conversion of farmland to forested
areas), improved forest management, as well as higher vegetation growth productivity rates
and longer growing seasons. Within the 5-mile radius of CUF, it is estimated that existing
62

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

forested lands sequester approximately 67,856 metric tons of carbon per year. By
comparison, therefore, the loss of 148 metric tons of carbon sequestration due to
construction phase clearing of forests at CUF is de minimis relative to the regional carbon
sequestration and would not adversely affect climate change.
Operation Impacts
CCR would be transported to the proposed landfill using dump trucks over access roads
within the boundaries of the plant. Based solely on the estimate of CCR produced daily and
the capacity of an articulated dump truck, approximately 141 truckloads of CCR would be
transported to the onsite landfill per day (282 trips). Due to the relatively low number of
trucks and minimal transport distance, the trucks would produce a minor, long term
increase in CO2 emissions but are not anticipated to increase regional GHG levels or
impact climate change.
Equipment that produces CO2 emissions (e.g., bulldozers) would be used to spread and
compact the CCR. The equipment used for landfill operations would be similar to what is
currently in use at the existing gypsum stack and, therefore, there would be no substantive
change in CO2 emissions as compared to base conditions.
3.2.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, climate change and GHG impacts associated with implementation of
the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and in-place closure of ash impoundments would be the
same as identified under Alternative B. Additionally, impacts associated with the
construction and operation of the onsite CCR landfill would also be similar to those
described for Alternative B.
For Alternative C, however, CCR removed from the impoundments under the Closure-byRemoval option would be transported to the onsite existing landfill for long-term storage.
Onsite GHG emissions associated with excavation and transfer of CCR to the landfill would
be somewhat larger than Alternative B, but offsite emissions would be notably reduced as
existing ash would not be transported to an offsite landfill for disposal.
In either case, GHG impacts from emissions are expected to be localized and short term for
the bottom ash dewatering and ash impoundment closures, localized and long term for
landfill operations, but would not result in regional impacts on climate.
3.2.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Climate change impacts under Alternative D are expected to be the same as Alternatives B
and C for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, and the same as Alternative B for the ash
impoundment closure activities.
However, in contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of
future ash to a previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management
Landfill) for long-term storage.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

63

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Under Alternative D, no construction related activities would be required to develop a
landfill. Consequently, there would be no impact to the amount of localized forest carbon
sequestration. Consequently, impacts from this alternative due to construction would be
less than those described for Alternatives B and C. This alternative would require the daily
transport of future CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill and would result
in long-term emissions of GHG associated with trucking operations. Based solely on the
estimate of CCR produced daily and the safe capacity of over the road dump trucks, TVA
estimates that approximately 187 truckloads per day would be needed to transport
conditioned CCR to the proposed offsite landfill. That would result in a traffic count of
374 trips per day between the dewatering and dry ash handling sites and the proposed
offsite landfill. It is anticipated that all trucks used to transport CCR would be maintained in
good working condition with current emission control technologies to minimize local air
quality impacts.
Overall, GHG emissions associated with Alternative D would be relatively minor and long
term, but not result in climate change or changes in regional GHG levels. These local
effects would be minor, but greater than those evident under Alternatives B and C.
3.2.3

Summary of Environmental Consequences on Climate Change and
Greenhouse Gases
Impacts to climate change associated with the implementation of each alternative are
summarized in Table 3-2. In summary, no impact to climate change is anticipated based on
the limited CO2 emissions generated from these CCR management projects in comparison
to the regional and world-wide volumes of CO2 generated.

Land Use

The CUF facility is located near Cumberland City, Stewart County, Tennessee, along the
southern bank of the Cumberland River. The plant property occupies approximately
2,400 acres of land that supports industrial development for the facility itself and supporting
infrastructure. Land use within the facility is dominated by various developed uses and
barren land (Figure 3-1). The areas associated with the dewatering facility and
impoundment closures are previously disturbed due to existing CUF plant development.
The proposed onsite landfill area is located within previously undeveloped land on CUF
property and is primarily deciduous forest (173.2 acres) with a very small amount of
wetlands (0.5 acre) (Table 3-3). More information about wetlands can be found in
Section 3.12.

Land Use/Land Cover Within the Vicinity of Cumberland Fossil Plant

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

As summarized in Table 3-3, land use within the 5-mile radius surrounding CUF is
dominated by undeveloped lands with various vegetative cover types, primarily deciduous
forest (61,203.2 acres), hay/pasture (6,612.2 acres), herbaceous/grassland (5,484.1 acres)
and cultivated crops (3,534.9 acres). Developed lands in the vicinity include both industrial
(CUF plant site) and non-industrial uses. Non-industrial developed lands consist of
developed lands associated with the rural Cumberland City to the east. The nearest
residence is located approximately 0.3 mile east of the CUF property in Cumberland City.
The facility is bordered to the north by Cumberland River, to the east by Cumberland City,
and to the west and south by undeveloped lands.
3.3.1

Environmental Consequences

3.3.1.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no change in the management of CCR
produced at CUF, and no work would be conducted that could result in a change in land
use. Therefore, no project-related environmental impacts with respect to land use would
occur under this alternative.
3.3.1.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be constructed on sites that are
already used for heavy industrial use. Accordingly, no changes in land use would occur with
this project.
Closure-in-Place of the impoundments would include the installation of a cover system
which would convert the existing industrial facilities largely devoid of vegetation to areas
with herbaceous terrestrial land cover. A portion of the Main Ash Impoundment/Stilling
Impoundment would be converted to Process Water Basins. However, these areas would
still be located within the TVA plant site and be used for industrial purposes; therefore,
closure would not result in the conversion of any land uses in the foreseeable future. Over a
longer period, it is possible that closed impoundments could be put to other uses. If such
uses are proposed, additional environmental reviews would be conducted.
Closure of the impoundments would incorporate some fill material that would be obtained
from a previously permitted onsite borrow area or offsite commercial borrow area. During
closure activities, TVA would use portions of existing developed areas for constructionrelated activities (i.e., vehicle and equipment parking, storage, and construction
administration). These activities would occur on land located within the plant boundary
which is dedicated to industrial use. Therefore, no changes in land use would occur with
this closure option.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, the existing CCR at CUF would be transported to an
existing offsite permitted landfill. Therefore, there would be no changes from the existing
environment within the landfill boundaries under this alternative. The haul route to the
offsite landfill would utilize previously constructed roads which are already subjected to
vehicular traffic and no new roads would need to be constructed. Therefore, there would be
no impact to land use under this closure option
The proposed onsite landfill would be constructed on a site that is currently in an
undeveloped state and covered with various vegetation cover types. Construction of the
proposed facility would result in the permanent conversion of approximately 174 acres of
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

67

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

land that is currently undeveloped to industrial facilities. Permanent industrial facilities
include the construction of the landfill, leachate ponds, storm water ponds and
conveyances, and access roads.
The conversion of undeveloped lands to industrial facilities is minor when compared to the
abundance of undeveloped land within a 5-mile radius of the site (see Table 3-3).
Therefore, impacts to land use from the construction and operation of the proposed onsite
landfill would be minor.
3.3.1.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility, in-place CCR impoundment closure, and onsite landfill
construction and operation would be the same as identified under Alternative B. However,
under Alternative C, CCR removed from the Main Ash Impoundment and the Bottom Ash
Impoundment under the Closure-by-Removal option would be transported to the existing
onsite landfill for long-term storage rather than being transported to an offsite landfill. These
areas are currently developed for industrial use, therefore there would be no change in
impacts to land use under this alternative.
3.3.1.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts to land use associated with construction and operation of the
Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be the same as Alternatives B and C, and would be
the same as Alternative B for CCR impoundment closure (both Closure-in-Place and
Closure-by-Removal options). However, under Alternative D, future CCR generated at CUF
would be transported to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill for long-term
disposal and there would be no direct impact to land use associated with landfill
construction and operation. Therefore, there would be no changes to land use under this
alternative
3.3.2 Summary of Impacts to Land Use
Impacts to land use associated with each of the proposed projects is summarized in

Prime Farmland

3.4.1 Affected Environment
The Farmland Protection Policy Act of 1981, 7 United States Code (USC) 4201, requires all
federal agencies to evaluate impacts to prime and unique farmland prior to permanently
converting to land use incompatible with agriculture. Prime farmland is land that has the
best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage,
fiber and oilseed crops. These characteristics allow prime farmland soils to produce the
highest yields with minimal expenditure of energy and economic resources. Prime farmland
includes land that possesses the above characteristics and may include land currently used
as cropland, pastureland, rangeland, or forestland.
Prime farmland soils within the project areas are shown on Table 3-5. Project areas
associated with the proposed dewatering facility and ash impoundment closure projects are
previously developed and no longer contain native soils. Therefore, there are no prime
farmland soils on these sites. Approximately 8 percent of the land within the proposed
landfill project site is prime farmland and consist of Humphreys gravelly silt loam and the
Lobelville silt loam.

Environmental Consequences

3.4.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no change in the management of CCR
produced at CUF. As a result, no ground disturbance activities would be conducted that
could potentially alter project-related environmental conditions within the project area.
Therefore, there would be no impacts to prime farmland resources with this alternative.
3.4.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, implementation of the proposed projects (including both options for
ash impoundment closure) would impact approximately 14 acres of prime farmland soils on
the proposed landfill site. TVA has initiated coordination with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA NRCS) through submittal of
the AD 1006 Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form. The NRCS uses a land evaluation
and site assessment (LESA) system to establish a farmland conversion impact rating score.
This score is used as an indicator to determine if adverse impacts to farmland exceed the
recommended allowable level. The higher the numerical score assigned, the more
protection the farmland would receive. Project sites receiving a total score of less than 160
need not be given further consideration for protection and no additional sites need to be
evaluated. The proposed landfill site received a score of 64.6. The completed AD 1006
Form is provided in Appendix D.
Approximately 18,599 acres (21.3 percent) of the area within 5 miles have soils classified
as prime farmland. The minor loss of onsite prime farmland soils due to the proposed
actions is not significant when compared to the amount of land designated as prime
farmland within the surrounding region. Therefore, impacts to prime farmland soils would be
minor under this alternative.
3.4.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts to prime farmland associated with construction and
operation of the proposed onsite landfill would be the same as identified under
Alternative B. Since there are no additional impacts associated with management of CCR in
the existing onsite landfill, there would be no change to the impact identified in
Alternative B.
3.4.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, any future CCR generated at CUF would be transported to the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. Therefore, there would be no impacts to the
14.2 acres of prime farmland soils from the construction and operation of the onsite landfill.
Consequently, implementation of Alternative D would not impact prime farmland soils.

Geology
Affected Environment

3.5.1.1 Site Geology
CUF is in the Highland Rim Physiographic Province (Figure 3-2) which is underlain by a
sequence of sedimentary bedrock that extends from Mississippi and Northern Alabama
through Tennessee, northward into Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. The formations that
underlie this province consist of dolostone, limestone, shale, and sandstone. The bedrock
strata have been subjected to an extended period of erosion which has produced a series
of moderate to steeply sloping hills and broad valleys. The province is relatively flat or
rolling upland into which a complex drainage pattern has been incised. In general, the
elevation of this upland surface ranges from 700 feet to 800 feet msl in the south, and
lowers northward to 600 to 700 feet msl. The Cumberland River enters the Wells Creek
area on the east and at an elevation of about 360 feet and leaves its western edge at an
elevation of about 340 feet. The Cumberland River has subsequently deposited a blanket of
alluvium at lower elevations over the bedrock (State of Tennessee 1968).

Physiographic Sections of the TVA Region
(Adapted from Fenneman 1938)

The area around CUF is in a distinctive geologic setting that is characterized as an ancient
meteor impact crater. This feature is known as the Wells Creek Impact Structure
(Figure 3-3) which is approximately 2 miles in diameter and is generally concentric in form
as evidenced in published geologic maps (Law Engineering 1992). The floor of the basin
ranges from 360 to 450 feet in elevation. Central Hill is located near the center of the basin
which rises to about 450 feet. Surrounding Central Hill is the belt of prominent inner annular
valleys, which ranges in elevation from 360 to 380 feet. This feature is surrounded, in turn,
by a broken ring of annular ridges, an incomplete belt of outer annular valleys, and an outer
belt of annular ridges 500 to 600 feet in elevation (State of Tennessee 1968).
The apparent meteor impact caused some of the older rock formations to be uplifted close
to ground surface. Most of the rock formations in this area are of the Mississippian System
which includes the Fort Payne, Warsaw, and St. Louis formations. These formations consist
mostly of carbonate rock. Older formations such as the Nashville Group which consists of
the Hermitage Formation and the Knox Group are also found in the middle of the structure.
The bedrock in this area has been folded and faulted, reflecting the Wells Creek Basin
Structure. The subject site appears to be underlain by the Fort Payne Formation which
consists of calcareous and dolomite silica stone with interbedded limestone and shale.

Parts of the site also appear to be underline by the Hermitage Formation which consists of
gray interbedded sandy and argillaceous limestone.

3.5.1.2 Geologic Hazards
3.5.1.2.1 Seismic Events
A graphical representation of the 2014 National Seismic Hazard Map for the TVA region is
shown on Figure 3-4. CUF is in an area where the expected Peak Ground Acceleration is
0.2 g and is identified as being within the influence of the New Madrid Seismic Zone. CUF
is on the edge of this zone but still can be impacted by the New Madrid Fault Zone potential
(U.S. Geological Service [USGS] 2009). Per the USGS, hazard map CUF would suffer
minimal damage but appropriate design criteria would be implemented to minimize potential
seismic impacts.

Seismic Peak Ground Acceleration Factors Near the
TVA Coal-Fired Plants

3.5.1.2.2 Faults
Four main concentric faults are associated with the Wells Creek Structure. The outer most
concentric fault marks the beginning of the essentially undisturbed region, and the
Cumberland Facility is in the middle of the Wells Creek Structure in the disturbed area.
Numerous faults are present beneath and nearby the facility. The Carlisle Fault is located
outside of the structure but it is not believed to be associated with the Wells Creek Structure
(State of Tennessee 1968). The areas in between each concentric fault are represented by
a hill and valley terrain that extends from the center of the structure to its periphery.
However, faults near CUF are located deep beneath the surface and have been
re-cemented over geologic time such that they do not represent a significant seismic
concern (Law Engineering 1992).
Ancient joints, fractures, faults, and contacts between rock types influence the bedrock
groundwater flow system at CUF. At many locations, dissolution of the limestone has
produced effective openings for groundwater movement in the bedrock. In certain areas
and along particular horizons, many of these openings might be closed, or infilled with
residual material and/or sediment. In 1992, Law Engineering conducted tests to evaluate
permeability of selected bedrock formations at CUF. Results from these tests indicated that
the formation was impermeable but higher permeability values were noted in areas with
74

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

numerous rock fractures and cavities (TVA 1998). Average conductivity values from 1998
tests of selected bedrock formations were similar to the 1992 test results. The highest
average conductivity value occurred at a well which was purposely located along the Indian
Hill fault. Therefore, the data suggests there might be some correlation between the
locations of fault zones and preferential movement of groundwater at the site along these
features (TVA 1998).
3.5.1.2.3 Karst Topography
“Karst” refers to a type of topography that is formed when rocks with a high carbonate
content, such as limestone and dolomite, are dissolved by groundwater to form sink holes,
caves, springs and underground drainage systems. Karst topography forms in areas where
limestone and dolomite are near the surface. Due to the carbonate rocks in the region and
the shattered bedrock around CUF, the potential exists for karstification to take place. Karst
features are typical in carbonate rock and are known to exist in the low areas south of the
existing plant. However, clay-filled solution channels and low-permeability confining soil
overburden reduce the potential for sinkhole development. The proposed landfill area is in
an upland area, and no karst features are known to exist within the proposed landfill
footprint (State of Tennessee 1968).
3.5.1.2.4 Soils
According to the USDA NRCS web soil survey (USDA NRCS 2017), most of the natural
soils on CUF are mapped as silty loams. Quaternary alluvial clay and silt deposits
averaging as much as 90 feet in thickness cover the Cumberland River and the Wells
Creek Basin in the structure (State of Tennessee 1968). The Quaternary Formations are
the result of in-place weathering of bedrock which has in-filled the faults, and closed over
geologic time. Most of the natural soils are variations of loams that are made of alluvial and
residuum material. Most of the soils near the plant have been stripped away and have been
replaced by anthropogenic fill to support development of plant facilities. As such, project
areas associated with the proposed dewatering facility and ash impoundment closure
projects are previously developed and no longer contain native soils. However,
geotechnical investigations conducted near the onsite impoundments provide evidence of a
low-permeability barrier under impoundment areas (Law Engineering 1992 and Stantec
2010b).
Soil characteristics of the proposed onsite landfill area consist of steeply sloping and often
eroded lands that include the following:
•

Hb – Maury silty clay loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded

•

Pf – Byler silt loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded

•

Bp – Bodine gravelly silt loam, 20 to 60 percent slopes

•

Bk – Bodine gravelly silt loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded

3.5.2

Environmental Consequences

3.5.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under Alternative A, no excavations would occur in conjunction with the construction of
dewatering facilities or landfill construction, and impoundments would remain operational.
Accordingly, TVA would not seek additional disposal options for dry placement of CCR
generated at CUF and would neither modify lands to construct an onsite landfill or haul
CCR offsite to an existing landfill. Additionally, TVA would ensure that all impoundment
dikes would be stable under static and seismic conditions and meet appropriate safety
factors. Thus, continued operations at CUF under the No Action Alternative would not be
expected to result in reduced safety under either static or seismic conditions.
3.5.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.5.2.2.1

Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility

Construction Impacts
The proposed dewatering facility would be constructed on a site that is heavily disturbed
and comprised of fill material. Site excavation and foundation construction is expected to be
limited to this horizon and not expected to disrupt bedrock geology. Therefore, there would
be no impacts to the geological or native soil resources from activities related to this project.
Operation Impacts
Geology-related operation impacts are associated with the potential effect of earthquakes
on the proposed dewatering operations. TVA would consider earthquake loads (and the
secondary effects of strong ground shaking) as part of the design of new facilities at the
project site. These design considerations are expected to mitigate the potential seismic risk
of impact to the proposed facilities and associated structures. Therefore, no notable seismic
impacts are expected to occur on the proposed dewatering facility that would impair
operation.
3.5.2.2.2 Ash Impoundment Closure
As identified in the PEIS, impoundments proposed to be Closed-in-Place would be
dewatered to allow stabilization of CCR materials and the installation of a low permeability
cover system. Structural integrity criteria for existing CCR surface impoundments under the
CCR Rule establish guidelines for conducting initial and periodic static, seismic, and
liquefaction safety factor assessments. Impoundment dikes would be assessed to ensure
they meet guidelines requiring stability under static and seismic conditions. At CUF, dikes
associated with the ash impoundment were assessed and determined to have acceptable
slope stability (Stantec 2010a). Similarly, dikes associated with other impoundments have
been similarly found to be stable or have had remedial measures implemented to ensure
stability (Stantec 2010a).
CCR removed from the Stilling and Main Ash Impoundments under the Closure-in-Place
option, would be transported to the existing onsite or offsite landfill. Because these are
existing permitted CCR disposal facilities, there would be no additional direct impacts to the
local geology. Closure-in-Place of the impoundments would require a large amount of fill
material. Proposed closure plans entail re-utilization of CCR from the impoundment as fill
material to construct design grades prior to the installation of the final cover system. The
reuse of CCR for fill material reduces the demand for soils for use in impoundment closure.
76

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Additional borrow material would be obtained from the existing onsite borrow site located at
CUF to install a properly designed cover system.
Specific conditions of the ash impoundments at CUF would not be expected to change the
impact analysis presented in the PEIS. Additionally, geotechnical investigations conducted
near the onsite impoundments provide evidence of a low-permeability barrier under
impoundment areas. Impacts from ash impoundment closure at CUF are, therefore,
expected to be positive as both the static and seismic factors of safety would be increased
by dewatering the impoundments under this alternative.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, the impoundments would be dewatered and all CCR
materials would be excavated and transported to an existing offsite landfill. If borrow is
needed to help grade and cover the site it would be obtained from the existing onsite
borrow area or from one or more permitted borrow sites within 30 miles of CUF.
3.5.2.2.3

Onsite Landfill

Construction Impacts
Construction of the proposed landfill would involve ground disturbing activities that would
include grubbing, grading, and excavation. Excavation activities are anticipated across most
of the landfill footprint to reduce the higher elevation areas across the site. Excavations are
anticipated to extend less than 1 foot to more than 35 feet deep. As described above,
geology of the proposed site is composed of carbonate rocks of the Mississippian System
surrounding the impact structure and older foundation strata such as the Nashville Group
exposed at the center of the impact structure. Removal of vegetation, grading and
construction activities have the potential to disturb soil stability and increase erosion.
Despite this, impacts to soil resources associated with surface disturbances related to the
proposed construction, excavation, clearing and grubbing activities are expected to be
minor, as BMPs outlined in a SWPPP designed to minimize erosion during land clearing
and site preparation would be implemented.
Onsite and local geologic and geomorphic features within and around the proposed
landfill’s footprint were evaluated during the screening level geotechnical investigation of
the proposed landfill locations (Stantec 2010a). The geotechnical exploration did not
encounter any onsite features that would prohibit development of a landfill for CCR storage.
Where some faulting has taken place due to the meteor impact, faults are considered
dormant structures that typically do not join existing active faults in the subsurface.
Additionally, karst features are not known to exist within the proposed landfill footprint. The
design of the landfill sufficiently addresses soils and materials that may be susceptible to
liquefaction, soil strength and slope stability, differential settlement potential, and fill
material selection and compaction requirements. Therefore, based on these design
considerations, impacts associated with geological features and soils are expected to be
minor.
Operation Impacts
There are two general categories of earthquake hazards that may impact operation of the
landfill: primary and secondary. Primary hazards include fault ground rupture and strong
ground shaking. If an earthquake is larger than magnitude 5.5, ground rupture may occur
on the fault. The amount of displacement generally increases with the magnitude of the
earthquake. Structures located on a fault, can be displaced or damaged by fault ground
rupture. The best mitigation for potential fault ground rupture to structures is to accurately
locate the fault and set back structures a safe distance from the fault. Where structures and
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

77

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

other facilities cannot be located to avoid faults, geotechnical and structural design
measures would be implemented to mitigate the potential for fault ground rupture. The
faults in the footprint of the subject site are caused by the meteorite impact. However, as
described above, these faults have shown to be healed by in filling of minerals. No
movement of the fault since the impact has been recorded (Stantec 2010b).
Secondary hazards include liquefaction/lateral spreading, landsliding, and ground
settlement. Liquefaction is essentially loss of strength in generally granular, saturated
materials including alluvial and fluvial deposits subjected to ground shaking. Liquefaction
can result in ground settlement, and where there is a free face such as river bank, can
result in ground spreading toward the free face. Liquefaction can damage foundations,
pavement, and pipelines and underground utilities. Such effects, however, can be mitigated
by geotechnical and structural design measures that include ground improvements and
foundation design. Earthquake-induced landsliding can occur where landslides are present
or where colluvial deposits or unstable materials are present on slopes. Potential landslides
can be mitigated, if present, with adequate siting and with various geotechnical and
structural design measures. Ground settlement can occur in soft, weak materials, including
non-engineered fill, due to ground shaking, and can be mitigated, by various geotechnical
and structural design measures, including ground improvements and adequate foundation
design.
3.5.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility and ash impoundment Closure-in-Place would be the same as identified
under Alternative B. However, under the Closure-by-Removal option, CCR from the
impoundments would be dewatered and all CCR materials would be excavated and
transported to the existing onsite landfill. Because this is an existing permitted CCR
disposal facility, there would be no additional direct impacts to the local geology that have
not already been considered in the issuance of the existing permit. Therefore, no additional
impacts to geology and soils are expected to occur with this alternative.
3.5.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility would be the same as Alternatives B and C. Impacts associated with
closure of the ash (both Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal) would be the same as
identified under Alternative B. However, under this alternative, future CCR generated at
CUF would be transported to an existing offsite permitted landfill, the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill. Because this is an existing permitted landfill, there would be no
changes from the existing environment within the landfill boundaries under this alternative.
There would be no impacts to the geology and soils associated with landfill construction.
3.5.3 Summary of Impacts to Geological Resources
Impacts associated with geological resources with the implementation the project
alternatives are summarized in Table 3-7. Impacts associated with geological resources
would be minor and mitigated by appropriate design measures.

tiers off the Final PEIS, the standards established by these requirements are also
applicable to the proposed actions.
3.6.2

Affected Environment

3.6.2.1 Regional Aquifers
Aquifers near CUF are represented by the bedrock carbonate aquifer and the alluvial
aquifer associated with the Wells Creek Embayment and the Cumberland River.
As described in Section 3.5 (Geology) CUF is located just to the north of the center of the
Wells Creek Impact Structure. The center of the impact structure to the south of the plant is
mostly overlain by the Wells Creek Embayment. This embayment is low lying and drains
into the Cumberland River to the North. Wells Creek drains from the south to the north and
borders the southern and western portion of CUF. The potentiometric groundwater surface
at the facility appears to be oriented to the south and west towards Wells Creek (TVA
2016e). Most of the soils are fill material around the plant or alluvial soils from the Wells
Creek and the Cumberland River. The alluvial soils range from 5 to 43 feet in thickness
(Law Engineering 1992). Based on the 1992 report, groundwater is present within the
alluvial material.
The alluvial aquifer consists of water-bearing sand and gravel deposits associated with
streams and floodplains.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Bedrock of carbonate formations of the Highland Rim is generally slightly alkaline and high
in dissolved solids and hardness. The quality of groundwater from shallow bedrock aquifers
is generally soft to moderately hard, but may contain elevated concentrations of iron. Most
groundwater from the alluvium along the Cumberland River is generally harder and
contains more iron than groundwater derived from the bedrock aquifers. TVA, as part of
adhering to the Tennessee Division of Solid Waste Management Regulations, has
monitored existing onsite wells around their ponds. Since 2012, concentrations have been
well within the groundwater protection standards.
3.6.2.2 Groundwater Use
Based on the map provided by TVA of domestic water wells within 1 mile of the subject site,
it appears the wells are either up-gradient or in another hydrologic zone. Therefore, there
are no known local users of groundwater.
3.6.3

Environmental Consequences

3.6.3.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under Alternative A, TVA would continue current plant operations and not construct or
operate the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility or undertake impoundment closure activities.
Additionally, TVA would not seek additional disposal options for dry placement of CCR
generated at CUF. Rather, CCR would continue to be managed in the current
impoundments and dry stacks for as long as storage capacity is available.
If the no action alternative is implemented, TVA would continue to adhere generally to the
existing Tennessee Division of Solid Waste Regulations. Groundwater monitoring at CUF
would continue on existing monitoring wells at regularly prescribed practices and intervals.
Groundwater monitoring of the impoundments will be undertaken with the development of
the CCR Rule required certified groundwater monitoring network which was completed in
October 2017. In conjunction with this plan, TVA will continue to work with the state under
the TDEC Order to obtain and evaluate groundwater quality associated with the CCR
management facilities at CUF. As described in the PEIS (TVA 2016b), regulations have
outlined a mitigation measure process summarized below that be implemented as
appropriate, in coordination with state regulatory agencies to help ensure environmental
protection for closure of inactive impoundments:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Design and implement a groundwater monitoring system.
Identify statistical procedures for evaluation of groundwater monitoring data.
Further assess groundwater conditions in proximity to closed ash impoundment.
If needed, identify corrective measures to prevent further releases or remediate
identified releases.

For active ash impoundments (under the No Action Alternative), a similar process for
groundwater assessment and protection will be implemented to ensure compliance with
CCR Rule requirements while in coordination with the TDEC Order and minimizing
environmental impacts.

3.6.3.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.6.3.2.1

Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility

Construction Impacts
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be constructed on a site that is heavily
disturbed and comprised of fill material. Construction activities would not directly impact
groundwater. BMPs as described in the project-specific SWPPP and Tennessee Erosion
and Sediment Control Handbook (TDEC 2012) would be used to avoid impacts to
groundwater in the project area and would be used to control sediment infiltration from
storm water runoff during construction phases of the project. With the use of BMPs, impacts
to groundwater would be minor and temporary.
Operation Impacts
Potential sources of groundwater impacts resulting from operations of the proposed
dewatering and handling facility include releases from the transfer pipe systems and runoff
from the dry storage piles. Much like the construction-related effects, these potential
impacts can be sufficiently mitigated with the use of appropriate BMPs. These BMPs would
cover sealed holding concrete basins in which equipment would be installed, and piping
which would be used in the dewatering process including but not limited to containment
walls, site grading and sumps equipped with transfer pumps.
With the implementation of the dewatering facilities, CCR would be conveyed to the onsite
CCR landfill or offsite existing landfill. Accordingly, the volume of water used for sluicing
would be reduced relative to the No Action Alternative. This reduction in water use would
result in a corresponding reduction in the potential for movement of constituents from
surface water systems (sluice trenches and impoundments) to groundwater. Therefore,
impacts of this alternative on groundwater are considered beneficial and minor.
TVA may construct a recirculation system in a subsequent phase where excess water
would be routed back to the plant. Instead of discharging water from the dewatering
process through the existing permitted NPDES outfall, the effluent would be rerouted back
into the powerhouse for future sluicing operations. This would further reduce the potential
for movement of constituents from surface water systems to groundwater.
3.6.3.2.2 Ash Impoundment Closure
Specific conditions of the ash impoundments at CUF would not be expected to change the
impact analysis presented in the PEIS. In the preamble to the CCR Rule, EPA determined
that either Closure-in-Place or Closure-by-Removal can be equally protective of human
health and the environment if done properly (80 FR 21412). Impacts from ash impoundment
closure at CUF are therefore expected to be positive under the Closure-in-Place option as
the decanting of surface water and subsequent grading and stabilization of the CCR
materials in the impoundment provides an immediate reduction in the potential influx of
leachate water moving from the impoundment through the subsurface saturated zone. A
cover system with an approved closure system over the compacted CCR not only prevents
additional infiltration from precipitation, but also would facilitate management of storm water
runoff. Elimination of the hydraulic inputs to the impoundment reduces the potential for
migration of leachate to groundwater beneath the impoundment and receiving surface
waters.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

81

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

As noted in the PEIS (TVA 2016b), Closure-in-Place activities will reduce risk to
groundwater and improve water quality in comparison to the No Action Alternative. Even in
cases where the elevation of the upper most aquifer is unknown, Alternative B provides the
following benefits:
1. Elimination of process water reduces the hydraulic head, therefore reducing the
pressure of water forcing ash contaminants into groundwater.
2. Capping improves groundwater quality by virtually eliminating rainfall infiltration
through the impoundment, and reducing downward migration of contaminants into
groundwater.
3. NPDES outfall water quality improves as contact with ash would cease following
capping; and the receiving river water quality would also improve.
4. Natural groundwater quality would eventually be reestablished.
TVA’s on-going monitoring of similar ash management facilities also points to the
effectiveness of those benefits mentioned above. In the case of CUF, when sluicing of CCR
changed from an open impoundment to sluicing in geomembrane-lined channels,
groundwater constituents demonstrated stable or decreasing concentrations. This has been
true for approximately 3 years. Closure-in-Place with a geomembrane is considered one of
the best options for improving groundwater quality beneath or downgradient of an ash
impoundment or landfill.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, CCR from the impoundments would be dewatered,
and all CCR materials would be excavated and transported to an existing, permitted offsite
landfill. As a result, a potential future source of CCR constituents would be removed. As
EPA identified in the CCR Rule, removal of the CCR materials will reduce groundwater risk
in the impoundment area. The CCR being removed from an impoundment would be dried to
an acceptable level prior to being loaded for offsite transport. The permitted landfills that
receive CCR would be lined and have groundwater monitoring systems as required by their
respective permits to minimize potential impacts to groundwater.
Groundwater benefits associated with this alternative include eliminating the potential
interaction between the CCR and the uppermost aquifer. It will eliminate new groundwater
risk from groundwater constituents of concern (COCs) migrating offsite.
As summarized in the PEIS, EPRI evaluated the potential effects of a closure scenario
similar to this option for a hypothetical CCR impoundment in Tennessee. EPRI found that
this option has an incrementally more positive impact compared to baseline relative to the
Closure-in-Place option (i.e., concentrations of all COCs are less than 100 percent of
baseline), ranging from a 1.4- to 21.7-fold increase in positive impact for excavate and
redispose (i.e., reduction in concentration) (EPRI 2016). However, for facilities having larger
volumes of CCR, the extended duration of removal (can be up to 70 years) would
effectively diminish any benefits to groundwater quality improvement relative to the
Closure-in-Place option.
No federal post-closure care measures are required if the impoundment is closed under the
Closure-by-Removal option. State requirements for post-closure certification would be
implemented as needed.

82

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Depending on the volume of CCR to be removed, the impacts of this alternative on
groundwater are beneficial and could be considerable, as it eliminates subsurface
discharges and eliminates COCs from the former CCR impoundments when the removal
project is completed. However, until the closure of the impoundments is completed, which
could take up to approximately 12 years at CUF, the benefit to groundwater quality is
expected to be less than the Closure-in-Place alternative because water infiltration through
the CCR would essentially be stopped much earlier.
The CCR being removed from the impoundments would be dried to an acceptable level
prior to being loaded for offsite transport. The permitted landfill that receives CCR would be
lined and have groundwater monitoring systems as required by their respective permits to
minimize potential impacts to groundwater.
3.6.3.2.3 Onsite Landfill
The proposed onsite landfill is located within a valley that is substantially elevated relative
to the alluvium and as such would not directly impact local groundwater aquifers. In
accordance with TDEC requirements, the proposed landfill design would incorporate a
composite liner system that meets Federal Subtitle D Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA) regulations and performance standards. The landfill design would incorporate
requirements designed to reduce groundwater impacts including a storm water
management system, leachate migration control standards, a geosynthetic cap system and
a groundwater monitoring program. BMPs would be used to control sediment infiltration
from storm water runoff during all construction phases of the project.
It is anticipated that construction and operation of the proposed landfill site would not have
a notable impact to groundwater as the new landfill would be required to maintain a liner
system as well as an engineered cap/cover system to mitigate groundwater flow through
the materials. Therefore, with the use of BMPs and adherence to TDEC permitting
requirements, minimal impacts to groundwater from the proposed action are expected.
3.6.3.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, Closure-in-Place of the impoundments, and construction and operation
of the onsite landfill would be the same as identified under Alternative B. However, under
the Closure-by-Removal option CCR from the impoundments would be dewatered, and all
CCR materials would be excavated and transported to the existing onsite landfill. As with
Alternative B, this would have a beneficial impact as it eliminates subsurface discharges
and eliminates COCs from the former CCR impoundments when the removal project is
completed. However, as the closure period is shorter under this alternative, beneficial
impacts would be greater than realized under Alternative B. The onsite landfill is a permitted
CCR disposal facility, and there would be no additional direct impacts or indirect impacts.

3.6.3.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility would be the same as identified under Alternatives B and C, and
impacts associated with impoundment closure (both Closure-in-Place and
Closure-by-Removal) would be the same as identified under Alternative B. However, all
future CCR materials would be transported to an existing offsite permitted landfill, the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. Because this is an existing permitted landfill,
there would be no changes from the existing environment within the landfill boundaries
under this alternative. As such, there would be no impacts to groundwater associated with
landfill construction.
3.6.4 Summary of Impacts to Groundwater
Based on the analysis summarized above, impacts to groundwater associated with the
proposed projects would be short-term and minor with the potential for long-term beneficial
impacts. Impacts to groundwater are summarized in Table 3-8.

Surface Water
Affected Environment

3.7.1.1 Surface Water – Lower Cumberland River, Barkley Reservoir
CUF is in northern middle Tennessee, southwest of Clarksville on the south shore of
Barkley Reservoir (Cumberland River) approximately 72 miles upstream of Barkley Dam.
CUF is drained by permitted storm water outfalls, wet weather conveyances, the CCW
discharge (Outfall 002), and process and storm water discharges from the Main Ash
Impoundment (Internal Monitoring Point [IMP] 001). The CCW, Outfall 002, discharges to
the Cumberland River at Cumberland River Mile (CRM) 102.8. The plant intake is located
approximately at CRM 103.2 and withdraws water for cooling and process purposes (TDEC
2008a).
The Lake Barkley Watershed (USGS HUC 05130205) is approximately 2,343 square miles
with approximately 982 square miles in Tennessee and includes parts of six counties in
Tennessee. A part of the Cumberland River drainage basin, the watershed has
1,258 stream miles and includes 27,000 acres in Tennessee.
The Lower Cumberland River from the Kentucky-Tennessee line (CRM 74.6) to Cummings
Creek (CRM 118.3) is classified for use for domestic and industrial water supply, fish and
aquatic life, recreation, livestock watering and wildlife, and irrigation. Wells Creek from mile
0.0 to its origin is classified for use for fish and aquatic life, recreation, livestock watering
and wildlife, and irrigation (TDEC 2013). No Nationwide Rivers Inventory streams or Wild
and Scenic Rivers are located near the CUF site. Scott Branch adjacent to CUF has not
been assessed, but would assume designations for aquatic life, recreation, livestock
watering and wildlife, and irrigation (TDEC 2013).
The Cumberland River (Barkley Reservoir) downstream of CUF is subject to the influence
of the thermal discharges from the plant. Under normal conditions, the Cumberland River
flow near CUF is primarily dependent upon releases from the USACE Cheatham Dam
located approximately 46 miles upstream, and to a lesser extent by downstream releases
from Barkley Dam and tributary inflows upstream of the plant. However, in 2007 leakage
was discovered in the USACE’s Wolf Creek Dam located upstream of CUF at CRM 460.9
which impounds the 65,530-acre Lake Cumberland in Russell County, Kentucky. To
accommodate repairs, the reservoir pool was lowered substantially which resulted in
reduced flows in the Cumberland River system downstream for approximately 5 years.
During this time of reduced river flows, and even though the plant reduced power
production (derated) to comply with thermal discharge limits, a large proportion of the flow
in the river was withdrawn by the plant for condenser cooling which magnified the potential
for adverse effects to the aquatic community downstream.
Wolf Creek Dam repairs were completed in 2013 and full pool elevations were restored in
2014. At this time, river flows past the plant have returned to historical norms, and TVA’s
biological monitoring indicates that biological recovery is occurring and a balanced,
indigenous population of aquatic life is returning to the river downstream of the plant (TVA
2016a). Barkley Reservoir (TN Waterbody ID TN05130205 015 – 1000) is still currently
listed on the state 303(d) report as impaired, only partially supporting its designated uses in
Stewart and Montgomery counties because of industrial thermal discharges (TDEC 2016a).

3.7.1.2 Onsite Surface Water Features
The ash impoundments and the proposed bottom ash dewatering facility site are in
previously disturbed areas and remain an active part of the CUF facility. These areas are
bordered to the south and west by Wells Creek and to the north by the Cumberland River.
Wells Creek has an 1Q10 (lowest one day flow with an average recurrence frequency of
once in 10 years) of 8.72 MGD based on a USGS study in 1992 (USGS 1992) and Scotts
Branch (a tributary to Wells Creek) is considered a zero-flow stream.
The proposed landfill site is located to the south and southwest of the main plant area and
is primarily wooded. Drainage on the property flows generally north and west to Wells
Creek and Scott Branch.
Jurisdictional streams and wetlands were delineated within the proposed project areas in
November and December 2016 (Amec Foster Wheeler 2017). As ash impoundments and
manmade drainage features within the existing plant boundary are not considered
jurisdictional, the proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering site, impoundment closure projects,
and laydown areas would not impact any streams or wetlands. One perennial stream, one
intermittent stream, four wet weather conveyance/ephemeral streams, and one wetland
were documented in the project area defined for the proposed landfill and access road
(Figure 3-5). The total linear footage of the portion of the perennial stream and the
intermittent stream within the proposed landfill site is 3,573 feet and 1,211 feet respectively.
The total linear footage of the four wet weather conveyances is 4,111 feet. Wetlands are
addressed in Section 3.13.
3.7.1.3 Existing CUF Wastewater Streams
CUF operates a surface water intake structure that withdraws an average of 2,096 MGD
from the Cumberland River for use as CCW and plant process water (e.g., sluice water, fire
protection, boiler feed water, safety eye wash and showers, and miscellaneous wash
water). Approximately 98 percent of the water withdrawal is used for cooling, while
approximately 2 percent is used for other uses including process water. The withdrawn
water is returned to the river after appropriate treatment and complies with CUF’s NPDES
permit.
The IMP 001 discharge to the CCW channel has an average flow of 21.73 MGD. TVA is
required under NPDES Permit No. TN0005789 to meet pH, total suspended solids, and oil
and grease at IMP 001. (TDEC 2008a and 2008b). The NPDES permit also requires that
IMP 001 be monitored for a series of total metals and ammonia as nitrogen. These
monitored metals include cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, iron, manganese
selenium, and silver. Total dissolved solids, chloride, sulfate, and fluoride must also be
sampled, analyzed, and reported for IMP 001 (TDEC 2008a and 2008b). Although there are
currently no regulatory limitations for these metals, discharged waters must meet TDEC
water quality criteria.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

As identified in Chapter 1, bottom ash is sluiced to the Bottom Ash Impoundment where
suspended solids are settled. The bottom ash is excavated and stacked in the Dry Ash
Stack, and the process water is conveyed through a series of ditches to the Main Ash
Impoundment. The Main Ash Impoundment receives runoff from the Fly Ash Stack and
Gypsum Stack via perimeter ditches in addition to the effluent from the Bottom Ash
Impoundment. The Main Ash Impoundment discharges under a floating skimmer to the
stilling impoundment. The stilling pool discharges through four spillways into the CCW main
plant discharge channel which flows into Barkley Reservoir.
3.7.1.3.1 FGD Scrubber Gypsum Byproduct Handling
When the gypsum concentration reaches about 15 percent solids in the absorber, solution
blow-down is initiated to maintain equilibrium. This blow-down stream is conveyed either:
•

To one of the two flexible membrane lined slurry settling channels in the northern
portion of the Gypsum Stack Area, or

•

To the gypsum dewatering facility (currently operated by SynMat) which dewaters
and markets the by-product for wallboard production, and the dewatered (filtrate)
waste water stream is then discharged to the ash impoundment.

The dewatered gypsum is then either placed in the gypsum disposal area or beneficially
reused as commercial grade gypsum. The Gypsum Stack drains to the Main Ash
Impoundment.
The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process is used to reduce nitrogen oxides for air
pollution control. Ammonia is added to the flue gases as part of the SCR process. Some
ammonia may slip through the SCRs. Most of the ammonia slip would be removed from the
stack gases in the FGD scrubber for that unit and become part of the FGD scrubber
gypsum disposal area wastewater. CUF performs monthly monitoring of IMP 001 for total
ammonia nitrogen per Permit TN0005789.
3.7.1.3.2 Discharge Characterization
To characterize the current conditions and projected changes in the IMP 001 discharge, an
evaluation of in-stream conditions after mixing of chemical characteristics was conducted.
This can be useful in predicting potential impacts to water quality that may arise from the
changes to the bottom ash handling systems. For details of this evaluation, see the Surface
Water Technical Memorandum in Appendix C.
This evaluation was based on a worst-case scenario just for evaluation purposes based on
a CCW flow that is full plant capacity and minimum river flow (1Q10 = 678.8 MGD). In
reality, if the flow in the Cumberland River were that low, CUF would derate or even shut
down to avoid thermal impacts to the river.
Even with that worst-case assumption, the evaluation of the in-stream mixing concentrations show that all the constituents except thallium would meet the TDEC lowest criteria
(i.e., the limit equal to minimum of the water quality criteria). The thallium exception is the
result from testing methods that can only detect these constituents in concentrations over
the TDEC criterion of 0.00024 milligram per liter. So, these results are due to limitations in
testing methods and do not represent true impacts to water quality due to thallium
concentrations. The mass balance analysis indicates that the overall impact of current
operations does not cause impacts to surface water quality.

3.7.1.3.3 Other Surface Runoff
The existing plant site runoff is regulated under the NPDES Permit TN0005789 and
Tennessee Storm Water Multi-Sector General Permit for Industrial Activities TNR0510000,
Tracking Number TNR051933.
Existing facilities and BMPs are used to ensure compliance with the permit conditions.
Some plant runoff is directed through the Main Ash Impoundment system IMP 001 or
through the CCW discharge Outfall 002 discussed above.
3.7.2

Environmental Consequence

3.7.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would not construct the proposed new facilities, and
no construction impacts would occur. TVA would continue to operate the existing systems
for bottom ash, fly ash, and gypsum. The existing wastewater streams would continue to be
authorized under NPDES Permit TN0005789. Discharges would continue to comply with all
applicable permit limits and therefore, surface water quality adjacent to CUF should remain
approximately the same.
Thus, continued operations at CUF under the No Action Alternative would not be expected
to cause any additional direct or indirect effects to local surface water resources, and
therefore, would not change existing conditions.
3.7.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.7.2.2.1 Construction Impacts
Wastewaters generated during construction may include construction-related storm water
runoff, drainage of work areas, non-detergent equipment washings and dust control,
hydrostatic test discharges, and domestic sewage. Construction activities have the potential
to temporarily affect surface water via storm water runoff.
The proposed bottom ash dewatering facility and ash impoundments are in an area within
an industrial site partially covered with impervious structures or ground cover. Impervious
buildings and infrastructure prevent rain from percolating through the soil and may result in
additional runoff of water and pollutants into storm drains, ditches, and streams. Any
existing structures and infrastructure would be removed from the project site; however, they
would be replaced with the covered bottom ash dewatering facility and would alter the
current storm water flows. Therefore, construction on the existing developed area would
only increase impervious surface area to a small extent.
Appropriate BMPs would be followed, and proposed project activities would be conducted
in a manner to ensure that waste materials are contained, and the introduction of pollutants
to the receiving waters would be minimized. A General Permit for Storm Water Discharges
Associated with Construction Activities (TDEC 2016b) would be required for this project,
and this permit would require development of a project-specific SWPPP. BMPs would be
based on the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (TDEC 2012).
Therefore, only minor temporary impacts to surface water would be expected due to
surface water runoff from the construction site.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

89

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Equipment washing and water for dust control activities would be handled in accordance
with BMPs described in the BMP Plan required by the site’s NPDES Permit TN0005789
and the General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activities
(TDEC 2016b) to minimize construction impacts to surface waters.
Onsite hydrostatic testing will have the option to use potable or surface waters and any
releases would be covered under the current NPDES Permit TN0005789.
Sanitary wastes generated during construction activities would be collected by the existing
sewage treatment system, onsite septic system(s) or by means of portable toilets (i.e., porto-lets). These portable toilets would be located throughout construction areas and would be
pumped out regularly, and the sewage would be transported by a vacuum truck to a publicly
owned wastewater treatment works that accepts pump out.
With the implementation of appropriate BMPs, only temporary and minor impacts to
surrounding surface waters would be expected from construction activities associated with
the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and impoundment closure.
Landfill construction activities could include, but are not limited to, the clearing and grading
of the project site and grading of new separate storm water and leachate basins; the
installation of the landfill facility (including liner and leachate collection fields) and the
installation of a forced main to pump leachate to its discharge outfall. Direct impacts to
3,573 feet of perennial stream and 1,211 feet of intermittent stream would occur as a result
of landfill construction activities (filling and/or culverting). Indirect effects include potential
sedimentation of downstream areas associated with runoff from the construction site.
However, such indirect effects are expected to be minimized by the installation of detention
basis and other BMPs within the construction site.
A characterization of aquatic features was conducted on the proposed project areas. One
perennial stream, one intermittent stream, and four wet weather conveyance/ephemeral
streams were documented on the proposed landfill project area. The USACE performed a
Jurisdictional Determination to determine wetlands and stream features and concurred with
identified resources. The requirement of a state 401 water quality certification (either an
individual or general ARAP permit) and federal 404 permits to be obtained for any
stream/wetland impact and the terms and conditions of these permits would likely require
mitigation, such as contributing to a stream mitigation bank, for these proposed activities.
3.7.2.2.2

Operation Impacts
Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility Operation Impacts

Option 1 – Construction/Operation of a Process Dewatering Facility Utilizing a Continuous
or “Once-Through” System
The bottom ash that would be dewatered is currently sluiced from the boiler bottoms to a
series of impoundments, where it settles and then is mechanically dewatered utilizing heavy
machinery. During the interim period between closure of the Bottom Ash Impoundment and
prior to construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, bottom ash and gypsum fines
would be directed to standalone tanks. Once the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility is
operational, the standalone tanks would be used to support process water treatment or to
support other plant needs. The location of these tanks is described in Chapter 2.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Currently, the bottom ash sluice stream also sluices economizer ash. CUF currently uses a
100 percent Illinois Basin coal blend, which does generate a mill reject waste steam;
however, the production of mill rejects has the potential to change based on the coal blend
utilized by the facility. For the purposes of this project, all three of these waste streams
would remain commingled and would go to the dewatering facility to be dewatered, and dry
solid waste would be sent to an approved existing onsite landfill. Depending on the timing of
various phases of construction, there may be a possibility that the impoundment system
could still be operational for a time after the implementation of the dewatering system.
Therefore, sluice water would be released to either the current impoundment system or,
after closure of the impoundment system, to the proposed process water basins. Either
impoundment/basin would ultimately discharge through IMP 001 to the CCW and
Outfall 002 to the Cumberland River. Clarified water from the bottom ash dewatering facility
would meet current NPDES permit limits.
To support the bottom ash dewatering effort, an internal study was performed in 2011 to
determine the potential wastewater management issues of the bottom ash and mill reject
waste streams during the dewatering process. This study specifically focused on the
solubility of the mill reject/coal mixture, both separately and combined, in the sluice water
prior to and after the dewatering process (TVA 2011b). This study’s results indicate that the
waste stream that would be generated by this process would likely meet the current TDEC
pH and metals in-stream Water Quality Criteria (WQC). For details of this study, see the
Surface Water Technical Memorandum (Appendix C).
No direct negative impacts to the surface waters would be anticipated from the operation of
this facility because any discharges would be required to meet existing NPDES and
Tennessee WQC limits that are developed to be protective of designated uses.
Additionally, no direct negative (toxic) impacts on the Cumberland River are anticipated
because Outfall 002 would be required to meet NPDES chronic toxicity limits. If routine
monitoring showed impacts, then mitigation measures, including altered settling times and
chemical treatments at the bottom ash dewatering equipment, would be undertaken to meet
requirements ensuring discharges meet NPDES and chronic toxicity limits and not cause an
exceedance of in-stream TDEC WQC.
Any discharges into surface waters would comply with all NPDES permit limits. Thus,
implementation of bottom ash dewatering at CUF under Option 1 conditions would not be
expected to cause any additional direct or indirect effects to local surface water resources.
Option 2 – Construction/Operation of a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility with a Recirculated
Bottom Ash Sluice Stream
This option would have similar construction impacts noted above for Option 1. However, the
operational withdrawals, and discharge details and impacts would be slightly different, as
discussed below.
In this alternative, most bottom ash sluice transport water would be recirculated. Only 0.9 to
2 MGD would be discharged from IMP 001 to Outfall 002, and this would be a reduction of
11 to12 MGD from existing discharges from these outfalls.
The dewatering process for Option 2 as described in Section 2.1.1 would be similar to the
process for Option 1, with the addition of recirculating the majority of the bottom ash sluice
transport water to be used again for sluicing or other allowed uses. This sluice water

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

recirculation process would include a make-up water stream, a low volume continuous
blowdown stream, and an outage waste stream. The make-up water stream would be water
that would replace or supplement the water lost from evaporation or leakage in the system.
This raw make-up water withdrawal rate would range from 300 to 600 gallons per minute,
which is equated to a maximum 0.864 MGD of make-up water. Not only would make-up
water ensure that water lost in the system was replaced, it would help to balance the pH
and other chemical constituents in the recirculating system to maintain the integrity of the
system’s infrastructure and materials.
Wastewater would flow from the dewatering conveyor to the clarifier and process flow
tanks, and lastly into a wastewater containment facility (or recirculation tank) prior to being
recirculated. The blowdown stream from the containment facility would help to regulate the
hydraulic flow levels from both generation units and would reduce the existing bottom ash
discharge from approximately 12.844 MGD to an approximate maximum of 2 MGD of
process water. During outages, the waste stream flow from the system could range
between 0.2 to 0.5 MGD to purge the system. All process waste streams would be
managed to comply with the site-specific NPDES permit.
Discharge Reduction Characterization
The potential reductions in loadings from recirculating ash sluice water to the bottom ash
dewatering facility were evaluated. It should be noted that this range of reduction does not
reflect the loadings being discharged from IMP 001/Outfall 002 or to the receiving stream
(Cumberland River), but rather the reduction in the loadings being discharged into the ash
impoundment prior to co-treatment. The ash impoundment effectively treats and decreases
these concentrations. After the ash impoundments are closed, the proposed Process Water
Basins and/or waste water treatment plant (WWTP) would ensure provision of equivalent or
greater levels of treatment such that any discharge would continue to meet NPDES permit
limits and TDEC WQC. For details of this evaluation, see the Surface Water Technical
Memorandum in Appendix C.
Some metals concentrations would be expected to decrease with the removal of the
majority of the bottom ash waste stream. The analysis indicates that the overall impact of
future bottom ash dewatering operations with recirculation would have beneficial impacts to
surface water quality. Thus, continued operations at CUF under Option 2 would not be
expected to cause any additional direct and/or indirect impacts to local surface water
resources.
As with Option 1, TVA would conduct routine monitoring of the altered and new waste
streams at IMP 001 to confirm this study’s results that no significant impacts to the
Cumberland River would occur from this action. Additionally, no direct negative (toxic)
impacts on the Cumberland River are anticipated because Outfall 002 would be required to
meet NPDES chronic toxicity limits. If the routine monitoring shows impacts, then mitigation
measures, including altered settling times and chemical treatments, would be undertaken to
meet requirements for ensuring that discharges meet NPDES and chronic toxicity limits.
Ash Impoundment Closure
Existing flows to the Main Ash Impoundment would be rerouted prior to closure. The
proposed plan to finalize closure of the existing Bottom Ash Impoundment, Stilling
Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment would not take place until the proposed Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility and Process Water Basins are in service or other alternative
solutions are in place.
92

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

The main operational change that would take place with the closure of the impoundments at
CUF is the change in management of the onsite storm water and process water that is
currently treated. The Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment would be closed. A
portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and the Stilling Impoundment would be repurposed
as Process Water Basins to treat flows before discharge to the CCW channel via IMP 001,
then discharge to the Cumberland River via Outfall 002. The basins would be designed and
operated to ensure compliance with all TDEC regulations and limits and TN Water Quality
Standards.
Existing outfall structures associated with the Main Ash Impoundment would be removed
and/or replaced as needed to manage the runoff from the closed impoundments.
Precipitation driven runoff from closed landfill areas should have much lower loadings of
suspended solids, metals, and other constituents than certain process wastewaters. Final
drainage would be routed to existing or new discharge points and comply with the modified
NPDES and/or the TMSP permits to ensure that no adverse impacts to surface waters
would occur. Mitigation measures would be identified, as needed, to ensure the discharges
meet permit limits which may or may not require a permit modification. Additionally, future
storm water that comes in contact with CCR would be routed to the future Process Water
Basin 1. Generally speaking, the proposed Process Water Basins 1 and 2 would accept the
contact storm water from the existing onsite landfill areas and plant process water flows.
These basins may be cross-tied or flows rerouted during basin maintenance.
Closure-in-Place
As identified in the PEIS (TVA 2016b), in-place closure of the ash impoundments would
minimize surface water flow to the impoundment which would enhance stability of the
berms due to a reduction of hydraulic inputs.
This alternative would consist of dewatering and stabilizing ponded areas followed by
redistributing CCR material within the footprint of the impoundments. The CCR material
would be regraded to promote drainage and construct Process Water Basins. The closed
area would be covered in place with a TDEC approved cap system. To facilitate installation
of Process Water Basin 1 and Process Water Basin 2, CCR within the Stilling Impoundment
and a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment would be removed to the existing onsite landfill
or an offsite disposal facility. Runoff from the onsite landfill would be managed through the
new Process Water Basins. Treatment of all runoff would comply with applicable
regulations and permits, and should result in only minor surface water impacts. The
proposed Process Water Basins would be lined with a TDEC approved liner over the
regraded CCR. For details of the potential cover and liner systems, see the Surface Water
Technical Memorandum in Appendix C.
The replacement of the existing ash impoundments with a capped disposal area should
reduce the quantity of solids and total and dissolved metals discharged through IMP 001 to
Outfall 002 and ultimately to the Cumberland River.
Final drainage would be routed to existing or new discharge points and comply with the
modified NPDES permit or covered under the TMSP to ensure that no adverse impacts to
surface waters would occur. Mitigation measures would be identified, as needed, to ensure
the discharges meet permit limits. This may or may not require a permit modification.
The proposed lined Process Water Basins should also provide added treatment potentially
reducing the quantities discharged even further. All work would be done in compliance with

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

93

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

applicable regulations, permits and BMPs so potential impacts to surface water from this
alternate would be negligible. Therefore, in-place closure of the existing ash impoundments
should reduce the loadings to the Cumberland River and provide a beneficial impact.
Closure-by-Removal
Closure-by-Removal would also require rerouting plant flows that currently go to the
impoundments. This option would also consist of dewatering and stabilizing ponded areas
and installing a liner to convert part of the area to Process Water Basins. Then this
alternative would require removing visible CCR material, perimeter dike material and
support structures within the footprint of the impoundments. Once visible CCR materials are
removed, the cleared areas would be graded, drained, and vegetated.
Storm water drainage would be directed as appropriate to ensure compliance with all
applicable regulations and permits. New storm water outfalls would be installed to direct
storm water runoff either west to Wells Creek or east to the existing discharge channel and
discharges would either be covered by the site NPDES permit or the TMSP.
Under this alternative, all removed CCR material would be hauled to a permitted offsite
landfill. Material placed within the receiving landfill is assumed to be fully contained by an
approved liner system such that no impacts to surface water would occur.
Landfill
The CCR by-products that would be placed in the landfill are expected to include fly ash,
bottom ash, and commercial grade gypsum. By-product generation and characterization
would depend on the coal source. The design coal for the CCR landfill considerations would
be based on the current CCR production utilizing 100 percent Illinois Basin coal.
The wastewater streams which could change substantively under this alternative are:
•

The addition of the landfill leachate stream and contact storm water runoff.

•

Non-contact surface runoff from the proposed landfill drainage area.

Each of the three by-products were evaluated using the synthetic groundwater leaching
procedure (SGLP) water extraction to evaluate the metals that would potentially leach from
the proposed new landfill’s leachate collection system. This information was utilized to
predict waste water impacts from the landfill operation. It should be noted that the landfill
would also include waste water treatment sludge and that was not able to be simulated in
this evaluation, however the amount of the sludge compared to the CCR would likely be de
minimis.
The Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance Model was utilized to evaluate the
proposed leachate collection system disposal facility (Stantec 2017). For details of this
evaluation, see the Surface Water Technical Memorandum in Appendix C. Depending on
the nature of this runoff stream, mitigation measures that may include wastewater treatment
may be required prior to discharge.
Onsite Landfill Leachate and Run-Off
The CCR solids produced at CUF would be trucked and placed in the proposed new landfill.
This proposed landfill system would have a liner system and a leachate collection system.
The leachate would be discharged to a leachate pond and then would either be gravity fed
via a pipe to Wells Creek (Option 1) or would be pumped to the proposed Process Water
94

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Basins or directly to the CCW (Option 2). The Process Water Basins would discharge via
the existing IMP 001 or a new outfall to the CCW and ultimately out Outfall 002 to the
Cumberland River. Ammonia concentrations in the landfilled materials would be dependent
on the SCR process and plant specifics. To limit ammonia loading to surface water from the
proposed landfill, the amount of CCR exposed may be restricted to 10 acres or less as has
been done at some other CCR landfills if needed. Details of the proposed landfill leachate
and runoff are in the Surface Water Technical Memorandum (see Appendix C).
Option 1 – Leachate Discharged to Wells Creek
The leachate stream would be discharged to the leachate pond and then gravity fed via a
pipe and discharged from a new outfall structure to Wells Creek. The modeled leachate
waste stream was evaluated after mixing with Wells Creek to ascertain if in-stream mixing
would meet Tennessee acute WQC. The leachate waste stream would have the potential to
be a low flow stream, acidic in nature with the potential of having some detectable metals
and ammonia levels. See the Metal Loading Section and Surface Water Technical
Memorandum in Appendix C for more details.
Option 2 – Leachate Discharged to the Proposed Process Water Basin
The leachate stream would be discharged to the leachate pond and then pumped to either
the Process Water Basins for treatment or directly to the CCW. The effluent from this basin
could then discharge through either IMP 001 or a new outfall to the CCW and ultimately
would be discharged out Outfall 002 to the Cumberland River. All waste streams would
comply with NPDES permit limits and regulations. However, the leachate would be treated
as required to meet all applicable permit requirements and in-stream water quality criteria,
therefore potential impacts to surface water under this alternative would be expected to be
minor.
Metals Loading and Ammonia Criteria Evaluation
To estimate the concentration of metals in both Options 1 and 2 after receiving leachate
discharges from the proposed by-product landfill, the maximum SGLP data were used. The
SGLP data were used instead of the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure data as the
SGLP data were deemed more appropriate to model leachate discharges because of the
use of non-acidified water in the method. Additionally, this method allows for analysis of
more parameters than the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure method. The leachate
data from the CCR products were identical in both Option 1 and Option 2.
In addition to the leachate loading and mixing evaluation, contact storm water runoff from
the proposed landfill to Scott Branch and Wells Creek was also evaluated. In this
evaluation, storm water modeled flows were utilized. However, rain water concentrations
were used and assumed to be de minimis and were evaluated at half the minimum
detection limit concentration. Additional details of the metals loading evaluations are in the
CUF CCR EIS Technical Memorandum (Appendix C).
For Option 1 – As evaluated in Table 4-3 of the Surface Water Technical Memorandum
(see Appendix C), the added loadings from the by-product leachate collection system
discharge to Wells Creek would have the potential to have constituents with concentrations
above the Tennessee WQC. When in-stream mixing was evaluated with the modeled
leachate stream and Wells Creek, cadmium, copper, selenium and thallium were found to
have the potential to be higher than the acute criteria for the Wells Creek’s most stringent
state water use designation. If this were to occur, mitigation measures, including waste

95

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

water treatment prior to discharge from these outfall(s) or rerouting flows to the process
water basins to be constructed, would be taken into consideration.
For Option 2 – As seen in Table 4-4 of Surface Water Technical Memorandum (see
Appendix C), the added loadings from the by-product leachate collection system discharge
would be unlikely to increase the metals concentrations at the Cumberland River where this
stream would discharge. Additionally, the concentrations would not exceed NPDES permit
limits or Tennessee WQC, except for thallium. The results for thallium, however, are due to
limitations in testing methods and do not represent true impacts to water quality due to
thallium concentrations. The mass balance analysis indicates that the overall impact of
current and future leachate operations would not cause impacts to surface water quality in
Option 2. This analysis represents the estimated maximum discharges from this site, since
the leachate flow used would be the peak flow during Phase III of the landfill operation. In
addition, water quality standards are typically applied as an in-stream concentration after
mixing in the receiving stream.
The evaluation for the storm water loading from the proposed landfill does have the
potential to increase the metals and ammonia concentrations in both Wells Creek and Scott
Branch. A loading calculation was performed utilizing preliminary storm water flow data.
The peak flow data were utilized from the 100-year, 24-hour storm (See Appendix C, Table
4-5). Flows were utilized going into each storm water pond and the concentration was
evaluated coming out of each storm water pond. Additionally, this loading and mixing
calculation did not consider any treatment in the storm water ponds. It would be assumed
that in-stream water quality standards would need to be met at the storm water outfall (for
those discharges into Scotts branch) prior to mixing with the stream, since the stream is a
zero-flow stream. The evaluation showed that all constituents evaluated would be below
WQC, except for arsenic, mercury, selenium and thallium. If this were to occur, mitigation
measures including waste water treatment prior to discharge from these outfall(s) would be
taken into consideration in future designs and storm water discharges.
In addition to the theoretical evaluation, actual storm water samples were collected from the
current dry stack at CUF just prior to discharge into the ash impoundment. This analysis
displayed that all metal constituents were below WQC, except for arsenic and thallium. The
increased concentrations of the mercury and selenium observed in the theoretical
evaluation were not observed in the actual storm water samples from the dry stack and are
therefore, considered to have a reduced risk of impacts from selenium and mercury. All
thallium concentrations were below detection and were considered to be a function of the
fact that the method’s detection limit is higher than the criteria and therefore, has the
potential to not be a foreseeable impact. In addition to the metals listed Appendix C,
Table 4-6, total dissolved solids were above water quality criteria, which could be an
indicator of potential water quality issues due to dissolved solids.
Additionally, TVA would conduct a characterization of the leachate and runoff streams postconstruction to confirm no significant impacts to the Cumberland River, Wells Creek or
Scott Branch. The waters would be analyzed for metals and other parameters. If
determined to be necessary, appropriate mitigating measures would be evaluated and
implemented to ensure that the discharge meets NPDES permit requirements for the water
quality parameters.

96

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Ammonia Model
An ammonia model was used to evaluate the expected ammonia releases from the landfill.
The current NPDES permit requirements include “report only” monitoring for IMP 001 that
ultimately discharges to the Cumberland River; however, if the concentration is found to be
over 2.08 milligrams per liter then corrective actions are required. The model was based on
conservative assumptions at the time of release and included mixing of the leachate stream
with Wells Creek to meet the acute criteria when pH of the waste streams ranged from 6 to
9 standard units. The leachate pond would have the ability to be released in a batch
process so that if any treatment is required this discharge flow can be isolated. No direct
negative (toxic) impacts on water quality of surface waters are anticipated, based on
modeled data.
Ammonia was also evaluated in the storm water runoff from the proposed new dry CCR
landfill. This discharge would be through new storm water outfalls to Scott Branch or Wells
Creek. Flows were utilized going into each storm water pond and the concentration was
evaluated coming out of each storm water pond. It would be assumed that in-stream water
quality standards would need to be met at the storm water outfall prior to mixing with the
stream, since Scott Branch is a zero-flow stream. The modeled concentration of the Total
Ammonia as Nitrogen was found to be below the chronic toxicity levels when pH was
ranged from 6 to 9 standard units and before accounting for mixing with Scott Branch.
TVA would conduct a characterization of the leachate and runoff streams to confirm no
significant impacts to Wells Creek or Scott Branch. The waters would be analyzed for
nutrients (including ammonia), metals and other parameters. If determined to be necessary,
appropriate mitigation measures would be evaluated and implemented to ensure that the
discharge NPDES permit requirements for the water quality parameters are met (TVA
2017b).
After accounting for the impacts of the CCR storage leachate and storm water, the impacts
after mixing with the Cumberland River would be minor. However, there would be potential
impacts in Wells Creek and Scotts Branch due to the addition of these waste streams. TVA
would conduct a characterization of the leachate and runoff streams to determine if there
would be impacts to the Cumberland River, Wells Creek or Scotts Branch. The waters
would be analyzed for metals and other parameters. If determined to be necessary,
appropriate mitigation measures would be evaluated and implemented to ensure that the
discharge requirements for the water quality parameters are met.
3.7.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility and in-place closure of ash impoundments would be the same as
identified under Alternative B. Additionally, surface water impacts associated with the
construction and operation of the proposed onsite CCR landfill would also be similar to
those described for Alternative B.
However, for this alternative, CCR from the Impoundments under the Closure-by-Removal
option would be hauled to the onsite landfill areas for long term storage. Runoff would be
managed through the new Process Water Basins. Treatment of all runoff would comply with
applicable regulations and permits, and should result in only minor surface water impacts.

3.7.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Surface water impacts under Alternative D are expected to be the same as Alternatives B
and C for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, and the same as Alternative B for the
impoundment closure activities.
However, in contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of
future CCR to a previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management
Landfill) for long-term storage. Minor impacts associated with construction and operation of
the onsite landfill would not occur as both existing and future CCR produced by CUF would
be transported to an existing offsite permitted landfill. It is assumed the pre-existing landfill
would have necessary permits that would be protective of water quality. Because this is an
existing permitted landfill, there would be no changes from the existing environment within
the landfill boundaries under this alternative.

Floodplains

3.8.1 Affected Environment
A floodplain is the relatively level land area along a stream or river that is subjected to
periodic flooding. The area subject to a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year is
normally called the 100-year floodplain. The area subject to a 0.2 percent chance of
flooding in any given year is normally called the 500-year floodplain.
CUF is located along the left descending bank of Cumberland River between approximately
River Mile (RM) 102.5 and RM 104.0, adjacent to Wells Creek from its mouth to about
creek mile 2.6. Scott Branch is a tributary of Wells Creek at about Wells Creek mile 1.5.
The 2010 Stewart County, Tennessee, Flood Insurance Rate Map for CUF is presented in
Figure 3-5.
The 100- and 500-year flood elevations at CRM 102.8 would be 379.6 and 385.3 feet,
respectively (TVA 2016b). The floodplain of Wells Creek is depicted as Zone A on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map, which means that flood elevations on Wells Creek have not been
determined. The drainage area of Wells Creek is about 57 square miles (USGS 2017).
Because the drainage area of the Cumberland River at Wells Creek is far greater than the
drainage area of Wells Creek or Scott Branch, the 100-year flood elevations on the
Cumberland River would govern water surface elevations in a 100-year flood. Therefore,
the 100- and 500-year flood elevations on Wells Creek and Scott Branch in the vicinity of
CUF would be 379.6 and 385.3 feet, respectively.
The existing ash impoundments and onsite stacks are enclosed within a perimeter earthen
dike that has a low crest elevation at approximately 394 to 395 feet, which is more than
9 feet above both the 100- and 500-year flood elevations of the Cumberland River
(Stantec 2016).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

99

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

The proposed CCR landfill would be in the watershed of a tributary of Scott Branch, outside
the FEMA-mapped floodplains of Wells Creek and Scott Branch, well above the 100- and
500-year elevations of the Cumberland River.
3.8.2 Environmental Consequences
TVA adheres to the requirements of EO 11988, Floodplain Management. The objective of
EO 11988 is “…to avoid to the extent possible the long- and short-term adverse impacts
associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid direct and
indirect support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative”
(EO 11988, Floodplain Management). The EO is not intended to prohibit floodplain
development in all cases, but rather to create a consistent government policy against such
development under most circumstances. The EO requires that agencies avoid the 100-year
floodplain unless there is no practicable alternative. For certain “Critical Actions,” the
minimum floodplain of concern is the 500-year floodplain.
The U.S. Water Resources Council defines “critical actions” as “any activity for which even
a slight chance of flooding would be too great” (U.S. Water Resources Council 1978).
Critical actions can include facilities producing hazardous materials (such as liquefied
natural gas terminals), facilities whose occupants may be unable to evacuate quickly (such
as schools and nursing homes), and facilities containing or providing essential and
irreplaceable records, utilities, and/or emergency services (such as large power-generating
facilities, data centers, hospitals, or emergency operations centers). Because under the
proposed actions, there is a potential for CCR material to enter floodplains and streams and
alter the flood-carrying capacity of those streams in a disaster, the proposed dewatering
facility would be considered a “critical action.”
3.8.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations, and no work
would be conducted that would result in a change in existing conditions. Therefore, there
would be no direct or indirect impacts to floodplains because there would be no physical
changes to the current conditions.
3.8.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering facility and Bottom Ash Impoundment and North
Ditch would be located within the perimeter dike, isolated from the 100- and 500-year floods
of the Cumberland River, which would be consistent with EO 11988 for critical actions.
Under both the Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal options, a portion of the Main
Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment would be excavated to approximately
elevation 376 feet, or more than 3 feet below the 100-year flood elevation. A segment of the
perimeter dike would be lowered, but would still provide protection for the 100-year flood.
The portion of the impoundment that would be Closed-by-Removal, would be lined and
repurposed as new Process Water Basins would be located within the perimeter dike,
which would be consistent with EO 11988.
The proposed onsite CCR landfill and the proposed access road from Old Scott Road to the
landfill would be located outside the 100-year floodplain and well above the 500-year flood
elevation of the Cumberland River. A perennial stream is located within the footprint of the
proposed CCR landfill; however, adverse impacts would be minimized by adherence to
mitigation measures required as part of water quality, wetlands, stream, and storm water
100

permitting. These mitigation measures would also minimize flooding impacts and preserve
the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains. Therefore, the CCR landfill and
access road would be consistent with EO 11988.
3.8.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under Alternative C, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, in-place closure of the CCR impoundments, and construction and
operation of the onsite landfill would be the same as Alternative B. Under the Closure-byRemoval option, however, there would be no offsite transport of CCR as CCR from the
impoundments would be excavated and transported to the onsite existing landfill for longterm storage.
Under Alternative C there would be no impacts to the FEMA mapped 100-year floodplain
area associated with the transport of CCR from the impoundments to the existing onsite
landfill.
3.8.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under Alternative D, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility are expected to be the same as described for Alternatives B and C and
the same as described for Alternative B for the ash impoundment closure (both Closure-inPlace and Closure-by-Removal).
Under this alternative, future CCR produced at CUF would be transported to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill for long-term storage, and no construction related
activities would be required to develop a landfill, which would be consistent with EO 11988.
By adhering to standard BMPs and mitigation measures as required under water quality,
wetlands, stream, and storm water permits, Alternatives A, B, C, and D would have no
significant impacts on floodplains.

3.9

Vegetation

3.9.1 Affected Environment
CUF and surrounding areas are located within the Western Highland Rim, a subregion of
the Interior Plateau Ecoregion. This region is characterized by rolling hills with a geologic
base of limestone, chert, and shale. The original oak-hickory forests were mostly removed
in the 1800s in association with iron-ore mining; however, the region is once again heavily
forested (Griffith and Omernik 2001).

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Land use/land cover based on National Land Cover data within the project areas and within
the vicinity (5-mile radius) of CUF is summarized in Table 3-3. Land cover near CUF is
primarily deciduous forest, hay/pasture, herbaceous/grassland, and cultivated crops. Land
cover on each of the proposed project areas is shown on the Environmental Features Map
of the project sites (Figures 3-6 and 3-7). The proposed project area which would include
the dewatering facility is primarily developed land (27.7 acres) and herbaceous areas
(2.1 acres). The ash impoundment closure areas are predominantly open water
(41.5 acres) and previously developed land (13 acres). The temporary use areas are
primarily developed land (128 acres). The proposed onsite landfill area is located within
previously undeveloped land on CUF property and is primarily deciduous forest
(173.2 acres) with a very small amount of wetlands (0.5 acre). More information about
wetlands can be found in Section 3.13.
The proposed project areas for the dewatering facility and ash impoundment closures are
highly disturbed and either devoid of native vegetation or consist of early successional
habitats dominated by grasses and non-native herbaceous plant communities. The
proposed onsite landfill project area is a mosaic of previously logged areas and second
growth hardwood forest. White and red oaks were the most abundant species within the
proposed project area. American elm, American beech, and eastern red cedar are also
common. One small forested wetland occurs at the northern end of the proposed landfill
project area. No uncommon vegetation or otherwise sensitive plant communities have been
identified within the proposed project areas at CUF. Plants observed during the project site
visit conducted in November 2016 are listed in Table 3-10.
According to TDEC (TDEC 2017b) there are two rare plant communities listed as occurring
in Montgomery and Stewart counties. While neither of these communities are ranked as
Globally Rare, they are considered of conservation concern in Tennessee. These
communities are Highland Rim Sinkhole and Depression Pond (rare, not state-listed, S2S3)
and Pennyroyal Karst Plain Prairie and Barrens (rare, not state-listed, S2). These
communities cannot be distinguished by using the land use/land cover data, however, they
are unlikely to occur as site surveys revealed there are no known sinkholes or high quality
herbaceous communities within any proposed project areas.

3.9.2

Environmental Consequences

3.9.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations, and no work
would be conducted that would result in ground disturbance or removal of vegetation.
Therefore, no project-related environmental impacts with respect to vegetation would occur
under this alternative.
3.9.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Impacts to vegetation would generally result from earthmoving activities associated with the
construction and operation of the dewatering facility, impoundment closure (both in-place
and by-removal), temporary use areas, and landfill construction.
Construction activities associated with the proposed projects would result in the disturbance
of plant communities from heavy equipment use and the potential introduction and/or
spread of invasive plant species from borrow material. Invasive plants that pose a threat in
the region include, but are not limited to, autumn olive, Japanese honeysuckle, Chinese
lespedeza, Chinese privet, wild teasel, and Johnson grass. Wild teasel, Japanese
honeysuckle and Chinese privet were observed during the February 2017 field visit.
However, the generalized transformation of existing ash impoundments from highly
disturbed or open water environments to stable, controlled and vegetated landscapes that
would result under Alternative B, provide a net improvement in the overall composition of
the plant communities of these sites and their ability to resist establishment by invasive
species. Following construction, the temporary use areas would revert to their current state
or be replanted with herbaceous vegetation. BMPs consisting of erosion control measures
and use of approved seed mixes designed to establish desirable vegetation would mitigate
the potential spread of invasive species.
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be constructed on a site that is heavily
disturbed and comprised of fill material. Within the entire 30.3 acres required for this
project, all of the land is highly disturbed due to previous development and includes only
2.1 acres of herbaceous habitat consisting of turfgrass and ruderal herbaceous vegetation.
This area does not contain unique vegetation with conservation value. Therefore, there
106

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

would be long-term minor adverse impact to vegetation resulting from construction and
operation of the dewatering facilities.
The temporary use areas are almost entirely developed land except for 0.2 acre of
herbaceous land cover that is primarily turfgrass and ruderal vegetation at the edge of a
gravel parking lot. These areas would be impacted mostly by laydown and storage of
equipment during construction. Post construction, these areas would revert to their original
use; therefore, the overall impact to vegetation in the temporary use areas would be short
term and minor.
The existing CCR impoundments are primarily non-vegetated open water areas or
previously disturbed barren lands. Closure-in-Place of the Main Ash Impoundment and
Stilling Impoundment would include placement of a cover system over a portion of the area
while the remaining area would be converted to Process Water Basin 1 and Process Water
Basin 2. The cover system would include 6 inches of topsoil that could sustain herbaceous
native plant growth or sod. Although the use of borrow material as part of the cover system
has the potential to introduce invasive plants, BMPs consisting of erosion control measures
and use of approved seed mixes or sod designed to establish desirable vegetation would
mitigate that risk. Therefore, in the short term, impacts to vegetation resulting from
impoundment Closure-in-Place would be adverse but minor; however, in the long term,
there would be minor beneficial impacts as a result of installation of cover systems over the
Bottom Ash Impoundment and a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment that would support
herbaceous vegetation.
Potential indirect impacts to vegetation related to transportation of the existing CCR from
the Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the existing CCR from the Main Ash
Impoundment would be less than those described below for the Closure-by-Removal option
as only a portion of the CCR from the Main Ash Impoundment would be removed.
Impacts to vegetation under the Closure-by-Removal option are limited to construction
phase disturbance of the same previously disturbed lands described above. Naturalized
plant communities like those of surrounding cover types may be expected to reestablish
within the former impoundment areas. Consequently, this option is expected to result in
short-term impacts to existing disturbed land cover types but would result in potential
long-term establishment of natural plant communities.
Potential indirect impacts to vegetation relate to the transportation of existing CCR material
to the offsite landfill under the Closure-by-Removal option. The haul route to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill would utilize previously constructed roads which currently
support landfill traffic. Additional trucks hauling CCR materials along this route would
potentially result in minor increases of fugitive dust and exhaust emissions that could
indirectly impact vegetation resources along the route due to deposition. However, BMPs
such as covered loads and responsible equipment maintenance would be implemented as
appropriate to minimize impacts. Therefore, no notable indirect impacts to vegetation are
expected to occur from the transport of CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management
Landfill.
Construction of the proposed onsite landfill would involve ground disturbing activities that
would include grubbing, grading, and excavation. The proposed onsite landfill area would
result in permanent loss of approximately 173.2 acres of deciduous forest resulting in
long-term adverse impacts.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

107

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

There is abundant deciduous forest habitat (61,203 acres) of similar quality within a 5-mile
radius of CUF, however, rendering the overall impact to vegetation within the proposed
landfill area minor. Soil excavations, removal of vegetation, grading, and construction
activities also have the potential to disturb soil stability and increase erosion, and could
result in the potential spread of invasive species. These indirect impacts would be
minimized using standard BMPs consisting of erosion control measures and other
measures to help reduce the spread of invasive species (Bowen 2012).
3.9.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with construction and operation of the dewatering
facility, in-place ash impoundment closure, disturbance of the temporary use areas and
landfill construction and operation would be the same as Alternative B. However, under the
Closure-by-Removal option, CCR from the Main Ash Impoundment and the Bottom Ash
Impoundment would be removed and transported to the onsite existing landfill for long-term
storage. The existing onsite landfill is entirely composed of developed open space with no
vegetative cover. Therefore, there would be no additional impacts to vegetation associated
with this activity.
3.9.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility and disturbance of the temporary use areas would be the same as
Alternatives B and C, and the same as those identified under Alternative B for ash
impoundment closure. However, under Alternative D, future CCR produced at CUF would
be transported offsite, and no onsite landfill would be constructed. Therefore, there would
be no impact associated with landfill construction, and overall impacts to vegetation would
be less than those associated with Alternatives B and C.
3.9.3 Summary of Impacts to Vegetation
Impacts to vegetation due to implementation of the proposed CCR management projects
are summarized in Table 3-11. Given the developed nature of CUF, impacts of vegetation
are expected to be primarily restricted to construction of the proposed onsite landfill.

Wildlife

3.10.1 Affected Environment
The proposed project areas for the dewatering facility and ash impoundment closures have
been heavily impacted and altered due to construction and operation of CUF. As described
in Section 3.9 Vegetation, plant communities in these areas have been heavily disturbed;
consequently, the wildlife communities associated with these habitats consist of more
common species that readily adapt to utilizing disturbed habitats. These areas are not
expected to support unique or rare wildlife species.
Within the proposed landfill project area, there are 173.2 acres of deciduous forest (see
Table 3-3). Numerous common bird and mammal species utilize deciduous forests as
habitat. During a site visit performed in November 2016, several common wildlife species
were observed within the proposed project areas. These species are listed in Table 3-12.
Common mammals included white-tailed deer, coyote, raccoon, and gray squirrel; whereas
typical bird species observed included common crow, blue jay, Carolina chickadee, tufted
titmouse, song sparrow and northern cardinal. During a mist netting study performed for the
proposed onsite landfill in 2011, five species of bats were found in the forested area in and
adjacent to the proposed landfill site: big brown bat, evening bat, eastern pipistrelle, eastern
red bat, and southeastern myotis (ESI 2011).
Several migratory bird species of concern are listed in the region surrounding CUF. These
include Bachman’s sparrow, bald eagle, blue-winged warbler, cerulean warbler, chuckwill’s-widow, dickcissel, fox sparrow, Kentucky warbler, least bittern, loggerhead shrike,
prairie warbler, prothonotary warbler, red-headed woodpecker, rusty blackbird, sedge wren,
short-eared owl, willow flycatcher, wood thrush, and worm eating warbler (U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service [USFWS] 2017b). The deciduous forest within the proposed landfill project
area may seasonally provide habitat for some of these species, including Kentucky warbler,
red-headed woodpecker, and worm-eating warble. Federal and/or state-listed migratory bird
species known to occur near CUF are addressed in greater detail in Section 3.12
(Threatened and Endangered Species).
Riparian corridors along streams may provide nesting habitat for migratory bird species,
such as prothonotary warblers, warbling vireo, Louisiana water thrush, and red-winged
blackbirds, as well as habitat for common amphibians, mammals, and aquatic reptiles (TVA
2016b). Habitat for these species may be provided by the perennial and intermittent
streams, and the 0.5 acre of forested wetland that are located within the proposed landfill
area.
Non-forested habitat such as the limited amount of herbaceous habitat within the project
areas for the impoundments, including areas of common reed and cattails, do provide some
habitat for wildlife, primarily birds such as red-winged blackbirds and great blue herons.
Other small areas of previously disturbed/mowed herbaceous habitats found in the
temporary use areas and dewatering facility project areas, are primarily dominated by nonnative grasses and herbaceous plants. These areas may provide very limited habitat for a
variety of common bird species, primarily foraging areas (TVA 2016b). Wildlife species
present in the more developed portions of the site include those often associated with
human presence. During the November 2016 site visit conducted for this project, several
common bird species were observed within the project areas for the dewatering facility,
temporary use areas and impoundments (see Table 3-12).

the project area for the dewatering facility, ash Impoundments and temporary use areas.

Not observed onsite. Observed as a flyover.

The open water of the impoundments offers suitable habitat and foraging opportunities for
water birds, amphibians, and mammals. Despite the continual disturbance of open water
features at facilities like CUF, wildlife, including mallards, great blue heron, and Canada
goose, often use them (TVA 2003, TVA 2004). During the November 2016 site visit, great
blue heron and American coot were observed using the edges of open water within the
main ash impoundment. Per the TVA natural heritage database, no heron colonies are
known to occur near CUF and none were observed during the November 2016 site visit.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

No caves have been documented at CUF and none were observed during the November
2016 site visit. One cave occurs within 2.6 miles of CUF in Houston County.
3.10.2 Environmental Consequences
3.10.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations, and no work
would be conducted that would result in loss or disturbance of wildlife habitat beyond
existing conditions. Therefore, no project-related environmental impacts with respect to
wildlife would occur under this alternative.
3.10.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
The proposed dewatering facility would be constructed on a disturbed site that offers
relatively low quality wildlife habitat. Under this alternative, the resident, common and
habituated wildlife found in the area proposed for the construction of the dewatering facility
would continue to opportunistically use other available habitats within the CUF property.
During construction and operation, most wildlife present within the project site would likely
disperse to adjacent and/or similar habitats. Direct temporary effects to some individuals
may occur if those individuals are immobile during the time of construction, especially if
construction would occur during breeding/nesting seasons as the species are less mobile
during those times. However, given the disturbed nature of the project area, any impacts
during construction and operation would be minor.
Impoundment closure activities (both in-place and by-removal) at CUF would occur within a
highly disturbed and fragmented industrial landscape that offers minimal habitat for wildlife.
A loss in marginally suitable habitat for waterfowl would occur because of this action;
however, higher quality habitat is available in areas surrounding CUF that could be utilized
by waterfowl. Under this alternative, resident wildlife found in these project areas would
continue to opportunistically use available habitats within the surrounding area. No tree
clearing would occur in conjunction with closure activities within the CCR impoundments.
Therefore, no direct impacts would occur to tree roosting/nesting bird or mammal species.
Immediately following the construction period, wildlife use of the closed impoundments may
be limited, as the geosynthetic and protective soil cover system may be expected to provide
limited foraging and nesting habitat for grassland species. A portion of the Main Ash
Impoundment and the Stilling Impoundment would be converted to Process Water Basins.
This may provide a small amount of marginally suitable habitat for waterfowl. Due to the
previously disturbed nature of the site, habitat for wildlife is not expected to change
significantly post closure (TVA 2016b).
Under the Closure-in-Place option, CCR would be removed from the Stilling Impoundment
and a portion of the Bottom Ash Impoundment to support development of Process Water
Basins. This CCR would be transported to the existing onsite landfill for long-term storage
or to an offsite landfill. These landfills are highly disturbed areas that provide poor habitat
for wildlife species, Under the Closure-by-Removal option, existing CCR from all the
impoundments would be transported to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill for
disposal. This is an existing permitted landfill, and there would be no additional direct
impacts to land cover types and their associated wildlife populations resulting from this
project. Lands within the former ash impoundments would be restored using approved,
non-invasive seed mixes designed to establish desirable vegetation that would support
112

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

periodic use by wildlife. Following construction these lands may be expected to undergo
succession to naturalized habitats that may offer somewhat improved habitat quality over
time (TVA 2016b).
In consideration of the highly disturbed habitats present within the project area, and the
availability of higher quality wildlife in proximity, potential direct and indirect impacts to
associated wildlife are expected to be minor and potentially slightly beneficial following ash
impoundment closure.
Temporary laydown areas are located on lands previously disturbed, fragmented, and of
poor quality for use by wildlife. During use of the laydown areas, wildlife habituated to the
area are expected to move to other plentiful suitable environments offsite; however, as
above, immobile species may be impacted. Post construction, these areas would return to
their previous state. Impacts to wildlife utilizing these areas would be minor and temporary.
Impacts to wildlife from construction and operation of the proposed landfill would generally
result from loss of 173.2 acres of deciduous forest habitats. This area is relatively
undisturbed and is expected to support a range of wildlife species, including migratory
birds. During construction, most mobile wildlife present within the project site would likely
disperse to adjacent and/or similar habitat, whereas direct mortality may result to less
mobile species. Within a 5-mile radius, there is approximately 61,203 acres of deciduous
forest. Therefore, due to the large amount of similar habitat in the region, the construction
and operation of the onsite landfill is not expected to substantially impact the local
population of any wildlife species, including migratory birds that may use the existing
forested habitats within the landfill area. Although forested habitat within the project area
would be removed, adjacent areas provide forested habitats that would accommodate
displaced biota. While the proposed project would result in alteration of habitats and
displacement of resident wildlife species, these effects are not expected to result in notable
alteration or destabilization of any species. Therefore, although there would be impacts to
wildlife resulting from the development and operation of the proposed landfill, those impacts
would be minor.
Although no caves were observed during the November 2016 site visit, should caves be
identified during the project construction, they would be examined for use by wildlife,
including threatened and endangered species.
While the proposed actions under Alternative B would result in alteration of habitats and
displacement of resident wildlife species, especially within the proposed landfill project
area, these effects are not expected to result in notable alteration or destabilization of any
species. In consideration of the highly disturbed habitats present within the remaining
project areas, and the availability of higher quality wildlife habitat in proximity, potential
direct and indirect impacts to associated wildlife are expected to be minor.
3.10.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, in-place ash impoundment closure, temporary use areas, and the
construction and operation of the onsite landfill would be the same as identified under
Alternative B.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

113

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

However, under this Closure-by-Removal option, CCR removed from the impoundments
would be transported to the existing onsite landfill for long-term storage, a highly disturbed
area that provides poor habitat for wildlife species. Therefore, overall impacts to wildlife
under Alternative C would be the same as Alternative B.
3.10.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Impacts to wildlife under this alternative, are expected to that the same as Alternatives B
and C for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, and temporary use areas, and the same as
Alternative B for the ash impoundment closure activities.
However, in contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of
future ash to a previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management
Landfill) for long-term storage. Under this alternative no construction related activities would
be required to develop a landfill. Consequently, impacts to wildlife from this alternative due
to construction would be less than those described for Alternatives B and C.
3.10.3 Summary of Impacts to Wildlife
TVA has determined that impacts to wildlife related to the CCR management projects are
minor as summarized in Table 3-13.

3.11

Aquatic Ecology

3.11.1 Affected Environment
The primary aquatic environments related to the CUF CCR actions include BarkleyReservoir (Cumberland River, a tributary to the Ohio River), Wells Creek (a tributary to the
Cumberland River), and Scott Branch (a tributary to Wells Creek) (see Figures 1-1 and
3-5). The Cumberland River is impounded prior to its confluence with the Ohio River to
create Lake Barkley. Near CUF, Lake Barkley-Cumberland River is more riverine,
approximately 72 miles upstream of Lake Barkley Dam. CUF is located along the left
descending bank near RM 103. Lake Barkley-Cumberland River adjacent to CUF is
characterized as having poor to fair shoreline aquatic habitat with no aquatic macrophytes.
The fish community consists of more warmwater species with a mix of species typical of
both rivers and reservoirs due to the CUF proximity to the main stem of Lake Barkley and
more riverine conditions near the CUF (TVA 2016a).
TVA sampled fish (electrofishing and gill netting) upstream and downstream of CUF
between RM 102 and 107 in the spring, summer, and autumn of 2015. Upstream of CUF,
1,576 fish (34 species) were collected in the Spring 2015, 753 fish (32 species) were
collected in the Summer 2015, and 597 fish (37 species) were collected in the Autumn
2015. Typical species upstream of CUF included gizzard shad, spotfin shiner, emerald
shiner, yellow bass, bluegill, longear sunfish, and largemouth bass.
Wells Creek is a small tributary of the Cumberland River that flows south-north through the
central portion of the CUF property. Scott Branch is a tributary of Wells Creek that flows
west-east through the property. An unnamed intermittent stream (tributary to Scott Branch)
flows through the middle of the proposed landfill site. The lower reach of this stream near its
confluence to Scott Branch has flowing water. The upper reach of this stream within the
proposed landfill footprint is dry during parts of the year and only experiences water flows
during wet weather. Due to their proximity and connection to the Cumberland River, species
composition and abundances are expected to be similar to that described above for the
Cumberland River.
The ash impoundments have open water zones and are expected to be represented by
common aquatic species with a relatively limited community composition.
TVA has used a Reservoir Ecological Health monitoring program since 1990 to evaluate
ecological conditions in major reservoirs in the Tennessee River system. A component of
this monitoring program is a multi-metric approach to data evaluation for fish communities
known as the Reservoir Fish Assemblage Index (RFAI). Fish communities are used to
evaluate ecological conditions because of their importance in the aquatic food web and
because fish life cycles are long enough to integrate conditions over time. Benthic (bottom
dwelling) macroinvertebrate populations are assessed using the Reservoir Benthic Index
(RBI) methodology. Because benthic macroinvertebrates are relatively immobile, negative
impacts to aquatic ecosystems can be detected earlier in benthic macroinvertebrate
communities than in fish communities. A component of this monitoring program includes
sampling the benthic macroinvertebrate community (TVA 2016a).
TVA sampled fish upstream and downstream of CUF between RM 102 and 107 in the
spring, summer, and autumn of 2015. Upstream of CUF, 1,576 fish (34 species) were
collected in the Spring 2015, 753 fish (32 species) were collected in the Summer 2015, and
597 fish (37 species) were collected in the Autumn 2015. Typical species upstream of CUF

included gizzard shad, spotfin shiner, emerald shiner, yellow bass, bluegill, longear sunfish,
and largemouth bass. Downstream of CUF, 1,643 fish (32 species) were collected in the
Spring 2015, 604 fish (27 species) were collected in the Summer 2015, and 705 fish
(31 species) were collected in the Autumn 2015. Typical species downstream of CUF
included threadfin shad, longear sunfish, emerald shiner, largemouth bass, bluegill, gizzard
shad, and yellow bass. Ecological health ratings were similar for both the upstream and
downstream sites for all three seasons, ranging from fair to good (TVA 2016a).
As part of the same TVA 2015 study on the Cumberland River near CUF between RM 102
and 106.6, benthic (or bottom-dwelling) invertebrates were also collected. Oligochaetes,
chironomids, and Asiatic clams were the dominant taxa both upstream and downstream of
CUF. Ecological health ratings were similar between the upstream and downstream sites
for all three seasons, ranging from fair to good (TVA 2016a).
A 2011 mussel survey conducted to characterize the freshwater mollusk community on the
Cumberland River (spot dives) and Wells Creek (along sampling transects) near CUF found
low abundances of a small number of relatively common mussel species. The three most
numerous freshwater mussel species included mapleleaf, wartyback, and pink heelsplitter.
On the Cumberland River, 24 mussels were collected from 23 locations (Catch per unit
effort = 9 mussels/hour). On Wells Creek, 11 mussels were collected along four transect
locations (density = 0.05 mussels/square meter) (Third Rock Consultants 2011).
3.11.2 Environmental Consequences
3.11.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations and no work
would be conducted that would result in loss or disturbance of aquatic resources beyond
existing conditions. Therefore, no project-related environmental impacts with respect to
aquatic ecosystems would occur under this alternative.
3.11.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.11.2.2.1 Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
The proposed dewatering facility would be constructed on a site that is already disturbed
from former and current operations at CUF. Invertebrates, fish, and mussel fauna of the
Cumberland River or Wells Creek would not be affected by the Bottom Ash Dewatering
Facility as there would be no direct impact to the river/creek or shorelines. Discharges to
aquatic resources would take place through the permitted existing outfall and would
necessarily meet existing NPDES permit requirements. Because NPDES requirements are
designed to be protective of aquatic life in receiving waters, impacts to aquatic fish and
shellfish species near CUF are not anticipated. Potential indirect impacts to aquatic
resources resulting from surface water runoff during construction activities for Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility would be mitigated through the implementation of storm water erosion
controls in accordance with a SWPPP which would be prepared for this project. Therefore,
there would be no impacts to aquatic ecosystems from dewatering activities.
Temporary laydown areas are similar to the area proposed for the dewatering facility in that
they are previously disturbed with no aquatic resources present. Therefore, there would be
no impacts to aquatic ecosystems with regard to temporary laydown areas.

116

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

TVA may construct a recirculation system in a subsequent phase and most bottom ash
sluice transport water would be recirculated. Consequently, discharges to the permitted
outfall would be reduced, which would have an incrementally beneficial impact on aquatic
life in in receiving waters.
3.11.2.2.2 Ash Impoundment Closure
Primary construction activities associated with Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal
would be located within the footprint of the existing impoundments and existing approved
borrow areas. Under both closure alternatives, wastewater discharges during dewatering
would be required to meet existing permit limits, and sampling would continue to be
performed at the approved outfall structure in accordance with the NPDES permit. Because
ash impoundments are considered treatment systems and not aquatic habitat, and because
laydown areas avoid encroachment or alteration of streams and water bodies, direct
impacts to aquatic ecosystems within jurisdictional waters would be avoided with closure
activities.
Surface water impacts related to ash impoundment closure construction activities are not
anticipated. Should minor alterations of surface waters be required, any activities within
areas containing aquatic resources would be appropriately permitted and would utilize
approved BMPs. Indirect impacts to aquatic resources of adjacent water bodies (i.e., Wells
Creek and Cumberland River) may be associated with storm water runoff due to temporary
construction activities associated with site preparation, closure activities, and dewatering of
the ash impoundment. Ash impoundment dewatering activities may temporarily increase
flow to Wells Creek and the Cumberland River. Aquatic biota may be temporarily displaced
due to increased flows, but would quickly repopulate following dewatering of the ash
impoundment. Any construction activities would adhere to permit limit requirements and
would utilize BMPs as described in the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook to minimize indirect effects on aquatic resources during the construction phase
(TDEC 2012). Where soil disturbance could occur, the area would be stabilized and
vegetated with noninvasive grasses and mulched as described in the above-mentioned
handbook. Following the construction phase, care and maintenance of the approved
closure system and site-wide management of storm water using appropriate BMPs would
minimize indirect impacts to the aquatic community in the receiving waters.
Indirect impacts to the downstream reach of Wells Creek after ash impoundment closure
are not anticipated as hydrology of the creek is influenced by the Cumberland River, not
Wells Creek. As such, the reduction of flow from the outfall to Wells Creek would not
decrease the available habitat and overall aquatic biomass.
Based on the use of an approved outfall structure in accordance with the NPDES permit for
wastewater discharge and the use of appropriate BMPs to control storm water runoff,
impacts to aquatic resources resulting from ash impoundment closure (both Closure-inPlace and Closure-by-Removal) are expected to be short-term and minor.
3.11.2.2.3 Landfill Construction and Operation
Construction of the landfill involves ground disturbing activities that would include grubbing,
grading, and excavation. One perennial stream, one intermittent stream, and four wet
weather conveyance/ephemeral streams were documented in the area surrounding the
proposed landfill and access road site (see Figure 3-5). The total linear footage of the
portion of the perennial stream and the intermittent stream within the proposed landfill
project area is 3,573 feet and 1,211 feet respectively. The total linear footage of the four

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

117

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

wet weather conveyances/ephemeral streams is 4,111 feet. The perennial stream flows
northeast through the center of the proposed landfill site. The lower reach of the perennial
stream near its confluence with Scott Branch has flowing water. The upper reach of this
stream within the proposed landfill is dry during parts of the year and only experiences
water flows during wet weather conditions. Aquatic habitat of this stream as well as the
intermittent stream and wet weather conveyances is limited as it is dry during much of the
year. However, the lower portion at the confluence to Scott Branch exhibits diverse flow
conditions which would support fish and benthic macroinvertebrates. Direct and permanent
impacts to aquatic biota and their habitats would be limited to stream loss and/or culverting
of both perennial (3,573 feet) and intermittent streams (1,211 feet) within the proposed
landfill project area. These activities would be done in compliance with applicable TDEC
ARAP and USACE 404 permits obtained for the proposed actions, including any required
mitigation. Construction activities would adhere to permit limit requirements and would
utilize appropriate BMPs that would minimize potential indirect impacts associated with
downstream transport and accumulation of sediments.
The direct impact of stream alteration would also be offset and mitigated by construction of
a surface runoff ditch and implementation of mitigation requirements as necessary.
However, some onsite habitat restoration may be expected in the long-term as the surface
runoff ditch sections would develop flow regimes, substrates and subsequent habitats
which would be similar to the filled section of the streams that would be altered. Watershed
level impacts would be minor given the local abundance of similar aquatic resources.
Indirect impacts to downstream reaches of the unnamed streams and Scott Branch may be
associated with storm water runoff due to temporary construction activities, or upstream
construction activities within the stream. Construction activities would adhere to permit limit
requirements and would utilize BMPs to minimize indirect effects on aquatic resources
during the construction phase, such as the use of silt fencing and other measures to
prevent the deposition of sediments in receiving streams. Additionally, flow alteration in
downstream sections of the unnamed stream and Scott Branch would be caused by runoff
from the landfill site. These impacts would be mitigated using sediment basins and other
BMPs onsite. Following the construction phase, care and maintenance of the approved
closure system and site-wide management of storm water with appropriate BMPs would
minimize indirect impacts to the aquatic community of the receiving waters.
Indirect impacts to aquatic resources of more distant receiving water bodies (i.e., Wells
Creek and the Cumberland River) may be associated with storm water runoff due to
temporary construction activities associated stream alteration (filling), culverting, and
construction of the leachate and sediment basins. Any construction activities would adhere
to permit limit requirements and would utilize BMPs to minimize indirect effects on aquatic
resources during the construction phase.
Construction activities would adhere to permit limit requirements and would utilize BMPs to
minimize indirect effects on aquatic resources. Following the construction phase, site-wide
management of storm water using appropriate BMPs would minimize indirect impacts to the
aquatic community of the surrounding waters (Cumberland River and Wells Creek). Thus,
impacts to aquatic resources resulting from the onsite landfill are expected to be short-term
and minor.

3.11.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, in-place impoundment closure, and the proposed landfill would be the
same as identified under Alternative B. Under the Closure-by-Removal option, impacts to
aquatic resources associated with closure activities would be similar to Alternative B;
however, existing CCR would not be transported to an offsite landfill, but would be
deposited into the existing onsite landfill, a highly disturbed area that provides no habitat for
aquatic biota. Therefore, impacts associated with ash impoundment closure would be the
same as described for Alternative B. Aquatic biota habituated to these areas would be
expected to move offsite, although immobile species would be impacted.
3.11.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Impacts to aquatic resources under Alternative D are expected to be of the same as
Alternatives B and C for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, and to the same as
Alternative B for ash impoundment closure.
Under this alternative, the proposed landfill would not be constructed, and therefore, there
would be no direct impacts to the unnamed streams located on the proposed landfill site,
and there would be no indirect impacts to surrounding waters. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative D would result in short-term minor indirect impacts to aquatic resources during
construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. However, as there would be no impacts
associated with onsite landfill construction, impacts to aquatic resources would be less than
Alternatives B and C.
3.11.3 Summary of Impacts to Aquatic Resources
As summarized in Table 3-14, TVA has determined that impacts to aquatic resources
related to the CCR management projects are minor.

Threatened and Endangered Species

3.12.1 Affected Environment
The Endangered Species Act 16 USC §§ 1531-1543, was passed to conserve the
ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend, and to conserve and
recover those species. An endangered species is defined by the ESA as any species in
danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Likewise, a
threatened species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout
all or a significant part of its range. Critical habitats, essential to the conservation of listed
species, also can be designated under the ESA. The ESA establishes programs to
conserve and recover endangered and threatened species and makes their conservation a
priority for federal agencies. Under Section 7 of the ESA, federal agencies are required to
consider the potential effects of their proposed action on endangered and threatened
species and critical habitats. If the proposed action has the potential to affect these
resources, the federal agency is required to consult with the USFWS.
The State of Tennessee provides protection for species considered threatened,
endangered or deemed in need of management within the state other than those already
federally listed under the ESA. Plant species are protected in Tennessee through the Rare
Plant Protection and Conservation Act of 1985. The listing of species is managed by TDEC.
Additionally, TVA also maintains databases of aquatic and terrestrial animal species that
are considered threatened, endangered, special concern, or are otherwise tracked in
Tennessee because the species is rare and/or vulnerable within the state.
3.12.1.1 Wildlife
According to the TDEC, 43 wildlife species of conservation concern occur in Stewart,
Montgomery, and Houston counties (Table 3-15) (TDEC 2016c). While CUF is entirely
within Stewart County, it is within 3 miles of Montgomery County and Houston County,
therefore these counties were included in the analysis. The USFWS Information for
Planning and Conservation (IPaC) tool contains a listing of the federally listed species that
have potential to occur near the project area. A review of the TVA Regional Natural
Heritage database in February 2017 indicated that of those species listed by USFWS and
TDEC, two species are currently known, or have been known, to occur within a 5-mile

120

radius of CUF: the bald eagle and the northern long-eared bat. Species contained on the
TVA, TDEC, and USFWS IPaC lists are included in Table 3-15.
3.12.1.1.1 Terrestrial Animals
Birds
None of the wintering birds observed during the November 2016 site visit within the project
area were state or federal species of concern. Table 3-15 contains a listing of bird species
observed during the November 2016 site visit.
American bitterns reside in wetland or riparian habitats including both freshwater and
brackish marshes as well as the edges of lakes or ponds. They typically require areas with
emergent aquatic vegetation and scattered shrubs. Generally, larger areas of wetland
(2.5 hectares or more) are required for nesting, while smaller wetlands can be utilized for
foraging for the American Bittern (Gibbs, Melvin, and Reid 1992). No records of the
American bittern exist within 3 miles of CUF. As emergent aquatic vegetation is generally
not available within the CUF ash impoundments, little habitat for these species exists within
CUF. The forested wetland within the proposed landfill area does not provide suitable
habitat for this species.
Bachman’s Sparrow is a large sparrow with a large bill and a rounded tail that is federally
listed as a species of management concern and state-listed endangered with a rank of S1B.
While Bachman’s sparrow can be found in old fields, savannas, and woodlands, the
preferred habitat is open pine or oak woods with a dense herbaceous understory
(NatureServe 2015). As the forested area of the proposed landfill area is semi-open
deciduous forest, it is possible that Bachman’s sparrow may be found in the vicinity;
however, no records of Bachman’s sparrow are known to occur within 3 miles of CUF.
Bald eagles are typically found near large, open bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and
reservoirs. Bald eagles will nest on cliffs or large trees near water (NatureServe 2015). A
search of the TVA natural heritage database shows 19 records of bald eagles within
Stewart County. There is one record of a bald eagle nest that was active from 2005-2009
near CUF, approximately 0.26 mile north of CUF between the two TVA transmission line
ROW(s). Because the trees in the deciduous forest portion of the proposed landfill are
generally too small to support a nest, it is unlikely that bald eagles would utilize that habitat
for nesting, however, they may be seen flying over and near the project area foraging over
the Cumberland River.
Bewick’s wren occurs in farmyards, brushy places, open woods, and overgrown fields. They
typically nest in small cavities, both those naturally occurring in trees and small human
made cavities. When not nesting, this species can be found in open habitat including weedy
fields, farm buildings, fencerows, and pastures (NatureServe 2015). Based on the
vegetation in the project areas, it is possible that this species may be found near the edges
of the proposed landfill area or utilizing the limited herbaceous vegetation within the current
impoundment; however, no occurrences are known within 3 miles of CUF.

Cerulean warblers typically nest in forest areas with numerous large trees, although they
have been known to use other types of nesting habitat opportunistically. These migratory
birds are only found in Tennessee while nesting or as passing migrants. Their non-breeding
habitat is in South America (NatureServe 2015). No known occurrences of cerulean
warblers have been recorded within 3 miles of CUF, and the lack of large trees in the
forested areas indicates that it is unlikely that this species would be found within the project
areas.
Golden eagles are most commonly found in semi-open to open habitat such as prairies,
savannah, sparse woodlands, or even barren areas that have sufficient mammalian prey
and are near nesting sites. Usually, golden eagles nest on rock ledges, however, they are
occasionally known to use trees. Tennessee is within the non-breeding resident range for
the golden eagle (NatureServe 2015). The TVA Natural Heritage Database has one record
of a golden eagle perching on a bluff 5.5 miles from CUF at the Cross Creek National
Wildlife Refuge. Golden eagles may occasionally be seen flying over or utilizing nearby
open areas as hunting grounds; however, it is unlikely that they would be found nesting in
the project area.
Henslow’s sparrows utilize pastures and native grasslands with a preference for areas with
tall grass species with a residual layer of dead vegetation (Reinking et al. 2000). This
species has not been recorded within 3 miles of CUF. Based on the limited amount of
herbaceous cover within the project area, it is unlikely that this species would be found
therein.
Lark sparrows utilize a wide variety of open habitats such as prairies, parkland, shrub
thickets, pastures, riparian areas, as well as the edges of woodland. Areas selected by the
lark sparrow typically have scattered bushes and trees as woody vegetation is a necessity
for nesting (NatureServe 2015). The proposed dewatering facility and impoundment closure
project areas likely contain a limited amount of suitable habitat for the lark sparrow;
however, no known records occur within 3 miles of CUF.
Little blue herons can be found in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, lakes,
meadows, mudflats, lagoons, streams and other calm, shallow, freshwater habitats. They
nest in trees and shrubs approximately 4 meters off the ground near freshwater. However,
this species is primarily seen as a passing migrant in Tennessee (NatureServe 2015). The
project area likely contains suitable habitat for the little blue heron in the wetland and open
water areas; however, no known records occur within 3 miles of CUF.
Savannah sparrows utilize a wide range of vegetation types for nesting and foraging
including tundra, coastal salt marshes, sedge bogs, grassy meadows, pasture, and
cropland, although it is most commonly found in idle native and conservation reserve
program lands. Generally, it avoids areas with high tree cover (NatureServe 2015).
Because of the limited non-forested habitat, it is unlikely that the savannah sparrow would
be found within the project area.
Swainson’s warblers nest in areas with dense shrub vegetation. It is a very secretive bird
and is infrequently observed. It is most commonly seen nesting in cane breaks, low
floodplain forests, and rhododendron and mountain laurel thickets. Tennessee is within the
breading range of the Swainson’s warbler (NatureServe 2015). The forested area lacks a

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

dense shrub understory and it is unlikely that the Swainson’s warbler would be found in the
project area. Additionally, no known records occur within 3 miles of CUF.
Vesper sparrows are a ground nesting bird that utilize a variety of open habitats including
prairies, pastures, fields, woodland clearings, and dry shrub lands. Tennessee is primarily
in the migration and non-breeding resident range for vesper sparrows, however, there may
be nesting birds in the state (NatureServe 2015). The TVA Natural Heritage Database has
one record of vesper sparrows foraging at Lake Kyle, 12.7 miles from CUF. The project
area has limited amounts of open herbaceous habitat. Consequently, it is unlikely that this
species would be found within the project areas.
Mammals
Bats
Eastern small-footed bat is primarily found in hilly or mountainous forests. They forage over
ponds and riparian areas, as well as in upland habitats such as open forests, clearings,
strip mines, and ridgetops. Warm season roosts are generally in cracks and crevices of
rocks along talus slopes or rocky outcroppings. They are also known to use manmade
structures for warm season roosts. This species is known to return to the same warm
season roosts annually. Winter hibernation occurs in caves or mine tunnels (NatureServe
2015). This species may be found foraging and roosting during summer in or near the
existing ash impoundments and the forested areas of the proposed landfill. However, no
records are known to occur within 3 miles of CUF.
Gray bats almost exclusively roost in large caves found in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky,
Missouri, and Tennessee with some smaller populations found in nearby states. They are
sometimes found roosting in mines or buildings (NatureServe 2016). The TVA database
has seven records of gray bats in Stewart County. The closest record is 14.8 miles from
CUF. Suitable roosting habitat for gray bats is not present within the proposed project areas
because of a lack of caves. Low quality foraging habitat for this species may occur over
open water areas associated with Wells Creek, the Cumberland River or ash
impoundments. Bellamy Cave is within 8 miles of CUF and provides suitable winter habitat
(hibernacula) for the gray bat (Brady et al. 1982). Hibernacula are assigned priority
numbers primarily based on winter population sizes and to protect essential hibernation
sites across the species’ range. Bellamy Cave is assigned Priority 1 (highest priority) based
on its current and/or historically observed winter population and stable microclimate.
The Indiana bat is listed as federally endangered by the USFWS (USFWS 2007). The
species overwinters in large numbers in caves and forms small colonies under loose bark of
trees and snags in summer months (Barbour and Davis 1974). Indiana bats disperse from
wintering caves to areas throughout the eastern United States. This species’ range extends
from New York and New Hampshire in the north to Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi in
the south, and as far west as eastern Kansas and Oklahoma. The species favors mature
forests interspersed with openings. Summer roosting habitat is represented by trees having
snags, cavities or exfoliating bark. Use of living trees, especially species such as shagbark
hickory, mature white oaks, and other trees with suitable roost characteristics near suitable
snags, has also been documented. Multiple roost sites are generally selected. The
availability of trees of a size and sun exposure are other another important limiting factors
contributing to roost site suitability (Tuttle and Kennedy 2002, Harvey 2002, Kurta et al.
2002). A search of the TVA database indicates one record of Indiana bat within 21.1 miles
of CUF. The forested areas within the landfill area and open areas over Wells Creek, the
Cumberland River and the ash impoundments may provide suitable foraging habitat for this
126

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

species. Additionally, CUF is within known swarming area for Indiana bats that hibernate
within Bellamy Cave in Montgomery County (USFWS 2015a). An acoustic survey
conducted within the proposed landfill area indicated a high probability that some of the
calls recorded during the survey were those of Indiana bats. However, no Indiana bats were
captured during mist netting operations within the project area (ESI 2011). Although
acoustic data indicated the likely presence of Indiana bats in the area, official presence can
only be determined by in-hand identifications using mist netting (ESI 2011). No active
summer roost sites were identified within the project areas.
Northern long-eared bats are found in the United States from Maine to North Carolina on
the Atlantic Coast, westward to eastern Oklahoma and north through the Dakotas, reaching
into eastern Montana and Wyoming, and extending southward to parts of southern states
from Georgia to Louisiana. Suitable winter habitat (hibernacula) includes underground
caves and cave-like structures (e.g., abandoned or active mines, railroad tunnels). These
hibernacula typically have large passages with significant cracks and crevices for roosting;
relatively constant, cool temperatures (32 to 48°F) and with high humidity and minimal air
currents. During summer, this species roosts singly or in colonies in cavities, underneath
bark, crevices, or hollows of both live and dead trees (typical diameter greater than or equal
to 3 inches). Males and non-reproductive females may also roost in cooler places, like
caves and mines. Northern long-eared bats forage in upland and lowland woodlots, treelined corridors, and water surfaces, feeding on insects. In general, habitat use by northern
long-eared bats is thought to be similar to that used by Indiana bats, although northern
long-eared bats appear to be more opportunistic in selection of summer habitat (USFWS
2016a). A search of the TVA Natural Heritage Database in January 2017 indicates that a
known hibernaculum for the northern long-eared bats occurs within 2.6 miles of CUF in
Houston County. Additionally, CUF is considered swarming habitat (Swarming 1) by
USFWS due to the proximity of Bellamy Cave, a known hibernaculum for this species
(USFWS 2015a). One northern long-eared bat (adult reproductive male) was captured
during a mist netting study in 2011, approximately 1.1 miles south of the landfill area in
Houston County in a young lowland forest (ESI 2011).
In November 2016, an assessment was conducted to determine bat habitat suitability within
forested areas of the proposed landfill limit of disturbance and the project areas associated
with the impoundments and the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. Based on this survey, and
the 2011 endangered bat survey described above, it was determined that the forested area
and associated streams on the proposed landfill site may be utilized by Indiana, northern
long-eared, and eastern small-footed bats for foraging habitat. These species may also
utilize the proposed landfill area as summer roosting habitat; however, due to the scarcity of
suitable roosting trees, it was determined that this habitat was of low quality for summer
roosting. The open water areas of Wells Creek, the Cumberland River and the existing ash
impoundments may provide foraging habitat for bats.
Other Mammals
American pygmy shrews are small primarily nocturnal rodents that can be found in a variety
of moist habitats though they appear to prefer openings in boreal forests. They utilize
burrows in or using soil, as well as fallen logs and debris (NatureServe 2015). Low quality
habitat for this species may be found in the proposed landfill area, however there are no
records within 3 miles of CUF.
Cinereus shrews are a medium sized burrowing shrew that can utilize a variety of habitats,
however, there is evidence that it prefers damp forests. Nesting season can last from

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

127

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

March-September. Nests are typically above ground in fallen logs or other debris
(NatureServe 2015). Cinereus shrews may be found within the low-quality habitat of the
proposed landfill project area, however there are no records within 3 miles of CUF.
Southeastern shrews are small burrowing shrews that utilize a variety of habitats. It seems
to prefer moist habitats such as bogs and damp woods, however, this species has also
been observed utilizing upland shrubby and wooded areas. Overall, the southeastern shrew
prefers areas with dense ground cover (NatureServe 2015). This species may be found
within low quality habitat of the proposed landfill project area, specifically within the small
wetland region, however, there are no records within 3 miles of CUF.
Southern bog lemming is a small burrowing mammal that is most commonly found in wet
habitat such as bogs, fens, riparian areas, and wetlands. Occasionally, southern bog
lemmings may be found in upland areas, provided there is a thick, moist humus layer. This
species is active throughout the day and night year-round (NatureServe 2015). The
southern bog lemming may be found within the proposed landfill project area, specifically
within the small wetland region, however, there are no records within 3 miles of CUF.
Meadow jumping mice are small soil burrowing mammals that breed from April to early
September. This species utilizes moist lowland habitats, particularly areas with thick, low
vegetation, and little canopy cover. Meadow jumping mice are usually nocturnal but may be
seen in daylight. They hibernate from early fall to late spring (NatureServe 2015). Meadow
jumping mice may be found within the proposed landfill project area, specifically within the
small wetland region, however there are no records within 3 miles of CUF.
Reptiles
Alligator snapping turtle is a highly rare aquatic species that is restricted to drainages,
floodplains, swamps, and oxbow lakes associated with large rivers, only emerging from
water for nesting and basking. The species does not inhabit isolated wetlands and ponds.
Nesting occurs on river banks and sandbars. Eggs are deposited in April-June and
hatchlings emerge in 11 to 16 weeks from deposition (NatureServe 2015). There are no
waterbodies likely to support alligator snapping turtles within the project areas and no
known records within 3 miles of CUF.
Copperbelly watersnakes rely on a matrix of shallow or floodplain wetlands surrounded by
forest. They move from wetland to wetland while foraging and hibernate in forested
wetlands or adjacent upland forests. Hibernation occurs from October to April (USFWS
2015b). The small wetland area within the limits of the proposed access road, may in part,
support copperbelly watersnakes. The forested habitats, especially the small forested
wetland area, within the landfill area may provide suitable habitat for hibernation. However,
there are no records of this species within 3 miles of the project area.
Eastern slender glass lizards rely on sandy soil for burrowing and are primarily found in
open areas such as grasslands, pastures, scrubby areas, right of ways, and fallow fields
(U.S. National Park Service [NPS] 2017a; NatureServe 2015). Due to the limited amount of
open herbaceous areas, it is unlikely that this species would be found in the project area.
Northern pinesnakes are egg laying snakes that breed in spring, with hatchlings emerging
in late summer. Northern pinesnakes’ preferred habitat is characterized by xeric, pine or
pine-oak dominated woodlands with open understory and sandy soils for burrowing
(NatureServe 2015). As no pine or pine oak dominated woodlands are within the project
128

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

boundaries, it is unlikely that this species would be found within the proposed project areas
for the landfill, dewatering site, or ash impoundment closures.
Western pygmy rattlesnake is a small secretive snake that may utilize a variety of habitats
from wetland areas to pine-hardwood forests. Births usually occur in summer (NatureServe
2015). As little is known about the habitat for the Western pygmy rattlesnake, there may be
suitable habitat within the project area. No known records of this species exist within
3 miles of CUF per the TVA database.
Insects
Acuminate snaketail is a green dragonfly that breeds in clear bedrock streams. Adult
foraging habitat is unknown. The streams located within the project area are unlikely to
provide habitat for this species, and no records are known within 3 miles of CUF per the
TVA database.
Coleman cave beetles are limestone cave dependent insects that have a very restricted
range. They are only known to occur in Coleman Cave, Foster Cave, Bellamy Cave, Darnell
Spring Cave, and Clarksville Lake Cave (USFWS 2016b). As there are no known caves
within the project area, this species is unlikely to be found at this site.
Amphibian
Barking treefrog can be found in low wet woods, swamps, and sandy areas of pine
savannas. When active they are mostly arboreal but can be occasionally be found on the
ground. During the cold season, adults burrow under tree roots, vegetation, or in soil.
Reproduction occurs in shallow water (NatureServe 2015). There are no known records
within the vicinity of CUF. There is limited wetland habitat within the project area that may
provide suitable habitat for the barking treefrog.
Fish
Blue sucker is a bottom feeding fish that can be found in large rivers and lower parts of
major tributaries in channels and flowing pools with moderate current. Occasionally they
can be found in impoundments. Adults migrate upstream to spawn in riffles (NatureServe
2015). One blue sucker was captured upstream and five blue suckers were captured down
stream of CUF during gill netting sampling as a part of 2015 biological monitoring of the
Cumberland River (TVA 2016a). The streams within the proposed landfill area are small
and do not provide suitable habitat for the blue sucker.
Lake sturgeon’s primary habitat is the bottoms of large freshwater rivers and lakes usually
at depth of 5 to 10 meters. Spawning occurs in is shallower waters in areas with swift
currents (NatureServe 2015). During gill netting sampling in 2015, two lake sturgeon were
identified, one up stream of CUF and one downstream (TVA 2016a). There is no habitat for
the lake sturgeon within the proposed project areas.
Southern cavefish is a troglodytic species only found in cave streams, underground lakes,
wells and spring outlets (NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat for the southern cavefish
within the proposed project areas.
Slenderhead darter is a small fish that is usually found in runs and riffles of small to medium
rivers with strong current, frequently in gravel shoal areas (NatureServe 2015). There is no
habitat for the slenderhead darter within the proposed project areas.

Mollusks and Crustaceans
The clubshell mussel is found in small to medium sized rivers and streams. The mussel is
known to bury itself in into substrate of clean, loose sand and gravel to depths of up to four
inches (NatureServe 2015). Surveys performed in the Cumberland River in 2011 (Third
Rock Consultants 2011) found that the habitat near CUF was suboptimal for this species
and no individuals were recovered during the survey. Therefore, this habitat does not occur
within the project area.
The rabbitsfoot mussel is found in large rivers with sand and gravel substrate (NatureServe
2015). Surveys performed in the Cumberland River in 2011 (Third Rock Consultants 2011).
found that the habitat near CUF was suboptimal for this species and no individuals were
recovered during the survey. Therefore, this habitat does not occur within the project area.
Orangefoot pimpleback is a mussel found in medium to large rivers in sand, gravel, and
cobble substrate in deep water with heavy currents (NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat
for orangefoot pimpleback in the proposed project areas.
Ring pink is a mussel found in medium to large rivers usually near sand and gravel bars
(NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat for ring pink in the proposed project areas.
Rough pigtoe is a mussel usually found over sand, gravel, and cobble substrates in the
shoals of medium to large rivers. They can occasionally be found on flats and on muddy
sand (NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat for the rough pigtoe in the proposed project
areas.
Slabside pearly mussel is usually found in shallow waters of creeks to large rivers with
moderate to swift currents (NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat for this species within
the proposed project areas.
Tan riffle shell is a mussel found in creeks and medium rivers, usually in headwaters, riffles,
shoals and in sand and gravel substrates (NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat for this
species in the proposed project areas.
Pink mucket is a mussel that is generally a large river species. Recently it has been found
in impoundments with river-lake conditions, but never in standing water (NatureServe
2015). There is no habitat for the pink mucket within the proposed project areas.
Muddy rocksnail is a freshwater snail found in the tail water areas of dams and large rivers.
They occur on gravel, cobble, and boulder substrate, but do not tolerate silty conditions
(NatureServe 2015). There is no habitat for the muddy rocksnail within the proposed project
areas.
An Amphipod (Stygobromus vitreus) is a subterranean obligate crustacean (NatureServe
2015). There is no habitat for this species within the proposed project areas, as there are
no caves.
Mammoth Cave crayfish occur in a narrow band of karst topography in Kentucky and
Tennessee. This species habitat is subterranean streams in cave systems (NatureServe
2015). There is no habitat for the Mammoth Cave crayfish within the proposed project
areas, as there are no caves.

3.12.1.2 Plants
A review of the TVA Regional Natural Heritage database indicated that no state-listed or
federally listed threatened or endangered plant species, or associated designated critical
habitat are known to occur on or within 5 miles of CUF (TVA Natural Heritage Database
2016). Two federally listed plant species are known to exist in the surrounding counties,
and an additional 49 species of plants listed by the TDEC as threatened, endangered, or
species in need of management in Tennessee are known to occur within Stewart,
Montgomery, and Houston counties (Table 3-16). Of these 51 species, one, the American
Ginseng was observed during a field survey of the landfill site conducted in August 2017.
Habitat requirements for each of these species, preferred habitat for each species, and the
possibility of habitat within the project areas are addressed in Table 3-16.

American ginseng is a state-listed Species of Special Concern-Commercially Exploited.
Special Concern Species means any species or subspecies of plant which is uncommon in
Tennessee, or has unique or highly specific requirements or scientific value and therefore
requires careful monitoring of its status. The plant is considered Commercially Exploited,
due to large numbers being taken from the wild and propagation or cultivation insufficient to
meet market demand.
As shown in Table 3-16, several species associated with forested areas are considered to
have potentially suitable habitat present within the proposed landfill area. However,
because the proposed onsite landfill project area consists of previously logged areas and
second growth hardwood forest that generally lack specialized habitats (rich mesic
woodlands, bluffs, rock ledges, glades, etc.) the potential for occurrence within the
proposed landfill project area is considered to be low. Notably, only one of these species
have been observed within CUF to date, and only the swamp lousewort has been observed
within 3 miles of the plant site.
3.12.2 Environmental Consequences
3.12.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would not construct a new CCR disposal site and
would continue current plant operations at CUF. Therefore, no new work would be
conducted that could potentially alter project-related environmental conditions within the
project area. Therefore, no impacts to threatened or endangered species, or species of
conservation concern or any suitable habitat would occur under this alternative.
3.12.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
The proposed dewatering facility would be constructed on a site that is heavily disturbed
and largely comprised of fill material from past and present CUF operations. The site is
unsuitable for the species listed in Table 3-16. Suitable habitat for federally listed aquatic
species does not occur within the project area; therefore, direct impacts to state-listed or

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

133

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

federally listed threatened and endangered aquatic species are would not occur with
implementation of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. Additionally, because water
discharges would continue to be routed through the permitted outfall and would meet
existing NPDES permit requirements, and because NPDES requirements are designed to
be protective of aquatic life in receiving waters, indirect impacts to listed fish and shellfish
species near CUF are not anticipated. Construction and operation of the proposed Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility would have no effect on any species of conservation concern or
their associated habitat.
No tree clearing would occur as a product of the ash impoundment closure (both in-place
and by-removal) activities. A reduction in low quality foraging habitat would occur as the
impoundments provide limited foraging for water birds such as the little blue heron.
Similarly, these areas provide limited amount of foraging habitat for bats. Therefore, this
alternative would reduce foraging area for bats. However, higher quality foraging habitat is
available for birds and bats in adjacent areas such as Wells Creek and the Cumberland
River. Because the limits of disturbance for closure activities are limited to the current
impoundment footprints, except for highly disturbed areas designated as temporary use
areas, no suitable habitat for plant or terrestrial threatened or endangered species would be
impacted. Additionally, CCR impoundment dewatering activities may temporarily increase
flow to Wells Creek and the Cumberland River. Aquatic biota may be temporarily displaced
due to increased flows, but would quickly repopulate following dewatering of the ash
impoundment. Any construction activities would adhere to permit limit requirements and
would utilize BMPs as described in the Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook to minimize indirect effects on aquatic resources during the construction phase
(TDEC 2012). Because any discharges associated with would meet existing NPDES permit
requirements, and because NPDES requirements are designed to be protective of aquatic
life in receiving waters, indirect impacts to listed fish and shellfish species near CUF are not
anticipated. CCR from the Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the CCR from the Main
Ash Impoundment would be removed and transported to an existing offsite landfill or an
existing onsite landfill. There would be no additional direct impacts to threatened or
endangered species and their associated habitats under this alternative.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, CCR from the impoundments would be transported
offsite to an existing, permitted landfill. Therefore, there would be no additional direct
impacts to threatened or endangered species and their associated habitats under this
alternative.
The area within the limits of disturbance for the proposed landfill may provide low quality
habitat for 17 of the wildlife species listed in Table 3-15, however, none of these species
are known to occur within the project area. Only the bald eagle and a northern long-eared
bat hibernacula have been observed within 3 miles of CUF. During construction and
operation of the landfill, mobile species would be able to move to the abundant similar
habitat surrounding the project area. For example, the nearby Cross Creek National Wildlife
Refuge may provide high quality habitat for some of listed species. Less mobile species
would be impacted during the construction and operation of the proposed projects.
However, no listed species are known to occur within the limits of the proposed project
areas. Therefore, the potential for direct impacts is considered very low. It is not expected
that the proposed landfill project site would provide habitat for listed species after
construction and operation are underway.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Bat mist netting studies (ESI 2011) and a site survey conducted in November 2016 have
determined that the forested area within the proposed landfill project area is of low summer
roosting quality for threatened and endangered bats, although it may be used as a foraging
area. Section 7 Consultation with USFWS is underway regarding potential impacts to the
federally listed gray bat, Indiana bat, and northern long-eared bat. Based on the absence of
hibernacula and documented roost sites potential effects to these species are limited to
alteration of foraging habitat. As such, a “not likely to adversely affect” determination is
expected from USFWS.
A total of 51 federally or state-listed plant species known to occur within the counties
surrounding CUF. However, based on the characteristics of the potentially affected
habitats, four species are considered to have habitat requirements that are overlapping with
those of the project areas. Only swamp lousewort, a state sensitive species, has been
recorded within 5 miles of CUF. In general, the forested habitats within the proposed landfill
project area are characterized as previously logged areas and second growth hardwood
forest that generally lack specialized habitats (rich mesic woodlands, bluffs, rock ledges,
glades, etc.). As such they are not known to be of high quality and the potential occurrence
of these five species is considered to be low.
The federally threatened Price’s potato-bean has been recorded in Stewart County.
Surveys for this species were conducted by a competent botanist within all project areas in
August 2017. No individuals of this species were found within the areas surveyed.
Therefore, no impacts to Price’s potato-bean would occur for any of the proposed actions.
American ginseng is one of many plant and animal species protected under the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora of 1973, an
international trade agreement which regulates harvest and export of this species. As a
result, American Ginseng is protected from over-harvesting and not due to habitat loss.
The habitat within the proposed project areas at CUF ranges from unsuitable to low quality
for state threatened and endangered plant species. No state-listed species are known to
occur within the project areas as there have been no records to date. Some of these
species may or may not be present on the proposed landfill site and seasonal field surveys
during the growing and blooming season will be conducted to evaluate the potential for
onsite presence of these plants further. If the species occur in the project areas, TVA would
avoid impacting the species if possible. Implementation of this alternative would result in the
loss of approximately 174 acres of relatively low quality forested habitat. For these reasons,
impacts to threatened and endangered species is expected to be minor under Alternative B.
The proposed actions would not impact Cumberland River or Wells Creek aquatic habitats.
Stream tributaries within the proposed landfill project area are unsuitable for occupation by
the blue sucker and as noted in Section 3.11 a 2011 mussel survey on the Cumberland
River and Wells Creek near CUF found low abundances of a small number of relatively
common mussel species. None of the listed mussel species was found proximate to the
proposed project areas. Construction activities would adhere to permit limit requirements
and would utilize BMPs to minimize indirect effects on aquatic resources during the
construction phase. Therefore, indirect impacts to federally or state-listed aquatic species
are not expected as a result of TVA actions.

3.12.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, and proposed landfill would be the same as identified under Alternative
B. The ash impoundment closure would be similar to Alternative B, however, under the
Closure-by-Removal option, CCR would be transported to the existing onsite landfill for long
term storage rather than transported offsite to the existing permitted landfill. The existing
onsite landfill is highly disturbed and provides no habitat for threatened and endangered
species, therefore there would be no additional impact.
3.12.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under this alternative, impacts associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility would be to the same as Alternatives B and C. Impacts associated with
ash impoundment closure would be the same as identified under Alternative B. However,
under this alternative, the proposed landfill would not be constructed and all future CCR
generated at CUF would be transported offsite to an existing, permitted landfill. Therefore,
because the habitat in the areas associated with the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and
ash impoundment closures are of poor quality for use by threatened and endangered
species, overall impacts under Alternative D would be minor, and less than Alternatives B
and C.
3.12.3 Summary of Impacts of Threatened and Endangered Species
The habitat within the proposed project areas at CUF ranges from unsuitable to low quality
for threatened and endangered species. No listed species are known to occur within the
project areas. A summary of impacts to threatened and endangered species is provided in

Wetlands

3.13.1 Affected Environment
The USACE regulates the discharge of fill material into waters of the United States,
including wetlands, pursuant to Section 404 of the CWA (33 USC 1344). Additionally,
EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent
possible, adverse impacts to wetlands and to preserve and enhance their natural and
beneficial values.
As defined in Section 404 of the CWA, wetlands are those areas that are inundated or
saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and
that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted
for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and
similar areas. Wetlands and wetland fringe areas can also be found along the edges of
many watercourses and impounded waters (both natural and man-made). Wetland habitat
provides valuable public benefits including flood storage, erosion control, water quality
improvement, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities.
CUF is located within the Western Highland Rim subdivision of the Interior Plateau
Ecoregion which is characterized by dissected, rolling terrain of open hills, with elevations
of 400 to 1,000 feet (Griffith et al. 2001). Natural vegetation includes mostly oak-hickory
forests with some areas of bluestem prairie and cedar glades.
Wetlands identified on National Wetland Inventory (NWI) maps within the project areas
include a total of 148 acres of freshwater ponds and lakes (including man-made
impoundments), and 2.9 acres of riverine wetland systems (streams). Wetlands were
delineated within the project areas in August 2014 and confirmed in December 2016 (Amec
Foster Wheeler 2017). Potential jurisdictional wetlands were evaluated in accordance with
the Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Eastern
Mountains and Piedmont Region (Version 2.0) The field survey identified a total 0.5 acre of
forested wetland, 4,111 linear feet of wet weather conveyances and 4,785 linear feet of
streams within the landfill disturbance area (Table 3-18).
Most of the NWI mapped wetland acreage is associated with the ash impoundments and fly
ash and gypsum stacks. However, waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or
lagoons designed to meet the requirements of the CWA are not considered to be
jurisdictional. Other non-jurisdictional wetland and open water features located within the
limits of the ash impoundments are part of the CUF treatment system, and would therefore
not be regulated as jurisdictional wetlands under Section 404 of the CWA.
Land use/land cover data shows that wetlands comprise less than 1 percent of the land use
within the CUF property and approximately 2.5 percent (2,207 acres of emergent
herbaceous and woody wetlands) of the lands within the surrounding 5-mile radius (see
Table 3-8).

As shown on Table 3-19, the field delineation identified a total of 0.5 acre of wetlands
located within the project area defined for the landfill. The wetlands are located in the far
northern end of the project area near the intersection with Old Scott Road. Also,
4,785 linear feet of streams and 4,111 linear feet of wet weather conveyances were
identified within the project area defined for the proposed landfill and haul road. These
areas are shown on Figures 3-5 and 3-7. The USACE performed a jurisdictional
determination to indicate wetlands and stream features that would require mitigation during
the Section 404 permitting process.
3.13.2 Environmental Consequences
3.13.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no change in the management of CCR
produced at CUF. As a result, no new work would be conducted that could potentially alter
project-related environmental conditions within the project area. Therefore, there would be
no impacts to wetland resources with this alternative.

138

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

3.13.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be constructed within a previously
disturbed site with no wetland resources identified. Therefore, there would be no impacts to
wetlands from activities related to this project.
Ash impoundments and manmade drainage features within the existing plant boundary are
not considered jurisdictional. Due to the location and composition of these wetlands they do
not provide the surrounding watershed with any significant wetland functions such as flood
abatement, nutrient or sediment retention, or high quality wildlife habitat. Therefore, impacts
to these wetlands would be considered minor and would be mitigated by appropriate
compensation in accordance with permit requirements.
Indirect impacts to nearby jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional wetlands outside the project
area could potentially result from the alteration of hydrologic inputs to the wetland system
resulting from closure of the impoundments. Jurisdictional wetlands adjacent to the ash
impoundments primarily receive their hydrology via diffuse surface flow and direct
precipitation. The dewatering and modification of hydrology from the CCR impoundments is
expected to have a negligible effect on these wetlands.
Under the Closure-in-Place option, CCR from the Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the
CCR from the Main Ash Impoundment would be removed and transported to an existing
offsite disposal facility or to the existing onsite landfill. As these are existing facilities, there
would be no changes to the existing environment within the landfill boundaries under this
closure option. Therefore, no wetlands would be impacted.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, the CCR in the impoundments would be excavated
and transported to an existing offsite permitted landfill. Impacts to wetland resources
associated with this alternative are analyzed based on the transport to the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill. Because this is an existing permitted landfill, there would be
no changes from the existing environment within the landfill boundaries under this closure
option. The haul route to the landfill would utilize previously constructed roads which are
already subjected to vehicular traffic and no new roads would need to be constructed.
Therefore, there would be no impact to wetlands because of transporting existing CCR to
the offsite landfill.
Construction, operation and maintenance of the proposed onsite landfill would result in a
direct loss of 0.5 acre of jurisdictional forested wetlands. However, effects of wetland and
stream impacts at the landfill site would be minor when viewed in the context of the
2,033.3 acres of forested wetland resources and a total of 2,206.9 acres of all wetland
resources (forested and emergent) within the surrounding 5-mile region. Unavoidable direct
impacts to wetlands would be mitigated as required by both state and federal agencies in
accordance with the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act and Section 404 of the CWA.
Therefore, development of the proposed landfill would be consistent with EO 11990.
Potential indirect impacts resulting from landfill construction could include erosion and
sedimentation from storm water runoff during construction into offsite or nearby jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional wetlands. BMPs in accordance with site-specific erosion control
plans would be implemented to minimize this potential. Indirect impacts to wetland areas
due to construction activities would be short-term and minor.

3.13.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR
Under this alternative, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility, in-place CCR impoundment closure, and onsite landfill
construction would be the same as identified under Alternative B. However, under
Alternative C, the Closure-by-Removal option, existing CCR from the impoundments would
be excavated and would be transported to the existing onsite landfill rather than being
transported to an offsite landfill. Since there are no jurisdictional wetland resources located
in these areas, there would be no change in the impacts associated with this alternative
beyond what was identified for Alternative B.
3.13.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future Ash
Under this alternative, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility are expected to be of the same as Alternatives B and C, and to the
same as Alternative B for the ash impoundment closure (both Closure-by-Removal and
Closure-in-Place options). However, under Alternative D, future ash would be transported to
a previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill) for long
term storage. Therefore, the onsite landfill would not be constructed, thus eliminating the
impacts identified for this action. As described for Alternative B, there would be no impact to
wetlands from the transportation of CCR material to the offsite landfill. Therefore, there
would be no impacts to wetland resources under Alternative D.
3.13.3 Summary of Wetland Impacts
Wetland impacts associated with implementation of the proposed projects are summarized
in Table 3-19. Wetland impacts would be minimal when viewed in the context of wetland
resources within the surrounding 5 miles, impacting less than 0.1 percent of wetlands within
the region. In terms of EO 11990, there is no practicable alternative that would avoid
impacting such wetlands given the operational constraints associated with the proposed
projects. Such unavoidable direct impacts to wetlands would be mitigated as required by
both state and federal agencies in accordance with Section 404 of the CWA.

Solid and Hazardous Waste

3.14.1 Affected Environment
3.14.1.1 Solid Waste
In Tennessee, requirements for management of solid wastes are focused on solid waste
processing and disposal under Rule 0400-11-.01. Solid wastes are defined in the rule as
garbage, trash, refuse, abandoned material, spent material, byproducts, scrap, ash, sludge
and all discarded material including solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material
resulting from industrial, commercial and agricultural operations, and from community
activities. Currently, the solid waste generated at CUF is managed in accordance with
federal and state requirements. The solid waste generated from the proposed activities
would be from demolition, construction, operation, and/or maintenance activities.
Under TDEC Rule 0400-11-.01-.01, special wastes include sludges, bulky wastes, pesticide
wastes, industrial wastes, combustion wastes, friable asbestos and certain hazardous
wastes exempted from RCRA Subtitle C requirements.
The primary solid wastes that result from the operation of CUF are collectively known as
CCR. The primary CCR waste streams at CUF are fly ash, bottom ash and gypsum. TVA
has historically managed storage of CCR materials generated at CUF in a combination of
onsite dry stacks, wet stacks, and impoundments.
When generating at full capacity, CUF consumes approximately an average of 5.6 million
tons of coal annually and produces approximately 1 million tons of CCR a year. The
projected average annual CCR production rates at CUF are provided in Table 3-20.

Bottom Ash

Fly ash and boiler slag are comprised of the noncombustible particles or components in
coal. Both fly ash and bottom ash are composed primarily of silica, aluminum oxide and iron
oxide. These waste streams also contain a variety of heavy metals at limited concentrations
including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury and selenium. In Tennessee,
CCR are regulated as special wastes that require special waste approval for the wastes to
be disposed of at a landfill specifically permitted to receive those types of wastes (Class I or
II disposal facility).
Demolition and construction debris would be generated during the demolition of the metal
buildings, footings, asphalt, etc. to allow for the construction of the new dewatering facilities.
The facilities would be inspected for regulated materials (asbestos, lead paint, etc.) and
would be properly abated prior to demolition. These wastes, if generated, would be
disposed as required by state and federal regulations. Remaining demolition debris would
be disposed offsite.
3.14.1.2 Hazardous Waste
Hazardous materials are regulated under a variety of federal laws including Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, Emergency Planning and Community
Right to Know Act (EPCRA), the RCRA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the Toxic Substances Control Act.
Regulations implementing the requirements of EPCRA are codified in 40 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) 355, 40 CFR 370 and 40 CFR 372. Under 40 CFR 355, facilities that
have any extremely hazardous substances present in quantities above the threshold
planning quantity are required to provide reporting information to the State Emergency
Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committees and local fire departments.
Inventory reporting to emergency response parties is required for facilities with greater than
the threshold planning quantity of any extremely hazardous substances or greater than
10,000 pounds of any OSHA regulated hazardous material. EPCRA also requires inventory
reporting for all releases and discharges of certain toxic chemicals. TVA applies these
requirements as a matter of policy.
RCRA regulations define what constitutes a hazardous waste and establishes a “cradle to
grave” system for management and disposal of hazardous wastes. Subtitle C of RCRA
includes separate, less stringent regulations for certain potential hazardous wastes. Used
oil, for example, is regulated as hazardous waste if it is disposed of, but is separately
regulated if it is recycled. Specific requirements are provided under RCRA for generators,
transporters, processors and burners of used oil that are recycled. Universal wastes are a
subset of hazardous wastes that are widely generated. Universal wastes include batteries,
lamps and high intensity lights and mercury thermostats. Universal wastes may be

142

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

managed in accordance with the RCRA requirements for hazardous wastes or by special,
less stringent provisions.
CUF is considered a small quantity generator of hazardous waste by TDEC. The primary
hazardous wastes currently generated include small quantities of waste paint, waste paint
solvents, paper insulated lead cable, mercury contaminated debris, debris from
sandblasting and scraping, paint chips, solvent rags due to cleaning electric generating
equipment, Coulomat (used to remove moisture from oil) and liquid-filled fuses.
3.14.2 Environmental Consequences
3.14.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no change to the management of CCR at CUF would
occur as long as capacity is available. In the long term, however, once capacity to manage
CCR produced at CUF is exceeded, plant operations would be impacted as there would be
no option for storage of CCR produced at CUF and therefore theoretically, the amount of
solid wastes produced at CUF would decrease. However, as CUF is one of the coal plants
that TVA plans to continue operating in the future, this alternative is not consistent with the
project purpose and need.
3.14.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.14.2.2.1 Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
Construction of the dewatering facility would entail site preparation and construction
activities that would generate typical construction debris and small volumes of solid waste
as summarized below:
•

Paper, wood, glass, and plastics would be generated from packing materials, waste
lumber, insulation, and empty nonhazardous chemical containers during project
construction.

•

Scrap metal would result from welding, cutting, framing and finishing operations,
electrical wiring, disposal of packing materials and empty nonhazardous chemical
containers.

•

A limited amount of soils would result from grading and excavation related to
foundation construction.

Construction waste and debris would be placed in roll-offs and disposed of at a permitted
offsite construction and demolition landfill. TVA would manage all solid wastes generated
from construction of the proposed facility in accordance with applicable state regulations
and following procedures outlined in TVA’s current Environmental Procedures and
applicable BMPs. Any soils generated due to grading or excavation would be managed
onsite.
A small amount of landscaping wastes would also result from grubbing and land clearing
operations. These landscaping wastes may be disposed onsite through open burning or
sent offsite for disposal. TVA would adhere to all appropriate state and county regulatory
requirements if burning of landscape waste is conducted.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

143

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Hazardous waste generated during site preparation and construction may include limited
quantities of fuels, lubricating oils, solvents, paints, adhesives, welding material, and other
hazardous materials. Appropriate spill prevention, containment, and disposal requirements
for hazardous materials would be implemented to protect construction and plant workers,
the public, and the environment. A permitted third-party waste disposal facility would be
used for ultimate disposal of the wastes.
Operation Impacts
CCR generation depends mainly on the amount and type of coal burned rather than the
methods for handling these products; therefore, CCR production rates would not change
from existing conditions due to implementation of Alternative B.
Limited quantities of used oils would be generated during operation of the proposed
dewatering facilities from vacuum pumps, liquid and slurry transfer pumps, gear boxes,
compressors and other machinery. Hydraulic oils may also be generated from components
of the dewatering facility and associated equipment. These types of used oil are currently
generated by CUF, and the increase in generation rate of these wastes is not expected to
be significant. Used oil is recycled in accordance with applicable regulations and TVA’s
procedures.
Hazardous waste streams that are likely to be generated during the operation of the
dewatering facility are maintenance-related and include adhesives, paints, paint chips,
degreasing solvents, absorbents, oily and solvent contaminated rags, sandblasting wastes,
and abrasive wastes. Only a limited increase in hazardous waste generation is expected to
occur from operation of the dewatering facility, and CUF is not expected to change
generator status from small quantity generator.
The transport, handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials would follow
federal, state and TVA requirements. Hazardous materials would be handled in limited
quantities, and there is very limited potential for significant impacts related to their handling.
Operation of the dewatering facilities would also generate limited quantities of universal
wastes (mercury-containing relays and other mercury-containing devices, batteries and
lamps). Although a limited increase in the quantities of these wastes that are generated at
CUF would occur from operation of the dewatering facilities, CUF is expected to remain a
small quantity handler of universal waste. These wastes would continue to be managed in
accordance with RCRA requirements and TVA BMPs.
Ash Impoundment Closure
As identified in the PEIS (TVA 2016b), the primary waste stream resulting from the
proposed impoundment closures (either Closure-in-Place or Closure-by-Removal) would be
solid nonhazardous waste. The primary solid nonhazardous wastes generated are
summarized below:

144

•

Construction debris consisting primarily of liner scraps, piping removed,
miscellaneous construction rubble, wastes from packing materials and empty
nonhazardous chemical containers during project construction.

•

Wastes would result from land clearing, grading and excavation operations.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

In addition to these larger nonhazardous waste streams, limited quantities of hazardous
solvents, paints and adhesives, spill absorbent, oil and solvent contaminated rags, and
empty containers would be generated.
TVA would manage all solid waste and hazardous wastes generated from construction
activities in accordance with standard procedures for spill prevention and cleanup and
waste management protocols in accordance with pertinent federal, state and local
requirements.
Under the Closure-in-Place option, a portion of the CCR in the Main Ash Impoundment
(approximately 245,700 yd3) and 180,000 yd3 of CCR from the Stilling Impoundment would
be transported to the existing onsite landfill or offsite to a permitted disposal facility. Storage
of existing CCR in the onsite facility would decrease the capacity of the landfill. This impact
would be minor; however, as future CCR generated at CUF would be disposed in the
proposed onsite landfill.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, TVA would excavate and relocate the CCR from ash
impoundments to existing offsite facilities. OSHA requirements for workers engaged in
excavation activities would be applied. Transport of CCR would be managed under the
requirements set forth under RCRA Subtitle D and in accordance with pertinent state and
local requirements and impacts to solid waste and hazardous waste generation are not
significant.
3.14.2.2.2 Onsite Landfill
Construction Impacts
Construction of an onsite landfill would require site preparation which would include
vegetation removal over the 173.7-acre site, excavation, re-compaction of subgrade over
the 81.4-acre landfill footprint, and installation of an approved liner and cover system.
The primary wastes resulting from these activities are:
•

Landscaping/vegetative waste

•

Construction waste and debris

Landscaping wastes would result from grubbing land clearing and grading necessary to
construct the landfill and support areas. Some of the wood from the forested areas
(approximately 174 acres) is harvestable but a portion of the wood, mainly stumpage, is
considered economically unusable due to difficulties and costs associated with grinding. As
discussed previously, these materials may be disposed offsite or onsite through open
burning, done in accordance with appropriate local and state regulations.
Construction waste and debris, such as paper, wood, and plastics would be generated
during landfill construction. This construction waste would be placed in roll-offs and
disposed of at a permitted offsite construction and demolition landfill.
In addition to these nonhazardous waste streams, limited quantities of hazardous solvents,
paints and adhesives, spill absorbent, oil and solvent contaminated rags and empty
containers would be generated. Additionally, there is the potential for spills or releases of
fuels, coolants, oils and hydraulic fluids from construction machinery. These waste streams
would be generated in very limited quantities. As described for dewatering facility

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

145

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

construction and impoundment closure construction activities, TVA would manage all solid
and hazardous wastes generated from construction activities in accordance with federal,
state and local requirements.
Operation Impacts
Operation of the landfill would not change the quantity of CCR wastes generated at CUF
annually. However, implementation of this alternative would result in a long-term change in
the management of CCR as all material would be stored in an onsite landfill. This would be
a positive impact as CCR management would be in accordance with TVA goals related to
long-term management of CCR.
Other solid waste streams associated with operation of the proposed landfill would be
limited in quantity. Periodic clean-out of the proposed storm water ponds would result in
soils and vegetative wastes. Clean-out of the storm water ponds is likely to occur only once
or twice over the lifespan of the proposed landfill. Each cleanout event would generate a
waste volume of approximately 30 to 50 percent of the combined capacities of the
impoundments. These wastes would be disposed of onsite or offsite at a landfill.
The largest solid waste stream that would be routinely generated from operation of the
proposed landfill is leachate sludge from the leachate storage impoundments. The
proposed design provides for leachate storage impoundments. The leachate sludge would
be periodically removed from the leachate storage impoundments and managed in the
onsite landfill.
Other solid wastes that would be generated from operation of the proposed landfill include
paper and plastics from packaging of maintenance-related materials, small quantities of oils
and fuels from spills, small quantities of paints, adhesives, etc. from maintenance. Pumps,
valves and controls associated with the leachate management system would require
replacement during operations.
Various hazardous wastes, such as used oils, hydraulic fluids and engine coolants could be
produced during landfill operations. These hazardous wastes would be managed similarly
to hazardous wastes generated during operations at the dewatering facilities.
At some point in the future, the landfill would implement closure activities following an
approved closure plan. Construction type wastes would be generated during preparation
and installation of the final cover. These solid and hazardous wastes would be similar to
those generated during impoundment closure activities. TVA would manage all waste
generated during landfill closure in accordance pertinent federal, state and local
requirements.
After the landfill is closed, post-closure care would generate vegetative debris and soils
from maintenance of drainage swales and storm water basins and sludge from the leachate
storage impoundments. Other small volume solid waste streams could be generated during
post-closure care such as lubricating oils and filters from construction equipment and
pumps associated with leachate collection system, small quantities of oils and fuels from
spills or leaks, and small quantities of paints and other wastes from maintenance. TVA
would manage these wastes in accordance with standard procedures for spill prevention
and cleanup and waste management protocols. Wastes generated by construction activities
would be managed in accordance with standard procedures for spill prevention and cleanup
and waste management protocols in accordance with pertinent federal, state and local
146

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

requirements. Hazardous waste streams generated from operation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility would be limited and would not change the status of CUF from a small
quantity generator. Therefore, impacts associated with generation of solid and hazardous
waste would be minor. However, there would be a long-term minor beneficial impact
associated with the change in management of solid wastes produced at CUF as all CCR
would be disposed in a dry manner in a new CCR landfill.
3.14.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure

Future CCR
Under this alternative, solid and hazardous waste impacts associated with construction and
operation of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, in-place closure of the ash impoundments,
and landfill construction and operation would be the same as described for Alternative B.
However, all CCR from the impoundment closures at CUF would be transported to the
existing onsite landfill under the Closure-by-Removal option. The haul route to the existing
landfill would use roads that are already subjected to vehicular traffic and no new roads
would need to be constructed and, therefore, no additional construction-related solid or
hazardous waste would be generated.
Under the Closure-by- Removal option, approximately 1.3 million yd3 of CCR in the Main
Ash Impoundment/Stilling Impoundment, and334,000 yd3 of CCR from the Bottom Ash
Impoundment maybe transported to the existing onsite landfill. Therefore, this alternative
would decrease the capacity of the existing landfill. This impact would be minor, yet greater
than the Closure-in-Place option. TVA determined that adequate capacity is available in
the existing landfill to manage the existing CCR and future CCR generated at CUF would
be disposed in the proposed onsite landfill.
3.14.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future Ash
Under this alternative, solid and hazardous waste impacts associated with construction and
operation of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be the same as Alternatives B and C
and the same as Alternative B for closure of the ash impoundments (both in-place and byremoval).
For Alternative D future CCR produced at CUF would be transported to an existing offsite
permitted landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill) and not be disposed of
onsite; therefore, solid and hazardous wastes associated with construction and operation of
the landfill would not occur.
The haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill would use roads that are
already subjected to vehicular traffic and no new roads would need to be constructed.
Operation of Alternative D would not change the quantity of CCR wastes generated
annually by CUF. However, this alternative would result in solid waste disposal that would
affect the lifespan of the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill and its long-term
ability to meet disposal needs of the region. As of this writing, the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill has approximately 70 years of capacity (Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill, personal communication, December 2016). If CCR from CUF were
stored at this landfill, its long-term capacity would be reduced.

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Relative to current generation rates, the quantity of equipment maintenance-related solid
and hazardous wastes would increase under Alternative D. These wastes include used
lubricating oil, used hydraulic fluids, coolants, oily sorbents and rags, waste fuel, batteries
and lamps. Due to the greater number of vehicles needed to transport CCR daily to an
offsite landfill, quantities of these materials generated under this alternative would be
greater than Alternatives B and C.
All waste generated due to the transport of CCR to the offsite landfill would be handled in
accordance with standard procedures for spill prevention and cleanup and waste
management protocols in accordance with pertinent federal, state and local requirements.
3.14.3 Summary of Impacts Related to Solid and Hazardous Waste
Wastes generated by construction activities would be managed in accordance with
standard procedures for spill prevention and cleanup and waste management protocols in
accordance with pertinent federal, state and local requirements. Hazardous waste streams
generated from operation of the dewatering facility would be limited and would not change
the status of CUF from a small quantity generator. Therefore, impacts associated with
generation of solid and hazardous waste would be minor. Impacts to solid and hazardous
waste associated with implementation of the proposed projects is summarized in
Table 3-21.

Visual Resources

3.15.1 Affected Environment
This assessment provides a review and classification of the visual attributes of existing
scenery, along with the anticipated attributes resulting from the proposed action. The
classification criteria used in this analysis are adapted from a scenic management system
developed by the U.S. Forest Service and integrated with planning methods used by TVA
(USFS 1995). Potential visual impacts to cultural and historic resources are not included in
this analysis as they are assessed separately in Section 3.16.
The visual landscape of an area is formed by physical, biological, and man-made features
that combine to influence both landscape identifiability and uniqueness. Scenic resources
within a landscape are evaluated based on several factors that include scenic
attractiveness, integrity and visibility. Scenic attractiveness is a measure of scenic quality
based on human perceptions of intrinsic beauty as expressed in the forms, colors, textures
and visual composition of each landscape. Scenic integrity is a measure of scenic
importance based on the degree of visual unity and wholeness of the natural landscape
character. The varied combinations of natural features and human alterations both shape
landscape character and help define their scenic importance. The subjective perceptions of
a landscape’s aesthetic quality and sense of place is dependent on where and how it is
viewed.
Scenic visibility of a landscape may be described in terms of three distance contexts:
(1) foreground, (2) middleground and (3) background. In the foreground, an area within
0.5-mile of the observer, individual details of specific objects are important and easily
distinguished. In the middleground, from 0.5 mile to 4 miles from the observer, object
characteristics are distinguishable but their details are weak and tend to merge into larger
patterns. In the distant part of the landscape, the background, details and colors of objects
are not normally discernible unless they are especially large, standing alone, or have a
substantial color contrast. In this assessment, the background is measured as 4 to 10 miles
from the observer. Visual and aesthetic impacts associated with a particular action may
occur as a result of the introduction of a feature that is not consistent with the existing
viewshed. Consequently, the character of an existing site is an important factor in
evaluating potential visual impacts.
For this analysis, the affected environment is considered to include the project areas within
the CUF facility that encompasses both permanent and temporary impact areas, as well as
the physical and natural features of the landscape. Parts of the CUF property are devoid of
vegetation and most of it has been heavily disturbed by previous industrial activities. The
most dominant visual components of the CUF facility include the older 1,000-foot high
emissions stacks and the newer 635-foot high stacks, cooling towers, and connecting
transmission lines. Other major visual components of the large-scale industrial site include
the powerhouse buildings, emission control buildings and ducts, and the coal pile and coal
handling facilities.
The proposed onsite landfill site is located on the southwestern portion of CUF property and
is currently forested and undeveloped. Topography within the proposed landfill site consists
of relatively steep ridges and valleys. The site exhibits as much as 190 feet of topographical
relief with tree-covered ridges and valleys. Portions of the site have been logged, and
previously built unpaved and gravel access roads are still present in areas. The existing site
features are shown on Figure 3-7.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

149

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

The large-scale industrial CUF facility provides a sharp visual contrast to the surrounding
rural and undeveloped landscape. Views of the CUF facility include broadly horizontal
buildings and industrial equipment. Predominant focal points include the existing
smokestack and cooling towers and the plumes they emit. Views of the plumes are heavily
influenced by seasonal variations in weather and atmospheric conditions and they are
typically more visible during the winter. Most of the area encompassed by the proposed
onsite landfill includes a naturally appearing landscape that shows little evidence of human
alteration. The composition of vegetation and the patterns of vegetation are the prominent
features and consist of a variety of deciduous trees and stream channels. Scenic
attractiveness of the area is common to minimal and scenic integrity ranges from moderate
to low.
The rating for scenic attractiveness is due to the ordinary or common visual quality. The
forms, colors and textures in the affected environment are normally seen through the
characteristic landscape. Therefore, the landscapes are not considered to have distinctive
quality. In the foreground, the scenic integrity has been lowered by human alteration such
as CUF and residential development. These alterations are less evident in the foreground
near the proposed onsite landfill. However, in the middleground and background these
alterations are not substantive enough to dominate the view of the landscape. Based on the
criteria used for this analysis, the overall scenic value class for the affected environment is
considered fair to good.
There are no sensitive viewing receptors within the foreground of the project area. The
nearest residential areas are in Cumberland City, approximately 0.2 mile from the eastern
edge of the CUF property. There are numerous residences in close proximity to the western
boundary of the CUF property (some are within 100 feet) along Scotts Chapel Road, near
the proposed onsite landfill location. The nearest church and cemetery are the United
Methodist Church and cemetery in Cumberland City, approximately 0.4 mile east of the
CUF property (Figure 3-8). Groups that have direct views of the project areas include
authorized employees, contractors and visitors to the plant site. Views of the project areas
are generally restricted to the foreground (i.e., within 0.5 mile) and include residents and
visitors of the adjacent Cumberland City. The proposed onsite landfill may be viewed by
residents and other motorists traveling along Scotts Chapel Road. In other directions,
however, views of the plant may be buffered by nearby vegetation and the local
topography. The proposed projects could also potentially be viewed by recreational boaters
and other users along the Cumberland River as well as motorists along Highways 149 and
233.
3.15.2 Environmental Consequences
The potential impacts to the visual environment from a given action are assessed by
evaluating the potential for changes in the scenic value class ratings based upon landscape
scenic attractiveness, scenic integrity and visibility. Sensitivity of viewing points available to
the public, their viewing distances and visibility of the proposed action are also considered
during the analysis. These measures help identify changes in visual character based on
commonly held perceptions of landscape beauty and the aesthetic sense of place. The
extent and magnitude of visual changes that could result from the proposed facility were
evaluated based on the process and criteria outlined in the U.S. Forest Service scenic
management system.

Natural Areas, Parks and Community Facilities Within the Vicinity of
the Proposed Project Areas

3.15.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations, and no work
would be conducted that could change the aesthetics of the CUF property.

(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.15.2.2.1 Construction Impacts
During the construction phase of the proposed projects there would be slight visual discord
from the existing conditions due to an increase in personnel and equipment in the area.
Impacts from additional vehicular traffic are expected to be insignificant as the roads are
already predominately used for industrial activity. In addition, the transport of CCR to an
offsite landfill under the Closure-by-Removal option could indirectly impact the landscape
character along the haul route. This small increase in visual discord would be temporary
and only last until all activities have been completed by TVA.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

151

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

3.15.2.2.2 Operation Impacts
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility primarily would be seen by employees and
visitors to CUF. The tallest feature of the dewatering facilities (conveyor discharge) would
be approximately 40 feet, which would be notably shorter than the existing stacks at CUF
(1,000 feet). The proposed facility components would be visually similar to other industrial
elements present in the current landscape. Therefore, the facility would generally be
absorbed by existing CUF components and would become visually subordinate to the
overall landscape character associated with the plant site.
Permanent impacts as a result of the ash impoundment closures would include minor
discernible alterations that would be viewed in the foreground of plant operations. In the
foreground, the closure of the ash impoundments and cover with natural vegetation and the
conversion of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment to a Process Water
Basins may enhance the landscape character compared to the current condition. In more
distant views, the closure of the impoundments would likely merge with the overall industrial
components of the facility. The proposed activities would have minimal public visibility and
primarily would be seen by employees and visitors to the CUF facility. Therefore, the closed
impoundments would generally be absorbed by existing CUF facility components and would
become visually subordinate to the overall landscape character associated with the plant
site.
Visual impacts associated with the Closure-by-Removal option would be similar to that
identified for Closure-in-Place. Following construction however, based upon the improved
visual characteristics of a vegetated former impoundment, the scenic attractiveness and
scenic quality of the ash impoundment areas may be expected to improve to some degree
relative to the existing condition.
The construction of the proposed onsite landfill would contrast with the color of the
landscape during some phases of operation. The current landscape at the proposed site is
predominantly green and brown as a result of the existing forested landcover on the site.
The dominant shapes in the landscape include the vertical lines of the trees and the
existing transmission structures to the north and south. The color and shape contrast would
be greatest in the foreground to residents to the west of the proposed landfill location,
although the contrasts would be less noticeable in the middleground and background. While
the CCR in the landfill would contrast with the natural landscape color, it would eventually
be covered with an earthen layer and grassy vegetation. Use of the landfill over its
estimated lifespan would result in the gradual increase in its height. Once the landfill is
closed it is expected to reach a maximum height of approximately 263 feet. While this
feature would be visible to motorists and residents along Scotts Chapel Road in the
foreground, it is not anticipated to create visual discord at the middleground and
background distances as the topography and vegetation within the surrounding area
provide some screening and allow the landscape to absorb the minor visual changes.
The Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is an existing permitted landfill; therefore,
placement disposal of existing CCR material at this location would result in no changes
from the existing environment within the landfill boundaries. The haul route to the landfill
would utilize previously constructed roads which are already subjected to vehicular traffic.
Any sensitive visual receptors along the haul route are already subjected to vehicular traffic
destined for the landfill, and no new roads would need to be constructed.

152

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

The scenic attractiveness of the areas proposed for the dewatering facility and ash
impoundment closure are already of minimal quality. Therefore, any discord resulting from
the construction activity is not anticipated to result in a change in the scenic quality.
Additionally, for the ash impoundment closures, the scenic quality of the project area may
be expected to improve to some degree relative to the existing conditions based upon the
improved visual characteristics of a vegetated closure system. Therefore, visual impacts
resulting from these activities would be minor.
The scenic attractiveness of the proposed onsite landfill location is common and the
proposed landfill would contribute to a notable change in visual integrity of the landscape.
However, it is not expected that the existing scenic class would be reduced by two or more
levels, which is the threshold of significance of impact to the visual environment. Scenic
attractiveness may be reduced to minimal in the foreground but would remain common in
the middleground and background. The forms, colors and textures of the landscape that
make up the scenic attractiveness would be affected in the foreground but would remain
minimal. Impacts to scenic integrity are anticipated to be greatest in the foreground for area
residents and other passing motorists along local roads. In the middleground and
background, impacts are not considered to be significant as they are not expected to alter
the overall landscape. Based on the criteria used for this analysis, the scenic value class for
the affected environment after the proposed landfill is constructed is considered to remain
at fair to good.
3.15.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR
Under this alternative, impacts associated with construction and operation of the Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility, in-place CCR impoundment closure, and construction and
operation of the onsite landfill would be the same as identified under Alternative B.
However, under the Closure-by-Removal option, existing CCR from the impoundments
would be transported onsite to the existing landfill rather than being transported to an offsite
landfill. Since there are no visual resource impacts associated with the current management
of CCR in the onsite landfill, the impact would be the same as that identified in
Alternative B.
3.15.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future Ash
Impacts to visual resources under this alternative, are expected to be the same as
Alternatives B and C for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and to the same as
Alternative B for the ash impoundment closure activities (both in-place and by-removal).
However, under this alternative, any future CCR generated at CUF would be transported to
the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. Therefore, the onsite landfill would not be
constructed, thus eliminating the visual impacts identified for this action.
As described for Alternative B, there would be no impact to visual resources from the
transportation of CCR material to the offsite landfill. Therefore, visual impacts resulting from
implementation of Alternative D would be negligible.

Cultural and Historic Resources

3.16.1 Affected Environment
3.16.1.1 Regulatory Framework for Cultural Resources
Cultural resources or historic properties include prehistoric and historic archaeological sites,
districts, buildings, structures, and objects as well as locations of important historic events.
Federal agencies, including TVA, are required by the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) (54 USC 300101 et seq) and by NEPA to consider the possible effects of their
undertakings on historic properties. “Undertaking” means any project, activity, or program,
and any of its elements, which has the potential to affect a historic property and is under the
direct or indirect jurisdiction of a federal agency or is licensed or assisted by a federal
agency. An agency may fulfill its statutory obligations under NEPA by following the process
outlined in the regulations implementing Section 106 of NHPA. Additional cultural resource
laws that protect historic resources include the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act
(54 USC 300101 et seq.), Archaeological Resources Protection Act (16 USC 470aa470mm), and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 USC
3001-3013).
Section 106 of the NHPA requires that federal agencies consider the potential effects of
their actions on historic properties and allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
an opportunity to comment on the action. Section 106 involves four steps: (1) initiate the
process, (2) identify historic properties, (3) assess adverse effects, and (4) resolve adverse
effects. This process is carried out in consultation with the SHPO and other interested
consulting parties, including federally recognized Indian tribes.
Cultural resources are considered historic properties if they are listed or eligible for listing in
the NRHP. The NRHP eligibility of a resource is based on the Secretary of the Interior’s
criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4), which state that significant cultural resources possess
integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, association and:
a. Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
b. Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c. Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic value; or
d. Have yielded, or may yield, information (data) important in prehistory or history.
A project may have effects on a historic property that are not adverse, if those effects do
not diminish the qualities of the property that identify it as eligible for listing on the NRHP.
However, if the agency determines (in consultation with the SHPO) that the undertaking’s
effect on a historic property within the area of potential effect (APE) would diminish any of
the qualities that make the property eligible for the NRHP, the effect is said to be adverse.
Examples of adverse effects would be ground disturbing activity in an archaeological site or
erecting structures within the viewshed of a historic building in such a way as to diminish
the structure’s integrity of feeling or setting.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

155

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

3.16.1.2 Area of Potential Effects
The APE is the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or
indirectly cause changes in the character or use of historic properties, if such properties
exist.
For Alternative B, TVA would construct the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility; close the ash
impoundments (either in-place or by-removal); and construct an onsite CCR Landfill. The
archaeological APE is defined as the project footprint and includes approximately 30 acres
for the proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, a 58-acre project area for the ash
impoundment closures, approximately 128 acres to be used for temporary use areas, and a
project area encompassing approximately 174 acres for landfill development that includes
an 81.4-acre landfill footprint (see Figure 1-1). The APE for architectural resources consists
of the half-mile viewshed surrounding the proposed dewatering facility and landfill as well
as the impoundments to be closed where the project could alter the existing viewshed of a
historic resource (e.g., constructing a new building or changing topography or vegetation).
For Alternative C, TVA impacts associated with the construction and operation of the
dewatering facility, in-place closure of the impoundments and construction of the onsite
landfill would be the same as described in Alternative B. However, under the Closure-byRemoval option, CCR from the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment and/or
the Bottom Ash impoundment would be hauled and placed in the existing onsite landfill.
The archaeological and historic architectural APE for Alternative C would be the same as
for Alternative B related to the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility dewatering facilities and
impoundments to be closed as well as the onsite landfill to be constructed.
For Alternative D, impacts associated with the construction and operation of the dewatering
facility and in-place closure of the impoundments would be the same as Alternative B.
However, no onsite landfill would be constructed and any future CCR generated at CUF
would be transported to an offsite permitted landfill. Therefore, the archaeological and
historic architectural APE for Alternative D would be the same as for Alternative B related to
the dewatering facility and impoundment closures. The offsite, permitted Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill is located on previously developed and disturbed lands. Future
CCR from CUF would be transported to the landfill along existing roadway corridors which
had previously been disturbed during their construction.
3.16.1.3 Previous Studies
TVA has conducted records searches at the Tennessee Historical Commission and the
Tennessee Division of Archaeology, located in Nashville, Tennessee, to identify previously
recorded archaeological and architectural properties listed on, or eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP within the APE. No archaeological sites or historic architectural resources have been
recorded within the plant boundary.
TVA has conducted two archaeological investigations under Section 106 of the NHPA
within the APE. Both investigations consisted of Phase I archaeological surveys and
involved systematic subsurface shovel testing at 100-foot intervals (30.5-meters) and a
visual examination of ground surfaces with greater than 50 percent surface exposure and
any terrain with a slope greater than 20 percent. The first investigation took place in the
summer of 2012 and covered a large area encompassing approximately 1,180 acres ahead
of proposed landfill activities (Barrett and Holland 2013). In that investigation, a total of 26
new archaeological sites were identified (40SW697 through 40SW722) and evaluated. Of
these, 24 were recommended as not eligible for the NRHP. Two sites, 40SW702 and
156

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

40SW710, which are prehistoric in nature, were recommended as undetermined as to their
NRHP eligibility status and further work was recommended if they were to be adversely
affected. The survey also re-evaluated one previously identified archaeological site,
40SW63, and conducted a surface reconnaissance at site 40SW219 (Brunsoni Furnace).
Investigations at 40SW63, a multi-component prehistoric open habitation, resulted in the
site being identified as undetermined as to NRHP eligibility status and further work was
recommended. Investigations at the previously NRHP listed Brunsoni Furnace (40SW219)
were limited to surface reconnaissance only. A more detailed map was created for the site
components and an extension of the NRHP boundary was recommended based on new
surface findings. Further work was also recommended at 40SW219 if deposits within the
extension area were to be adversely affected by future development. The Tennessee
SHPO concurred with the findings described above in a letter dated November 5, 2012 (see
Appendix D).
In November and December 2012, TVA contracted for an intensive archaeological survey
surrounding the NRHP listed Hollister House. The survey area for the project included the
entire 4.7-acre NRHP boundary area (Barrett and McKee 2013). The investigation included
the excavation of a full systematic 10-meter interval shovel test grid, a ground penetrating
radar and gradiometer geophysical survey of the survey area and the Hollister Cemetery,
and the excavation of 13 test units that in general measured 1-x-0.5-meter. Thus, the entire
survey area was incorporated into the NRHP listed boundary at one archaeological site
(40SW723) and this site was recommended eligible for the NRHP. The Tennessee SHPO
concurred with these findings in a letter dated May 2, 2013 (see Appendix D).
In January 2017, TVA contracted for an architectural assessment regarding the proposed
construction and operations of an onsite landfill at CUF (Mohr et al. 2017). The APE for
historic architectural resources was defined as the area within a 0.5-mile radius of the
proposed landfill site, an access road, and two borrow areas. A total of 17 resources over
50 years of age were identified and included six previously surveyed structures, as well as
eleven newly documented resources. The structures located within the APE date between
the mid-1800s and 1968 and consist of single family dwellings, agricultural outbuildings, a
church, and a bridge.
One of the previously documented resources, SW00745, was listed in the NRHP in 1988
and is collectively known as the Brunson/Hollister House and Hollister Cemetery (NRHP
88000262). TVA re-assessed the house’s current condition in May 2012 and determined
that although the house had undergone some interior alterations in the 1950s, these
alterations did not compromise the NRHP eligibility status of the house or the Hollister
Cemetery. In addition, the report recommended that the NRHP boundary be expanded to
include the Graveyard Hill Cemetery located just northeast of the Hollister House (Karpynec
2012). Three of the previously documented structures, SW00744, SW00747, and
SW00748, have been demolished since they were initially surveyed in 1981. The remaining
two previously documented structures, SW00746 and SW00801, were not evaluated for
NRHP significance when they were originally surveyed. All eleven of the newly documented
resources, as well as SW00746 and SW00801, were recommended as NRHP not eligible
due to a lack of integrity and/or the failure to meet any of the criteria for eligibility. The
Tennessee SHPO concurred with these findings in a letter dated October 24, 2012.

Pursuant to 36 C.F.R. Part 800.3(f)(2), TVA consulted with federally recognized Indian
tribes regarding historic properties within the proposed project’s APE that may be of
religious and cultural significance and are eligible for the NRHP. These tribes are listed in
Chapter 5.
3.16.2 Environmental Consequences
3.16.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Implementation of Alternative A would require no new ground disturbance activities or
changes to current operations. Therefore, no direct or indirect impacts to cultural resources
would occur under Alternative A.
3.16.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
The proposed construction footprint for the dewatering facility, ash impoundment areas, and
proposed temporary laydown and borrow areas have been thoroughly disturbed by past
construction and excavation activities. Therefore, construction would not disrupt
archaeological resources.
A 2017 architectural historic survey (Mohr et al. 2017) determined there are 17 resources
over 50 years of age within the APE for indirect impacts. One of these resources, the
Brunson/Hollister House and Hollister Cemetery, is listed on the NRHP. However, TVA has
determined that construction and operation of the proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
and impoundment closure (both in-place and by-removal) would not have an adverse visual
effect on the Hollister House. The remaining 16 resources have been determined NRHP
ineligible by TVA. Therefore, TVA determined that no indirect adverse visual impacts would
result for these properties from the construction of the dewatering facilities and ash
impoundment closure activities. The Tennessee SHPO concurred with these findings in a
letter dated June 21, 2017 (Appendix D).
As described above, one NRHP eligible historic architectural resource, the
Brunson/Hollister House and Hollister Cemetery is within the APE for indirect impacts. TVA
determined that there would be No Adverse Visual Impact to these resources from the
proposed access road and landfill due to their distance from the proposed construction
areas and the obstructed views provided by the surrounding topography and vegetation
within the APE. The Tennessee SHPO concurred with these findings in a letter dated June
21, 2017 (Appendix D).
One archaeological site eligible for the NRHP (40SW219 – Brunsoni Furnace) is located
within the APE for potential landfill limits of disturbance. The site was listed on the NRHP in
1988 under a Multiple Property Submission form entitled: Iron Industry on the Western
Highland Rim 1790s-1920s. The furnace was in operation in the early portion of the 19th
century and its remains today occupy an approximate 14-acre area. Proposed landfill
construction activities would adversely impact deposits at 40SW219. The SHPO concurred
with this determination in a letter dated June 26, 2017 (Appendix D). TVA has developed a
research design to conduct archaeological investigations at the site that will mitigate
adverse effects to deposits. TVA initiated consultation with the Tennessee SHPO for
approval of the research design and the development of a Memorandum of Agreement
regarding mitigation activities (Appendix D). Response from the Tennessee SHPO is
pending.

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

If an unidentified archaeological site is discovered during construction, TVA would cease all
construction activities in the immediate area where archaeological material is discovered.
TVA would contact the SHPO and tribes to determine what further action, if any, would be
necessary to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA.
3.16.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR
Cultural impacts would be the same as those described for Alternative B. There would be
no change in impacts to cultural resources associated with the onsite disposal of existing
CCR under the impoundment Closure-by-Removal option.
3.16.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future Ash
Cultural resource impacts under Alternative D are expected to be of the same as
Alternatives B and C for construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and the same
as Alternative B for impoundment closure (both in-place and by-removal). However, in
contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of future ash to a
previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill) for long
term storage.
Under Alternative D, no direct impacts to historic properties would occur as the onsite
landfill would not be constructed. The Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is a
permitted landfill that has previously undergone the Section 106 review process to evaluate
impacts to historic properties. Because the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is
previously permitted, no additional impact to cultural resources would occur from the
addition of CCR material from CUF to this landfill.
Indirect impacts from transporting CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
could include an increase in vibrations and noise that may affect historic resources located
adjacent to the haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. Based on a
record search, no historic resources listed on the NRHP were identified along the proposed
CCR haul route. In addition, this route would utilize existing roadways and as such if any
unrecorded cultural resources are present along the haul route they are already subjected
to vehicular traffic. Moreover, if any unrecorded cultural resources are present along the
haul route, any increase in noise and vibration due to increased truck traffic would be
intermittent and not expected to impair or adversely affect them. Therefore, Alternative D
would have no direct or indirect impacts on historic resources.

Natural Areas, Parks, and Recreation

3.17.1 Affected Environment
Natural areas include state or federally managed areas, ecologically significant sites, and
any Nationwide Rivers Inventory (NRI) streams. Parks and recreation facilities include open
areas, boat ramps, community centers, swimming pools, and other public places. The
spatial extent for the analysis of impacts is set as a 5-mile radius buffer around CUF project
area which encompasses the proposed onsite landfill, dewatering facility, and CCR
impoundment closure project areas; and a 0.5-mile radius around the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill and associated haul route (i.e., Alternatives B and D). A 5-mile
buffer is a large-enough area of consideration to give a liberal estimate of any effects from
construction activities proposed by the alternatives. Conversely, a smaller 0.5-mile buffer
for the haul route is more appropriate because of a lack of broad construction activities and
the linear nature of transporting CCR to the existing Bi-County Solid Waste Management
Landfill.
A review of the current TVA Regional Natural Heritage database, National Park Service NRI
database, and Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency database indicates multiple natural
areas (i.e., managed areas, ecologically significant sites, and an NRI stream) and parks or
recreation areas (i.e., boat ramps) in the study areas. These locations provide recreational
opportunities for local residents and tourists and are an important part of the regional
economy and for long-term conservation.
Within the 5-mile CUF study area lie portions of Lake Barkley and Lake Barkley Wildlife
Management Areas (WMAs), Cross Creeks National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Stewart State
Forest, and multiple sites around the Wells Creek Crater Structure sites (see Figure 3-8).
Lake Barkley has served as navigation, flood control, and hydropower for Kentucky and
northern Tennessee since the Barkley Dam was built on the Cumberland River in 1957
(USACE 2017). Today, Lake Barkley and its multiple WMAs including River Bend
Recreation Area (1 mile north of CUF) and Guices Creek Recreation Area (1.5 miles west
of CUF) are managed for fish and wildlife conservation and recreation. Following the
160

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

creation of Lake Barkley, the Fish and Wildlife Service established Cross Creeks NWR
(1.5 miles northwest of CUF) along the Cumberland River to provide winter habitat for
migratory birds (USFWS 2017a and 2017c). This refuge supports hunting, fishing, and bird
watching. Stewart State Forest (4.5 miles west of CUF) is 1,710 hectares of oak and
hickory forest established in 1935 used by hunters, hikers, mountain bikers, and also for
biannual military training (Tennessee Department of Agriculture 2017). Wells Creek
Structure sites are small locations that contain geologically important remnants of a
meteorite that struck the area 100 to 300 million years ago (Memphis Archaeological and
Geological Society 2006).
Boat access to the Cumberland River is abundant in the area. In total, seven boat ramps
are found within 5 miles of CUF on both sides of the river. The closest of these publicly
accessible boat ramps is located on TVA property off Old Cumberland City Road. This
location also allows shoreline fishing. No other parks or community facilities exist within the
5-mile buffer around CUF (see Figure 3-8).
The haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill follows existing
roadways through portions of Cross Creeks NWR, Stewart State Forest, the Fort Donelson
National Battlefield, the Dover Recreation Area, and Long Creek. Long Creek is listed on
the National Park Service’s NRI due to its scenic, recreational, and fishery “outstanding
remarkable values” (NPS 2017c). Fort Donelson National Battlefield, which also includes a
National Cemetery and the Dover Hotel, is an American Civil War memorial and museum.
Access to these facilities is from Highway 79, west of the town of Dover, Tennessee (NPS
2017b). Further along the haul route is Fort Campbell, an active military base bordering
SR-49 to the north. Fort Campbell, which, in addition to its stated military purpose, provides
public hunting and fishing opportunities for permitted individuals (U.S. Army MWR 2017).
Access to the Cumberland River and Lake Barkley is provided by eight public boat ramps
along the haul route. No other natural areas, parks, or recreational sites exist within a
0.5-mile buffer around the haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill.
3.17.2 Environmental Consequences
3.17.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under this alternative there would be no changes to CCR management operations at CUF;
therefore, there would be no impacts to natural areas, parks or recreation.
3.17.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
There is a publicly accessible boat ramp located on CUF property approximately 0.4-mile
northwest of the proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility Site. The ramp would not be
directly impacted by construction and operation of the dewatering facility. Users of the boat
ramp may be indirectly impacted during construction from increased construction traffic on
SR 233. This traffic increase would be short term and is unlikely to interfere with use or
enjoyment of these facilities. As such, impacts would be minor.
Additionally, operational noise may indirectly affect fishing enjoyment at the boat ramp, but
these effects would be temporary and not outside the peak noise normally encountered at
the CUF (see Section 3-19, Noise). Overall, any indirect impacts to users of the boat ramp
would be minor and temporary.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

161

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

There would be no direct impact to natural areas, parks or recreation facilities due to
Closure-in Place of the Bottom Ash Impoundment; however, similar to above, users of the
boat ramp on CUF property may be indirectly affected by increased construction traffic and
noise during closure activities. In addition, indirect impacts associated with transport of
CCR from a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment to an existing
offsite facility under the Closure-in-Place option would be less than those described below
under the Closure-by-Removal option as the volume of CCR transported would be lower.
However, overall, any indirect impacts would be temporary and minor. There would be no
indirect impact to natural areas, parks of recreation associated with the transport of CCR to
the existing onsite landfill.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, approximately 200 truck trips per day would be
needed to transport CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. The haul
route would follow existing roadways through Lake Barkley and Lake Barkley WMAs, Cross
Creeks NWR, Stewart State Forest, Long Creek Scenic River, and Fort Campbell
(Figure 2-4). In addition, the haul route would cross the primary access road to the Dover
Hotel (part of the Fort Donelson National Battlefield). There would be no change in travel
patterns or access to the facilities adjacent to the haul route; and, as noted in the
Section 3.18, Transportation, the additional traffic generated as a result of transport of
existing CCR to the offsite landfill would not impact level of service (LOS) on these
roadways. However, there may be impacts to ease of movement along SR-49 due to the
additional trucks, especially around Dover, Tennessee. These impacts are anticipated to be
minor as hauling trips would be dispersed throughout a normal workday and would fit in
with normal traffic patterns. Additionally, fugitive dust from the trucks would be reduced with
BMPs designed to minimize emissions during transport. Noise impacts due to increased
truck traffic along SR-49 are expected to be minor (see Section 3.19).
No natural areas or parks are on or adjacent to the proposed landfill at CUF (within
0.5 mile). As above, initial construction of the landfill would have an indirect impact on users
of the onsite boat ramp.
Once constructed, CCR generated at CUF would be transported to the onsite landfill via the
proposed onsite access route. Therefore, there would be no direct or indirect impact to
natural areas, parks, or recreational facilities.
3.17.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under Alternative C, impacts associated with construction and operation of the dewatering
facility, in-place closure of the CCR impoundments, and construction and operation of the
onsite landfill would be the same as Alternative B. However, under the Closure-by-Removal
option, CCR from the Impoundments would be excavated and transported to the existing
onsite landfill for long term storage. Therefore, there would be no offsite transport of
existing CCR and no indirect impact to natural areas, parks, and recreation facilities along
the haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill.

3.17.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under Alternative D, impacts associated with construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering
Facility are expected to be the same as described for Alternative B and the same as
described for Alternative B for the ash impoundment closure (both Closure-in-Place and
Closure-by-Removal).
Under this alternative, future CCR produced at CUF would be transported to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill for long term storage. Disposal of future CCR would
generate an additional 374 truck trips per day along the haul route for the life of the landfill
(currently estimated at approximately 18.8 years). As noted in Section 3.18, this additional
traffic would not impact LOS on these roadways and there would be no change in travel
patterns or access to the facilities located adjacent to the haul route. However, in contrast
to Alternative B, it is possible that there would be a long-term indirect impact to users of
these facilities due to the additional traffic, noise, and dust from the trucks transporting CCR
to the landfill. In addition, the 200 truck trips per day needed to transport existing CCR
under the Closure-by-Removal option would also occur for during the 18.8 years while
current CCR is transported to the offsite landfill. Therefore, the total number of trips along
the haul route under Alternative D is 574 truck trips per day. Consequently, the impact to
the use or enjoyment of these resources would be minor, yet greater than Alternative B,

Transportation

3.18.1 Affected Environment
CUF lies just west of Cumberland City, Tennessee on the Cumberland River. The plant is
served by highway, railway and waterway modes of transportation. The transportation
network surrounding CUF contains roads and bridges, rail lines, and navigable waterways.
Interstate Highway 24 is approximately 25 miles to the east of CUF.
Traffic generated by existing operations at CUF is composed of a mix of cars and light duty
trucks, as well as medium duty to heavy duty trucks. The proposed dewatering facility, and
Main Ash and Bottom Ash impoundments are all located on the CUF site. The north edge of
the proposed onsite landfill, which is on TVA-owned property, is one mile southwest of the
plant and is bordered on the north by Old Scott Road.
State highways provide ample access in the immediate vicinity of CUF. Principal access at
CUF is via SR 233 (Cumberland City Road), which is two lanes wide. SR 149, another twolane roadway, is approximately 1.2 mile east of CUF. The Cumberland City Ferry, which
operates just east of CUF, provides a connection for SR 46 across the Cumberland River.
To the west, SR 49 connects SR 233 to US 79 at Dover, Tennessee. US 79 crosses the
Cumberland River at Dover.

The existing LOS on the roadways in the immediate vicinity of CUF are LOS A. LOS is a
quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms
of such service measures as speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic
interruptions, and comfort and convenience. LOS is described accordingly:
•

LOS A: describes free flow traffic conditions;

•

LOS B: free flow conditions although presence of other vehicles begins to be
noticeable;

•

LOS C: increases in traffic density become noticeable but remain tolerable to the
motorist;

•

LOS D: borders on unstable traffic flow; the ability to maneuver becomes restricted;
delays are experienced;

•

LOS E: traffic operations are at capacity; travel speeds are reduced, ability to
maneuver is not possible; travel delays are expected; and

•

LOS F designates traffic flow breakdown where the traffic demand exceeds the
capacity of the roadway; traffic can be at a standstill.

3.18.2 Environmental Consequences
For the purposes of this EIS, impacts associated with the disposal of CCR at an existing
offsite permitted landfill are analyzed based on the closest landfill that can currently accept
CCR material, which is Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill approximately 37 miles
by roadway northeast of CUF on US 79.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

165

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

3.18.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under this alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations and not construct a
Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility to manage CCR produced at CUF in a dry manner. TVA
would not close the ash impoundments. Accordingly, TVA would not seek additional
disposal options for dry placement of CCR generated at CUF. Rather, CCR would continue
to be managed in the current impoundments and stacks for as long as storage capacity is
available. Therefore, no impacts to transportation and local roads are anticipated.
3.18.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.18.2.2.1 Construction Impacts
The daily workforce traffic generated by the construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering
Facility, the impoundment closures, and the construction of the landfill is expected to peak
at 260 workers. This will vary depending on the timing of the construction of the various
components of this alternative; however, the worst-case value of 260 workers per day is
used to establish an upper limit of the construction-related traffic impacts. For conservative
purposes, it is assumed that there is one worker per passenger vehicle resulting in a
construction workforce traffic count of 520 (260 inbound trips and 260 outbound trips). The
construction workforce traveling to and from the plant site would contribute to the traffic on
the local transportation network (such as SR 233 and SR 49). This workforce volume would
occur at the beginning and end of the work day. Construction-related vehicles (dozers,
backhoes, graders, loaders, etc.) would be delivered to or removed from each CCR
impoundment site on flatbed trailers under both the mobilization and demobilization stages
of the project. Overall, the traffic volume generated by the construction workforce and the
construction-related vehicles would be relatively minor and temporary. It is assumed that
these motorists would use interstate highways or major arterial roadways as much as
possible, but would use lower functioning roadways (SR 233, SR 49) to access CUF. As a
stand-alone value, this projected construction workforce traffic generates a negligible effect
on the public roads around CUF.
Two options for impoundment closures are considered under this alternative, Closure-inPlace and Closure-by-Removal. Closure-in-Place of the Bottom Ash Impoundment is not
anticipated to have an impact on transportation as there would be no transport of CCR.
However, Closure-in-Place of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment would
include removal of CCR from a portion of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling
Impoundment to support the development of a Process Water Basin1 and Process Water
Basin 2 respectively. This CCR would be transported offsite or to an existing onsite landfill
for disposal. Transport of CCR from the impoundments to the existing onsite landfill would
not have an impact on transportation. Transport of existing CCR offsite would require the
use of public roadways and would therefore potentially affect traffic and LOS on local roads.
This impact would be less than the Closure-by-Removal alternative as the volume of CCR
transported offsite would be less. It is anticipated that all borrow material would be obtained
from a location or locations within the CUF site boundary, and would not have an impact on
the public transportation network. However, if offsite borrow material is needed, it would be
hauled from one or more previously permitted commercial sites within 30 miles of CUF. As
offsite borrow would only be used if needed, it is assumed the traffic volume generated by
the hauling of borrow would be relatively low and haul trucks would use interstate highways
or major arterial roadways as much as possible, but would use lower functioning roadways
(SR 233, SR 49) to access CUF. Because the existing traffic volumes on these surrounding
166

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

roadways is relatively low, the existing roadway network is expected to have sufficient
capacity to absorb the potential temporary construction traffic increase. Therefore, potential
impacts of construction on roadway transportation are expected to be negligible.
Under Closure-by-Removal, existing ash would be excavated from the impoundments and
would be transported to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. The haul route to
the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill primarily would utilize SR 233 (also known
as Cumberland City Road), SR 49 and US 79 (see Figure 2-4).
As identified in the PEIS, TVA determined that loading operations are highly dependent on
the rate at which CCR can be safely excavated, dried and moved to truck loading facilities.
TVA considered these factors and determined the rate of truck loading to be 100 truckloads
per day. This would result in approximately 200 truck trips per day along the haul route or
approximately 23 truck trips per hour over a typical nine-hour workday throughout the
estimated closure period (approximately 12 years). The effects of these truck trips on roads
along the haul route are shown in Table 3-26.
The existing traffic volumes on Cumberland City Road and SR 49 are relatively low for
two-lane roads. Existing LOS on Cumberland City Road and SR 49 are LOS A. The LOS on
US 79, a four-lane road, is also LOS A.
Transport of CCR from the impoundments to the offsite landfill under the Closure-byRemoval option would add approximately 200 trips per day on Cumberland City Road,
SR 49 and US 79. The largest percentage increase is about 16 percent on Cumberland City
Road just east of SR 49. While this seems like a large percentage, the actual traffic volume
increase is minor. The addition of these 200 trips on Cumberland City Road, SR 79 and
US 79 would not change the existing LOS on these roads as there is sufficient capacity
remaining on them to handle the increase in traffic resulting from the hauling of existing
CCR from CUF.

The proposed hauling of CCR over public roadways would contribute to the number of
vehicle miles traveled on those roadways, which is a factor in injury and fatal traffic crash
rates. The number of truck-related crashes associated with the hauling of existing CCR

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

167

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

from CUF could increase and could compromise driver safety. Therefore, while the impacts
of the additional CCR haul traffic on these roads may be absorbed, localized effects on
traffic flow and safety may be evident. Three schools are adjacent to the haul route (Stewart
County Middle School in Dover, Stewart County High School on US 79 and North Stewart
Elementary School on US 79). The additional hauling of CCR along the haul route has the
potential to interfere with school bus and passenger car traffic at these schools. If
necessary, TVA would coordinate with Tennessee Department of Transportation and
Stewart County transportation officials as needed to develop appropriate mitigative
measures to reduce localized temporary transportation effects.
Otherwise on the remainder of the road network, which has relatively low traffic volumes,
the percentage increases in traffic resulting from the transport of existing CCR from CUF
are negligible and the impacts are expected to be minor.
3.18.2.2.2 Operation Impacts
Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
The proposed dewatering facility would be constructed onsite at CUF. Once constructed,
operation of this facility would not require an appreciable increase in workforce and,
therefore, would not have an impact on the public transportation network.
Ash Impoundment Closure
Transportation related impacts associated with the closure of the ash impoundments would
be associated with construction related impacts as described above. Once closed,
operations associated with the repurpose of the Main Ash and Stilling Impoundments to a
Process Water Basins would not require an appreciable increase in workforce and therefore
would not have an impact on the public transportation network. Therefore, there would be
no operational impacts on the public transportation network or any public roads.
3.18.2.2.3 Landfill
Under this alternative, future CCR generated at CUF would be transported to the new
onsite landfill on TVA property. Articulated dump trucks would be used to haul CCR from
the dewatering facility to the proposed landfill site along the onsite access road. Based on
the current volume of CCR production, it is estimated that 141 truckloads per day would be
needed to transport future CCR to the proposed landfill. This would result in approximately
282 truck trips per day along the onsite access road or approximately 32 trips per hour over
a typical nine-hour workday. Transport of future CCR would occur daily over the life of the
landfill (estimated to be approximately 18.8 years). The use of the onsite access road keeps
the trucking of future CCR off public roadways, which is a benefit to the safety of the
traveling public.
Under this alternative, the hauling of future CCR generated at CUF would not use public
roadways; therefore, there is no impact to traffic and levels of service on public roads.
3.18.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, CCR Impoundment Closure
(In-Place and By-Removal to Onsite Stacks), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Transportation impacts of Alternative C associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, in-place closure of the impoundments, and development of an onsite
CCR landfill would be the same as Alternative B.
For Alternative C, under Closure-by-Removal, existing CCR from the impoundments at
CUF would be transported to the existing onsite landfill. No CCR would be hauled over any
168

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

public roadways; therefore, there is no impact to traffic and levels of service on public roads
associated with Closure-by-Removal of the Impoundments.
3.18.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Transportation impacts of Alternative D are expected to be the same as Alternative B and C
for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and the same as Alternative B for impoundment
closure (both in-place and by-removal). Under this alternative no construction related
activities would be required to develop a landfill. Consequently, impacts from this alternative
related to the construction workforce and vehicles would be less than those described for
Alternatives B and C.
However, this alternative considers the transport of future CCR to a previously permitted
offsite landfill for long-term storage. Like the existing CCR in the ash impoundments, future
production CCR at CUF would also be transported to the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill (see Figure 2-4).
As described under Alternative B, Closure-by-Removal of the Bottom Ash and Main Ash
Impoundments with transport of existing CCR to an offsite landfill is expected to generate
200 truck trips per day that would occur daily for approximately 12 years. This would result
in approximately 23 truck trips per hour along the haul route over a typical nine-hour
workday. Future production CCR would also be hauled in over the road dump trucks to the
existing landfill site. Based on the estimate of CCR produced daily and the capacity of an
over the road dump truck, 187 truckloads of CCR per day would be needed to transport
CCR to the proposed landfill. This would generate 374 truck trips per day along the haul
route or approximately 42 truck trips per hour over a typical nine-hour workday. Transport of
CCR would occur daily (during a typical five-day work week) over a period of approximately
18.8 years to accommodate long-term disposal of CCR generated at this facility. The
number of truck trips per day needed to transport CCR offsite is higher than onsite transport
of CCR because this alternative utilizes public roadways which requires the use of smaller
over the road dump trucks instead of the larger articulated dump trucks. Additionally, the
estimate of number of truckloads needed to manage future CCR is not bounded in the
same manner as the hauling of existing CCR from the two impoundments as loading
operations under the Closure-by-Removal option are highly dependent on the rate at which
CCR can be safely excavated, dried and moved to truck loading facilities.
As identified above, the traffic volume generated by the construction workforce and the
construction-related vehicles would be relatively minor. It is assumed that these motorists
would use interstate highways or major arterial roadways as much as possible, but would
use lower functioning roadways (SR 233, SR 49) closer to CUF. As a stand-alone value,
this projected construction workforce traffic generates a negligible effect on the public roads
around CUF.
Therefore, the total number of truck trips along the haul route under Alternative D is 574
truck trips per day and consists of the following:
•

200 truck trips per day – hauling of existing CCR from the two ash impoundments

•

374 truck trips per day – hauling of future CCR produced at CUF

Hauling of existing and future CCR generated at CUF would add approximately 574 truck
trips per day on Cumberland City Road, SR 49 and US 79. The largest percentage increase
is about 46 percent on Cumberland City Road just east of SR 49. While this seems like a
large percentage, the actual traffic volume increase is minor because the base volume is
relatively small. The addition of these 574 truck trips on Cumberland City Road, SR 79 and
US 79 would not change the existing LOS on these roads as there is sufficient capacity
remaining on them to handle the increase in traffic resulting from the hauling of existing
CCR from CUF. However, this additional truck traffic would increase roadway deterioration.
Such deterioration would include wear and tear of the pavement, pavement rutting, and
formation of potholes and destruction of soft (grass or loose gravel) shoulders.
The proposed hauling of CCR over public roadways would contribute to the number of
vehicle miles traveled on those roadways, which is a factor in injury and fatal traffic crash
rates. The number of truck-related crashes associated with the hauling of existing and
future CCR from CUF could increase and could compromise driver safety. In addition,
roadway conditions that are characterized by sharp turns (such as SR 49) also contribute to
impacts to driver safety.
Three schools are adjacent to the haul route (Stewart County Middle School in Dover,
Stewart County High School on US 79 and North Stewart Elementary School on US 79).
The additional hauling of CCR along the haul route has the potential to interfere with school
bus and passenger car traffic at these schools. TVA would coordinate with Tennessee
Department of Transportation and Steward County transportation officials as needed to
develop appropriate mitigative measures to reduce localized temporary transportation
effects where necessary.
The percentage increases in traffic resulting from the transport of existing CCR from CUF
are minor. However, impacts to traffic flow, roadway conditions and safety may be evident
170

and would be greater than Alternative B due to the increased number of trucks and duration
of transport such that the impact would be moderate.
3.18.2.5 Summary of Impacts to Transportation
As summarized in Table 3-28, TVA has determined that all transportation impacts related to
the CCR management projects would have a minor impact on the levels of service on the
public road system near CUF. Increased traffic resulting from the hauling of future CCR to
the offsite landfill would occur each work day for approximately 18 years. The impacts to
levels of service along the haul route would be minor, but there would be an increase in the
number of vehicle miles traveled on those roadways, which is a factor in injury and fatal
traffic crash rates. The number of truck-related crashes associated with the offsite hauling
of CCR from CUF could increase and could compromise driver safety. Therefore, localized
effects on traffic safety may be evident.

Noise

3.19.1 Affected Environment
Noise is unwanted or unwelcome sound usually caused by human activity and added to the
natural acoustic setting of a locale. It is further defined as sound that disrupts normal
activities and diminishes the quality of the environment. Community response to noise is
dependent on the intensity of the sound source, its duration, the proximity of noise-sensitive
land uses, and the time of day the noise occurs. For instance, higher sensitivities to noise
would be expected during the quieter overnight periods at noise sensitive receptors such as

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

171

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

residences. Other receptors might include other developed sites where frequent human use
occurs such as churches and schools.
Sound is measured in units of decibels (dB) on a logarithmic scale. The “pitch” (high or low)
of the sound is a description of frequency, which is measured in Hertz (Hz). Most common
environmental sounds are a composite of sound energy at various frequencies. A normal
human ear can usually detect sounds that fall within the frequencies from 20 Hz to
20,000 Hz. However, humans are most sensitive to frequencies between 500 Hz to
4,000 Hz.
Sound from a source spreads out as it travels from the source, and the sound pressure
level diminishes with distance. In addition to distance attenuation, the air absorbs sound
energy; atmospheric effects (wind, temperature, precipitation) and terrain/vegetation effects
also influence sound propagation and attenuation over large distances from the source. An
individual’s sound exposure is determined by measurement of the noise that the individual
experiences over a specified time interval. A continuous source of noise is rare for long
periods and is typically not a characteristic of community noise (i.e., Community noise
refers to outdoor noise near a community). Typical background day/night noise levels for
rural areas range between 35 and 50 dB whereas higher-density residential and urban
areas background noise levels range from 43 dB to 72 dB (EPA 1974). Background noise
levels greater than 65 dBA can interfere with normal conversation, watching television,
using a telephone, listening to the radio, and sleeping.
Certain frequencies are given more “weight” during noise assessments because human
hearing is not equally sensitive to all frequencies of sound. This adjusted unit of measure is
known as the A-weighted decibel, or the dBA. The dBA scale corresponds to the sensitivity
range for human hearing. A scale weighting reflects the fact that a human ear hears poorly
in the lower octave-bands. It emphasizes the noise levels in the higher frequency bands
heard more efficiently by the ear and discounts the lower frequency bands. A noise level
change of 3 dBA or less is barely perceptible to average human hearing. However, a 5 dBA
change in noise level is clearly noticeable. A 10 dBA change is perceived as a doubling or
halving of noise loudness; whereas a 20 dBA change is considered a “dramatic change” in
loudness. Common indoor and outdoor noise levels are listed in Table 3-29.
3.19.1.1 Noise Regulations
To account for sound fluctuations, environmental noise is commonly described in terms of
the equivalent sound level, or Leq. The Leq value, expressed in dBA, is the energyaveraged, A-weighted sound level for the time period of interest. The day-night sound level
(Ldn), is the 24-hour equivalent sound level Leq, which incorporates a 10-dBA correction
penalty for the hours between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. to account for the increased annoyance
during this period and the fact that when most people are more sensitive to noise while they
are trying to sleep. The EPA (1974) guidelines recommended that Ldn not exceed 55 dBA
for outdoor residential areas. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) considers an Ldn of 65 dBA or less to be compatible with residential areas (HUD
1985). These levels are not regulatory goals but are “intentionally conservative to protect
the most sensitive portion of the American population” with “an additional margin of safety”
(EPA 1974). For traffic-related noise, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has set a
threshold of 67 dBA as the sound level at which noise abatement should be considered.
The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) has adopted this same threshold for
projects in Tennessee.

3.19.1.2 Sources of Noise
There are numerous existing sources of noise at CUF. Operations at the existing coal plant
generate varying amounts of environmental noise. Noise generating activities associated
with the existing plant include coal unloading activities, periodic dozer operations
associated with coal pile management and truck operations. Existing noise emission levels
associated with these activities typically range from 59 to 87 dBA when measured 50 feet
from the source (TVA 2014).
Noise sources common to activities evaluated in this EIS include noise from industrial
activities, transportation noise, and construction noise. Transportation noise related to
activities evaluated in the EIS primarily includes noise from highway traffic; however, there
would also be some noise related to rail and barge traffic at CUF. Three primary factors

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

173

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

influence highway noise generation; traffic volume, traffic speed, and vehicle type.
Generally, heavier traffic volumes, higher speeds, and greater numbers of trucks increase
the sound level of highway traffic noise. Other factors that affect the sound level of traffic
noise include a change in engine speed and power, such as at traffic lights, hills, and
intersecting roads, as well as pavement type. Highway traffic noise is not usually a serious
problem for people who live more than 500 feet from heavily traveled freeways or more
than 100 to 200 feet from lightly traveled roads (FHWA 2011). Due to the nature of the
decibel scale and the attenuating effects of noise with distance, a doubling of traffic volume
would result in approximately a 3 dBA increase in noise levels, which would not normally be
a perceptible noise increase. Railway noise depends primarily on the speed of the train but
variations are present depending upon the type and condition of engines, wagons, and rails
(Berglund and Lindvall 1995). The sources of noise associated with unloading of barges are
related to the conveyor system used to transfer coal from the barges. Barge operations
produce two types of noise: noises produced by a tug maneuvering the tow into and out of
the loading area; and noises associated with the arrival and departure barge tow (USACE
1975). Since the proposed projects would not increase the amount of coal delivered to
CUF, any increase in barge-related and railway noise associated with the project is
expected to be very minor and intermittent.
The level of construction noise is dependent upon the nature and duration of the project.
Construction activities for most large-scale projects would be expected to result in
increased noise levels due to operation of construction equipment onsite and the movement
of construction-related vehicles (i.e., worker trips, and material and equipment trips) on the
surrounding roadways. Noise levels associated with construction activities would increase
ambient noise levels adjacent to the construction site and along roadways used by
construction-related vehicles. Construction noise is generally temporary and intermittent in
nature as it generally occurs on weekdays during daylight hours which minimizes the
impact to receptors.
3.19.1.3 Noise Receptors
CUF is bordered by wooded ridges to the west, open pasture with a mix of trees to the
south and east, and the Cumberland River to the north. The residential areas nearest the
CUF plant are in Cumberland City, approximately 0.2 mile from the eastern edge of the
CUF property. These same residences are approximately 2,100 feet east of the coal stack.
These residences, or receptors, are currently most affected by plant noise. There are
numerous residences in proximity to the western CUF site boundary (some are within
100 feet) along Scotts Chapel Road (see Figures 1-1 and 2-3). The nearest church and
cemetery are the United Methodist Church and cemetery in Cumberland City,
approximately 0.4 mile east of the CUF coal stack.
3.19.2 Environmental Consequences
3.19.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under Alternative A, there would be no changes to CCR management operations at CUF.
Therefore, no changes in the existing noise environment would occur under this alternative.

174

3.19.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.19.2.2.1 Construction Impacts
Construction-related noise would result from the construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering
facility, the closure of the ash impoundments and the new onsite landfill. There are no
receptors within 500 feet of the proposed dewatering site and ash impoundments, therefore
there would be no direct noise impact.
There is a potential for indirect noise impacts associated with an increase in construction
related traffic associated with these activities. Noise impacts from construction-related
traffic are expected to be minor as construction-related traffic would utilize interstate
highways or major arterial roadways as much as possible and likely would not have a
noticeable increase on traffic volume and consequently traffic noise in the vicinity of those
major roadways
Under the Closure-in-Place option, CCR from the Stilling Impoundment and a portion of the
CCR from the Main Ash Impoundment would be removed and transported to the existing
onsite or offsite landfill. Transport of CCR to the onsite landfill would not have a direct
impact as there are no noise receptors within 500 feet of the landfill. The transport of CCR
to an existing offsite facility would impact sensitive receptors along the haul route.
However, the amount of CCR removed from the impoundments would be lower than what
would be removed under the Closure-by-Removal option. Therefore, the duration and
number of trucks needed to transport CCR to the offsite facility would be lower and
accordingly, noise impacts would be less than described for the Closure-in-Place option.
The transport of borrow material to the impoundments could result in indirect noise impacts.
TVA anticipates that if borrow is needed it would be obtained from existing borrow areas
and onsite project areas. The borrow areas are located south of the main plant site.
Environmental impacts associated with obtaining borrow from these sites have been
previously assessed (TVA 2017a). If additional borrow materials are needed beyond what
can be provided by onsite sources, borrow would be obtained from an offsite permitted
borrow site within 30 miles of CUF. Although the exact haul route from this potential borrow
site is not known, as noted in the PEIS (TVA 2016b) transport of borrow material may result
in an increase in intermittent noise at residences or other sensitive receptors located along
any local roads that may be utilized during the construction period. For borrow sites at
greater distances from the plant site, trucks are expected to use larger arterial roadways for
much of the travel to and from the borrow site. Noise impacts from the additional transport
of borrow along these arterial roadways is expected to be minor relative to existing baseline
traffic-related noise.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, CCR from the impoundments would be transported
offsite to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. There are over 556 noise
sensitive receptors within 500 feet of the project site, which includes the associated haul
routes between CUF and the Bi-County Solid Waste Landfill. The haul route primarily
utilizes SR 233 (also known as Cumberland City Road), SR 49 and US 79 (see Figure 2-4).
Current traffic volumes on these roadways includes truck use. Sensitive receptors (such as
churches and residences) located along the haul route in proximity to these roadways
would be impacted by the noise generated by the transport of CCR from the impoundments
to the Landfill. To determine potential impacts of traffic-related noise along this route,

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

175

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

FHWA’s Traffic Noise Model (TNM) was used to predict noise impacts to selected,
representative receptors located closest to the haul road. Based on anticipated generation
rates, it is estimated that 100 truckloads of CCR would be transported to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Landfill per day for a typical five-day work week. This would result in
approximately 200 truck trips per day along the haul route or approximately 22 truck trips
per hour over a typical nine-hour workday.
Predicted noise levels resulting from the transport of existing CCR along the haul route to
the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill are identified in Table 3-30.

Existing peak traffic noise levels along the haul route range from a low of 51.7 dBA to
56.6 dBA. Predicted noise levels from the transport of CCR from CUF increased from 3.2 to
5.4 dBA at the receptors modeled. The estimated modeled noise from hauling operations
along the haul route (which also includes the existing local traffic) does not exceed the
FHWA and TDOT criterion of 67 dBA for considering noise abatement due to traffic-related
noise. However, at most of these receptors, noise levels would increase by more than
3 dBA which means the change in noise level would be perceptible at the adjacent land
uses along the haul route. However, these impacts would be intermittent and occur during a
normal workday. Given this, the noise impacts associated with the hauling of CCR from
CUF to the Bi-County Solid Waste Landfill are expected to be minor.
Construction of the landfill would generate noise from compactors, front loaders, backhoes,
graders, trucks, and blast devices. As illustrated in Table 3-31, typical noise levels from
construction equipment are expected to be 85 dBA or less at a distance of 50 feet from the
equipment. These types of noise levels would diminish with distance from the project site
activity at a rate of approximately 6 dBA per each doubling of distance. Therefore, noise
would be expected to attenuate to the recommended HUD noise guideline of 65 dBA at
approximately 500 feet. However, this distance would be shorter in the field as objects and
topography would cause further noise attenuation. Although construction noise would
176

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

attenuate to meet the HUD guideline of 65 dBA during daytime hours, construction noise
could still remain above the EPA guideline of 55 dBA at 500 feet. However, these impacts
would be intermittent and temporary. Given the temporary and intermittent nature of
construction noise, the impact of noise generated from construction activities is expected to
be minor.

3.19.2.2.2 Operation Impacts
Primarily, operation of the dewatering facility and the proposed landfill would occur during
the day on weekdays. There are no receptors within 500 feet of the proposed dewatering
site and, therefore, operation of this facility would not have an impact.
The transition from construction-period noise to operation-period noise at the proposed
onsite landfill would be relatively indistinct since the same type of equipment would be used
to operate the landfill as would be used during construction of the landfill. The construction
of the dedicated onsite haul road would be temporary; however, the movement of dump
trucks carrying CCR over the haul road would fall into operation of the landfill and would not
be temporary. To assess the impact of noise from landfill operations, several potential noise
receptors were identified near the proposed site and analyzed for noise impacts. The
receptors closest to the proposed onsite landfill are along East Richview Road, which is
west of the proposed landfill.
Noise level impacts from construction equipment used to construct and operate the landfill
are listed in Table 3-32.

Noise levels attenuate to below 65 dBA at the receptor located nearest to the proposed
landfill site. The nearest receptor to the landfill boundary is a home on East Richview Road
(536 feet from the proposed landfill). Based on straight line noise attenuation, it is estimated
that noise levels from landfill operations would attenuate to approximately 64.4 dBA,
however, the actual noise level would probably be lower in the field, where objects and
topography would cause further noise attenuation. Noise from the operations of the landfill
would attenuate to meet the HUD guideline of 65 dBA during daytime hours. However,
operational noise could still remain above the EPA guideline of 55 dBA. However,
operational noise impacts would be intermittent and usually occur during normal working
hours. Consequently, noise impacts associated with the operation of the proposed onsite
landfill are expected to have a minor, yet noticeable impact on the receptors located on
East Richview Road.
3.19.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Noise-related impacts of Alternative C associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility, in-place closure of the impoundments and development of an onsite
CCR landfill would be the same as Alternative B.
Under the Closure-by-Removal option, existing CCR from the impoundments at CUF would
be transported to the onsite landfill. There are no receptors within 500 feet of the
impoundments or the landfill, therefore there would be no impacts.
3.19.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Noise-related impacts of Alternative D associated with implementation of the Bottom Ash
Dewatering Facility would be the same as Alternatives B and C, and the same as
Alternative B for ash impoundment closure (both in-place and by-removal).
However, under this alternative and unlike Alternative B, future CCR generated at CUF
would be transported to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill for long-term
storage. The existing CCR in the ash impoundments and the future CCR generated at CUF
would be transported to the Bi-County Solid Waste Landfill along the haul route described
above for Alternative B. As discussed above, there are over 556 noise sensitive receptors
within 500 feet of the project site, which includes the associated haul routes between CUF
and Bi-County Solid Waste Landfill. Closure-by-Removal of the Bottom Ash and Main Ash
Impoundments is expected to result in transporting 100 truckloads of CCR per day which
would generate an increase in traffic volume of 200 truck trips per day that would occur
daily for approximately 12 years. Future CCR would also be hauled in over-the-road dump
178

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

trucks to the existing landfill site. Based on the estimate of CCR produced daily and the
capacity of an over-the-road dump truck, 187 truckloads of CCR per day would be needed
to transport CCR to the proposed landfill which would generate and increase in traffic
volume of 374 truck trips per day for approximately 19 years. Together, these trips would
result in approximately 574 truck trips per day along the haul route, or approximately
65 truck trips per hour over a typical nine-hour workday during the estimated duration of
closure activities (12 years). Once closure of the ash impoundments is complete, transport
of future CCR would occur daily (during a typical five-day work week) for an additional
7 years to accommodate long-term disposal of CCR generated at this facility.
Predicted noise levels along the haul route as a result of transport of existing CCR and
future CCR to the Bi-County Solid Landfill are identified in Table 3-33.

Existing peak traffic noise levels along the haul route range from a low of 51.7 dBA to

along the haul route (which also includes the existing local traffic) does not exceed the
FHWA and TDOT criterion of 67 dBA for evaluating the need for noise abatement due to
traffic-related noise. However, at most of these receptors, noise levels would increase by
more than 3 dBA, which means the change in noise level would be perceptible to receptors
along the haul route. However, these impacts would be intermittent and occur during a
normal workday. Given this, the noise impacts associated with the hauling of CCR from
CUF to the Bi-County Solid Waste Landfill are expected to be minor. Although these
impacts are considered minor, they are greater than the noise impacts that would result
from Alternative B.
3.19.2.5 Summary of Noise Impacts
There are no sensitive receptors within 500 feet of CUF, therefore there would be no direct
noise impact associated with the proposed projects. Indirect noise impacts created by
increased traffic resulting from hauling CCR to the offsite landfill would be minor and would

and 2011-2015 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates provided by the U.S.
Census Bureau (USCB 2017a; 2017b). Employment and housing data are provided by the
2011-2015 ACS.
For socioeconomic and Environmental Justice (EJ) analyses, TVA used data from a spatial
extent and scale that provides the most accurate and up-to-date picture of socioeconomic
characteristics near the proposed actions. The spatial extent for the analysis of
socioeconomic impacts is set as a 5-mile radius buffer around CUF property which
encompasses the proposed onsite landfill, dewatering facility, and ash impoundment
closures; and a 0.5-mile radius around the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill and
associated haul route (i.e., Alternatives B and D). A 5-mile buffer adequately considers
effects from construction activities proposed by the alternatives. Conversely, a smaller
0.5-mile buffer for the haul route is more appropriate because of a lack of construction

180

activities and this would incorporate those that would potentially be impacted by the
transportation of CCR.
Socioeconomic data are assessed by block groups (i.e., the second smallest census
geography unit). This spatial scale of analysis simultaneously provides fine detail while
maintaining the greatest availability of data. Included as secondary geographic areas of
reference are Houston, Montgomery, and Stewart counties, and the state of Tennessee.
Comparisons at multiple spatial scales provides a more detailed picture of populations that
may be affected by the proposed actions including any EJ populations (e.g., minority and
low income).

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

The communities surrounding CUF and the haul route to the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill are rural and not densely populated (e.g., 65.6 people per square
mile; USCB 2017a). The nearest population centers are the rural municipalities of
Cumberland City, Erin, Dover, and Woodlawn, Tennessee. Overall, there are approximately
19,704 people living near the study boundaries, which breaks down to 10,388 people living
within 5 miles of CUF and 14,731 living within 0.5 mile of the haul route to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill (with some overlap between the two study boundaries).
In comparison to the population of the surrounding counties (207,556 people), the area
around CUF contains only 5.0 percent of the regional population and the area around the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill contains only 7.1 percent. Since 2010, the
population around CUF and the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill have
decreased by approximately 0.1 and 1.2 percent, respectively. During this same period
populations similarly decreased in Stewart and Houston Counties by 0.3 and 1.6 percent,
respectively. Conversely, populations increased in Montgomery County by 7.9 percent and
in Tennessee by 2.4 percent. Overall, population losses in the project area are small,
mostly in line with the surrounding counties, and are more indicative of the general area (as
population growth in Montgomery County is attributable to growth in unaffected Clarksville,
Tennessee).
The population around CUF and the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is
primarily comprised of white people (94.7 and 92.3 percent, respectively). The state of
Tennessee is 77.8 percent White in comparison. Correspondingly, minority populations in
the two study areas are small. Black or African American are the largest racial minority
group, comprising 3.5 and 2.6 percent of the population surrounding CUF and the BiCounty Solid Waste Management Landfill, respectively. Hispanic and Latino ethnic groups
make up a slightly higher proportion of the population around the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill (4.7 percent), which is comparable to all of Tennessee (4.9 percent).
Age demographics of the population around CUF and the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill are variable compared to the surrounding counties and the state.
Persons under the age of 18 make up 22.5 and 23.2 percent of the population around CUF
and the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill, respectively. Numbers of persons
greater than 65 years old around CUF (15.5 percent) and the Bi-County Solid Waste
Management Landfill (15.0 percent) are similar to numbers throughout Tennessee
(14.6 percent). However, more people 65 years and older are found in Houston
(18.9 percent) and Stewart (18.6 percent) Counties and fewer are found in Montgomery
County (8.4 percent). Overall, the study areas contain approximately 10 percent fewer
children than Tennessee overall and approximately 4 percent fewer retirees than the
surrounding region, which implies that no vulnerable age groups are concentrated within
the proposed study boundaries.
3.20.1.2 Economic Conditions
Economic characteristics (housing, income, and employment rates) are shown in
Tables 3-36 and 3-37.
Housing and income characteristics of the study areas are similar to comparison
geographies (see Table 3-37). For example, neighborhoods surrounding CUF and the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill comprise only 5.3 and 8.0 percent of the total
housing units found in the three surrounding counties. These numbers parallel population
figures at the same scale (see above). Median household incomes for neighborhoods
around CUF ($43,773) and the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill ($46,444) are
182

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

comparable to Tennessee ($45,219). Additionally, persons living below the poverty line
around CUF (17.7 percent) and the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
(15.9 percent) are at or below the state average of 17.6 percent. Conversely, Houston and
Stewart Counties have higher poverty rates (23.1 and 19.5 percent, respectively) than the
populations found in the study boundaries.
The top three industries for civilian employment in Houston, Montgomery, and Stewart
counties are: (1) educational, health care, and social services at 23.2 percent, (2) retail
trade at 13.1 percent, and (3) manufacturing at 11.8 percent. In Houston County,
construction (10.5 percent) also employs a larger percentage of the civilian population than
other occupations (USCB 2017a). Median household incomes for neighborhoods around
CUF ($43,773) and the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill ($46,444) are
comparable to the state (median income of $45,219; Table 3-37).
Employment rates in the study areas and references geographies are similar (Table 3-36).
The total employed civilians in the communities surrounding CUF and the haul route to the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is 3,880 and 5,673, respectively. The civilian
unemployment rate around CUF is 11.2 percent. This rate is 2.8 percent higher than the
state average (8.4 percent), but similar to Stewart County (10.1 percent). Additionally,
unemployment for the total employable population around CUF is 5.9 percent or only
0.8 percent above the state rate of 5.1 percent. Civilian unemployment around the haul
route and Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is 9.1 percent, which is slightly
higher than the state unemployment rate (8.4 percent), but below the average
unemployment for the three-county area (9.7 percent).

3.20.1.3 Community Facilities and Services
Community facilities and services are public or publicly-funded facilities such as police
protection, fire protection, schools, hospitals and other health care facilities, libraries, daycare centers, churches, and community centers. Direct impacts to community facilities
occur when a community facility is displaced or access to the facility is altered. Indirect

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

183

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

impacts can also occur when a proposed project results in a population increase that would
generate greater demands for services and affect the delivery of such services. When
applicable, the study area for the evaluation of impacts to community services is the service
area of various providers, otherwise a secondary study area defined for the purposes of a
socioeconomic analysis may be defined. In this case, the study areas for community
impacts are the same as socioeconomic analyses described above.
Community services available to the communities surrounding CUF and the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill include fire and emergency services, law enforcement,
churches, cemeteries, and schools (see Figure 3-8). Specifically, there are eleven
churches, six cemeteries, three government offices (i.e., one post office and two
wastewater treatment buildings), two schools, one fire department, and one police
department located within a 5-mile radius of CUF. In addition, there are numerous
community facilities including churches, schools, emergency services, and a sheriff’s office
within the 0.5-mile radius of the 37-mile haul route. Many of these facilities are concentrated
in and around Dover, Tennessee.
3.20.1.4 Environmental Justice
On February 11, 1994, President Clinton signed EO 12898 Federal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. EO 12898
mandates some federal-executive agencies to consider EJ as part of the NEPA. EJ has
been defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of
race, color, national origin, or income (EPA 2016b) and ensures that minority and low
income populations do not bear disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects from federal programs, policies, and activities. Although TVA is not
one of the agencies subject to this order, TVA routinely considers EJ impacts as part of the
project decision-making process.
Guidance for addressing EJ is provided by the CEQ’s Environmental Justice Guidance
under the National Environmental Policy Act (CEQ 1997). The CEQ defines minority as any
race and ethnicity, as classified by the USCB, as: Black or African American; American
Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander; some other
race (not mentioned above); two or more races; or a race whose ethnicity is Hispanic or
Latino (CEQ 1997). Low income populations are based on annual-statistical poverty
thresholds also defined by the USCB.
Identification of minority populations requires analysis of individual race and ethnicity
classifications as well as comparisons of all minority populations in the region. Minority
populations exist if either of the following conditions is met:
•

The minority population of the impacted area exceeds 50 percent of the total
population.

•

The ratio of minority population is meaningfully greater (i.e., greater than or equal to
20 percent) than the minority population percentage in the general population or
other appropriate unit of geographic analysis (CEQ 1997).

Low-income populations are those with incomes that are less than the poverty level, which
varies by the size of family and number of related children under 18 years (CEQ 1997). The
2015 USCB Poverty Thresholds states the poverty threshold as an annual household
income of $24,257 for a family of four (USCB 2017c). For an individual, an annual income
184

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

of $12,082 is the poverty threshold. A low-income population exists if either of the following
two conditions is met:
•

The low-income population exceeds 50 percent of the total number of households.

•

The ratio of low income population significantly exceeds (i.e., greater than or equal
to 20 percent) the appropriate geographic area of analysis.

For this assessment, three geographic areas of analysis (i.e., census block group, county,
and state) were used to determine potential EJ populations. Potentially affected
communities were defined as any census block group that intersected the 5-mile radius
study boundary around CUF or the 0.5-mile radius boundary around the haul route to the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill). Demographic data by block group were then
compared to county and state-wide data.
Total minority population (i.e., all non-white racial groups and Hispanic or Latino, combined)
comprise 27.1 percent of the population of the state of Tennessee. Of the three counties
considered, Montgomery has the highest percentage minority population (37.6 percent),
followed by Stewart (8.9 percent), and Houston (7.7 percent).
Minorities comprise between 2.9 to 16.3 percent of the population of block groups
intersecting the study area around CUF (average of 6.9 percent). None of these block
groups exceed EJ thresholds when compared to reference geographies. Conversely,
minorities range from 0 to 63.3 percent of the population surrounding the study area
corresponding to the transport of CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
(average of 12.4 percent); however, only one block group (Block Group 1, Census Tract
9801) located along the haul route in Montgomery County is considered a sensitive
population subject to EJ consideration. This block group is located within the Fort Campbell
U.S. Army Installation.
The poverty rate in Tennessee is 17.6 percent. Of the three counties considered, Houston
has the highest poverty rate (23.1 percent), followed by Stewart (19.5 percent), and
Montgomery (15.8 percent). The average poverty rate of the populations around CUF is
17.7 percent and ranges from 5.3 to 29.9 percent between block groups. None of these
block groups exceed the EJ threshold when compared to reference geographies. The
average poverty rate around the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is15.9
percent and ranges from 0 to 34.9 percent among the block groups studied. None of these
block groups exceeds thresholds for EJ populations.
3.20.2 Environmental Consequences
3.20.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no new plant operations and no new construction would be
undertaken that could affect local demographics, economic conditions, community services,
or EJ populations.
3.20.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under Alternative B, demographic characteristics of the project area are not expected to
change significantly in response to an increase in temporary construction workforce. The
peak construction workforce is estimated to peak at 260 workers for all phases of the

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

185

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

project (i.e., construction of dewatering facilities and the proposed landfill and closure of the
ash impoundment). These workers could be drawn from the labor force that currently
resides in the study area. No additional permanent workers would be employed for
long-term operation of the landfill or dewatering facility. Additionally, the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill is already constructed, so no new workforce would be needed
at that location. Overall, no long-term impacts to local demographics are expected due to
the small and temporary increase in workers related to the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
construction, landfill construction, or ash impoundment closure.
Potential economic impacts associated with the proposed projects relate to direct and
indirect effects of construction as well as the long-term operation of the facilities.
Construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and proposed landfill and closure of the
ash impoundments would cause a temporary increase in employment and associated
payrolls, the purchases of materials and supplies, and procurement of additional services.
New construction workers and truck drivers are expected to be residents, which would help
temporarily reduce unemployment around CUF. Revenue generated from sales tax from
any additional purchases would also benefit the local economy. Capital costs associated
with the proposed action would have direct economic benefits to the local area and
surrounding community. Some beneficial secondary impacts to the economy are also
expected in conjunction with the multiplier effects of construction. For example, local food
and service industries would benefit from the demands brought by the increased
construction workforce. However, given the size of the anticipated workforce (peak of up to
260 workers) and the temporary nature of the work, overall primary and secondary
economic impacts are considered minor.
Community facilities would not be directly affected by the construction and operation of the
Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, in-place impoundment closures, or the construction and
operation of the landfill. However, under the offsite transport of CCR associated with both
the Closure-in-Place and the Closure-by-Removal options there may be some impacts to
ease of movement to and from community facilities along the proposed haul route due to
the addition of trucks transporting CCR, especially around Dover, Tennessee (see
Figure 3-8). Access to these facilities would not be impacted and as noted in Section 3.17,
transportation-related impacts are anticipated to be minor, yet greater under the Closureby-Removal option, given the larger volume of CCR transported offsite under that closure
option. No significant worker relocations to the area are anticipated; therefore, community
services including fire, police, medical, and schools can likely accommodate the local
population and would not be affected by the action.
There would be no impacts to EJ communities under Alternative B. No EJ populations were
identified near CUF and only a single EJ group was identified along the haul route at the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. However, this block group is part of the Fort
Campbell U.S. Army Installation and there are no civilian buildings or occupied barracks
within the haul route boundary. Additionally, any long-term indirect impacts to this
community due to the additional traffic, noise, and dust from the trucks transporting CCR to
the landfill would not disproportionately affect this community and would be consistent
across all communities (i.e., EJ and non-EJ) along the haul route. Therefore, there would
be no disproportionate effects to minority or low income populations under this alternative.

186

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

3.20.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Under Alternative C, socioeconomic impacts associated with construction of the Bottom
Ash Dewatering Facility, in-place closure of the ash impoundments, and construction and
operation of the proposed landfill would be the same as identified under Alternative B.
Potential economic impacts associated with the impoundment Closure-by-Removal option
would be similar those described for Alternative B. However, additional workers may be
hired to accommodate the increased rate of transport that can be achieved with the use of
the onsite landfill. However, this increase would be somewhat offset as the duration of
closure would be much shorter than Closure-by-Removal to the existing Bi-County Landfill.
All major construction costs would remain the same and all direct and indirect beneficial
economic impacts from construction would be realized. However, given the size and the
temporary nature of the anticipated new workforce, economic impacts are considered to be
low.
Community facilities would not be affected by the construction and operation of the
proposed landfill, dewatering facilities, and impoundment closures either directly or
indirectly. All construction and hauling of CCR would be contained to TVA property.
There would be no impacts to EJ communities under Alternative C as no EJ populations
were identified near CUF.
3.20.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Under Alternative D, socioeconomic impacts associated with construction and operation of
the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would be the same as Alternative B and C and to the
same as Alterative B for ash impoundment closure (both in-place and by removal).
However, under this alternative, future CCR generated at CUF would be transported to the
offsite landfill (the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill) for long term storage.
Potential economic impacts associated with the proposed projects relate to direct and
indirect effects of construction as well as the long-term operation of the facilities and hauling
of future CCR for disposal. The positive economic impacts from construction would be
slightly reduced with the exclusion of the new landfill. Transport of CCR generated at CUF
to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is expected to be carried out by local
contractors so the realized positive impact would be minor. Small beneficial secondary
impacts to the economy are expected in conjunction with the multiplier effects of
construction, but are expected to be negligible for long-term hauling of CCR to the
Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill. Overall, short-term and long-term economic
impacts to the regional economy are considered minor.
Community facilities would not be directly affected by the construction and operation of a
landfill, dewatering facilities, or in place impoundment closure, but may be indirectly
affected by hauling of CCR to the existing Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill.
Effects of long-term hauling of CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill are
similar to Alternative B, where there may be some impacts to ease of movement from
community facilities along the proposed haul route. These impacts would be extended for
over approximately 19 years, but would be dispersed throughout a normal workday to fit in

187

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

with normal traffic patterns and would not change LOS along the roadways. Long-term
effects of increased truck traffic to facility accessibility along the haul route are considered
minor.
Similar to other alternatives, there would be no impacts to EJ communities under
Alternative D.

Public Health and Safety

Workplace health and safety regulations are designed to eliminate personal injuries and
illnesses from occurring in the workplace. These laws may comprise both federal and state
statutes. OSHA is the main statute protecting the health and safety of workers in the
workplaces. The Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development has
adopted federal OSHA standards.
TVA’s Safety Standard Programs and Processes would be strictly adhered to during the
proposed actions. The safety programs and processes are designed to identify actions
required for the control of hazards in all activities, operations and programs. It also
establishes responsibilities for implementing OSHA and state requirements.
3.21.1 Affected Environment
The routine operations and maintenance activities at CUF reflect a safety-conscious culture
and activities are performed consistent with OSHA and TCA standards and requirements
and specific TVA guidance. Personnel at CUF are conscientious about health and safety
having addressed and managed operations to reduce or eliminate occupational hazards
through implementation of safety practices, training and control measures.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

189

CUF has safety programs and BMPs in place to minimize the potential of safety incidences.
These would include but are not limited to such programs as the following:
•
•

Operations and Maintenance Plans
Hazard Communication

•

Housekeeping

•

Contractor Evaluation and Acceptance

•

•

Compliance Audits

It is TVA’s policy that contractors have a site-specific health and safety plan in place prior to
conducting construction activities at TVA properties. The contractor site-specific health and
safety plans address the hazards and controls as well as contractor coordination for various
construction tasks. A health and safety plan would also be required for workers responsible
for operations after construction is complete.
The potential offsite consequences and emergency response plan are discussed with local
emergency management agencies. These programs are audited by TVA no less than once
every three years and by EPA periodically.
Health hazards are also associated with emissions and discharges from the facility as well
as accidental spills/releases at the plant and/or along the pipelines. Mitigative measures are
used to ensure protection of human health which includes the workplace, public and the
environment. Applicable regulations and attending administrative codes that prescribe
190

monitoring requirements may include those associated with emergency management,
environmental health, drinking water, water and sewage, pollution discharge, air pollution,
hazardous waste management and remedial action.
Additionally, wastes generated by operation of the plant can pose a health hazard. Wastes
including solid wastes, hazardous waste, liquid wastes, discharges and air emissions are
managed in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and all
applicable permit requirements. TVA is committed to complying with all applicable
regulations, permitting and monitoring requirements. Furthermore, waste reduction
practices are employed including recycling and waste minimization.
3.21.2 Environmental Consequences
3.21.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
The operations and maintenance activities at CUF would continue within the safetyconscious culture and activities currently performed in accordance with applicable
standards or specific TVA guidance. TVA would continue to address and manage reduction
or elimination of occupational hazards through implementation of safety practices, training
and control measures. TVA’s safety conscious efforts would continue such that no changes
to current public and health and safety are anticipated under this alternative. Therefore,
Alternative A would not have an impact on public health and safety.
3.21.2.2 Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
3.21.2.2.1 Construction Impacts
During construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and onsite landfill, customary
industrial safety standards as well as the establishment of applicable BMPs and job site
safety plans would describe how job safety would be maintained. These BMPs and site
safety plans address the implementation of procedures to ensure that equipment guards,
housekeeping, and personal protective equipment are in place; the establishment of
programs and procedures for lockout (to ensure machinery or equipment is stopped,
isolated from all potentially hazardous energy sources and locked out before employees
perform any servicing or maintenance) , right-to-know (correct labelling of materials),
hearing conservation, equipment operations, excavations, grading, and other activities; the
performance of employee safety orientations and regular safety inspections; and the
development of a plan of action for the correction of any identified hazard. Construction
debris and wastes would be managed in accordance with federal, state, and local
requirements. Construction activities in support of the proposed projects would be
performed consistent with standards as established by OSHA and TCA requirements.
Worker and public health and safety during construction including material transportation
would be maintained, and impacts to public health and safety would be minor.
Activities associated with Closure-in-Place of the impoundments would include dewatering,
equipment removal, grading, compaction and stabilization of CCR, and transport and
installation of an approved closure system geomembrane cap. The equipment required for
the impoundment closures includes dozers, compactors, dump trucks, scrapers/pans, track
hoes and diesel pumps. Customary industrial safety standards as well as the establishment
of applicable BMPs and job site safety plans similar to what was described for the
construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility would describe how job safety would be
maintained.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

191

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Under the Closure-in-Place of the Main Ash Impoundment and Stilling Impoundment CCR
would be excavated from the impoundments and transported to an existing onsite or
existing offsite permitted landfill. The equipment required for the impoundment excavation
and closures includes dozers, compactors, dump trucks, scrapers/pans, track hoes and
diesel pumps. Work including the excavation, loading and transport of the CCR would
follow customary industrial safety standards as well as the establishment of applicable
BMPs and job site safety plans to describe how job safety would be maintained. These
same standards would be followed under the Closure-by-Removal options for all
impoundments.
Closure activities including material transport in support of the proposed closure activities
would be performed consistent with standards as established by OSHA and TCA
requirements. Worker and public health and safety during project activities and material
transportation would be maintained. However, as identified in the PEIS (TVA 2016b) offsite
transport of CCR results in a higher risk to workforce health and safety as well as increased
risk related to offsite transportation of CCR (crashes, derailments, road damage and other
transportation-related effects). The risk is greater under the Closure-by-Removal option
given the increased volume of CCR and associated increase in truck trips needed to
transport CCR relative to the Closure-in-Place option.
3.21.2.2.2 Operation Impacts
Activities associated with operation of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility and maintenance
of the closed impoundments (e.g., maintaining vegetation, monitoring, and reporting as
necessary), would adhere to established health and safety practices. These practices would
address and provide management procedures for the reduction or elimination of
occupational and public health hazards.
Operation of the proposed landfill would require the use of earthmoving and compacting
equipment as well as trucks for hauling materials. CCR generated at CUF would be
transported by truck via onsite roads to the proposed onsite landfill. Onsite traffic would
increase but not impact the local roadways and public traffic.
The operation of the proposed onsite landfill would comply with TVA guidance and be
consistent with standards established by OSHA. Health and safety practices would be
developed and implemented to address and manage the reduction or elimination of
occupational and public health hazards through worker training and adherence to safety
practices and control measures. There would be no increase in the use of public roads
associated with the offsite transport of CCR which would reduce the possibility of traffic
incidents and as such, lessen the potential for impacts to public health and safety.
All facility wastes would be managed in accordance with applicable federal, state and local
laws and regulations and all applicable permit requirements. No hazardous materials that
might affect human safety are expected to be utilized. Implementation of operational safety
measures would manage and address monitoring and control; maintenance and integrity
programs; performance of field surveys and inspections; right-of-way maintenance; and
public awareness. Therefore, worker and public health and safety during operation
including material transportation would be maintained and impacts would be minor.

3.21.2.3 Alternative C – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Existing Onsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for
Future CCR Produced at CUF
Alternative C would have similar impacts to worker and public health and safety as
Alternative B regarding the implementation of the dewatering facility, in-place impoundment
closure, and the onsite landfill for future CCR.
However, under the Closure-by-Removal option, CCR removed from the impoundments
would be transported onsite to the existing landfill which is permitted to receive the material.
TVA has determined that onsite transport of CCR could be accomplished with larger trucks
and the shortened transport distance would allow for a greater number of truck trips per
normal working shift. Worker safety during material transportation would be maintained
through TVA’s standard traffic management measures employed at all of TVA plant sites.
There would be no increase in the use of public roads that is associated with the offsite
transport of CCR. This would reduce the possibility of traffic incidents and as such, the
impact to public health and safety would be decreased. However, as identified in the PEIS,
excavation activities have a greater risk of injury or fatality. Customary industrial safety
standards including OSHA requirements for workers engaged in excavation activities would
help reduce these risks.
Therefore, impacts to worker and public health and safety associated with this alternative,
would be minor, and as offsite transport of CCR would not occur, impacts associated with
the Closure-by-Removal option would be less than those described under Alternative B for
this closure option.
3.21.2.4 Alternative D – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Offsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Alternative D would have similar impacts to worker and public health and safety as
Alternatives B and C for the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, and to the same as
Alternative B for the ash impoundment closure activities.
However, under Alternative D, an onsite landfill would not be constructed and future CCR
generated at CUF would be transported by truck on existing roadways to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill for long-term disposal. Alternative D would increase the
traffic on existing roadways associated with the offsite transport of CCR which would
potentially increase the risk of injuries and fatalities associated with traffic incidents.
Implementation of Alternative D would require the use additional trucks to transport CCR.
TVA would establish health and safety practices that would address and manage the
reduction or elimination of occupational and public health hazards associated with the
offsite hauling activities through implementation of safe operation practices, training and
control measures.
All wastes generated by use of additional trucks would be managed in accordance with
applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and all applicable permit
requirements. TVA may decide to contract with outside vendors for these transportation
services under Alternative D. TVA policy requires that contractors have in place a sitespecific health and safety plan prior to operation on TVA properties. The contractor sitespecific health and safety plan addresses the hazards and controls; spill and emergency
response; as well as contractor coordination for operations.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

Therefore, worker and public health and safety regarding offsite disposal of CCR in an
existing permitted landfill would be maintained, and there would be minor impact to public
health and safety. However, given the number of additional trucks estimated to be on the
roadway, this impact would be greater than that under Alternatives B and C.

3.22

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts

Unavoidable adverse impacts are the effects of the proposed action on natural and human
resources that would remain after mitigation measures or BMPs have been applied.
Mitigation measures and BMPs are typically implemented to reduce a potential impact to a
level that would be below the threshold of significance as defined by the CEQ and the
courts. Impacts associated with the management of CCR from CUF have the potential to
cause unavoidable adverse effects to several environmental resources.
The closure of impoundments at CUF has the potential to cause unavoidable adverse
effects to existing open water habitats located within the ash impoundments. However, this
impact is considered minor as these areas are elements of a man-made permitted
treatment system which do not provide high quality habitat. In addition, temporary impacts
to water quality from runoff at the site and wastewater discharge during dewatering could
impact nearby receiving water bodies during initial construction activities. BMPs to minimize
runoff would be implemented, and water released by construction activities would meet
established TDEC permit limits.
Under Alternatives B and C, the construction of a new onsite landfill would be on lands
currently undeveloped and covered with forested vegetation. Clearing and grading of the
site would result in long-term impacts to species composition and wildlife habitat. However,
due to the abundant habitat of similar quality within a 5-mile radius of CUF, the overall
impact to vegetation and wildlife is considered moderate. Adverse impacts would also occur
to a small wetland area, one perennial stream, one intermittent stream, and four ephemeral
streams located within the proposed onsite landfill. This impact would be mitigated through
adherence to permit requirements. Operation of the landfill would impact to Wells Creek
and or Scott Branch from leachate and storm water discharges. However, this impact would
be mitigated by adherence to permit requirements.
Other impacts associated with Alternatives B and C primarily would be related to impacts
that occur during construction activities. Activities associated with the use of construction
equipment may result in varying amounts of dust, air emissions, noise, and vibration that
may potentially impact onsite workers. Potential noise impacts also include traffic noise
associated with the construction workforce traveling to and from the site. Emissions from
construction activities and equipment are minimized through implementation of mitigation
measures, including proper maintenance of construction equipment and vehicles. During
operation of the dewatering facility, onsite handling and transportation of CCR to the CCR
landfill may generate minor amounts of fugitive dust.
Under Alternatives B and D, the transport of CCR material from CUF to the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill would increase truck traffic volumes on public roads which
could compromise public safety. This additional operations-related traffic would also
increase noise and fugitive dust in areas in proximity to these roads. Emissions from the
haul trucks are minimized through implementation of BMPs including proper vehicle
maintenance.

3.23

Relationship of Short-Term Uses to Long-Term Productivity

NEPA requires a discussion of the relationship between short-term uses of the environment
and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity. This EIS focuses on the
analyses of environmental impacts associated with the various projects proposed to support
management of CCR produced at CUF. For the purposes of this section, these activities
are considered short-term uses of the environment and the long term is considered to be

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

195

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

initiated upon the cessation of management and storage of CCR at CUF. This section
includes an evaluation of the extent that the short-term uses preclude any options for future
long-term use of the project site.
Construction activities would have a negative effect on a limited amount of short-term uses
of the environment such as air, noise, and transportation resources as described above. In
addition, construction activities such as site preparation and noise may displace some
wildlife during the construction period. Most environmental impacts during construction
activities would be relatively short term and would be addressed by BMPs and mitigation
measures. Construction activities would have a limited, yet favorable short-term impact to
the local economy through the creation of construction and support jobs and revenue.
The proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering facility would be constructed in an area that has
been previously disturbed and supports industrial uses. Because CUF is dedicated to
power production, no loss of productivity of other natural resources is anticipated. In the
long term, upon cessation of operations at CUF and after decommissioning, the lands could
be reused and made available for other uses. Safety and security requirements as well as
post-closure monitoring of the impoundments and landfill could impact future use of these
areas. However, since these facilities are located on land presently dedicated for industrial
uses, future land use would be limited to those uses that are compatible with industrial
uses, until the CUF facilities are decommissioned.
Ash impoundment closure at CUF would have a beneficial effect on long-term productivity
through the reduction or elimination of potential subsurface discharges of leachate to
groundwater. Although there is adequate capacity to store CCR in the existing onsite
landfill, at some point in the future capacity to store CCR onsite would become a limiting
factor for CUF operations. Therefore, the development of the CCR Rule-compliant landfill
would have a favorable short-term impact on productivity resulting from the operations at
CUF in that the proposed landfill would meet the need for long-term storage of CCR so that
CUF operations would not need to be curtailed.
If needed, the purchase of borrow material would have a short-term impact on the
availability of this resource for other uses, however this impact is minimized as it is
anticipated that borrow material primarily would be obtained from borrow areas on CUF
property.
Use of the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill would impact capacity and,
therefore, have an impact on the users of the landfill. However, there are other landfills
within the region that may be utilized for disposal of waste materials.

3.24

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources

This section describes the expected irreversible and irretrievable environmental resource
commitments used in the construction and operation of the proposed CCR management
activities. An irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources refers to impacts on or
losses to resources that cannot be recovered or reversed. The term irreversible
commitments of resources describe environmental resources that are potentially changed
by the construction or operation of the proposed projects that could not be restored to their
prior state by practical means at some later time. Irretrievable commitments of resources
include materials that are used for the new facility in such a way that they could not be
recycled or restored for a period of time. The opportunity to use a resource is foregone
while it is committed to other uses. For example, the construction of a road through a forest
196

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

would be an irretrievable commitment of the productivity of timber within the road right of
way as long as the road remains. Mining of ore is an irreversible commitment of a resource;
once the ore is removed and used, it cannot be restored.
The land used for the proposed dewatering facility is not irreversibly committed because
once operations at CUF cease, the land supporting the facilities could be returned to other
industrial uses. Nonrenewable fossil fuels and some process materials such as thickening
agents would be irretrievably lost through the construction and operation of the dewatering
facility. In addition, the materials used for the construction of the facility would be committed
for the life of the facility. While some of these building materials may be irreversibly
committed, some metal components and structures could be recycled. The limited use of
building materials for use in this project would not adversely affect the future availability of
these resources.
Resources required by construction activities, including labor, fossil fuels and construction
materials, would be irretrievably lost. Nonrenewable fossil fuels would be irretrievably lost
through the use of gasoline and diesel-powered equipment during construction. In addition,
construction materials (such as liners and cover systems) would be consumed. However, it
is unlikely that their limited use in these projects would adversely affect the overall future
availability of these resources.
The land used for the in-place closure of the impoundments would be irreversibly
committed as the CCR material would remain in place for the foreseeable future
representing a permanent commitment of the land and precluding future use of the land.
However, as these areas would be vegetated they would support some natural resources.
The land used for the proposed landfill is irreversibly committed because the land would be
permanently converted from an undeveloped use to a landfill; however, after closure and
decommissioning of the plant, the project areas could be used as open space or some
other industrial related use.
The Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill is an existing landfill, and there would be
no changes to the committed materials and resources associated with landfill construction
associated with the use of this facility. However, landfill capacity would be irretrievably lost
and nonrenewable fossil fuels would be irretrievably lost through the use of fuel by trucks
used to transport CCR to this landfill. Due to the higher number of trucks needed and the
greater number of miles travelled, this impact would be greater for the Closure-by-Removal
option under Alternatives B and D which would require a greater number of trucks
(Alternative D) and vehicle miles travelled, than Alternative C. However, this impact would
still be minor relative to existing supplies.

Cumulative Effects

This section supplements preceding analyses that include the potential for cumulative
adverse impacts to the region’s environment that could result from the implementation of
the projects proposed to manage CCR at CUF. A cumulative impact analysis must consider
the potential impact on the environment that may result from the incremental impact of a
project when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions
(40 CFR 1508.7). Baseline conditions reflect the impacts of past and present actions. The
impact analyses summarized in preceding sections are based on baseline conditions
including the following actions which are either explicitly or implicitly considered cumulative
impacts:
•

Flue Gas Desulfurization System on CUF Units 1 and 2

•

Selective Catalytic Reduction Systems on CUF Units 1 and 2

•

Sale of TVA property for development of a gypsum wallboard plant and gypsum
processing plant

•

Partial Closure of the Fly Ash and Gypsum stacks

•

Development of onsite borrow areas and construction of an access road from the
plant perimeter road to Old Scott Road to provide access to the borrow sites

As such, these actions are considered part of the baseline and are not addressed
separately in the cumulative effects analysis.
TVA evaluated a full range of environmental resource issues for inclusion in the cumulative
effects analysis. The proposed action and its connected actions identified under
Alternatives B, C, and D would mostly occur on land that was previously disturbed and is
used for industrial purposes. In addition, the surrounding landscape is already subject to
environmental stressors associated with continuing industrial operations. Consequently, as
has been described in prior subsections of this EIS, the existing quality of environmental
resources with the potential to be directly or indirectly affected by project activities is
generally low. The exception to this is the proposed onsite landfill, which would be
constructed on land that is currently undeveloped and covered with forested vegetation.
The proposed transportation of CCR material to an offsite landfill identified under
Alternatives B and D would occur on land developed as a landfill and would utilize existing
roadways for transport of CCR; accordingly, impacts associated with this action are
confined to those associated with the transport of CCR from CUF to the Bi-County Solid
Waste Management Landfill. All proposed actions under Alternative C would occur within
the CUF property.
3.25.1 Geographic Area of Analysis
The appropriate geographic area over which past, present, and future actions could
reasonably contribute to cumulative effects is variable and dependent on the resource
evaluated. Based upon the defined list of resources potentially affected by cumulative
effects, the lands and water resources within a 5-mile radius of the proposed actions were
considered appropriate for consideration in this analysis. This geographic area also
encompasses lands on the CUF property proposed for use as laydown during construction.

3.25.2 Identification of “Other Actions”
The only past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future action that is appropriate for
consideration in this cumulative analysis is described in Table 3-39. This action was
identified within the geographic area of analysis as having the potential to, in the aggregate,
result in larger and potentially significant adverse impacts to the resources of concern.

Actions that are listed as having a timing that is “past” or “present” inherently have
environmental impacts that are integrated into the base condition for each of the resources
analyzed in this chapter. However, these actions are included in this discussion to provide
for a more complete description of their characteristics. Actions that are not reasonably
foreseeable are those that are based on mere speculation or conjecture, or those that have
only been discussed on a conceptual basis.
Waste Water Treatment Plant
TVA is planning to construct and operate a new WWTP facility to treat wastewater streams
from the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. Preliminary planning indicates that this facility
would be located near the proposed bottom ash dewatering facility on a previously
disturbed site.
3.25.3 Analysis of Cumulative Effects
To address cumulative impacts, the existing affected environment surrounding the project
area was considered in conjunction with the environmental impacts presented in Chapter 3.
These combined impacts are defined by the CEQ as “cumulative” in 40 CFR 1508.7 and
may include individually minor, but collectively significant actions taking place over a period
of time. As described in the resources analyzed above, the proposed projects would be
located on a previously disturbed industrial site and would not substantially impact land use,
geology, floodplains, surface water, groundwater, natural communities, cultural resources,
visual resources, natural areas, parks or recreational facilities, and socioeconomic
resources. The projects would result in some beneficial impacts during operation due to the
increase in vegetated land cover at impoundment areas. In addition, dewatering would
reduce discharge to surrounding water bodies. However, this benefit is minor and localized
and would not be expected to contribute to a more significant cumulative effect. Overall risk
related to groundwater and surface water quality would be improved with implementation of
impoundment closures. As noted in the PEIS (TVA 2016a), this would contribute to a
positive impact on a cumulative basis within the Tennessee Valley region and within river
systems supporting multiple coal-fired power plants subject to CCR impoundment closures.
However, there are no other TVA facilities within the 5-mile geographic area of analysis.
Primary adverse effects of the proposed action as described in the preceding sections of
Chapter 3 are related to temporary and localized effects associated with air and noise
emissions from construction vehicles, erosion and runoff from construction sites, and minor

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

199

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

generation of solid and hazardous wastes. It is likely that the construction phase of the
other reasonably foreseeable future actions identified within the region may overlap with the
proposed action. However, due to the relatively minor and temporary nature of construction
related impacts, and the implementation of BMPs to minimize impacts, cumulative effects of
the proposed action are considered negligible.
The potential for cumulative effects to the identified environmental resources of concern are
analyzed below for Alternatives B, C, and D.
3.25.3.1 Air Quality and Climate Change
The reasonably foreseeable future action identified has the potential to impact air quality.
Emissions from the operation of a dewatering facility and WWTP are subject to applicable
operating permit and fugitive dust regulations. Emissions from these activities are expected
to be minor and together with minor emissions associated with operation of the dewatering
facilities and onsite landfill would not exceed significance levels. The ongoing transport of
borrow from the onsite borrow areas to CUF would result in air emissions from combustion
of gasoline and diesel fuels. These emissions, together with fugitive dust and emissions
from equipment and vehicles during in-place impoundment closure activities would result in
potential localized increase in air emissions. However, given the nature of these activities,
exceedances of applicable ambient air quality standards are not expected and therefore
cumulative impacts to air quality would be localized and minor.
Implementation of Alternatives B, C, or D would result in localized increase in GHG
emissions and, therefore, there would be no cumulative effect to climate change.
3.25.3.2 Wetlands, Floodplains and Aquatic Ecology
The potential for cumulative effects to wetlands and the aquatic environment are largely
driven by the loss of wetland area resulting from the implementation of Alternatives B and
C. As described in Sections 3.7 (Surface Water) and 3.13 (Wetlands), impacts associated
with the construction and operation of the onsite landfill would result in the permanent loss
of 0.5 acre of wetlands and impact 8,896.8 linear feet of streams and wet weather
conveyances. Excavation of the southern borrow site would have a direct impact to the
2,851 linear feet of wet weather conveyance and two small farm ponds. Approximately
110 feet of Wells Creek and approximately 90 linear feet of Scott Branch would be
impacted due to placement of a culvert to complete the access road and construction of a
bridge over Wells Creek to access the borrow sites. Impacts to surface waters would be
minimized by the use of appropriate BMPs and adherence to appropriate permit conditions.
Cumulatively approximately 1.34 acres of wetlands would be impacted by past and present
actions. Permanent impacts to wetlands would be mitigated in accordance with
requirements of Section 404 of the CWA. Given the industrial nature of CUF, wetland
impacts associated with construction of the WWTP are not anticipated.
Floodplain impacts would be avoided by locating the WWTP (identified in Table 3-39)
outside the floodplain of the Cumberland River and/or Wells Creek. However, floodplain
impacts would be evaluated, and mitigation measures identified as needed, for reasonably
foreseeable activities (i.e., construction of the WWTP) in future environmental reviews. By
adhering to the requirements of EO 11988, as amended by EO 13690, and the National
Flood Insurance Program, impacts of reasonably foreseeable actions on floodplains and
floodplain resources would be minimized.

200

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3 – Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

Construction of the onsite landfill would also impact aquatic habitat along the lower portion
of the unnamed tributary near its confluence with Scott Branch. Direct impacts include
stream alteration, culverting, and construction of a leachate pond and one of the sediment
basins. These activities would be done in compliance with applicable TDEC and USACE
404/401 permits obtained for the proposed actions, which may require mitigation, such as
contributing to a stream mitigation bank, per permit requirements. There would be an
incremental increase in impacts to aquatic and wetland resources, however given the local
abundance of similar aquatic resources and wetland areas within the region and the
implementation of BMPs during construction for all identified projects, watershed level
cumulative impacts to aquatic and wetland resources would not be notable under either
alternative.
3.25.3.3 Transportation
The potential for cumulative effects to transportation from other identified actions would be
related to the construction phase of the WWTP. No additional traffic on public roadways
would result from concurrent borrow site operations as all truck movements would use the
onsite access road. Traffic generated by these actions would consist of the construction
workforce and the shipments of goods and equipment to the construction site. The
construction phase traffic would occur in addition to the existing traffic generated by the
operation of CUF. However, once construction is completed, maintenance phase traffic
associated with the WWTP is anticipated to be negligible.
Closure-in-Place of the Bottom Ash impoundment as well as the Closure-by-Removal
option under Alternative C would not utilize public roadways. CCR removed from the Main
Ash and Stilling Impoundments under the Closure-in-Place Alternative may be transported
to the existing onsite landfill. Long-term storage of CCR generated at CUF would be
transported to the onsite landfill and would not use public roadways. There would be no
cumulative effects associated with these actions.
Under Alternatives B and D, impoundment Closure-by-Removal, and the transportation of
future CCR generated at CUF to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
(Alternative D) would utilize public roads throughout the closure period (up to 12 years for
impoundment closure and during the operational phase, up to 18 years). The road network
along this route is anticipated to have sufficient capacity remaining to handle the resulting
increase in truck traffic. Therefore, there would be no cumulative effects.
Closure-in-Place of the Main Ash and Stilling Impoundments may require the use of public
roadways to transport CCR removed from these facilities if it is taken to an offsite landfill
rather than an onsite landfill. However, there would be no cumulative impact as the amount
of CCR removed would be lower than under the Closure-by-Removal option and therefore
the duration and increased truck traffic would less under Closure-by-Removal.
3.25.3.4 Noise
Construction and operation of WWTP is not anticipated to result in long term noise impacts
as the facility would be located on CUF and there are no sensitive receptors within 500 feet
of the facility. However, under the impoundment Closure-in-Place and Closure-by-Removal
options and the transport of future CCR to the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
under Alternative D, there would be an increase in noise emissions resulting from the
transport of CCR along the haul route. The potential for cumulative noise impacts from
WWTP construction would be associated with the increase in construction related traffic
along the existing roads. This may increase noise levels at residences in proximity to the

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

201

CUF CCR Management Operations Environmental Impact Statement

haul route. However, any impacts would be minor and limited to the construction phase of
the proposed project. In addition, operation of the landfill together with noise from transport
of borrow material would result in a localized increase in noise levels at noise receptors
identified near the access road when these operations are occurring at the same time. The
cumulative effect would be minor as the transport of borrow would only occur when needed
to support plant operations and operations related noise would occur during normal working
hours.
3.25.3.5 Landfill Capacity
Under Alternatives B and C, all future CCR produced at CUF would be disposed in an
onsite landfill, therefore there would be no impact to capacity of other landfills in the region.
Under Alternative D, future CCR from CUF would be transported to an existing offsite
permitted landfill. In addition, CCR removed from the impoundments under the Closure-byRemoval option under Alternatives B and D and the Closure-in-Place option under all
alternatives would also be transported to an existing offsite permitted landfill. Existing
Subtitle D landfills that may be considered for receipt of CCR from CUF are typically sited,
sized and permitted with expectations regarding total life span and capacity for disposal
within their respective service areas. While the Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill
has been considered in this analysis as the nearest receiving landfill with available capacity
for the purposes of assessing impacts on environmental resources, TVA has not eliminated
the possibility of transporting CCR under this alternative to one or more other offsite landfills
if needed. If such a decision were made in the future, it would be the subject of a separate
NEPA review. Disposal of CCR from CUF at any offsite landfill may reasonably be expected
to consume existing capacity and, therefore, shorten the lifespan of the receiving landfill.
The need to expand a given receiving landfill, however, is dependent upon a range of
factors that include the existing permitted capacity, volume of CCR material placed within a
given landfill and other market factors that would result in the placement of other non-CCR
materials within the landfill. Because of these factors and the fact that TVA has not
determined with certainty whether CCR materials from CUF would be placed at Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill, or any other receiving landfill, potential cumulative
effects on environmental resources associated with the expansion of landfill capacity are
remote and speculative.

Introduction

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) to address the potential environmental effects associated with implementation of several
projects to facilitate long-term management of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) produced at
the Cumberland Fossil Plant (CUF) located near Cumberland City, Tennessee. Specifically,
these projects are:


Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. Bottom ash is currently wet-sluiced to the Bottom Ash
Impoundment. TVA is proposing to build and operate a bottom ash dewatering facility
with options for using a continuous system where water left over from the dewatering
process would be recirculated back into the plant for future sluicing operations, or oncethrough system where water would be treated as needed and then discharged through
an existing permitted outfall.



Closure of the Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment. At a
programmatic level, TVA has previously considered two impoundment closure methods:
Closure-in-Place or Closure-by-Removal. The alternative analysis for impoundment
closure will rely on this programmatic closure evaluation as well as evaluating specific
issues related to closing the Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment at
CUF.



Landfill. TVA will evaluate disposing of dry CCR at an offsite permitted landfill and/or
constructing a new onsite landfill. A new landfill would be designed to provide sufficient
storage capacity for long-term management of CCR generated at CUF.

The location of these projects is shown on Figure 1.
This proposal supports TVA’s goal to eliminate all wet ash storage at its coal plants and will also
help TVA comply with present and future regulatory requirements related to new CCR
production and management, including those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)’s final Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities rule (CCR Rule) and
Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point
Source Category (ELGs), and those of the State of Tennessee.
1.1

Background

CUF generates enough energy to supply about 1.1 million homes. The plant consumes an
average of 5.6 million tons of coal annually and produces approximately 1.3 million tons of CCR
a year. TVA sells approximately 75 percent of the CCR produced at CUF annually (725,000
tons of gypsum and 275,000 tons of fly ash) for beneficial reuse as raw manufacturing material.
The CCRs that are not sold for reuse are currently stored onsite in dry stacks, wet stacks and
impoundments.
In July 2009, the TVA Board of Directors passed a resolution for staff to review TVA practices
for storing CCRs at its generating facilities, including CUF, which resulted in a recommendation
to convert the wet ash management system at TVA Fossil Plants, including CUF, to a dry
storage system. On April 17, 2015, the EPA released its final CCR Rule. The CCR Rule
establishes a comprehensive set of requirements for disposal in surface impoundments and
established closure requirements. Once closure is initiated, impoundments are potentially
subject to a closure deadline of five years, with the possibility of an extension of the closure time
period under certain circumstances.

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

The Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation (TDEC) is overseeing TVA
compliance with the CCR Rule of its plants in Tennessee as part of the TDEC Commissioner’s
Order.

Figure 1.

Proposed CCR Management Projects at CUF

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

On September 30, 2015, EPA finalized new ELGs. The final ELG rule sets new or additional
requirements for wastewater streams from fossil-fueled power plants, including waste streams
from fly ash and bottom ash operations.
In June 2016, TVA issued a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) that
analyzed methods for closing impoundments that hold CCR materials at its fossil plants and
identified specific screening and evaluation factors to help frame the evaluation of closures at
facilities system-wide. A Record of Decision was released in July 2016 that would allow future
environmental reviews of CCR impoundment closures to tier from the PEIS.
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) evaluation of closure alternatives for the Main
Ash Impoundment and Bottom Ash Impoundment at CUF would tier off of the 2016 PEIS.
1.2
TVA’s Objectives
The approximately 2,470 megawatts of generating capacity provided by CUF is important in
maintaining an adequate and reliable power supply to the north-central portion of TVA’s service
area. Accordingly, CUF was identified in TVA’s 2015 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) as one of
the coal plants that TVA plans to continue operating in the future. The purpose of the proposed
action is to convert the management of CCRs produced at CUF from a wet to dry system. The
project is needed to support the goal established by the TVA Board of Directors to handle CCR
on a dry basis and to eliminate all wet CCR storage at its coal plants. The dewatering facilities
would also foster TVA’s compliance with present and future regulatory requirements related to
new CCR production and management, including the requirements of the EPA’s CCR and ELG
rules, and Tennessee’s requirements.
TVA must decide whether to construct a dewatering facility, whether and how to close the
Bottom Ash and Main Ash Impoundments at CUF, and whether to construct a new dry onsite
CCR landfill or dispose of dry CCR at an offsite permitted landfill. TVA’s decision will consider
factors such as potential environmental impacts, economic issues, availability of resources and
TVA’s long-term goals.

2.0

Proposed Alternatives

As a result of internal review and scoping comments, TVA has proposed the following
alternatives to be evaluated in the EIS.
2.1
Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would continue current plant operations and not construct
a bottom ash dewatering facility to manage CCR produced at CUF in a dry manner. It would not
close the ash impoundments nor would it seek disposal options for long-term storage of CCR
generated there. Rather, CCR would continue to be managed in the current impoundments and
stacks for as long as storage capacity was available. This alternative does not satisfy the project
purpose and need and, therefore, is not considered viable or reasonable. It does, however,
provide a benchmark for comparing the environmental impacts of alternatives retained for
detailed study.

Future CCR
Under this alternative, TVA would:
2.4

1.

a.

Future CCR would be transported and managed in an existing offsite permitted
landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill).

No decision has been made about CCR management at CUF. TVA is preparing the EIS to
inform decision makers, other agencies, and the public about the potential for environmental
impacts associated with a decision regarding management of CCRs generated at CUF.

3.0

Environmental Review Process

NEPA regulations require an early and open process for deciding what should be discussed in
an EIS (i.e., the scope of the document). The NEPA review process is intended to help federal
agencies make decisions that are based on an understanding of the action’s impacts and, if
necessary, to take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the natural and human
environment. NEPA also requires that federal agencies provide opportunities for public
involvement in the decision-making process.
TVA intends to prepare an EIS, the most intensive level of NEPA review, to consider options for
management of CCR at CUF. During the development of the EIS, the public and environmental
and permitting agencies have two opportunities to provide input on the development of the
environmental study. The first opportunity is the scoping process followed next at the draft
document stage.
After considering input from the public scoping period, TVA will develop and publish a draft EIS.
The draft EIS will be available for public review and comment for 45 days. During the public
comment period on the draft EIS, TVA will conduct a public meeting. Once the public and other
agencies have reviewed the document, TVA will consider all comments and make revisions, if
necessary, and publish a final EIS. After at least 30 days later, TVA will make a final decision
captured in a Record of Decision.

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

During the initial public scoping period, TVA estimated that the Draft EIS would be published in
the summer of 2017, the Final EIS would be published in inter 2017, and a final decision would
be made in Spring 2018.
3.1
Public Outreach During the Scoping Period
Public scoping for this project was initiated with the publication of the Notice of Intent (NOI) to
prepare an EIS in the Federal Register on December 5, 2016 (Appendix A). The NOI initiated a
30-day public scoping period, which concluded on January 6, 2017. In addition to the NOI in the
Federal Register, TVA published notices regarding this effort in regional and local newspapers;
issued a news release to media; and posted the news release on the TVA Web site to solicit
public input.
TVA also developed an initial project mailing list that included local and regional stakeholders,
governments and other interested parties, and sent letters to notify those on the list of the
project. Approximately 350 postcards were also mailed to nearby residents.
TVA held a public scoping meeting on December 12, 2015, in Clarksville, Tennessee.
Approximately 10 people attended the scoping meeting. Attendees included members of the
general public, media representatives, and other special interest groups.
3.2
Scoping Feedback
TVA received a total of six comment submissions. Of the six submissions, three were from
members of the public and two were from environmental advocacy organizations. These
organizations are:


Sierra Club (583 individuals signed a form letter, 134 of these commenters also
submitted individual comments). The majority of the comments expressed concern that
water quality be protected.



The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) and nine other environmental
advocacy groups submitted a 13-page letter with 12 attachments. Unless otherwise
indicated, these commenters are collectively referred to as SELC.

Comment submissions are included in Appendix B. TVA also received one request from an
individual wishing to be added to the mailing list for future information about the project.
Comments were received in relation to the project alternatives, impact analysis, groundwater,
and surface water, aquatic ecology, tiering from the PEIS, and general topics. The comments
related to TVA’s proposed actions are addressed in the sections that follow.
In addition, TVA received a copy of four comment submissions which had been previously
submitted in relation to the Ash Impoundment Closure PEIS process. Those four sets of
comments have been previously addressed in Appendix A of the PEIS and are not addressed
further in this document. The Final Ash Impoundment Closure Environmental Impact Statement,
Part I – Programmatic NEPA Review is available on the TVA Web site at:
https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Reviews.
3.3
3.3.1

Public Scoping Comments and Responses
Impact Analysis

Comment 1: The EIS must discuss the full extent of existing contamination and current and
ongoing groundwater and surface water pollution at CUF (Commenter: SELC).
6

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

Response 1: In the EIS, TVA will fully describe the existing baseline conditions at CUF in the No
Action Alternative, and will fully examine the environmental impacts associated with each
alternative, including the No Action Alternative.
3.3.2

Groundwater and Surface Water

Comment 2: CCR is submerged in at least 20 feet of groundwater and groundwater is
hydrologically connected to Wells Creek. TVA’s monitoring reports found exceedances of boron,
iron, manganese, molybdenum, chloride, sulfate and total dissolved solids in at least one test
well location (Commenter: SELC).
Response 2: See response to Comment 1.
Comment 3: The EIS should address the hydrogeology of the proposed landfill site and whether
the site is situated atop rock that is cracked (the Wells Creek Structure), which is characterized
by highly unpredictable fractured bedrock. Existing impoundments are over original streambed
of Wells Creek in an area with fractured bedrock which increases the potential for groundwater
contamination (Commenters: Deanna Bowden, Sierra Club).
Response 3: In the EIS, TVA will describe existing baseline conditions, including a description of
the geology, including the Wells Creek Structure and groundwater quality at CUF. These
baseline conditions will form the foundation from which impacts associated with the proposed
project alternatives will be evaluated. Risks to human health and the environment, including
groundwater, will be addressed in the EIS analysis for both the No Action alternative (current
conditions) and all proposed project alternatives.
Comment 4: Proposed actions would impact water quality and affect drinking water and aquatic
life (Commenter: Sierra Club).
Response 4: In the EIS, TVA will characterize surface water resources, and will analyze the
extent to which each proposed project might affect water quality directly or indirectly (i.e.,
through infiltration or runoff). The No Action Alternative will set out baseline conditions that will
form the foundation from which impacts associated with the proposed project alternatives will be
evaluated.
3.3.3

Ash Impoundment Closure

Comment 5: SELC opposes TVA tiering analysis from PIES (Commenter: SELC).
Response 5: As noted in the response to Comment 2 in the Final PEIS, a programmatic
environmental review is appropriate to use in the evaluation of a proposal to proceed with
multiple projects that are temporally or spatially connected and that will have a series of
associated concurrent or subsequent decisions. Programmatic NEPA reviews address the
general environmental issues relating to a suite of projects, and can effectively frame the scope
of subsequent site and project-specific actions. CEQ regulations provide for programmatic
reviews and the tiering process that allows more site-specific actions to rely on programmatic
analyses and avoid recreating or redoing relevant analyses.
While TVA performed a programmatic review of impoundment closure in Part I of the PEIS, this
analysis in no way obscures or biases/predetermines the completeness or accuracy of the sitespecific environmental analyses performed for the proposed closure of other CCR facilities. The
tiered NEPA analyses will appropriately rely upon and integrate the over-arching and bounding
analyses performed in the PEIS, but will integrate site-specific details and analyses.
7

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

Comment 6: PEIS Fails to Discuss Reasonable Range of Closure-by-Removal Alternatives
including excavation and recycling, excavation and disposal in the proposed new onsite landfill,
excavation and removal by rail, and excavation and removal by barge. For this and other
reasons, TVA should provide site-specific analysis and demonstrate the closure alternative
satisfies minimum CCR Rule performance standards (Commenter: SELC).
Response 6: As noted in the response to Comment 5, site-specific conditions will be evaluated
in the CUF EIS; however, this tiered analysis will integrate the bounding analyses performed in
the PEIS, while also integrating site specific details to fully evaluate the impacts of the proposed
closure methods. These methods include Closure-by-Removal and Closure-in-Place. All modes
of transport of CCR will be addressed. One element of the purpose and need for this project is
to comply with the CCR Rule, and to fulfill that purpose and need, closure methods will comply
with all applicable requirements.
Comment 7: The analysis of closure options should consider site-specific conditions and how
they will affect issues such as releases to ground and surface water, the potential impoundment
of water, and stability and compliance with all regulations that apply to coal ash ponds and
disposal areas (Commenter: SELC).
Response 7: The EIS will evaluate the impact of closure of the Bottom Ash Impoundment and
Main Ash Impoundment on surface water and groundwater. As noted in the responses to
Comment 1 and Comment 6, TVA will fully describe the existing baseline conditions and will
fully examine the environmental impacts associated with each alternative. An element of the
purpose and need for this project is to comply with the CCR Rule, and to fulfill that purpose and
need, closure methods will comply with all applicable requirements, including stability.
Comment 8: TVA’s preferred alternative to cap and close in place does not comply with the
minimum requirements outlined in the federal Coal Ash Rule (Commenter: SELC).
Response 8: TVA has not selected a preferred alternative at this time. The EIS will evaluate
Closure-by-Removal as well as Closure-in-Place of the Bottom Ash and Main Ash
Impoundment. An element of the purpose and need for this project is to comply with the CCR
Rule; thus, the alternative selected will necessarily comply with all requirements of that rule.
Comment 9: TVA must select a closure alternative that complies with all of the laws and
regulations that apply to its coal ash ponds and disposal areas (Commenter: SELC).
Response 9: See responses to comments 6, 7 and 8.
Comment 10: TVA’s closure plans do not provide adequate technical analysis to support TVA’s
selection of Closure-in-Place of any of the ash impoundments and disposal areas at the Plant.
The plans contain no discussion of site-specific conditions (Commenter: SELC).
Response 10: This comment is premature as Closure-by-Removal and Closure-in Place of the
Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment are potential actions that are being
evaluated in the EIS. Accordingly, technical analyses of site-specific conditions relevant to this
evaluation are currently underway. As noted in the response to comments 5, 6, and 7, those
site-specific conditions and analyses at the CUF impoundments will be considered in the
evaluation of closure alternatives.

8

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

Comment 11: For the Bottom Ash Impoundment and the Main Ash Impoundment, Closure-byRemoval should be preferred alternative (Commenters: Sierra Club, Deanna Bowden, Kathleen
Dougherty, Elizabeth Garber, SELC).
Response 11: Comment noted. TVA has not selected a preferred alternative at this time. The
EIS will evaluate Closure-by-Removal as well as Closure-in-Place, of the Bottom Ash and Main
Ash Impoundment.
3.3.4

Management and Disposal of Dry Ash

Comment 12: TVA should move towards best practices for coal ash storage and store dry ash in
lined storage areas (Commenter: Deanna Bowden).
Response 12: Comment noted.
Comment 13: Dry and wet ash should be stored in a lined area away from rivers and creeks
(Commenter: Elizabeth Garber).
Response 13: Comment noted.
Comment 14: TVA should consider using the proposed onsite landfill for disposal of the Plant’s
legacy coal ash currently stored in the Bottom Ash and Main Ash Impoundments (Commenter:
SELC).
Response 14: The proposed onsite landfill would be planned to only receive new CCR produced
at CUF and as such, capacity to accommodate the existing CCR from the impoundments is not
available. Under the Closure-by-Removal option, TVA will evaluate management of legacy ash
in the onsite Fly Ash and Gypsum Stacks (Alternative C) as well as transport to an offsite third
party permitted landfill (Alternative B and D).
Comment 15: Gypsum Stack and Fly Ash Stack – TVA should immediately close the Gypsum
Stack and Fly Ash Stack (Commenter: SELC).
Response 15: Closure of the Gypsum Stack and Fly Ash Stack are not included within the
scope of this EIS. Current operations at the Gypsum and Fly Ash stacks are part of the existing
baseline conditions at CUF which are evaluated in the No Action Alternative, and are subject to
existing permits by TDEC. TVA will consider all reasonable consequences of the No Action
Alternative in the EIS impacts analysis.
Comment 16: TVA should address hydrogeology of the proposed on-site landfill site
(Commenter: SELC).
Response 16: TVA will consider the hydrogeologic conditions of all of the proposed project sites
when assessing potential impacts to groundwater in the EIS.
Comment 17: The proposed landfill must be permitted to comply with requirements of the
federal CCR Rule and requirements of the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Act and its
implementing requirements (Commenter SELC).
Response 17: TVA agrees and will continue to work with state and federal regulatory authorities
to appropriately permit new landfills under applicable regulatory programs.

9

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report

3.3.5

OffSite Transportation of Coal Ash

Comment 18: TVA should consider a reasonable range of options with respect to hauling coal
ash offsite to an existing permitted landfill. These options should include use of rail or barge to
transport CCR, varying distances to potential landfills and opportunities for additional coal ash
recycling (Commenter: SELC).
Response 18: TVA will assess the reasonableness of using barge and rail transport in the EIS.
TVA selected a representative nearby landfill that was permitted to receive CCR under
Subtitle D for use in its analysis of potential impact of offsite transport of CCR. This analysis
constitutes a reasonable basis for assessing impacts of offsite transport and disposal of CCR
from CUF.
Comment 19: TVA must consider environmental justice implications of transporting CCR to an
off-site permitted landfill (Commenter: SELC).
Response 19: The EIS will analyze the potential for disproportionately high and adverse human
health or environmental effects of all alternatives on minority and low-income populations.
3.3.6

Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility

Comment 20: TVA is considering options for using a continuous or once-through system where
left over water is treated and discharged through an existing permitted outfall or recirculated
back to the plant for future use. TVA’s once-through option would violate ELGs and not meet
purpose and need (Commenter: SELC).
Response 20: The EIS will consider the impact of implementing both options for bottom ash
dewatering in the EIS: once-through and recirculation system, as well as a phased approach
where initially a once-through dewatering system will be constructed, with the recirculation
system added in a subsequent phase. TVA will adhere to the standards in the ELG rule.
Comment 21: TVA should consider dry handling of bottom ash to avoid need for the dewatering
facility (Commenter: SELC).
Response 21: TVA has evaluated the use of various different dry bottom ash systems; however
due to the boiler bottoms being located in the confines of the facilities basements, there is not
enough headspace to install the needed equipment. In addition to the infeasibility of the
technologies to fit in the required space, the dry option is also cost prohibited.
3.3.7

Retirement of CUF

Comment 22: TVA should consider an analysis of an alternative in which TVA retires the
Cumberland Plant (Commenter SELC).
Response 22: The purpose and need for the proposed action evaluated in this EIS is to help
TVA meet its commitment to convert CCR storage from wet to dry, complement compliance with
the CCR Rule, and enhance compliance with the ELG rule. TVA is considering in depth, four
alternatives (listed in Section 2.0) to fulfill this purpose and need.
While the 2015 IRP did recommend continuing with the announced unit retirements at Allen,
Colbert, Johnsonville, Paradise and Widows Creek, it did not include Cumberland in this unit
retirement group. Instead, the IRP recommended that Cumberland continue to operate in the
future. Because the retirement of CUF would not align with the recommended direction of the
2015 IRP, it is not considered a reasonable option for TVA.

3.4
Issues to be Addressed
Based on TVA’s internal scoping and input gathered from the public scoping process, TVA
anticipates the major issues to be addressed in this EIS include:
 Water Resources – TVA will characterize surface water and groundwater resources, and
will analyze the extent to which each closure alternative would affect water quality directly
or indirectly (i.e., through infiltration or runoff).
 Biological Resources (vegetation, wildlife and aquatic life) – Community types within the
project areas will be described. Significant natural features, including rare species habitat,
important wildlife habitat, or locally uncommon natural community types will be identified.
TVA will evaluate the effect of each alternative on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
 Threatened and Endangered Species – Federally or state-listed as threatened or
endangered plants and animals known to exist in the vicinity of CUF or any of the
proposed project areas will be identified. The effects of each closure alternative on
endangered, threatened, and rare species in need of management will be evaluated.
 Floodplains and Wetlands – Wetlands and floodplains within the proposed project areas
will be identified and impacts will be quantified. The effects of each of the alternatives on
jurisdictional wetlands and floodplains will be evaluated.
 Geology and Soils – Regional geology and soils at proposed project sites will be
identified and any limitations related to construction and operation will be evaluated.
Impacts to prime farmland soils will be quantified.
 Land Use – Land uses within the proposed project sites and within the vicinity (5-mile
radius) will be identified. Permanent and temporary direct and indirect impacts to land use
associated with each of the alternatives will be evaluated.
 Transportation – The existing roadway network in the vicinity of CUF and the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill, including physical road characteristics (number of
lanes, shoulders, and posted speed limit) and existing traffic characteristics will be
identified. The effect of construction and operation of each alternative on the nearby
roadway network will be evaluated,
 Recreational and Managed Areas – Natural areas, parks, and other managed areas
within the vicinity of the alternatives (5-mile radius) will be identified and potential impacts
associated with the proposed alternatives will be addressed.
 Visual Resource – The aesthetic setting of each project site will be described and an
analysis of changes to scenic attractiveness and scenic integrity associated with each of
the alternatives will be completed.

11

CUF CCR Management
Scoping Report
 Cultural Resources – TVA will characterize archaeological and historic resources within
the Area of Potential Effect of each project site. TVA also will discuss any known National
Register sites. The potential effects of each alternative on historic and archaeological
resources will be evaluated. Results of the analysis will be reviewed by the Tennessee
State Historic Preservation Officer.
 Noise – Baseline noise conditions will be characterized and noise emissions associated
with the construction phase equipment use and truck traffic during operations will be
assessed to determine the potential noise impact of each alternative on sensitive
receptors.
 Air Quality and Climate Change – Air quality considerations including attainment status,
and regional air quality information will be presented. Impacts to air quality from activities
associated with each of the alternatives will be evaluated. The impact of emissions from
each of the alternatives on climate change will be addressed.
 Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice – Demographic and community characteristics associated with the proposed project sites and along the haul route to the Bi-County
Solid Waste Management Landfill will be evaluated. Special attention will be given to
identification of potential low income and minority populations to evaluate the potential for
disproportionate adverse impacts in accordance with Executive Order 12898. Economic
effects associated with construction and operation of the proposed projects under each
alternative will also be evaluated.
 Solid and Hazardous Waste – CCR will be characterized based upon existing CUF
operations. Current practices regarding hazardous materials/waste management at CUF
will also be identified. In addition, TVA will identify any impacts from waste generation
during construction and operation of the proposed projects for each alternative.
Operational measures (waste management practices) will be incorporated into the
assessment of impacts.
 Public Health and Safety – Potential effects of each alternative on public health and
safety will be evaluated. The evaluation will include potential effects of transportation of
CCR along public roadways.
The potential direct and indirect impacts of each resource will be assessed in the EIS. Mitigative
measures designed to minimize impacts, as appropriate, will be identified. In addition, the EIS
will include an analysis of the cumulative impacts of the preferred alternative. A cumulative
impact analysis considers the potential impact to the environment that may result from the
incremental impact of the project when added to other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions (40 Code of Federal Regulations § 1508.7). The methodology for
performing such analyses is set forth in Considering Cumulative Effects under NEPA (Council
on Environmental Quality 1997).

TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY
Environmental Impact Statement for
Cumberland Fossil Plant Coal
Combustion Residual Management
Tennessee Valley Authority.
Notice of intent.

AGENCY:
ACTION:

The Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) intends to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
to address the potential environmental
effects associated with management of
coal combustion residual (CCR) material
produced at the Cumberland Fossil
Plant (CUF) located near Cumberland
City, Stewart County, Tennessee. The
purpose of the proposed EIS is to
address long-term management of CCR
produced at CUF. The project will help
TVA comply with state and federal
regulatory requirements related to CCR
production and management, including
the requirements of U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA’s) CCR Rule
and Effluent Limitations Guidelines.
TVA will evaluate the potential
environmental impacts of construction
and operation of a new bottom ash
dewatering facility and options for
management and disposal of dry CCR
produced at CUF. TVA will also
evaluate closure of the Bottom Ash and
the Main Ash Impoundments. TVA will
develop and evaluate various
alternatives to these actions, including
the No Action Alternative. Public
comments are invited concerning both
the scope of the review and
environmental issues that should be
addressed.

SUMMARY:

Comments on the scope of the
EIS must be received on or before
January 6, 2017.
ADDRESSES: Written comments should
be sent to Ashley Pilakowski, NEPA
Compliance Specialist, 400 West

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This
notice is provided in accordance with
the regulations promulgated by the
Council on Environmental Quality (40
CFR parts 1500 to 1508) and TVA’s
procedures implementing the National
Environmental Policy Act (http://
www.tva.com/environment/reports/pdf/
tvanepa_procedures.pdf.)
TVA Power System and CCR
Management
TVA is a corporate agency and
instrumentality of the United States
created by and existing pursuant to the
TVA Act of 1933 that provides
electricity for business customers and
local power distributors. TVA serves
more than 9 million people in parts of
seven southeastern states. TVA receives
no taxpayer funding, deriving virtually
all of its revenues from sales of
electricity. In addition to operating and
investing its revenues in its electric
system, TVA provides flood control,
navigation and land management for the
Tennessee River system and assists local
power companies and state and local
governments with economic
development and job creation.
Historically, TVA has managed its
CCRs in wet impoundments or dry
landfills. Currently, CUF consumes an
average of 5.6 million tons of coal per
year, generates approximately 16 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity a year
(enough to supply 1.1 million homes),
and produces approximately 1.3 million
tons of CCR a year which are managed
in an existing fly ash stack, gypsum ash
stack, Bottom Ash Impoundment and
Main Ash Impoundment. CUF sells
approximately 75% of the CCRs
produced (725,000 tons gypsum and
275,000 tons of fly ash) annually for
beneficial reuse as raw manufacturing
material.
In July 2009, the TVA Board of
Directors passed a resolution for staff to
review TVA practices for storing CCRs
at its generating facilities, including
CUF, which resulted in a
recommendation to convert the wet ash
management system at CUF to a dry
storage system. On April 17, 2015, the
EPA published the final Disposal of
CCRs from Electric Utilities rule, also
known as the CCR Rule.
In June 2016, TVA issued a Final
Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement (PEIS) that analyzed methods
for closing CCR impoundments TVA
fossil plants and identified specific

PO 00000

Frm 00119

screening and evaluation factors to help
frame its evaluation of closures at its
other facilities. A Record of Decision
was released in July 2016 that would
allow future environmental reviews of
qualifying CCR impoundment closures
to tier from the PEIS.
This EIS is intended to tier from the
2016 PEIS to evaluate the closure
alternatives for the existing CCR Bottom
Ash Impoundment and Main Ash
Impoundment. The EIS will also
evaluate construction and operation of a
new bottom ash dewatering facility and
management of dry CCR in a new lined
CCR landfill meeting Tennessee
Department of Environment and
Conservation criteria. This project
supports TVA’s Board of Directors July
2009 resolution and subsequent
recommendation to convert the wet ash
management system at CUF to dry
storage.
Alternatives
In addition to a No Action
Alternative, this EIS will address
alternatives that have reasonable
prospects of providing a solution to the
management and disposal of CCRs
generated at CUF. TVA has determined
that either the construction of a new onsite landfill or hauling CCR to an
existing offsite permitted landfill are the
most reasonable alternatives to address
the need for dry CCR disposal. A new
dewatering facility would dry bottom
ash prior to disposal. TVA will consider
closure alternatives for the Bottom Ash
Impoundment and the Main Ash
Impoundment in accordance with and
consistent with TVA’s PEIS and EPA’s
CCR Rule.
No decision has been made about CCR
management at CUF beyond the current
operations. TVA is preparing this EIS to
inform decision makers, other agencies
and the public about the potential for
environmental impacts associated with
the long-term management of CCR
generated at CUF.
Proposed Resources and Issues To Be
Considered
This EIS will identify the purpose and
need of the project and will contain
descriptions of the existing
environmental and socioeconomic
resources within the area that could be
affected by management of CCR at CUF.
Evaluation of potential environmental
impacts to these resources will include,
but not be limited to, water quality,
aquatic and terrestrial ecology,
threatened and endangered species,
wetlands, land use, historic and
archaeological resources, as well as
solid and hazardous waste, safety,
socioeconomic and environmental

to be addressed in the environmental
review will be determined, in part, from
scoping comments received. The
preliminary identification of reasonable
alternatives and environmental issues in
this notice is not meant to be exhaustive
or final.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
SUMMARY:

I. New Jersey Transit Incident
On September 29, 2016, at
approximately 8:38 a.m., New Jersey
Transit (NJT) Train 1614 travelling at 21
miles per hour (mph) impacted the
bumping block at the end of the track
No. 5 Depot, at Hoboken Terminal, in
Hoboken, New Jersey. The cab car
overrode the bumping block and struck
the wall of the terminal building, near
the ticket office in the corner of the
building. NJT Train 1614 was occupied
by three crew members and
approximately 331 passengers. The
accident resulted in the three
crewmembers and 108 passengers being
transported to four area hospitals. One
individual who was standing on the
pedestrian walkway between the tracks
and the station was fatally injured from
falling debris.
The National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) has taken the lead role in
conducting the investigation of this
accident under its legal authority. See
49 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.; 49 CFR 831.2(b).
As is customary, FRA is participating in
the NTSB’s investigation and also

investigating the accident under its own
authority. NTSB has not issued its
formal findings. Although the NTSB has
not concluded its investigation of this
accident, FRA believes railroads should
take more robust action to address
human factors that may cause accidents
and to enhance protection of railroad
employees and the public.
II. Other Railroad Accidents
Amtrak Accident at Philadelphia, PA
On Tuesday, May 12, 2015, National
Railroad Passenger Corporation
(Amtrak) passenger train 188 (Train 188)
was traveling from Washington, DC, to
New York City. Aboard the train were
five crew members and approximately
238 passengers. Shortly after 9:20 p.m.,
the train derailed while traveling
through a curve in the track at Frankford
Junction in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
As a result of the accident, eight persons
were killed and a significant number of
persons were seriously injured.
NTSB conducted an investigation of
this accident under its legal authority
and issued its findings on May 17,
2016.1 As Train 188 approached the
curve from the west, it traveled over a
straightaway with a maximum
authorized passenger train speed of 80
mph. The maximum authorized
passenger train speed for the curve was
50 mph. NTSB determined the train was
traveling approximately 106 mph within
the curve’s 50-mph speed restriction,
exceeding the maximum authorized
speed on the straightaway by 26 mph,
and 56 mph over railroad’s maximum
authorized speed for the curve.2 NTSB
concluded the locomotive engineer
operating the train made an emergency
application of Train 188’s air brake
system, and the train slowed to
approximately 102 mph before derailing
in the curve.3 NTSB concluded that the
probable cause of the engineer
accelerating to this speed was due to his
loss of situational awareness likely
because his attention was diverted to an
emergency situation with another train.4
On July 8, 2015, NTSB sent a letter to
FRA reiterating NTSB recommendations

Re:

TVA’s notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for
Cumberland Fossil Plant coal combustion residuals management

Dear Ms. Pilakowski:
The Southern Environmental Law Center, Environmental Integrity Project, Southern
Alliance for Clean Energy, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign, Tennessee Clean Water
Network, and Tennessee Chapter Sierra Club (collectively, “Environmental Groups”) write to
provide comments regarding the scope of TVA’s proposed environmental impact statement
(“EIS”) for coal combustion residuals (“CCR” or “coal ash”) management at the Cumberland
Fossil Plant (“Cumberland Plant” or “Plant”). The notice of intent published in the Federal
Register (“Scoping Notice”) explains that TVA intends in the EIS to analyze three connected
actions: (1) closure of the Bottom Ash and Main Ash Impoundments; (2) options for
management and disposal of dry CCR; and (3) construction of a bottom ash dewatering facility. 1
We first describe some key aspects of the existing environment at and near the Cumberland Plant
relevant to water-related impacts associated with these three proposed actions. We then briefly
identify some issues that must be considered by TVA in the NEPA analysis for each of these
three proposed actions. 2

These brief scoping comments are not intended to be comprehensive; rather, we highlight some of the issues that
TVA’s past coal ash-related environmental analyses have failed to adequately address. The burden remains TVA’s
to prepare a comprehensive analysis of the impacts associated with a reasonable range of alternatives. See Friends

The Cumberland Fossil Plant has been polluting and continues to pollute
groundwater and surface water with toxic wastewater and coal ash, and its
description of the affected environment must include this pollution.

With 2,470 MW generating capacity, the Cumberland Plant is the largest coal-fired
power plant in TVA’s fleet. 3 The Cumberland Plant is located in Cumberland City, Tennessee,
at the confluence of Wells Creek and a stretch of the Cumberland River known as Lake Barkley.
The Cumberland Plant is upstream from several highly valued recreation and wildlife areas in
Tennessee, including Barkley Wildlife Management Area, Cross Creeks National Wildlife
Refuge, and Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. 4 The Cumberland River/Lake
Barkley, miles 90.3-108, are included on Tennessee’s list of Known Exceptional Tennessee
Waters and Outstanding National Resource Waters, due to the Cross Creeks National Wildlife
Refuge and the presence of state endangered lake sturgeon. 5 Several drinking water intakes are
also located downstream from the Cumberland Plant. 6
The Cumberland Plant burns thousands of tons of coal daily, resulting in hundreds of
thousands of tons of coal combustion residuals (“coal ash”) waste generated annually and an
average of 2,097 million gallons of wastewater each day. 7 As described below, the Cumberland
Plant has caused and continues to cause significant water pollution in the Cumberland River,
Wells Creek, and groundwater that flows into these surface waters.
A recently-published report identifies the Cumberland Plant as the worst mercury polluter
among coal plants nationwide. 8 Mercury is a neurotoxin that bioaccumulates in fish and can
cause damage to a person’s nervous, digestive, and immune systems. 9 The report, based on
information provided by TVA to the federal EPA and available to the public in the Toxics

that has a ‘continuing duty to gather and evaluate new information relevant to the environmental impact of its
actions.’”)

Release Inventory, found that TVA dumped 120 pounds of mercury generated at the Cumberland
Plant into the Cumberland River in 2015. 10 The same report identifies the Cumberland Plant as
the second-worst selenium polluter among coal plants nationwide. 11 Like mercury, selenium
also bioaccumulates in fish. Selenium can cause damage to a person’s circulatory system. 12 In
2015, TVA dumped 6,000 pounds of selenium generated at the Cumberland Plant into the
Cumberland River. 13 TVA’s current state-issued NPDES permit at the Cumberland Plant places
no numeric limits on the amount of mercury, selenium, or other toxic pollutants TVA can dump
into the river through its permitted outfalls. 14
In addition to the toxic wastewater TVA dumps into the Cumberland River under its
permit, the ash ponds and disposal areas at the Cumberland Plant also illegally leak toxic coal
ash pollution into Wells Creek and the Cumberland River.
After the catastrophic coal ash spill at its Kingston plant, TVA committed to transition to
dry coal ash storage at all of its coal plants. Yet eight years later, TVA is still storing coal ash in
leaking, unlined pits next to the Cumberland River and Wells Creek at the Cumberland Plant.
In January 2016, on behalf of the Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center
filed a notice of intent (“Sierra Club NOI”) to sue Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in federal
court for violating the Clean Water Act at the Cumberland Plant by illegally polluting the
Cumberland River and Wells Creek with coal ash contamination leaking from unlined coal ash
pits at the Plant. 15 The Sierra Club NOI is provided as an attachment to this letter and the facts
set forth therein are incorporated by reference. The Sierra Club NOI explains that the ash ponds
and disposal areas at Cumberland are constructed atop the original streambed of Wells Creek and
fragile bedrock fractured by a meteor hundreds of millions of years ago. These unique features
of the site, coupled with TVA’s decision to build primitive dams to contain the coal ash—in
some cases on top of unstable, porous layers of ash—have resulted in persistent leaks of coal ash
pollutants both through groundwater and directly through seeps into Wells Creek and the
Cumberland River. Independent surface water sampling reported in the Sierra Club NOI

demonstrates the presence of coal ash contaminants in seep flows and elsewhere along the
perimeter of the ash ponds and disposal areas at the Plant. 16
In addition, TVA’s own groundwater monitoring reports show that its coal ash is
polluting the groundwater at the Plant, which flows into nearby Wells Creek and the Cumberland
River. In every report over a ten year period from 2003 to 2013, TVA found exceedances of
boron, iron, manganese, molybdenum, chloride, sulfate and total dissolved solids in at least one
test well location. 17
Because TVA built the ash ponds over the original stream channel of Wells Creek and
atop fractured bedrock that is prone to unpredictable and unknown fractures, this contaminated
groundwater flows into the nearby surface waters. TVA’s current permit only authorizes it to
discharge CCR wastewater into surface water through a single outfall, not through countless
leaks and seeps. Moreover, the permit requires TVA to dispose of coal ash and coal ash
constituents not discharged through the outfall “in a manner, [sic] which prevents [their]
entrance into or pollution of any surface or subsurface waters.” 18 TVA therefore has been and
continues to illegally pollute groundwater, the Cumberland River, and Wells Creek with coal ash
and coal ash constituents.
The proposed EIS must discuss the full extent of existing contamination and current and
ongoing groundwater and surface water pollution at the Cumberland Plant.

II.

The proposed EIS must thoroughly address water-related impacts associated
with the proposed actions and a reasonable range of alternatives.

NEPA is “our basic national charter for protection of the environment.” 19 Other
environmental statutes focus on particular media (like air, water or land), specific natural
resources (such as wilderness areas, or endangered plants and animals), or discrete activities
(such as mining, introducing new chemicals, or generating, handling or disposing of hazardous
substances). In contrast, NEPA applies broadly “to promote efforts which will prevent or
eliminate damage to the environment.” 20

[NEPA] has ‘twin aims. First, it places upon [a federal] agency the obligation to
consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed
action. Second, it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed
considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process. 21
To accomplish its goal of informed decision-making, NEPA requires the agency
proposing the action to provide a full and fair analysis of the environmental impacts of a
proposed action and its alternatives. 22 In order to engage in this analysis, the agency must (1)
define the purpose of its action; (2) identify alternatives that might help it achieve that purpose;
and (3) describe an accurate environmental baseline against which to evaluate the impacts of the
proposed action and its alternatives. 23 To the extent an agency proposes to “tier” its analysis
from a programmatic EIS, such tiering is not intended to allow the agency to obscure the extent
of site-specific environmental impacts or to narrow artificially the alternatives available during
site-specific analysis. 24
NEPA “emphasizes the importance of coherent and comprehensive up-front
environmental analysis to ensure informed decisionmaking to the end that ‘the agency will not
act on incomplete information, only to regret its decision after it is too late to correct.’” 25 Only
after fully evaluating a reasonable range of alternatives and the environmental impacts associated
with each in compliance with NEPA may an agency determine its preferred course of action.
Environmental Groups, together with others, have previously commented extensively on
the fundamental inadequacy of the programmatic and site-specific analyses in the Ash
Impoundment Closure EIS, the final version of which was published in June 2016 (“PEIS”). The

addressed by TVA in its analysis of each of the proposed actions identified in the Scoping
Notice.
A. Closure of the Bottom Ash and Main Ash Impoundments
In the Scoping Notice, TVA states that the purpose of the EIS is “to address the longterm management of CCR produced at CUF.” 27 TVA further states that “[t]he project will help
TVA comply with state and federal requirements related to CCR production and management,
including the requirements of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA’s) CCR Rule….” 28
As Environmental Groups discussed in comments on the PEIS, TVA must select an alternative
that complies with all of the laws and regulations that apply to its coal ash ponds and disposal
areas. Yet TVA’s preferred alternative to cap the Bottom Ash and Main Ash Ponds in place, as
identified in closure plans it has posted on its federal Coal Ash Rule compliance website, does
not comply even with the minimum requirements established by the federal Coal Ash Rule.
Under the federal Coal Ash Rule, a closure plan proposing to cap a coal ash unit in place
must, among other requirements, “discuss how the final cover system will achieve the
performance standards specified in paragraph (d) of this section.” 29 Paragraph (d), in turn,
includes three sets of performance standards relevant to closure in place: (1) environmental and
public health standards; (2) drainage and stabilization standards; and (3) final cover standards. 30
If a unit cannot satisfy the performance standards, the operator must “clean close” the unit,
which means removing the coal ash and decontaminating the area. 31
With respect to environmental and public health standards, an owner/operator must
demonstrate that the CCR unit is closed in a manner that will:
(i) Control, minimize or eliminate, to the maximum extent feasible, post-closure
infiltration of liquids into the waste and releases of CCR, leachate, or contaminated run-off to the
ground or surface waters or to the atmosphere;
(ii) Preclude the probability of future impoundment of water, sediment, or slurry;

(iii) Include measures that provide for major slope stability to prevent the sloughing or
movement of the final cover system during the closure and post-closure care period;
(iv) Minimize the need for further maintenance of the CCR unit; and
(v) Be completed in the shortest amount of time consistent with recognized and generally
accepted good engineering practices. 32
With respect to drainage and stabilization standards, an owner/operator must demonstrate
the following:
(i) Free liquids must be eliminated by removing liquid wastes or solidifying the
remaining wastes and waste residues.
(ii) Remaining wastes must be stabilized sufficient to support the final cover system. 33
With respect to the final cover standards, an owner/operator must demonstrate, among
other things, that the final cover system is “designed to minimize infiltration and erosion.” 34
A discussion of how the closure of a particular impoundment will meet these standards
must necessarily be site-specific. Indeed, EPA counsels:
Whether any particular unit or facility can meet the performance standards for
closure with waste in place is a site-specific determination that will depend on a
number of factual and engineering considerations, such as the hydrogeology of
the site, the engineering of the unit, and the kinds of engineering measures
available. 35
Such a discussion must be site-specific because the conditions at each impoundment vary, in
terms of the underlying geology and hydrogeology, the history of construction of the dikes, and
other features of the impoundment. The closure plan should reference and incorporate the sitespecific information provided in the accompanying stability assessments and history of
construction, along with any other site-specific technical analyses required to define the features
of the site and demonstrate how the closure will meet the performance standards in light of those
features. A technically thorough discussion of these site-specific conditions, and how they will
affect issues such as releases to ground and surface water, the potential impoundment of water,

and stability, is crucial to enable citizens and decisionmakers to evaluate whether an
owner/operator’s plan satisfies the performance standards in the Rule, and therefore, whether the
alternative is reasonable for purposes of NEPA compliance.
In a letter dated October 18, 2016, EPA informed TVA of the utility’s obligation to
provide the site-specific analysis required by the Coal Ash Rule in order to comply with NEPA:
If the TVA is unable to meet the requirements of the CCR Rule or any
requirements from the states for the preferred alternative [closure in place], the
EPA recommends that the TVA consider re-opening the NEPA process and
potentially re-evaluating its preferred and selected alternatives for any of the
specific impoundments that may be in question. 36
The closure plans posted by TVA for the Cumberland Plant fall far short of providing the sitespecific technical analysis required to support TVA’s selection of closure in place for any of the
ash ponds and disposal areas at the Plant. The plans contain no discussion of site-specific
conditions. Yet, as we have pointed out elsewhere, documents in the possession of TVA and
provided to TDEC demonstrate that coal ash waste is submerged in at least 20 feet of
groundwater, and that groundwater is hydrologically connected to Wells Creek and the
Cumberland River. These documents further reveal that TVA constructed some of the starter
dikes for the impoundments with gravel, creating constant and rapid connectivity to Wells Creek.
To give a specific example, as applied to the closure plan for the Stilling Pond at
Cumberland (which is part of the Main Ash Pond), these site-specific conditions at the
Cumberland Plant have several implications for compliance with the performance standards in
the Coal Ash Rule. In the closure plan, TVA blandly proposes that it will minimize releases to
groundwater and surface water and preclude the impoundment of water by developing a site
grading plan, cap system and stormwater management system. 37 This proposal will not control
or minimize releases “to the maximum extent feasible,” 38 as required by the Rule, because the
waste will be left perpetually submerged in groundwater that is hydrologically connected to the

nearby creek and Cumberland River. Nor will the proposal minimize or eliminate “the
infiltration of liquids into the waste.” 39 In fact, it is obvious that water will constantly enter and
exit the saturated ash, leaching contaminants into the environment, indefinitely. Similarly, the
proposal will not preclude the probability of future impoundment of water, sediment or slurry
because the waste remains submerged in groundwater and the dikes are constructed in part with
lower permeability soil that results in pore water remaining in an impounded state.
Nor does TVA explain how it will comply with the drainage and stabilization and final
cover requirements. The closure plan states conclusorily that TVA will remove the free water
and pore water and stabilize the remaining waste. 40 The closure plan does not explain how TVA
will accomplish this when the ash is perpetually submerged in groundwater. The closure plan
further does not address how the cover system will minimize infiltration and erosion given the
condition of the dikes and the saturated ash. The closure plan cannot meet the performance
standards in light of these conditions, and it makes no attempt to do so. 41
TVA also provides no explanation regarding why it is not planning to immediately close
the Fly Ash Stack and the Gypsum Disposal Area. Both of those units began their lives as
surface impoundments, contain ash submerged in groundwater, and are polluting groundwater
and surface water as described in the Sierra Club NOI. Accordingly, the EIS should analyze a
reasonable range of alternatives for clean closing and removing ash from the Fly Ash Stack and
the Gypsum Disposal Area in addition to the Main Ash Pond and Bottom Ash Pond.
TVA asserts that its analysis of closure alternative in the EIS will “tier” from the analysis
in the PEIS. As Environmental Groups explained at length in comments on the PEIS, that
document provides no site-specific analysis of groundwater and surface water impacts.
Moreover, contrary to the requirements of the federal Coal Ash Rule, the PEIS concludes that
capping a coal ash unit in place is a reasonable alternative where coal ash is buried in
groundwater. 42 The PEIS also fails to include meaningful, site-specific analysis of a reasonable
range of clean closure alternatives, such as:

39

40 C.F.R. § 257.102(d)(i).
TVA Cumberland Closure Plan, 8.
41
Indeed, EPA has counseled that clean closure is necessary where ash is submerged in groundwater. See EPA
Closure Requirements, https://www.epa.gov/coalash/relationship-between-resource-conservation-and-recovery-actscoal-combustion-residuals-rule#Closure (explaining that where small corner of unit is submerged in underlying
aquifer, facility should clean close the submerged portion of the unit).

• Excavation and recycling;
• Excavation and disposal in the new on-site landfill TVA is proposing to build;
• Excavation and removal by rail; and
• Excavation and removal by barge.
For all of these reasons, in addition to the reasons set forth in Environmental Groups’ comments
on the PEIS, TVA cannot permissibly tier to the PEIS to comply with its NEPA obligations.
TVA must start fresh and provide the site-specific analysis required by NEPA, including
an analysis of whether the proposed alternatives will satisfy the minimum performance standards
set forth in the federal Coal Ash Rule. It is imperative that TVA perform a robust analysis now
to avoid having to reopen the NEPA process later, as EPA has indicated TVA will be required to
do, if its preferred alternative cannot satisfy the requirements of the Coal Ash Rule or state law. 43
B. Options for Management and Disposal of Dry CCR

In the Scoping Notice, TVA asserts that for newly-generated “dry” coal ash, disposal in
“a new on-site landfill or hauling CCR to an existing offsite permitted landfill are the most
reasonable alternatives….” 44 This assertion begs the larger question: The retirement of the
Cumberland Plant would eliminate the generation of new, “dry” coal ash and therefore eliminate
any purported need for additional coal ash disposal facilities. Thus, ceasing to burn coal at the
Cumberland Plant is an alternative that should be considered in the EIS.
Moreover, to the extent TVA intends to construct a new on-site landfill for disposal of
coal ash, it should first consider using such a landfill for the disposal of the Plant’s legacy coal
ash, which is stored in the unlined pits described in Section I and II.A above and is currently
contaminating groundwater and surface water at and near the Plant. In TVA’s Public Scoping
Information Packet, TVA suggests that it may continue to use the Fly Ash Stack for disposal. 45
Assuming TVA intends this proposal to be part of a “no action” alternative, it must consider the
logical consequences of continuing to dispose of ash in an unlined, leaking pit that is polluting
groundwater and surface water in violation of the Clean Water Act and other laws. Excavating
coal ash from the Fly Ash Stack and other impoundments, recycling the ash to the extent
feasible, and disposing of any remaining ash in the proposed on-site, lined landfill is an
alternative that should be considered in the EIS.

Any new on-site landfill will need to comply with all of the requirements of the federal
Coal Ash Rule, including the location restrictions set forth in 40 C.F.R. §§ 257.60-64. A new
on-site landfill must also comply with the requirements of the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal
Act and its implementing regulations. The EIS should address how its proposed on-site landfill
will comply with these laws and regulations. In particular, the EIS should address the
hydrogeology of the proposed landfill site and whether the site is situated atop the Wells Creek
Structure, which is characterized by highly unpredictable, fractured bedrock.
With respect to hauling coal ash off site to an existing permitted landfill, TVA should
consider a reasonable range of options, including: (1) transportation by rail and barge; (2)
varying distances to potential landfills; and (3) opportunities for additional coal ash recycling.
TVA must also consider the environmental justice implications of the selection of a
particular site for coal ash disposal. In the aftermath of the Kingston coal ash spill, TVA
transported ash to the Arrowhead Landfill in Perry County, Alabama, a landfill in an
environmental justice community with repeated violations of pollution laws. 46 In September
2016, the United States Commission on Civil Rights issued a report finding that the decision to
move coal ash to the Arrowhead Landfill was primarily based on technical considerations,
including cost, and did not properly take into account environmental justice concerns. 47 This
must not happen again. TVA must ensure that any disposal location for its coal ash complies
with laws designed to protect people from pollution, and takes into account disproportionate
impacts on communities that are already burdened.

C. Construction of a Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility
Finally, TVA proposes to construct and operate a new bottom ash dewatering facility. 48
TVA’s Public Scoping Information Packet explains that TVA is considering “options for using a
continuous or once-through system where water left over from the dewatering process would be

treated and then discharged through an existing permitted outfall or recirculated back into the
plant for future sluicing operations.” 49
TVA identifies compliance with the Effluent Limitation Guidelines as one of the
purposes of its proposed project. 50 The Effluent Limitation Guidelines require zero discharge
from bottom ash transport water beginning in 2018. 51 TVA’s proposed “once-through” option
would result in continued discharges of toxic wastewater pollution into the Cumberland River.
Because it would violate the Effluent Limitation Guidelines, TVA’s proposed “once-through”
option does not satisfy the purpose and need for the proposed project.
Other alternatives not discussed by TVA in the Scoping Notice should be included in the
EIS. First, as discussed above, TVA should include analysis of an alternative in which TVA
retires the Cumberland Plant. 52 By retiring the Plant, TVA would cease production of toxic
bottom ash and bottom ash wastewater and eliminate the need for a bottom ash dewatering
facility. Second, in addition to recirculating systems that require dewatering facilities, EPA
identifies dry handling of bottom ash as an alternative to comply with the zero discharge limit. 53
The EIS should evaluate dry handling in addition to dewatering.
Any alternative in which TVA will continue to generate bottom ash must include an
analysis of how TVA will dispose of the ash, the impacts associated with such disposal, and
whether such disposal will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. See Sections I and
II.A and B above.
In sum, the Cumberland Plant contributes a significant amount of water pollution to a
watershed that serves as a highly-valued recreational resource and a drinking water source for
citizens of the State of Tennessee. The federal Clean Water Act, Coal Ash Rule, Effluent
Limitation Guidelines, and state water quality and solid waste disposal laws must form the basis
for determining the range of alternatives available to TVA for “long term management of CCR
produced at CUF.” 54 TVA must take these laws and regulations fully into account. Moreover,
to comply with these laws and regulations and with NEPA, TVA must prepare an EIS that

SCOPING COMMENT FORM LETTER
As TVA drafts its plans for storage of coal ash from the Cumberland coal plant, I
respectfully urge that you move the waste to dry, lined storage away from water resources
like Wells Creek and the Cumberland River. This site is not suitable for disposing coal ash
waste. The Cumberland Plant and its unlined, leaking coal ash waste pits were constructed

You need to clean up your mess!!!

coachburgdorf@gmail.com

You must move and secure the coal ash away from any water
resource. If you do not, you will knowingly be creating poison water
for everyone downstream with a resulting massive loss of innocent
lives. You cannot knowingly do such a thing!

You messed up enough in Kingston; now it is time to get this fixed!

Would you drink the contaminated water? Please consider cleaning
up the mess TVA has made and be responsible earth stewards.
Without water, there is no life.
Why have you not done anything about this!? Isn't that what your
job is for? To protect our best interests!!??
We want clean water. What if you used well water like we do?
We must be very careful to protect our water ways & ground water
for the health and safety of Americans
We have to have clean water to. Drink.
We have already had a very serious incident in Tennessee with coal
ash, and we need to take care this does not happen again. Please
take care with this waste. Our water supplies are too valuable to
spoil.
We desperately need clean potable water, don't pollute it.
We are all well aware of the catastrophic damage done by the last
deluge of coal ash waste. We must not have another. Move the coal
ash waste to a safe storage area.

dollycarlisle@comcast.net

We all need clean water. We should have learned from Flint that we
need to take measures to protect our health and water, as well as
including the places where we live and spend time in recreation. We
expect companies to do the right thing for the good of everyone.
We all deserve the assurance of having clean drinking water. Do
what's right for your fellow citizens.

hmsyota@yahoo.com

Water is Tennessee's most precious resource. TVA has the resources
and the power (and a moral obligation) to do what's right for the
people and the state of Tennessee. Please put people and our
precious environment ahead of profit. Do the right thing!

Water is life! Clean drinking is what and we pay our water Bills for!
Water is life
Wasn't the coal ash spill in East TN enough for us to realize how bad
leaving ash near creeks and rivers? Let's learn from past incidents
and avoid potential problems.
TVA is supposed to be a public utility and they need to act
responsibly not like they are in a 3rd world country where
environmental issues don't matter.
TVA Directors, Do you care about future generations? We only have
this planet to live on! I wish you and other Big Business (Greedy)
Polluters would get your act together before it's too late! You have
already done too much damage! Submitted by a very concerned
citizen.
Too much damage has been done.Please no more.We must protect
our water
to help protect fish species!!!!!
This means so much to so many - many who may not yet even
realize it. Thank you, Tom Williams
This is simply unacceptable!
Think of your children and grand children. Have you learned nothing
from the Kingston spill?
Think and protect our water. We can do without things but NO life is
sustainable without water!!!

consultroger@hotmail.com

The world has enough to worry about without having to worry
about our drinking water. Do the right thing--not the easy thing.
The Tennessee Valley region depends on clean water for drinking,
but also for fishing (which brings many people to tournaments) as
well as other tourists who come for the beauty of our mountains
and streams. Coal ash ruins the streams and polutes our lives with
toxic substantes.

kimsings3@yahoo.com

The storage of toxic coal ash, whenever or wherever it's done,
should be done with the utmost safety in mind, always! Past storage
has been quite horrible with disastrous results. NO ONE can afford
to deal with future spills, especially into waterways. To store coal
ash near ANY waterway is extremely short sighted, and I would go
so far as to call it completely stupid. PLEASE NO MORE UNSAFE
STORAGE!!!!!!!!!!

winifredsilvers@yahoo.com

abigail.tylor@yahoo.com

The so-called externalities, the actual price to be paid for burning
fossil fuels is coming home to roost. You knew of the dangers, but
TVA is coal and oil's bitch and you have let them have their way with
you at the expense of humanity. Pay the piper and fix this problem
the right way, then change tacks and move us toward solar and
wind like a good public servant should. Thank you for your time.
There isn't that great of health insurance in this state to risk health
issues. IF you really are doing this I HOPE YOU are drinking this
water as well. This is so sad. Why do we get increases in our water
bill AFTER the fact. No excuses, you see it happening from the
passed practices.
There are are myriad of other options for how to handle the coal
ash waste that don't involve letting it continue to sit and seep into
our water. I beg you, don't continue to ignore this problem. It won't
go away. Water is a finite, precious resource that we cannot afford
to pollute.

geneva.andrews@icloud.com

The people of Tennessee might consider those sky high salaries and
bonuses to be justified IF the TVA acts responsibly to protect our air
and water. Otherwise, it's just one more example of fraud and
corruption. Please do the right thing by your citizens who
apparently have no say about the quality of the water we drink.

The most precious commodity we have on this earth is our water. I
respectfully ask that you not pollute the water supply that we and
future generations will be dependent on. Please clean up your
pollution and protect our water sources.
The citizens of Tennessee have a right to have safe water for
consumption.
The bottom line is coal ash waste must be moved way from our
water supplies. Thank you for your attention to my views.
The ash threatens not only our water supply but it would affect
water for the animals in the area as well.
Take a look at the news, please. A lot of our water is already
contaminated. Please do not add more to an already bad situation.
Be part of making Tennessee green and clean again. Thank you.
Storing coal ash in unlined pits is a dangerous practice that will
contaminate our waters.
Send the ash to Washington and pile it on the white house lawn.
After the inauguration of course.

Really, we should be moving away from coal entirely--and not to
nuclear power, which has its own waste problems, nor to oil or gas,
which have theirs! Reducing demand is key.
Pleas move coal ash to lined pits away from water! Thank you for
your consideration
PLEASE TAKE THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO INSURE THAT
FUTURE "FLINT MICHIGAN" TRAGEDIES WILL NOT OCCUR IN OUR
DRINKING WATER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
MARGARET MOCK

mona.ellen@hotmail.com

Please stop poisoning Tennesee's beautiful rivers, lakes & land with
horribly toxic coal ash! Hasn't TVA learned ANYTHING from the
Kinston coal ash spill & its sad & expensive aftermath? As a citizen &
ratepayer, I feel that TVA executives should be held accountable if
they continue to store & dispose of highly toxic coal ash in ways
that risk the health of nearby & downstream residents. Do not think
people have forgotten TVA 's past negligence & will tolerate more
contamination, whether through slowly-leaking storage pits or
massive spills!
Please responsible to take care of the people and the earth that
they live on. Life is not all about profit.
Please protest our water from these hazards. Storage of coal ash in
unlined pits where toxins can leach into or drinking water, lakes,
and the waters of Wells Creek and the Cumberland Rivers is
unacceptable.
Please protect the people who live in Tennessee from contaminated
water and provide us with safe drinking water. Thank you. M.

please move the ash to a lined area away from the river. thanks Paul
Please make our drinking water safe.
Please keep our waters safe.

rowes@pop.belmont.edu

Please keep our water safe! Lining your pits and repairing leaks, plus
moving the worst pits away from waterways, should not be that
difficult, and would be cheaper than an enormous violation fine!

Please ensure that we will have safe drinking water now and for our
children and future. The cost of health problems from polluted
water is much greater than the immediate cost of clean up now.
Please do this right! Our water is too important.
Please do the right thing and correct this problem now.
Please do not run the risk of creating another Flint Michigan fiasco
because of poor administrative choices, such as leaving the coal ash
near our water sources.
Please don't let our water continue to be poisoned. Think of the toll
this will take on human health, not just the bottom line. Protect TN
citizens from further poisoning.
Please don't allow further pollution of our drinking water. Our water
isn't in very good condition as it is and we believe the citizens of
Middle Tennessee deserve decent water. Remember, TVA, it's your
water too.
Please do all you can to protect our water!!!
Please deal with this the proper way and don't take risks, it's not
worth it in the long run
Please. We canNOT live without clean water. We can live without
coal. Please STOP the pollution
Please...this is important to me and my family.
Please, protect our water!
Our water is a precious commodity and needs to be protected.
Thank you.
Our drinking water is primary to life and health for everyone!
Our clean water sources must be your priority. There must never be
another disaster in our state like the last coal ash pit failure. That is
unacceptable.
Our children and grandchildren deserve your very best
environmental stewardship, make the responsible environmental
choice for a legacy that will make your children and grandchildren
proud by eliminating the risk of ground and waterways
contamination.
Next to the air, our water is our singlemost important vital resource.
Please consider it's importance to LIFE on this planet.
Look at what happened at Kingston, TN
LET US NOT BE LIKE FLINT, MICHIGAN. THANK YOU.
Keep Mitch McConnell and his hoodlums out of our water
systems...its one of only a few natural resources left...don't ruin it
with coal sludge or fracking....please!!!!

It is unconscionable for the TVA to leave such contaminants at any
site where they can pollute our precious water supplies!
It is TVA's responsibility to make sure that they don't pollute our
water!!
It is so important to protect our water. Thank you for reading my
letter.
It is far easier and economical to do this right the first time than to
come behind and do it a second time.
I thought fly ash was being blended into concrete. That was the
justification for creating so much of it in the first place.

cheryl619@peoplepc.com

I think we in Tennessee are the perfect example of why there is no
such thing as "clean" coal. It, to say the least, is environmentally
destructive on so many levels and, now, it is too expensive as a
electricity generating source to even use. The cost of cleanup,
environmental damage inherent in the mining and use, and the high
cost to consumers make coal obsolete. Please, act to get the coal
ash contained and then just abandon coal as a generating source for
our energy in Tennessee. We have abundant wind and plenty of sun
to switch entirely to them as our main, if not only, source of energy.
This beautiful state deserves all the care and consideration we can
give it.
It's time to move away from coal and use more solar and Keshe
plasma technology to produce power.

It's important we remember safety first with anything that might
endanger the health of the people of the Valley and to continue to
show TVA as a leader in the valley particularly in the area of safety.
It's a no brainer clean up your act tva.

donyhgebauer@gmail.com

I stand 100% with Sierra club statement. I do not consent or agree
to intoxicating Tennessee waters. Thus For immediately I will the
spread word to our leaders, community, and state of current
matters involving TVA and Tennessee waters.

coal ash.

I live in Tennessee and frequent the Cumberland Mountains,
Cumberland River areas often. We don't need another coal ash spill
to contaminate the water and kill fish and animals again.
I live in Clarksville, and I don't want my water to be poisoned by coal
residue. Please make every effect to get out of this area and away
from our drinking water.
I know that there are hazards in moving this waste, but the hazards
are greater to leave it in place.
I hope that those in charge of these decisions will choose what is
right, not what is easy. America proudly claims to be the best and
strongest in the world. How will that continue to be the case if
continue to poison our children and our planet?
I have seen the devastation of Kingston. Please be environmentally
responsible.
I have lived in Nashville for most of my life, and it is so important to
protect the quality of our water. Drinking water for Nashville comes
from the Cumberland River!
I have land in Kingston, I don't want another spill or anyway the coal
ash can get into our water!! Water is LIFE ??
I have always been an admirer of what the TVA has done for the
standard of living in its service area; not so much the bloated
salaries of its top administrators or its surprising lack of concern for
the very health and safety of its area of responsibility. The leaking of
the dangerous coal ash is an environmental disaster and I would
expect you, in all good conscience, to act appropriately by moving
this waste awayfrom our waterways and drinking supplies, using
leak-proof methods of protecting ground water wherever the final
destination.
If you don't help protect our beautiful countryside and waterways -who will? Please help the people of Tennessee -- not the coal
companies. Thank you.
If we don't put air and water quality first above all other things in
the state of TN we can kiss our economy goodbye because there
won't be anyone living here to actually keep things going. Please
take action and protect our water!!

I filter my water, but I know these filters don't get 100% of
pollutants or toxins out of the water. Furthermore, many residents
either don't have the privilege to afford to filter their water or do
not take the time to do so. We live in a country where clean
drinking water is expected. This leaves many unaware of any
potential harm by these pollutants and toxins. I believe it is the
TVA's job to ensure Tennesseeans get the purest water possible.
Moving this waste is a step to continue to provide clean water for
this generation and future generations.
I do not want coal ash in my drinking water, find a proper way to
dispose of it, if not, you will be putting the health of Tennesseans at
risk.

nmcfadden9@gmail.com

I consider TVA to be one of the most respected entitys in existence.
Do not disappoint us. We depend on you and your integrity.
I can't believe that after Kingston, you want unlined pits Shame,
shame!

joanneboyd@comcast.net

I beg you to use all of your resources to protect our water. We all
know that the planet is already suffering from a lack of good, clean
drinking water. The area we live is beautiful and your company has
helped keep it that way. I beg you to do the right thing.

I am extremely concerned about coal ash is contained and about
contamination of ground and drinking water!! I have a young
daughter and I don't want her to be poisoned from the water she
drinks. I know that it is expensive to move the coal ash to a lined,
more suitable site, but trying to clean up after a disastrous spill is
also expensive and the damage can never truly be undone. Please
take the long view and protect our children! My family's drinking
water comes from the Cumberland River. I'm concerned about
another spill like in Kingston. Please protect us!!!
I am a resident of Knoxville and this directly concerns me.
Haven't you caught on yet?? Coal ash poisons our drinking water
when greed drives companies.
Fracking and oil pipelines are doing damage to our water already.
This is the only planet we have.

fotogator@comcast.net

For too many years the health and safety of the public has been
disregarded. Projects from big/government need to be thought
through before they are implemented. This is just another case
where that did not happen. Does the coal ash cause a problem for
water supplies? If "Yes" than you need to get rid of it!

Do what is right. Not what is cheap.
Do the right thing.
Do the right thing.
Do not take our drinking water from the aquifer in Memphis for
your plant. Take it from the Mississippi River or cancel the plant.
Don't wait for another Kingston Steam Plant-like release to then
clean up.
Don't let it happen again!
Considering the cost of cleanup, TVA should move quickly to safely
store coal ash. It is so disappointing that TVA is not moving towards
substantially further reducing the reliance on coal, especially given
past errors in judgement.

bach2468@yahoo.com

Coal Combustion Products can also be "recycled" into concrete
building products and asphalt (which better retain the toxic
components of coal ash than leaving it in an unlined reservoir),
thereby being both environmentally and economically
advantageous when compared to simply storing it in an unlined
reservoir. Thank you, Emily Graves, M.D.
Clean water is our birth right. We mustn't externalize coal costs in
either time or money. If coal is cheap enough to use (which I
question) it is cheap enough to use right. Please use lined ash pits in
th future.

sr.madeleine.mary@gmail.com

Clean up the mess and put it in lined pits to protect the population!

As president of the Cumberland-Harpeth Audubon Society
(Nashville) we have a great interest in improving the water quality
of the Cumberland River watershed. We strongly support the
measures outlined above. Please do everything possible to improve
the sequestration of coal ash from our waterways and drinking
water sources. Thanks, Bill Franks
As many are beginning to realize, Water is Life. I urge you to be a
leader in protecting this vital resource for this and all the
generations to come.

princecastledlp@gmail.com

As a Tennessean, I want the ash moved out of those potentially
leaky unlined pits and away from our waterways. Common sense
says use dry lined pits away from waterways. Sometimes it's just not
about saving money but keeping people and the environment safe.

A price can not be put on the value of Tennessee's citizens and it's
environment. It is your duty to protect them using the best
technology available so the process doesn't need to be repeated in
the near future due to dangerous, outdated methods used to save
money..
Air and water quality are precious to everone. I am hoping TVA will
become a better steward of our resources.

After the largest coal ash industrial spill in HISTORY occurred in 2008
in Roane County, Tennessee, and not only was in our water and air
destroyed, we are just getting back birds, bees, fish and wildlife.m
This should be a NO Thinking action. Protect us and the
environment.
After the catastrophic NES ash spill it is essential the TVA protect
the environment. It never should have happened, criminally
negligent to say the least.
Act responsibly by removing coal ash to lined pits.

TVA's own studies show that you are poisoning the groundwater
with pollutants including arsenic and boron and probably other
toxins. Why have you allowed such a thing as this to happen?
Should anyone need to tell you to clean it up? No they should not.
Please do the right thing. I will volunteer my time and will find
others to do so as well. I will help you. Free of charge. It's all about
the money, isn't it? 615-680-2740
Merry Christmas! Please dispose of the waste properly! Don't you
love Tennessee? 615-680-2740
Happy Holidays! Please make the right choice. Hit you up again
tomorrow. 615-680-2740
Every day. I have loved ones in that area. 615-680-2740
Dump it at trumps front door.
Do the right thing! Love from Hartsville. 615-680-2740
Business as usual at this point is a death sentence for the human
race and our beautiful planet. Please, dispose of it properly. Isn't
Tennessee gorgeous? There's no other place I'd rather be. Much
love from Hartsville. 615-680-2740

The best way to deal with coal ash is to close or retire all tea coal plants as soon as possible and replace them with
wind, solar and natural gas plants. Thank you. Jack Gaw

Cumberland Fossil Plant
Coal Combustion Residual Management
Environmental Impact Statement
Introduction
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
intends to prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) to address the potential
environmental effects associated with
management of coal combustion residual
(CCR) material produced at the Cumberland
Fossil Plant (CUF) located near Cumberland
City, Tennessee (see Figure 1). The
purpose of the EIS is to address long-term
management of CCR produced at CUF. The
project will also help TVA comply with
present and future regulatory requirements
related
to
CCR
production
and
management, including those of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA’s)
CCR Rule and Effluent Limitations
Guidelines and those of the State of
Tennessee.

Figure 1. Cumberland Fossil Plant

Background
CUF is TVA’s largest coal-fired plant by capacity, and was built between 1968 and 1973. CUF generates
enough energy to supply about 1.1 million homes. It consumes an average of 5.6 million tons of coal
annually and produces approximately 1.3 million tons of CCR a year. Of the CCR produced, CUF sells
approximately 75 percent of the CCR produced (725,000 tons of gypsum and 275,000 tons of fly ash)
annually for beneficial reuse as raw manufacturing material.
Currently, bottom ash generated by the operating units at CUF is sluiced to the existing bottom ash
impoundment where the material settles out. The treated waste water flows on to the main ash
impoundment for final treatment before discharge. The settled bottom ash is excavated and stacked for
transport to the fly ash stack. Fly ash is conveyed dry from the plant and transported to the fly ash stack.
Gypsum is conveyed to an adjacent wall-board manufacturer or to lined channels where it is dewatered.
It is stockpiled for later use or disposed in the gypsum
stack.
What is the Purpose of the

Environmental Impact Statement?
The purpose of this EIS is to evaluate
appropriate and reasonable future CCR
management alternatives at CUF, assess
the potential impacts of the alternatives and
identify the preferred alternative that fully
meets the project needs.

TVA intends to transition from a wet-sluiced bottom ash
disposal system to a dry ash disposal system in order to
fulfill its goal to eliminate wet ash storage at its coal
plants.
To enable bottom ash wet-to-dry conversion, TVA will
evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a new
bottom ash dewatering facility and options for
management and disposal of dry CCR produced at CUF.

Cumberland Fossil Plant CCR Management
Environmental Impact Statement

Public Scoping Information Packet

December 2016

TVA will also evaluate stopping operations and closing the Bottom Ash and the Main Ash Impoundments.
TVA will develop and evaluate various alternatives in the EIS, including the No Action Alternative.

What are the Needs for the Project?
The current CUF fly ash stack has capacity to manage dry fly
and bottom ash until about 2024. This storage capacity,
however, is dependent upon demonstrating by 2018 that the
impoundments meet state and federal rules for stability,
location and groundwater monitoring; if they do not, the
impoundments may need to be closed. Due to these potential
limitations, TVA needs to evaluate additional long-term CCR
management alternatives.
Additionally, the TVA Board of Directors committed to
converting the wet ash management systems at all coal-fired
plants, including at CUF, to dry storage systems. This project
helps meet that commitment.
On April 17, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) published the final Disposal of Coal Combustion
Residuals from Electric Utilities rule (CCR Rule) in the Federal
Register. Under the CCR Rule, if an impoundment cannot
demonstrate that it meets stability, location and groundwater
requirements by 2018, an impoundment may be subject to a
five-year closure deadline. On September 30, 2015, EPA
finalized its Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for
the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category
(ELGs). The ELGs set new or additional requirements for
wastewater streams from fossil-fueled power plants, including
waste streams from fly ash and bottom ash operations. These
requirements may affect CUF’s current CCR management
processes.

Proposed Action
TVA’s proposed action is the long-term management of CCR
at CUF. The proposed action will support the implementation
of TVA’s goal to eliminate wet CCR storage and ensure
compliance with the CCR Rule and ELG requirements.

Cumberland Plant CCR Management EIS

What are CCRs
CCRs are byproducts produced from
burning coal and include fly ash, bottom
ash, and flue gas desulfurization
materials.
Fly Ash: Fly ash is composed mainly of
non-combustible inorganic material
contained in the coal. Fly ash typically
consists of fine particles that are
entrained in the combustion exhaust
gas.
Bottom Ash: Bottom ash is comprised
of the incombustible coarse particles
that settle to the bottom of the
combustion chamber of a boiler. Bottom
ash or boiler slag slurry is produced from
washing the boiler bottom with a water
jet stream.
Flue Gas Desulfurization Materials:
The burning of coal in boilers produces
flue gas, which is the combustion
exhaust gas that eventually exits via the
stack. It is composed mostly of nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, water vapor, and
oxygen. Flue gas also contains
pollutants such as particulate matter
(PM), nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides.
Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems
or scrubbers remove sulfur oxides from
the flue gas using limestone. Synthetic
gypsum is produced in the chemical
reaction between the limestone and the
sulfur oxides in the flue gas.

Alternatives
The proposed action would include several projects described below and shown on Figure 2 (see
attachment):


No Action Alternative. TVA would continue to manage CCR through its existing wet storage
(Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment) and dry storage (fly ash stack and
gypsum ash stack) system. The No Action Alternative does not meet the purpose and need of
the project.



Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility. Bottom ash is currently wet-sluiced to the bottom ash
impoundment. TVA is proposing to build and operate a bottom ash dewatering facility with options
for using a continuous or once-through system where water left over from the dewatering process
would be treated and then discharged through an existing permitted outfall or recirculated back
into the plant for future sluicing operations.



Landfill. TVA will evaluate disposing of dry CCR at off-site permitted landfills and/or constructing
a new on-site landfill. A new landfill would be designed to provide sufficient storage capacity for
long-term management of CCR generated at CUF.



Closure of the Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment. TVA will evaluate
the closure of these two impoundments. At a programmatic level, TVA has previously considered
two impoundment closure methods: Closure-in-Place or Closure-by-Removal. The alternative
analysis will rely on this programmatic closure evaluation as well evaluating specific issues
related to closing the Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment at CUF.

NEPA Process for EIS
The EIS will be prepared following the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
The EIS will identify and assess potential social, economic, and environmental impacts of reasonable
alternatives for long-term management of CUF’s CCR to support TVA decision-making. TVA’s preferred
alternative will be protective of people’s health and the environment.
The CUF EIS will use the findings of the 2016 Programmatic EIS (PEIS) to evaluate the closure
alternatives for the existing Bottom Ash Impoundment and Main Ash Impoundment. The PEIS analyzed
methods for closing impoundments that hold CCR materials at TVA fossil plants and identified specific
screening and evaluation factors to help frame its evaluation of closures at its other facilities. The July
2016 Record of Decision determined that for qualifying impoundments, future environmental reviews of
CCR impoundment closures could build off or tier from the PEIS. The CUF EIS is intended to tier or
build off of the 2016 PEIS to evaluate the closure alternatives for the existing Bottom Ash Impoundment
and Main Ash Impoundment.

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
325216056
October 8, 2017
Anita Masters
NEPA Surface Water
Prepared by:
A.C. Williams and C.L. McEntyre

Introduction/Project Description

TVA is proposing to change the way that coal combustion residuals (CCR) are managed
at the Cumberland Fossil Plant (CUF) located in Stewart County, Tennessee. CCRs at
CUF are byproducts produced from burning coal and include fly ash, hydrated lime,
bottom ash, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) materials. Currently, CCR generated by
the operating units at CUF are managed by:
•

sluicing bottom ash to the existing bottom ash pond,

•

conveying dry fly ash to the dry ash stacking area, and

•

sluicing FGD to the gypsum disposal complex area.

These CCR materials together with coal yard runoff, sumps, chemical and non-chemical
metal cleaning wastewaters, and some yard drainage are discharged to the existing
main ash pond. This main ash pond discharges to an existing stilling pond which
discharges through National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Internal
Monitoring Point (IMP) 001 to the CUF condenser cooling water (CCW) channel. The
CCW discharges through Outfall 002 to the Cumberland River at Cumberland River mile
(CRM) 103. TVA intends to transition from a wet bottom ash disposal system to a dry
bottom ash disposal system as part of a new agency-wide directive. Therefore, TVA has
proposed the following projects at CUF:
•
•
•

construct and operate a new bottom ash dewatering facility,
closure of the existing main ash impoundment and stilling impoundment, either
by closure in-place or by removal;
construct and operate a new special waste landfill for future ash or haul future
ash to an existing offsite landfill.

On April 17, 2015, the EPA established national criteria and schedules for the
management and closure of CCR facilities (80 Federal Register 21302) (herein referred
to as the CCR Rule).
This Surface Water Technical Memorandum is in support of the preparation of an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA), to analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the
implementation of these new CCR management operations at CUF.

Location of Existing CCR Facilities

The areas within the existing plant footprint are bordered to the south and west by Wells
Creek and to the north by the Cumberland River. The areas have been previously
disturbed and remain an active part of the CUF facility.
The new areas located outside of the existing plant facility to the south and southwest
consist of a mixture of land uses. The proposed Landfill Area is completely wooded while
the proposed Borrow Area consists largely of pasture with wooded fence lines and
drainage corridors. The proposed Access Route consists of an existing farm road that
leads to an existing bridge structure over Wells Creek. Drainage on the property flows
generally north and west to Wells Creek and Scott Branch.

Methods and Assumptions

2.1 Methods
Surface water NEPA evaluations follow the NEPA methodology of: (a) describing and
assessing the existing environment, (b) evaluating the potential changes which could
occur from the proposed actions or projects, and (c) estimating the potential impacts
those changes could have on the existing environment.
For surface water quality, this process normally consists of first describing the existing
surface waters adjacent to the proposed actions/projects including any existing
wastewater streams that currently discharge into those surface waters. The second step
is to estimate any new or changed wastewater streams that could result from the
proposed actions and compare them to any existing wastewater streams. The third and
final step is to evaluate the proposed changes and discuss the potential impacts that
those changes could have on surface water quality.
2.2

2.3

Assumptions
• This NEPA review of CCR impoundment closures and new dewatering facilities
at CUF is based on and tiers off the Final Ash Impoundment Closure
Environmental Impact Statement, Part 1 – Programmatic NEPA Review,
prepared by TVA in June 2016. It is available at the following website:
https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/EnvironmentalReviews/Closure-of-Coal-Combustion-Residual-Impoundments.
•

Current operations at CUF comply with all applicable regulations and permits.

•

Wolf Creek Dam repairs were completed in 2013 and full pool elevations were
restored in 2014. River flows past the plant have returned to historical norms,
and TVA’s biological assessments indicate that biological recovery is occurring
and a balanced, indigenous population of aquatic life is returning to the river
downstream of the plant.

•

Reductions in wastewater loadings discharged to surface waters resulting from
the proposed actions should have beneficial impacts on surface water quality.

Affected Environment – Surface Water

3.1 Surface Water – Lower Cumberland River, Barkley Reservoir
CUF is in northern middle Tennessee, southwest of Clarksville on the south shore of
Barkley Reservoir, (Cumberland River) approximately 72 miles upstream of Barkley
Dam. Unit 1 began commercial operation in 1981 and Unit 2 in 1982. Net operating
capacity is approximately 2,300 MW of electricity. With both units at maximum power,
maximum condenser cooling water (CCW) demand is 2,097 million gallons per day
(MGD).
CUF is drained by permitted storm water outfalls, wet weather conveyances, the CCW
discharge (Outfall 002), and process and storm water discharges from the Main Ash
Impoundment (Internal Monitoring Point [IMP] 001). The CCW, Outfall 002, discharges
to the Cumberland River at CRM 102.8. The plant intake is located approximately at
CRM 103.2 and intakes water for cooling and process purposes (TDEC 2008a).
The Lake Barkley Watershed (USGS HUC 05130205) is approximately 2,343 square
miles with approximately 982 square miles in Tennessee and includes parts of six
counties in Tennessee. As part of the Cumberland River drainage basin, the watershed
has 1,258 stream miles and 27,000 acres in Tennessee. The land use in the watershed
is primarily deciduous forest (68%) and agricultural (22% with 13% in pasture/hay, 5% in
grassland/herbaceous and 4% in row crops). The remainder is low intensity residential
comprising 4% and evergreen forest, wetlands, and open water comprising 2% each.
Therefore, most of the watershed has little impervious surface (<2 to 5%). (TDEC
2008a)
The Lake Barkley Watershed in Tennessee is mainly karst topography characterized by
sinkholes, springs, disappearing streams and caves. Karst describes a landform that
indicates dissolution of underlying soluble rocks by surface water or ground water. The
area around CUF is in the Western Highland Rim (71f) subecoregion which is
characterized by dissected, rolling terrain of open hills. Streams are characterized by
coarse chert gravel and sand substrates with areas of bedrock, moderate gradients, and
relatively clear water. (TDEC 2008)
The Lower Cumberland River from the Kentucky-Tennessee line (CRM 74.6) to
Cummings Creek (CRM 118.3) is classified for use for domestic and industrial water
supply, fish and aquatic life, recreation, livestock watering and wildlife, and irrigation.
Wells Creek from mile 0.0 to its origin is classified for use for fish and aquatic life,
recreation, livestock watering and wildlife, and irrigation (TDEC 2013). No Nationwide
Rivers Inventory streams or Wild and Scenic Rivers are near the proposed action. Scott
Branch adjacent to CUF has not been assessed, but would assume designations for
aquatic life, recreation, livestock watering and wildlife, and irrigation (TDEC 2013)..
The Cumberland River (Barkley Reservoir) downstream of CUF is subject to the
influence of the thermal discharges from the plant. Under normal conditions, the
Cumberland River flow near CUF is primarily dependent upon releases from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Cheatham Dam located approximately 46 miles
upstream, and to a lesser extent by downstream releases from Barkley Dam and
tributary inflows upstream of the plant. However, in 2007, leakage was discovered in
4

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

USACE’s Wolf Creek Dam upstream of CUF at CRM 460.9 which impounds the 65,530acre Lake Cumberland in Russell County, KY. To accommodate repairs, the reservoir
pool was lowered substantially which resulted in reduced flows in the Cumberland River
system downstream for approximately 5 years.
During this time of reduced river flows; and even though the plant reduced power
production (derated) to comply with thermal discharge limits, a large proportion of the
flow in the river was withdrawn by the plant for condenser cooling which magnified the
potential for adverse effects to the aquatic community downstream.
Wolf Creek Dam repairs were completed in 2013 and full pool elevations were restored
in 2014. At this time, river flows past the plant have returned to historical norms, and
TVA’s biological monitoring indicates that biological recovery is occurring and a
balanced, indigenous population of aquatic life is returning to the river downstream of the
plant (TVA 2016a). Barkley Reservoir (TN Waterbody ID TN05130205 015 – 1000) is
still currently listed on the state 303(d) report as impaired, only partially supporting its
designated uses in Stewart and Montgomery counties because of industrial thermal
discharges (TDEC 2016a).
3.2 Onsite Surface Water Features
The ash impoundments and the proposed bottom ash dewatering facility site are in
previously disturbed areas and remain an active part of the CUF facility. These areas are
bordered to the south and west by Wells Creek and to the north by the Cumberland
River. Wells Creek has an 1Q10 (lowest one day flow with an average recurrence
frequency of once in 10 years) of 8.72 million gallons per day (MGD) based on a USGS
study in 1992 (USGS 1992) and Scotts Branch (a tributary to Wells Creek) is considered
a zero-flow stream.
The proposed landfill site is located to the south and southwest of the main plant area
and is primarily wooded. Drainage on the property flows generally north and west to
Wells Creek and Scott Branch.
Jurisdictional streams and wetlands were delineated within the proposed project areas in
November and December 2016 (Amec Foster Wheeler 2017). As ash impoundments
and manmade drainage features within the existing plant boundary are not considered
jurisdictional, the proposed Bottom Ash Dewatering site, impoundment closure projects,
and laydown areas would not impact any streams or wetlands. One perennial stream,
one intermittent stream, four wet weather conveyance/ephemeral streams, and one
wetland were documented in the project area defined for the proposed landfill and
access road (Figure 3-5). The total linear footage of the portion of the perennial stream
and the intermittent stream within the proposed landfill site is 3,573 feet and 1,211 feet
respectively. The total linear footage of the four wet weather conveyances is 4,111 feet.
Wetlands are addressed in Section 3.13.

3.3.1

Existing CUF Wastewater Streams
Intake and Condenser Cooling Water (CCW)

CUF operates a surface water intake structure that withdraws an average of 2,096 MGD
from the Cumberland River for use as CCW and plant process water (e.g., sluice water,
fire protection, boiler feed water, safety eye wash and showers, and miscellaneous wash
water). Approximately 98 percent of the water withdrawal is used for cooling, while
approximately 2 percent is used for other uses including process water. The withdrawn
water is returned to the river after appropriate treatment and complies with CUF’s
NPDES permit.
3.3.2

Coal Combustion Residue

The existing systems for handling CCR includes several areas that receive and treat
CCR wastewater streams, including the Bottom Ash Impoundment, the Main Ash
Impoundments (including the Stilling Impoundment), the Fly Ash Stacking area, and the
Gypsum Stack (see Figure 1).
Bottom Ash
Approximately 8 percent of the coal burned at CUF remains as ash, of which
approximately 20 percent is bottom ash and 80 percent is fly ash, but varies slightly.
Approximately 70,000 dry tons of bottom ash is wet-sluiced to the bottom ash
impoundment each year.
Bottom ash collects in the bottom of the boiler. It is washed from the boiler bottoms with
jets of water and sluiced to the Bottom ash impoundment where suspended solids are
settled. The bottom ash is dredged and stacked in the Dry Ash Stack and the process
water is conveyed through a series of ditches to the Main Ash Impoundment, which is
west of the powerhouse and north of the Dry Ash Stack. The Main Ash Impoundment
receives runoff from the Dry Ash Stack and Gypsum Disposal Complex via perimeter
ditches in addition to the effluent from the Bottom Ash Impoundment. The Main Ash
Impoundment discharges under a floating skimmer to the Stilling Impoundment. The
Stilling Impoundment discharges through four spillways via IMP 001 into the CCW main
plant discharge channel and via Outfall 002 into Barkley Reservoir. The IMP 001
discharge to the CCW channel has an average flow of 21.73 MGD. TVA is required
under NPDES Permit No. TN0005789 to meet pH, total suspended solids, oil and
grease, and ammonia as nitrogen limits on this discharge (TDEC 2008a and 2008b).
As shown in Table 3-1 below, bottom ash sluice flow at CUF averages 12.69 million
gallons per day (MGD). Precipitation runoff from the coal storage area drains to the ash
impoundment.

Please note all streams that are storm water driven are denoted in average annual daily
flows; however, a storm event can produce flows greater than these amounts in a 24-hour
period.
Ancillary streams flow into these major streams, but are not mentioned in this table.

Air preheater ash is a non-chemical metal cleaning waste containing CCR. It is sluiced to
the Coal Yard Runoff Pond. The discharge flow values above are based on information
gathered for the NPDES permit and represent average daily flows on an annual basis.
Fly Ash
Approximately 282,000 dry tons of fly ash is stacked in the Dry Ash Stack each year.
Approximately 197,000 tons or 70 percent of the fly ash is beneficially reused.
The NPDES permit also requires that IMP 001 be monitored for a series of total metals,
but there are no current limitations for these metals. These metals include cadmium,
chromium, copper, lead, mercury, iron, manganese selenium, and silver. Total dissolved
solids, chloride, sulfate, and fluoride must also be sampled, analyzed, and reported for
IMP 001 (TDEC 2008).

FGD Scrubber Gypsum Byproduct
When the gypsum concentration reaches about 15 percent, solution blow-down is
initiated to maintain equilibrium. This blow-down stream is conveyed either:
•

To one of the two flexible membrane lined slurry settling channels in the northern
portion of the Gypsum Disposal Area.
or

•

It is sent to the SynMat dewatering facility which dewaters and markets the byproduct for wallboard production, and the dewatered (filtrate) waste water stream
is then discharged to the ash impoundment.

The dewatered gypsum is then either placed in the gypsum disposal area or beneficially
reused as commercial grade gypsum. Approximately 629,000 tons of gypsum is
conveyed to the gypsum disposal area. Approximately 566,000 tons or 90 percent of the
gypsum is beneficially reused. The gypsum disposal area drains to the Main Ash
Impoundment.
A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is used at CUF for air pollution control.
Ammonia is added to the flue gases as part of the SCR process to remove nitrogen
oxides. Some ammonia may slip through the SCRs. Most of the ammonia slip would be
removed from the stack gases in the FGD scrubber for that unit and become part of the
FGD scrubber gypsum disposal area wastewater. CUF performs monthly monitoring of
IMP 001 for total ammonia nitrogen per Permit TN0005789.
Other Surface Runoff
The existing plant site runoff is regulated under the NPDES Permit TN0005789. Existing
facilities and BMPs are used to ensure compliance with the permit conditions. Some
plant runoff is directed through the Main Ash Pond system IMP 001 or through the CCW
discharge Outfall 002 discussed above. Other storm water discharges associated with
the industrial activity at CUF is covered by the Tennessee Storm Water Multi-Sector
General Permit for Industrial Activities TNR0510000, Tracking Number TNR051933.

Results of Impact Evaluation – Environmental Consequences to Surface
Water Quality

4.1 Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, TVA would not construct the proposed new facilities, and
no construction impacts would occur. TVA would continue to operate the existing systems
for bottom ash, fly ash, and gypsum. The existing wastewater streams would continue to
be authorized under NPDES Permit TN0005789. Discharges would continue to comply
with all applicable permit limits and therefore, surface water quality adjacent to CUF should
remain approximately the same.
Thus, continued operations at CUF under the No Action Alternative would not be
expected to cause any additional direct or indirect effects to local surface water
resources, and therefore, would not change existing conditions.

Alternative B – Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility, Ash Impoundment Closure
(In-Place or By-Removal to Offsite Landfill), Onsite Landfill for Future CCR
Produced at CUF
Construction Impacts Other than Onsite Landfill

For all these projects, wastewaters generated during construction of the proposed
projects may include construction-related storm water runoff, drainage of work areas,
non-detergent equipment washings and dust control, hydrostatic test discharges and
domestic sewage.
Demolition and construction activities have the potential to temporarily affect surface
water via storm water runoff. TVA would comply with appropriate state and federal
permit requirements. Demolition and construction activities of the associated project
would be located on the plant property. Appropriate best management practices (BMPs)
would be followed, and proposed project activities would be conducted in a manner to
ensure that waste materials are contained, and the introduction of pollutants to the
receiving waters would be minimized. A General Permit for Storm Water Discharges
Associated with Construction Activities (TDEC 2016) would be required for this project.
This permit requires development of a project-specific SWPPP. This plan would identify
specific BMPs to address construction-related activities that would be adopted to
minimize storm water impacts. Additionally, BMPs as described in the Tennessee
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (TDEC 2012), would be used to avoid
contamination of surface water in the Project Area. Where soil disturbance could occur,
the area would be stabilized and vegetated with noninvasive grasses and mulched as
described in the above-mentioned handbook. BMPs or equivalent measures would be
used to avoid contamination of surface water in the Project Area. Therefore, no
significant impacts to surface water would be expected due to surface water runoff from
the construction site. Additionally, because this project would not take place in “Waters
of the United States” or “Waters of the State of Tennessee” or in regulated adjacent
waters, no water quality certification or USACE permit would be required for this project.
Impervious buildings and infrastructure prevent rain from percolating through the soil and
result in additional runoff of water and pollutants into storm drains, ditches, and streams.
Any existing structures and infrastructure would be removed from the project site;
however, they would be replaced with the covered dewatering facility and would alter the
current storm water flows. A portion of the project area is within an industrial site and is
partially covered with impervious structures or ground cover that decreases percolation.
Construction would not significantly increase impervious surface area but it would
increase it. On the proposed landfill site, the area has little infrastructure or impervious
cover therefore storm water flows would be altered significantly.
Equipment washing and dust control discharges would be handled in accordance with
BMPs described in the BMP Plan required by the site’s NPDES Permit TN0005789 to
minimize construction impacts to surface waters.
Onsite hydrostatic testing will have the option to use potable or surface waters and
would be covered under the current NPDES Permit TN0005789.

Surface Water Technical Memorandum

Sanitary wastes generated during construction activities would be collected by the
existing sewage treatment system, on-site septic system(s) or by means of portable
toilets (i.e., porta lets). These portable toilets would be located throughout construction
areas and would be pumped out regularly, and the sewage would be transported by a
vacuum truck to a publicly owned wastewater treatment works that accepts pump out.
Potential on-site borrow areas have been identified and evaluated to ensure the material
is suitable for construction and capping activities for the proposed projects. The borrow
material has been evaluated to ensure that it can met the required compaction
requirements of the proposed designs and other specifications. The onsite NPDES BMP
Plan would cover any needed best management practices that would be required to
ensure that no adverse impacts to surface water would be expected from the use of
these borrow areas.
With the implementation of appropriate BMPs only temporary minor, impacts to
surrounding surface waters would be expected from construction activities associated
with dewatering facilities and impoundment closure.
4.2.2

Construction Impacts from Onsite Landfill for Future Ash

Landfill construction activities could include, but are not limited to, the clearing and grading
of the project site and grading of new separate storm water and leachate basins; the
installation of the landfill facility (including liner and leachate collection fields) and the
installation of a forced main to pump leachate to its discharge outfall. Direct impacts to
3,573 feet of perennial stream and 1,211 feet of intermittent stream would occur as a result
of landfill construction activities (filling and/or culverting). Indirect effects include potential
sedimentation of downstream areas associated with runoff from the construction site.
However, such indirect effects are expected to be minimized by the installation of
detention basis and other BMPs within the construction site.
A characterization of aquatic features was conducted on the proposed project areas.
One perennial stream, one intermittent stream, and four wet weather
conveyance/ephemeral streams were documented on the proposed landfill project area.
The USACE performed a Jurisdictional Determination to determine wetlands and stream
features and concurred with identified resources. The requirement of a state 401 water
quality certification (either an individual or general ARAP permit) and federal 404 permits
to be obtained for any stream/wetland impact and the terms and conditions of these
permits would likely require mitigation, such as contributing to a stream mitigation bank,
for these proposed activities.
4.2.3

Operational Impacts

Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility Operational Impacts
Option 1 - Construction/Operation of a Process Dewatering Facility Utilizing a
Continuous or “Once Through” System
The bottom ash that would be dewatered is currently sluiced from the boiler bottoms to a
series of impoundments, where it settles and then is mechanically dewatered utilizing
heavy machinery. During the interim period between closure of the Bottom Ash
11

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

Impoundment and prior to construction of the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility bottom
ash and gypsum fines would be directed to standalone tanks and would be dipped or
scooped for removal and placed in trucks to be transported to either the current onsite
stack or the future onsite landfill. Once the Bottom Ash Dewatering Facility is
operational, the standalone tanks would be used to support process water treatment or
to support other plant needs. The tanks would be placed within the closed portion of the
Main Ash Impoundment or within the closed portion of the Bottom Ash Impoundment.
Currently the bottom ash sluice stream also sluices economizer ash. CUF currently uses
a 100% Illinois Basin coal blend which does generate a pyrite waste steam; however,
this byproduct production has the potential to change based on the coal blend utilized by
the facility. For the purposes of this project all three of these waste streams would
remain commingled and would go to the dewatering facility to be dewatered and dry
solid waste would be sent to an approved onsite landfill. Depending on the timing of
various phases of construction, there may be a possibility that the impoundment system
could still be operational for a time after the implementation of the dewatering system.
Therefore, sluice water would be released to either the current impoundment system or,
in the future, after closure of the impoundment system to a proposed process water
basins. Either impoundment/basins would ultimately discharged through IMP 001 to the
CCW and Outfall 002 to the Cumberland River. Clarified water from the dewatering
facility would meet current NPDES permit limits.
To support the dewatering effort, an internal study was performed in 2011 to determine
the potential wastewater management issues of the bottom ash and pyrite reject waste
streams during the dewatering process. This study specifically focused on the solubility
of the pyrite/coal mixture, both separately and combined, in the sluice water prior to and
after the dewatering process (TVA 2011).
The results of this study determined that the dewatering was of such a short duration
that the metals and pyritic bacteria had little time to react and cause significant water
chemistry changes, reducing the likelihood of pH and metal accumulation problems in
the dewatered stream. All metals concentrations were below TDEC’s Water Quality
Criteria (WQC) limits. Furthermore, the pH throughout the study period was found to be
within pH range of 6 to 9 standard units (s.u.). This study’s results indicate that the waste
stream that would be generated by this process would likely meet the current TDEC pH
and metals in-stream WQC. In addition, the study illustrated that because the fines
associated with this waste stream were much finer than were previously theorized (TVA
2011b), however final design would have a performance guarantee that would require
the discharge to meet TSS levels at or below the current NPDES requirements. The
effluent flows from the proposed dewatering facility would have additional treatment prior
to discharge from IMP 001. Mitigation measures would be implemented to ensure that
discharges would meet NPDES limits.
Results for operational dewatering systems could vary greatly based on many factors
including the nature and composition of the coal burned, the make-up water used in the
system, and the moisture level of the bottom ash. This study focused upon a dewatering
process with pyritic reject streams, results of this study are applicable to CUF due to
similar coal sources and coal conveyance.

12

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

No direct negative impacts to the surface waters would be anticipated from the operation
of this facility because any discharges would be required to meet NPDES limits and
Tennessee WQC that are developed to be protective of designated uses. Additionally,
associated process storm water associated with this facility would be routed to sumps
and to either the current impoundment system or the future Process Water Basins for
co-treatment prior to discharge.
Discharge Characterization
To characterize the current conditions and changes in the IMP 001 discharge, an
evaluation of in-stream mixing calculations of chemical characteristics was conducted.
These measures are useful in predicting potential impacts to water quality that may arise
resulting from the changes to the bottom ash handling systems.
Results of the surface water mixing analysis under current operations are presented in
Table 4-1. For the current operations analysis, metals data were collected from the IMP
001 impoundment discharge, Outfall 002 and the plant intake, from the recent 24-hour
NPDES sampling conducted in 2016. This information was used to show current
operations with the resultant discharge concentrations after mixing with the receiving
stream. The projected in-stream mixing concentrations were based on analyses of the
CUF intake and the minimum one-day low flow that occurs once in 10 years (i.e., the
“1Q10”) of 678.8 MGD from the Water Quality Based Effluent Calculations in the CUF
NPDES Permit TN0005789 Rationale. The 1Q10 stream flow is the regulated low flow
condition according to U.S. Geological Survey data for the protection of fish and aquatic
life. However, under this low flow condition, the units would either need to be derated or
would not be able to operate due to thermal issues and the need for more intake water
than is available. However, these circumstances are evaluated because they are
deemed conservative and alternative cooling flows are not available.

Results of the in-stream mixing concentrations show that all the constituents except
cadmium would meet the TDEC lowest criteria (i.e., the limit equal to minimum of the
water quality criteria). The thallium exception is the result from testing methods that can
only detect these constituents in concentrations over the TDEC criterion of
0.00024 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Since no thallium was detected in the intake or in
Outfall 002, the mixing calculation conservatively assumes one-half the method
detection limit (MDL); thus, weighting the calculation with assumed thallium detections of
0.0005 mg/L. The conservative use of these assumed values at more than four-times the
health-protective TDEC criterion for thallium salts, predisposes the thallium results to
exceed TDEC criteria. These results, however, are due to limitations in testing methods
and do not represent true impacts to water quality due to thallium concentrations. The

14

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

mixing analysis indicates that the overall impact of current and future dewatering
operations would not cause impacts to surface water quality.
Future metal discharge rates for the proposed operation are conservatively represented
by current conditions depicted in Table 4-1. This shows concentrations of in-stream
metals below Tennessee WQC except for thallium as described previously. Additionally,
in-stream metals concentrations could be further reduced in the proposed dewatering
process through settling or treatment with waste water treatment chemicals in the
dewatering clarifiers. Consequently, future operations of the bottom ash dewatering
facility would be expected to have minor temporary, even potentially beneficial, impacts
on the receiving stream. TVA is aware that this system as designed would not meet
future ELG requirements, which calls for no discharge of bottom ash transport waters.
The dewatering of the bottom ash would be a necessary initial phase of any action to
reduce and/or eliminate this flow, however upgrading or enhancement of this initial
dewatering design may be required to meet future regulations
TVA would conduct an operational characterization of the altered and new waste
streams to confirm that no significant impacts to the Cumberland River would occur from
this action. Additionally, no direct negative (toxic) impacts on the Cumberland River are
anticipated because Outfall 002 would be required to meet NPDES chronic toxicity limits.
If the operational characterization showed impacts, then mitigation measures, including
altered settling times and chemical treatments, would be undertaken to meet
requirements ensuring discharges meet NPDES and chronic toxicity limits and not cause
an exceedance of in-stream TDEC WQC.
Any discharges into surface waters would comply with all NPDES permit limits. Thus,
continued operations at CUF under Option 1 conditions would not be expected to cause
any additional direct or indirect effects to local surface water resources.
Option 2 – Construction/Operation of a Process Dewatering Facility with a
Recirculated Bottom Ash Sluice Stream
This option would have similar impacts to the construction impacts noted above for
Option 1. However, the operational, withdrawals, and discharges details and impacts
would be altered with Option 2, as discussed below.
The dewatering process for Option 2, would be similar to the process for Option 1, with
the addition of recirculating most of the bottom ash sluice transport water. This
recirculation would include a make-up water stream, a low volume continuous blowdown
stream, and an outage waste stream. The make-up water stream would be additional
raw water that would replace or supplement the water lost from evaporation or leakage
in the system. This raw make-up water withdrawal rate would range from 300 to
600 gpm, which is equated to a maximum 0.864 MGD of additional make up water. Not
only would make-up water ensure that water lost in the system was replaced, but it
would help to balance the pH and other chemical constituents in the recirculating system
to maintain the integrity of the system’s infrastructure and materials.
Wastewater would flow from the dewatering conveyor to the clarifier and process flow
tanks and lastly into a wastewater containment facility (or recirculation tank) prior to
being recirculated. The blowdown stream from the containment facility would help to
15

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

regulate the hydraulic flow levels from all two generation units and would reduce the
existing bottom ash discharge from12.844 MGD to a maximum of 2 MGD of process
water. During outages, the waste stream flow from the system could range between 0.2
to 0.5 MGD to purge the system. All process waste streams would be managed to
comply with the site specific NPDES permit.
Discharge Reduction Characterization
Discharge from the bottom ash system would be managed in accordance with the ELGs
finalized on January 4, 2016. Therefore, it is assumed that bottom ash sluice waste
water would not be directly discharged and that the recirculation blow-down stream
would be managed to comply with ELG regulations as applied through the site specific
NPDES permit.
Results of the reduction in loading ranges for Option 2 (i.e., following the bottom ash
dewatering with recirculation) are displayed in Table 4-2. Bottom ash sluice data was
collected at the same time as the 2016 NPDES permit renewal sampling. These
samples were collected from the bottom ash sluice prior to mixing and treatment in the
ash impoundments. The bottom ash sluice data displayed some variability in
concentrations; therefore, the minimum and maximum concentrations were used to
display the range of reduction. It should be noted that this range of reduction does not
reflect the loadings being discharged from IMP 001/Outfall 002 or to the receiving stream
(Cumberland River), but rather the reduction in the loadings being discharged into the
ash impoundment prior to co-treatment.
Some metals concentrations would be expected to decrease with the removal of the
bottom ash waste stream. The analysis indicates that the overall impact of future
dewatering operations with recirculation would have beneficial impacts to surface water
quality. Thus, continued operations at CUF under Option 2 would not be expected to
cause any additional direct and/or indirect impacts to local surface water resources.
As with Option 1, TVA would conduct routine monitoring of the altered and new waste
streams at IMP 001 to confirm this study’s results that no significant impacts to the
Cumberland River would occur from this action. Additionally, no direct negative (toxic)
impacts on the Cumberland River are anticipated because Outfall 002 would be required
to meet NPDES chronic toxicity limits. If the routine monitoring shows impacts, then
mitigation measures, including altered settling times and chemical treatments, would be
undertaken to meet requirements for ensuring that discharges meet NPDES and chronic
toxicity limits.

Ash Impoundment Closure Operational Impacts

Existing flows to the Main Ash Impoundment would be rerouted prior to closure. The
proposed plan to close the existing bottom ash impoundment, main ash and stilling
impoundments would not take place until the proposed bottom ash dewatering facility
and a wastewater treatment plant are in service. The Bottom Ash Impoundment
comprises approximately 6.8 acres and 334,000 cubic yards of CCR. The Main Ash
impoundment comprises 53.7 acres and contains approximately 1.1 million cubic yards
of CCR. Dewatering of the impoundments and stabilization of the ash would be required
in areas where ponding is currently present. The closure of the northern slope of the
divider dike between the impoundment and the Fly Ash Stack would be included in each
alternative. Closure of the southern slope of this dike to the crest would be included with
the Fly Ash Stack closure cap system.
The main operational change that would take place with the closure of the
impoundments at CUF is the change in management of the onsite storm water and
process waste water that is currently treated. The main ash and stilling impoundments
would be closed and a portion converted to process water basins to treat flows before
17

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

discharge to the CCW channel via IMP 001, then discharge to the Cumberland River via
Outfall 002. The wastewater treatment facility would be designed and operated to ensure
compliance with all TDEC regulations and limits and TN Water Quality Standards.
Changing from the existing system to the proposed bottom ash dewatering facility and
wastewater treatment system would require replacing the assimilative capacity currently
used for treating storm water, air pre-heater washes (APHW), low volume waste
streams, and station sump discharges with equivalent or greater treatment in the new
facilities.
Existing outfall structures associated with the Main Ash Impoundment would be removed
and/or replaced with new ditches and/or outfall structures as needed to manage the
runoff from the closed impoundments. Precipitation driven runoff from closed landfill
areas should have much lower loadings of suspended solids, metals, and other
constituents than certain process wastewaters. Final drainage would be routed to
existing or new discharge points and comply with the modified NPDES and/or the TMSP
permits to ensure that no adverse impacts to surface waters would occur. Mitigation
measures would be identified, as needed, to ensure the discharges meet permit limits
which may or may not require a permit modification. Additionally, future storm water that
comes in contact with CCR would be routed to the future process water basins.
4.2.4.1 Ash Impoundment Closure – in – Place
As identified in the Programmatic EIS (TVA 2016), Closure- in-Place of the ash
impoundments would minimize surface water flow to the impoundment which would
enhance stability of the berms due to a reduction of hydraulic inputs. As all work would
comply with applicable regulations, permits and BMPs, potential impacts of this alternate
to surface water would be negligible. TVA would ensure these actions are performed in a
manner protective of water quality. This could include monitoring for solids, metals, and
whole effluent toxicity.
This alternative would consist of dewatering and stabilizing ponded areas followed by
redistributing CCR material within the footprint of the impoundments. The existing
perimeter dike around the Main Ash Impoundment would be lowered and the excavated
material would be used as protective cover soil in the final cap system. The divider dike
between the Main Ash Impoundment and the Dry Ash Stack would remain and would be
closed with a geomembrane cap system. The CCR material would be regraded to
promote drainage and a portion of the pond would be lined and repurposed as a storm
water and process water basin. The remaining portion of the impoundment would be
covered in place with a geomembrane cap system. A geomembrane cap would reduce
infiltration more than an alternative soil cap system, (0.1 inch per year compared to
0.57 inch per year). The proposed geomembrane cap system would consist (from
bottom to top) of a 40-millimeter geomembrane, a geocomposite drainage layer,
18 inches of protective cover soil, and 6 inches of vegetative cover soil.
The proposed storm water and process water basins would be lined with a geosynthetic
clay liner over the regraded CCR, followed by a geomembrane, a non-woven geotextile
cushion, and 18 inches of stone as a protective layer.

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

The replacement of the existing ash impoundments with a capped, dry disposal area
should reduce the quantity of solids and total and dissolved metals discharged through
IMP 001 to Outfall 002 and ultimately to the Cumberland River. The proposed lined
storm water and process water basins should also provide added treatment potentially
reducing the quantities discharged even further. Therefore, closure of the existing ash
impoundments with the CCR remaining in place should reduce the loadings to the
Cumberland River and potentially provide a beneficial impact.
Storm water drainage would be directed as appropriate to ensure compliance with all
applicable regulations and permits. New storm water outfalls would be installed to direct
storm water runoff either west to Wells Creek or east to the existing Discharge Channel
and discharges would either be covered by the site NPDES permit or the TDEC
Multi-Sector General Storm Water Permit.
4.2.4.2 Ash Impoundment Closure-by-Removal
This alternative would also require rerouting plant flows that currently go to the Bottom
Ash and Main Ash Impoundments. This alternative would also consist of dewatering and
stabilizing ponded areas and installing a liner to convert part of the area to a storm water
and process water basins. Then this alternative would require removing CCR and plus
one foot of underlying soil material, perimeter dike material and support structures within
the footprint of the impoundments. The dike material could be stockpiled onsite if
segregated properly. The divider dike between the Main Ash Impoundment and the Dry
Ash Stack would remain in place and would be closed with a soil cap system consisting
of four feet of 10-5 cm/sec permeability clay. Once CCR and underlying soil materials are
removed, the cleared areas would be graded, drained, and vegetated.
Prior to excavation of the Bottom Ash Impoundment, a retaining wall would need to be
constructed along the perimeter of the bottom ash impoundment to support the
approximate 40-foot excavation. Once CCR and underlying soil materials are removed,
the cleared areas would be graded to drain and vegetated.
Storm water drainage would be directed as appropriate to ensure compliance with all
applicable regulations and permits. New storm water outfalls would be installed to direct
storm water runoff either west to Wells Creek or east to the existing discharge channel
and discharges would either be covered by the site NPDES permit or the TMSP.
Under this alternative, all removed CCR material would be hauled to a permitted offsite
landfill. Material placed within the receiving landfill is assumed to be fully contained by
an approved liner system such that no impacts to surface water would occur.
4.2.5

CCR Landfill for Future Ash - Operational Impacts

The CCR by-products that would be placed in the landfill are expected to include fly ash,
bottom ash, and commercial grade gypsum. By-product generation and characterization
would be dependent on the coal source. The design coal for the CCR landfill
considerations would be based on the current CCR production utilizing 100 percent
Illinois Basin (ILB).

19

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

The wastewater streams which could be generated or change substantively under this
alternative are:
•
•

The addition of the landfill leachate stream and storm water run-off.
Non-contact surface runoff from the proposed landfill drainage area.

Each of the three by-products were evaluated using the synthetic groundwater leaching
procedure (SGLP) water extraction to evaluate the metals that would potentially leach
from the proposed new landfill’s leachate collection system. This information was utilized
to predict waste water impacts from the landfill operation. Please note that the landfill will
also include waste water treatment sludge and that was not able to be simulated in this
evaluation, however the amount of the sludge compared to the CCR would likely be de
minimis.
The Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) Model was utilized to
evaluate the proposed leachate collection system disposal facility. Based on this HELP
model, the estimated average leachate flow from the proposed landfill was estimated to
be approximately 0.090 MGD with a maximum peak flow of 1.12 MGD (Stantec 2017)
The storm water run-off, based on the design storm of 24-hour and 100-year event,
could be expected to have peak inflows ranging from 176 to 294 cubic feet per second
(cfs) to each of the three newly proposed lined storm water impoundments that would be
included as part of the design for the proposed landfill project. The outlet discharges of
these impoundments under the same conditions would be expected to range from
approximately 12.6 to 16.2 cfs per impoundment. An estimated daily flow for each
impoundment would range from 0.173 to 0.435 MGD per impoundment based on the
current level of design. Storm water flows from the site would be discharged from the
proposed impoundments and would each discharge through separate outfalls via gravity
feed pipes out new Tennessee Multi-Sector Permitted Storm Water outfalls to Scott
Branch a Tributary of Wells Creek and Wells Creek to the north, west and south of the
proposed new dry CCR landfill site. Wells Creek has a 1Q10 in Erin of 5.4 cfs, and a
flow was calculated for Cumberland City based on the drainage area to be 8.72 cfs
which converts to 4.69 MGD based on a USGS Study from1992 (USDS 1992). Scott
Branch is considered a zero-flow stream. It would be assumed that in-stream water
quality standards would need to be met at the outfall prior to mixing with this stream.
Depending on the nature of this run-off stream mitigation measures that may include
waste water treatment may be required prior to discharge to this stream.
4.2.5.1 On Site Landfill Leachate and Run-off
The CCR solids not beneficially reused would be trucked and placed in the proposed
new landfill. This proposed landfill system would have a liner system and a leachate
collection system. The leachate would be discharged to a leachate impoundment and
then would either be gravity feed via a pipe to Wells Creek (Option 1) or would be
pumped to the current ash impoundment system or the proposed new storm water and
process water basin (Option 2). The basin would discharge via an existing IMP 001 or a
new outfall to the CCW and ultimately out Outfall 002 to the Cumberland River.
Ammonia concentrations in the landfilled materials would be dependent on SCR process
and plant specifics. To limit ammonia loads from the dry fly ash stack, the amount of
CCR exposed could be restricted to 10 acres or less. Please note for Option 2, under
low flow conditions, the Units would either need to be derated or would not be able to
20

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

operate due to thermal issues and the need for more intake water than is available.
However, these circumstances are evaluated because they are deemed conservative
and alternative cooling flows are not available.
Option 1 – Leachate Discharged to Wells Creek
The leachate stream would be discharged to leachate impoundment and then gravity
feed via a pipe and discharged out a new outfall structure to Wells Creek. The modeled
leachate waste stream was evaluated after mixing with Wells Creek to ascertain if instream mixing would meet Tennessee acute WQC. The leachate waste stream would
have the potential to be a low flow stream, acidic in nature with the potential of having
some detectable metals and ammonia levels. See the Metal Loading Section for more
details.
Option 2 – Leachate Discharged to the proposed Stormwater and Process Water
Basins
The leachate stream would be discharged to leachate impoundment and then pumped to
the proposed Process Water Basins for treatment. The effluent from these basins could
then discharge through either IMP 001 or a new outfall to the CCW and ultimately would
be discharged out Outfall 002 to the Cumberland River. All waste streams would comply
with NPDES permit limits and regulations. However, the leachate would be treated as
required to meet all applicable permit requirements and in-stream water quality criteria,
therefore potential impacts to surface water under this alternative would be expected to
be minor.
4.2.5.2 Metals Loading
To estimate the concentration of metals in both Options 1 and 2 after receiving
discharges from the proposed by-product landfill, the maximum synthetic groundwater
leaching procedure data was used. The SGLP data was used instead of the toxicity
characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) data because the SGLP data was deemed
more appropriate to model leachate discharges because of the use of non-acidified
water in the method. Additionally, this method allows for analysis of more parameters
than the TCLP method. The leachate data from the CCR products was identical in both
Option 1 and Option 2.
In addition to the leachate loading and mixing evaluation, an evaluation was also
performed to evaluated the contact storm water runoff from the proposed landfill to Scott
Branch and Wells Creek. In this evaluation storm water model flows were utilized.
However, rain water concentrations were used and assumed to be de minimis and were
evaluated at half the laboratory minimum detection limit (MDL) concentration.
The HELP Model was utilized to evaluate the proposed leachate collection system
disposal facility. The drainage layers for the cap and liner systems as well as the
leachate drainage pipe system would be designed to maintain less than 1 foot of
leachate head above the liner system (Stantec, 2017). Per the Final CCR Rule, the
design of the leachate collection system would account for anticipated differential
settlement of the liner. Leachate generation volumes would be used to size leachate

21

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

storage impoundment(s). The design of the leachate storage impoundment(s) would
also involve design of the following items:
• Compacted clay and geosynthetic membrane liner system
• Pump station and force main to convey leachate to proposed Process Water
Basins
• Groundwater monitoring plan to detect potential leaks through the liner system
For Option 1 – As evaluated in Table 4-3, the added loadings from the by-product
leachate collection system (LCS) discharge to Wells Creek would have the potential to
have constituents with concentrations above the TN WQC. When in-stream mixing was
evaluated with the modeled leachate stream and Wells Creek, cadmium, copper,
selenium and thallium were found to have the potential to be higher than the acute
criteria for the Wells Creek most stringent designation. This may indicate that there may
be a need for mitigation measures, which may include waste water treatment, prior to
discharge from these outfall(s) and should be taken into consideration in future designs
and storm water discharges.

For Option 2 – As seen in Table 4-4, the added loadings from the by-product LCS
discharge would be unlikely to increase the metals concentrations at the Cumberland
River where this stream would discharge. Additionally, the concentrations would not
exceed NPDES permit limits or TN WQC, except for Thallium. These results, however,
are due to limitations in testing methods and do not represent true impacts to water
quality due to thallium concentrations. The mass balance analysis indicates that the
overall impact of current and future leachate operations would not cause impacts to
surface water quality in Option 2. This analysis represents the estimated maximum
discharges from this site, since the leachate flow used would be the peak flow during
Phase III of the landfill operation. In addition, water quality standards are typically
applied as an in-stream concentration after mixing.
Additionally, TVA would conduct a characterization of the leachate and run-off streams
to confirm no significant impacts to the Cumberland River. The waters would be
analyzed for metals and other parameters. If determined to be necessary, appropriate
mitigating measures would be evaluated and implemented to ensure that the discharge
NPDES permit requirements for the water quality parameters are met.

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

The evaluation for the storm water loading from the proposed landfill does have the
potential to increase the metals and ammonia concentrations in the Scott Branch, a
Tributary of Wells Creek. A loading calculation was performed utilizing preliminary storm
water flow data (Table 4-5). The peek peak flow data was utilized from the 100-year,
24-hour storm. Flows were utilized going into each storm water impoundment and the
concentration was evaluated coming out of each storm water impoundment. Additionally,
this loading and mixing calculation did not consider any treatment in the storm water
impoundments. It would be assumed that in-stream water quality standards would need
to be met at the storm water outfall prior to mixing with the stream, since the stream is a
zero-flow stream. The evaluation showed that all constituents evaluated would be below
WQS, except for arsenic, mercury, selenium and thallium. This may indicate that there
may be a need for mitigation measures, which may include waste water treatment, prior
to discharge from this outfall and should be taken into consideration in future designs
and storm water discharges.

In addition to the theoretical evaluation, actual storm water samples were collected from the
current dry stack at CUF just prior to discharge into the ash impoundment. This analysis
displayed that all metal constituents were below WQC, except for arsenic and thallium. The
increased concentrations of the mercury and selenium observed in the theoretical evaluation
were not observed in the actual storm water samples from the dry stack and are therefore,
considered to have a reduced risk of impacts from selenium and mercury. All thallium
concentrations were below detection and were considered to be a function of the fact that the
method‘s detection limit is higher than the criteria and therefore, has the potential to not be a
foreseeable impact. In addition to the metals listed below in Table 4-6, total dissolved solids
were above water quality criteria, which could be an indicator of potential water quality issues
due to dissolved solids.

Additionally, TVA would conduct a characterization of the leachate and runoff streams postconstruction to confirm no significant impacts to the Cumberland River, Wells Creek or Scott
Branch. The waters would be analyzed for metals and other parameters. If determined to be
necessary, appropriate mitigating measures would be evaluated and implemented to ensure
that the discharge meets NPDES permit requirements for the water quality parameters. These
mitigation methods could possibly include, rerouting discharge waste stream, water treatment,
implementing BMPs as potential examples.
4.2.5.3 Ammonia Criteria
Ammonia slip, the emission of unreacted ammonia (NH3), is caused by the incomplete reaction
of the ammonia with NOx present in the flue gas. The unreacted NH3 could react with available
gaseous sulfuric acid to form ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4), a very sticky substance.
28

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

Ammonia slip tends to adhere to or commingle with the fly ash, and/or build up on the air
preheaters (APHs) interior surfaces. Formation of NH4HSO4 could accelerate the buildup inside
the APHs, and make the periodic cleaning of the APHs more difficult.
NH3 + H2O + SO3  NH4HSO4
Approximately 20 percent of the NH3 slip is expected to adhere to the heating surfaces in the
APH, and about 80 percent adhered to the fly ash. The partitioning of ammonia slip between fly
ash and APH heating surfaces will be determined by the specific equipment installed, actual fuel
blends, and their operating characteristics.
The discharge concentrations to the receiving stream or the concentration at the edge of an
approved mixing zone in the receiving streams should meet applicable water quality standards.
The USEPA acute aquatic life criterion (ALC) for ammonia in fresh water is termed the criterion
maximum concentration, or CMC. The CMC is the one-hour average concentration of total NH3N (in mg of nitrogen per liter [N/L]) which is not to be exceeded at the discharge more than once
every three years on average. he CMC is pH dependent: as the pH increases, the ammonia
CMC decreases to remain protective of aquatic organisms (Table 4-7). The CCC is the 30-day
average concentration of total NH3-N/L, which is not to be exceeded more than once every
three years on average. The CCC is pH and temperature dependent: as pH and/or temperature
increase, the ammonia CCC decreases to remain protective of aquatic organisms. The landfill
leachate and storm water discharge are expected to be precipitation driven and would be
required to meet the CMC criteria (TVA 2008).
Table 4-7.

Note: Assumes salmonids are absent
As mentioned previously, CUF currently burns 100 percent ILB coal. Due to the presence of
acid species in ILB coal ash and flue gas relative to PRB coal ash and flue gas, it is likely that
the ammonia slip could react with gaseous acids or acids in the fly ash, causing an increase of
ammonia on the ash and potentially forming ammonium fluoride, ammonium chloride, and/or
ammonia-sulfur salts (ammonium bisulfate likely predominating) among other species. This
acid-base neutralization reaction would likely keep the ammonia more stable in solid salt form or
combined with fly ash and less susceptible to off-gassing as it would be in a more alkaline
environment. If dissociated in water, the soluble ammonium would likely pair with soluble acids
from the now more acidic fly ash and result in a more neutral pH, to the extent that such a small
amount of gaseous ammonia slip can influence the pH of a much larger volume of water.
4.2.5.4 Nutrient Criteria
Because addition and conversion of ammonia increases the nutrient enrichment potential of
impoundment aquatic discharges (total nitrogen, NO2+NO3-N, organic nitrogen), nutrient water
quality criteria for the receiving water bodies are important considerations. States’ water quality
standards contain criteria to protect surface waters from the adverse effects of nutrient
enrichment. These criteria have historically been in the narrative form (prohibit the formation of
objectionable accumulations of floating materials), but more recently, a major emphasis by
29

Cumberland CCR Impoundment Closure EIS
Surface Water Technical Memorandum

USEPA and the states is to develop numeric, “not to exceed,” concentrations of the nutrients
nitrogen and phosphorous or of biological (i.e., algal biomass) or other (i.e., water transparency)
values that protect against use impairment. USEPA is encouraging states to promulgate
numeric nutrient criteria that will be protective of downstream, even far-field, uses such as in the
Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. Should any receiving stream segment become listed as “impaired”
on a state’s 303(d) list due to exceedance of either existing or future ammonia and/or nutrient
criteria, TVA would reduce or treat the amount of ammonia and/or nutrient discharged as
required to comply with water quality standards and NPDES permit limits. (TVA 2008)
The leachate infiltration assumptions included the following:

•
•
•
•
•

Twenty percent moisture content on the CCR.
Particle density was assumed at 2.25 kg/L.
One hundred percent of the ammonia would be released from the CCR.
One pore volume of water dissolves all of the NH3 in one unit volume of CCR.
The average concentration of ammonia on the fly ash for 2016 was utilized.

An ammonia model was used to evaluate the expected ammonia releases from the landfill. The
current NPDES permit requirements includes report only monitoring, however if the
concentration is found to be over 2.08 mg/L than corrective actions are to be implemented. The
model was based on conservative assumptions at the time of release and included mixing of the
leachate stream with Wells Creek to meet the acute criteria when pHs of the waste streams
ranged from 6 to 9 s.u. The leachate impoundment could be released in a batch process so that
if any treatment is required this discharge flow can be isolated. No direct negative (toxic)
impacts on water quality of surface waters are anticipated, based on modeled data.
Ammonia was also evaluated in the storm water run-off from the proposed new dry CCR landfill.
This discharge may be discharged via new storm water outfalls to Scott Branch or Wells Creek.
Flows were utilized going into each storm water impoundment and the concentration was
evaluated coming out of each storm water impoundment. It would be assumed that in-stream
water quality standards would need to be met at the storm water outfall prior to mixing with the
stream, since Scott Branch is a zero-flow stream. he modeled concentration of the Total
Ammonia as Nitrogen was found to below the chronic toxicity levels when pH was ranged from
6 to 9 s.u. and before accounting for mixing with Scott Branch.
TVA would conduct a characterization of the leachate and run-off streams to confirm no
significant impacts to Wells Creek or Scott Branch. The waters would be analyzed for nutrients
(including ammonia), metals and other parameters. If determined to be necessary, appropriate
mitigation measures would be evaluated and implemented to ensure that the discharge NPDES
permit requirements for the water quality parameters are met. (TVA 2017)
After accounting for the impacts of the by-product storage leachate and storm water, the
impacts after mixing with the Cumberland River would be minor, however there would be for
potential impacts in the Wells Creek and Scotts Branch. TVA would conduct a characterization
of the leachate and run-off streams to confirm if there would be impacts to the Cumberland
River, Wells Creek or Scotts Branch. The waters would be analyzed for metals and other
parameters. If determined to be necessary, appropriate mitigation measures would be evaluated
and implemented to ensure that the discharge requirements for the water quality parameters are
met.

CUF- Operational Impacts
However, in contrast to Alternatives B and C, this alternative considers the transport of future
ash to a previously permitted offsite landfill (Bi-County Solid Waste Management Landfill) for
long-term storage. Minor impacts associated with construction and operation of the onsite
landfill would not occur as both existing and future CCR produced by CUF would be transported
to an existing offsite permitted landfill. It is assumed the pre-existing landfill would have
necessary permits that would be protective of water quality. Because this is an existing
permitted landfill, there would be no changes from the existing environment within the landfill
boundaries under this alternative.

STEPS IN THE PROCESSING THE FARMLAND AND CONVERSION IMPACT RATING FORM
Step 1 - Federal agencies (or Federally funded projects) involved in proposed projects that may convert farmland, as defined in the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA)
to nonagricultural uses, will initially complete Parts I and III of the form. For Corridor type projects, the Federal agency shall use form NRCS-CPA-106 in place
of form AD-1006. The Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) process may also be accessed by visiting the FPPA website, http://fppa.nrcs.usda.gov/lesa/.
Step 2 - Originator (Federal Agency) will send one original copy of the form together with appropriate scaled maps indicating location(s)of project site(s), to the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) local Field Office or USDA Service Center and retain a copy for their files. (NRCS has offices in most counties in the
U.S. The USDA Office Information Locator may be found at http://offices.usda.gov/scripts/ndISAPI.dll/oip_public/USA_map, or the offices can usually be
found in the Phone Book under U.S. Government, Department of Agriculture. A list of field offices is available from the NRCS State Conservationist and State
Office in each State.)
Step 3 - NRCS will, within 10 working days after receipt of the completed form, make a determination as to whether the site(s) of the proposed project contains prime,
unique, statewide or local important farmland. (When a site visit or land evaluation system design is needed, NRCS will respond within 30 working days.
Step 4 - For sites where farmland covered by the FPPA will be converted by the proposed project, NRCS will complete Parts II, IV and V of the form.
Step 5 - NRCS will return the original copy of the form to the Federal agency involved in the project, and retain a file copy for NRCS records.
Step 6 - The Federal agency involved in the proposed project will complete Parts VI and VII of the form and return the form with the final selected site to the servicing
NRCS office.
Step 7 - The Federal agency providing financial or technical assistance to the proposed project will make a determination as to whether the proposed conversion is consistent
with the FPPA.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FARMLAND CONVERSION IMPACT RATING FORM
(For Federal Agency)
Part I: When completing the "County and State" questions, list all the local governments that are responsible for local land
use controls where site(s) are to be evaluated.
Part III: When completing item B (Total Acres To Be Converted Indirectly), include the following:
1. Acres not being directly converted but that would no longer be capable of being farmed after the conversion, because the
conversion would restrict access to them or other major change in the ability to use the land for agriculture.
2. Acres planned to receive services from an infrastructure project as indicated in the project justification (e.g. highways,
utilities planned build out capacity) that will cause a direct conversion.
Part VI: Do not complete Part VI using the standard format if a State or Local site assessment is used. With local and NRCS
assistance, use the local Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA).
1. Assign the maximum points for each site assessment criterion as shown in § 658.5(b) of CFR. In cases of corridor-type
project such as transportation, power line and flood control, criteria #5 and #6 will not apply and will, be weighted zero,
however, criterion #8 will be weighed a maximum of 25 points and criterion #11 a maximum of 25 points.
2. Federal agencies may assign relative weights among the 12 site assessment criteria other than those shown on the
FPPA rule after submitting individual agency FPPA policy for review and comment to NRCS. In all cases where other
weights are assigned, relative adjustments must be made to maintain the maximum total points at 160. For project sites
where the total points equal or exceed 160, consider alternative actions, as appropriate, that could reduce adverse
impacts (e.g. Alternative Sites, Modifications or Mitigation).

Part VII: In computing the "Total Site Assessment Points" where a State or local site assessment is used and the total
maximum number of points is other than 160, convert the site assessment points to a base of 160.
Example: if the Site Assessment maximum is 200 points, and the alternative Site "A" is rated 180 points:
Total points assigned Site A
Maximum points possible

180
= 200 X 160 = 144 points for Site A

For assistance in completing this form or FPPA process, contact the local NRCS Field Office or USDA Service Center.
NRCS employees, consult the FPPA Manual and/or policy for additional instructions to complete the AD-1006 form.
