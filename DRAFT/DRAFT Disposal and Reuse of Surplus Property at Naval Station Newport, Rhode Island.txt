Mr. Edward F. Sanderson
State Historic Preservation Officer
Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission
Old State House
150 Benefit Street
Providence, Rhode Island 02903
Dear Mr. Sanderson:
Thank you for your June 14, 2013 reply to the Navy letter
initiating consultation for the Base Realignment and Closure
(BRAC) undertaking at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport. The Navy
appreciates your concurrence on the area of potential effects
(APE), and your guidance on potential consulting parties and the
consultation process. The intent of this letter is to obtain
concurrence on the National Register of Historic Places
(National Register)-eligibility of cultural resources within the
BRAC APE, and the effect of this project.
As previously stated, under legislation enacted in 2005,
the BRAC Program Management Office East (BPMOE) will transfer
portions of NAVSTA Newport to non-federal entities for
redevelopment. The APE consists of the surplus property slated
for transfer on Aquidneck Island, in Newport County, Rhode
Island: 1) the former Naval Hospital parcel (City of Newport) ;
2) the Tank Farms 1 and 2 parcel (Town of Portsmouth); 3) the
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor (Towns of Middletown and
Portsmouth); and, 4) the former Navy Lodge parcel (Town of
Middletown) . The BPMOE will prepare a National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to
evaluate the potential environmental consequences of the
disposal and reuse of the surplus property by the Aquidneck
Island Reuse Planning Authority (AIRPA) .
As part of the transfer process, the Navy, through
contract, conducted archaeological identification surveys and
National Register of Historic Places (National Register)eligibility evaluations for the built environment, to comply
with Sections 106 and 110 of the NHPA, as amended, and in
support of the EIS. Naval Facilities Engineering Command

5090
Ser BPMOE/13-101
July 10, 2013
Atlantic (NAVFAC Atlantic}, in conjunction with the BPMOE,
coordinated the cultural resources investigations, in accordance
with federal law and Navy procedures. Two enclosed
comprehensive reports detail these facilities:
1} Draft Phase I Archaeological Investigation of Five Areas
for BRAC Disposal, U.S. Naval Station Newport, Newport,
Rhode Island (March 2013}.
2} Draft Architectural Survey and Evaluation Update, U.S.
Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island (March 2013}
Archaeology
Five individual parcels totaling approximately 225 acres, all of
which have been extensively developed, were investigated as part
of the Phase I archaeology survey. Over 170 shovel tests were
excavated, and the results were as follows:
1} The For.mer Naval Hospital consists of approximately 10
terrestrial acres. Nearly all of the twenty-seven shovel
tests excavated within this parcel displayed prior
disturbance, and no archaeology sites were identified. The
submerged portion of this parcel consisting of
approximately seven acres was not investigated as part of
this survey.
2} The For.mer Navy Lodge parcel located at the intersection of
Route 114 and Coddington Highway consists of three vacant
acres.
Four shovel tests were excavated outside the
footprint of the former lodge. The shovel tests indicated
that the area had been significantly disturbed by prior cut
and fill activities. No new archaeology sites were
identified in this parcel.
3)The Defense Highway parcel consists of three segments of
roadways and adjacent land totaling approximately 67 acres.
A total of 22 shovel tests were excavated in four areas:
a
low flat knoll on the east side of Defense Highway at the
Midway Fueling Pier (4 shovel tests}; a graded slope located
on the east side of Defense Highway north of the McAllister
Point Landfill (14 shovel tests}; a grassy flat area located

2

5090
Ser BPMOE/13-101
July 10, 2013
east of the Firefighter Training Facility (2 shovel tests) ;
and an area adjacent to a small stone fence on the west
side of the active rail line located approximately 600
meters north of Midway Fueling Pier (2 shovel tests) . All
of the areas investigated within the Defense Highway parcel
showed evidence of disturbance as a result of the
construction of the roadway, transmission lines, a
pipeline, the railway, the demolition of shore-side
structures, and other development. No archaeology sites
were identified within this parcel.
4)Tank Farm 1 consists of 50 acres, and 82 shovel tests were
excavated along the northeastern, eastern, and southern
portions of the parcel. The shovel tests indicated
extensive disturbance, and only one isolated historic
artifact, a glass stopper, was recovered. No archaeology
sites were identified.
S)Tank Farm 2 consists of 96 acres, and 40 shovel tests were
excavated along the northwestern and eastern portions of the
parcel. The shovel tests in Tank Farm 2 also revealed
extensive disturbance, and no new sites were found.

Architecture
The architectural report included survey and evaluation at Tank
Farms 1 and 2, the hospital, and the Defense Highway/Stringham
Road corridor. No extant resources remain at the former Navy
Lodge parcel to warrant architectural survey. The report
includes the following results:
1) Melville Naval Historic District retains sufficient
integrity to be eligible for the National Register under
Criteria A and C. The expanded boundaries of the historic
district are recommended to include Tank Farms 1 and 2.
The recommended expanded period of significance is 1910 to
1973, to include the Fuel Depot's significant role into the
Cold War period in supplying fuel to the Atlantic Fleet.
2)The U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District boundaries
should be expanded to include the Pier (Structure 71) . Its
period of significance is recommended 1913-1942. The
district remains eligible under Criteria A and C as a

3

5090
Ser BPMOE/13-101
July 10, 2013

representative example of Navy hospital construction during
the first half of the twentieth century.
3) The Naval Defense Highway is recommended as individually
eligible under Criterion A for its association with the
expansion of the Naval Operating Base Newport during World
War II.
4) Stringham Road, Greene Lane, and Midway Pier are
recommended as not eligible for the National Register.
The Navy is submitting the enclosed documentation pursuant
to Section 106 of the NHPA, to continue consultation with your
agency, to facilitate effective planning in conjunction with the
NEPA process, and to plan for the disposal of the Navy-owned
facilities. Based on the information enumerated above, site
visits by Navy cultural resources staff, and the enclosed
deliverables, the Navy has determined the following:
1) The architectural evaluations meet applicable state and
National Register guidelines, and the Navy agrees with all
of the National Register-eligibility recommendations.
2) The Phase I archaeology survey was conducted according to
state guidelines. No archaeological sites in the
terrestrial parcels proposed for BRAC disposal were
discovered during the survey, and therefore the disposal
action will have no effect on National Register-eligible or
listed archaeological resources.
The Navy agrees with these
findings.
3)In accordance with 36 CFR Part 800.5(a) (2) (vii), the Navy
will continue consultation to avoid the potential adverse
effect of the BRAC transfer on historic properties.
In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA and other
applicable historic preservation statutes and procedures, the
Navy invites you to concur with these findings by letter, with
any additional comments regarding the content or format of the
reports and other deliverables, within a period of time that
will foster adequate planning for the pending transfers.

SUBJECT: INITIATION OF GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CONSULTATION DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY AT NAVAL STATION
NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND
The purpose of this letter is to initiate formal governmentto-government consultation with the Narragansett Indian tribe
regarding the above referenced project. The Department of the
Navy (DON) recognizes the Narragansett Indian tribe may have an
interest in the properties affected by the proposed action and
thus would like to open discussions.
The surplus property to be disposed at the Naval Station
includes the former Navy Lodge site (3 acres); the former Naval
Hospital (7 acres); Tank Farms 1 and 2 (145 acres); and the
Midway-Green Lane Parcel/Stringham Road/Portion of Defense Highway
(67 acres). The environmental impacts of the disposal of and
reuse of the property are being evaluated on the basis of the
Aquidneck Island Reuse Implementing Authority which includes a mix
of land uses and densities at each site.
We are interested in your views regarding the potential
effects of the proposed property disposal and reuse on Tribal
resources and interests.
I would like to invite you to meet with me and other Navy
representatives to hear your views, further discuss your concerns,
provide additional information regarding the proposed action, and
establish the framework for ongoing communications for this
project. To arrange such a meeting in the local Newport, RI area
at a mutually convenient time, please contact my office at (215)
897-4909.

SUBJECT: DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY AT NAVAL STATION
(NAVSTA) NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND
Thank you for the July 1, 2013 letter sent on your behalf by
Ms. Little Fawn Boland of CEIBA Legal, LLP. The Department of the
Navy (DON) recognizes the Narragansett Indian Tribe's interest in
the properties affected by this federal undertaking and has
separately sent a formal invitation to Matthew Thomas, Chief
Sachem to initiate government-to-government consultations. Below
we respectfully offer a summary of the Navy's efforts to share
information with your Tribe on this project thus far.
We look
forward to continuing consultation with the Narragansett.
Communication with the Narragansett for this project has been
conducted primarily in the context of compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) . The Base Realignment and
Closure (BRAC) Program Management Off ice (PMO) provided
notification to the Narragansett as well as the public and other
stakeholders of the proposed project and of our intent to prepare
the appropriate NEPA documentation in a November 7, 2012 NEPA
notice of intent (NOI), enclosures attached. This NOI was
intended to invite input from the Narragansett during the NEPA
scoping process.
In our efforts to identify cultural resources
that might be affected by this project, we have additionally
solicited your input in connection with the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) .
With respect to your question about outreach conducted by the
Aquidneck Island Reuse Implementing Authority, the point of
contact who can speak directly to the efforts to engage
stakeholders during the surplus property redevelopment planning
process is Mr. Shawn Brown of the Aquidneck Island Re-use

5090

August 23, 2013
Implementing Authority (AIRIA).
He can be reached at (401) 8492898 or sbrown@middletownri.com.
Again, BRAC PMO is interested in your views regarding the
potential effects of the proposed property disposal and reuse on
Tribal resources and interests. We hope our invitation to
initiate government-to-government consultation that is the subject
of the separate letter to Chief Thomas will enhance your ability
to provide input on the aforementioned NEPA and NHPA processes as
they continue.
If you have any questions or would like to discuss
the proposed action, please do not hesitate to contact Mr. Willie
Lin of this office at (215) 897-4904.

Dear Mr. Brown:
The purpose of this letter is to formally notify the
Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island (NIT) that the Navy
is initiating Section 106 consultation regarding the proposed
disposal of surplus property at Naval Station Newport, Rhode
Island. Formal government-to-government consultation with the
NIT began in August 2013 and the NIT made the Navy aware of its
interest in this project through past meetings and
correspondence. At this time, the Navy is initiating
consultation with other potential consulting parties, and will
continue to consult with the NIT, as the process moves forward.
This undertaking and its effects are being considered under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended (NHPA) , and implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part
800, and as part of compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, and
compliance with Executive Orders No. 13007, 13084 and 13287.
The Navy has declared certain property as surplus at Naval
Station (NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode Island and recognizes that the
NIT has expressed interest in the properties affected by the
proposed undertaking.
The proposed undertaking consists of the disposal (transfer

As shown in enclosure 1, the surplus property is located
entirely on Aquidneck Island, in Newport County, Rhode Island:
the former Naval Hospital parcel is located in the City of
Newport; the Tank Farms 1 and 2 parcel is located in the Town of
Portsmouth; the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor is
located in the Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth; and the
former Navy Lodge parcel is located in the Town of Middletown.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Navy has determined, in
consultation with the Rhode Island State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO), that the area of potential effects (APE) for the
proposed undertaking will consist of the areas within the
boundaries of the surplus property.

Proposed Disposition of Surplus Property at Naval Station Newport

Dear Mr. Anderson:
The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) recently received the additional information in
support of your notification of adverse effects of the referenced undertaking on properties listed on and
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Based upon the information you provided,
we have concluded that Appendix A, Criteria for Council Involvement in Reviewing Individual Section
106 Cases, of our regulations, “Protection of Historic Properties” (36 CFR Part 800) does not apply to
this undertaking. Accordingly, we do not believe that our participation in the consultation to resolve
adverse effects is needed. However, if we receive a request for participation from the State Historic
Preservation Officer, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, or another party, we may reconsider this
decision. Additionally, should circumstances change, and you determine that our participation is needed
to conclude the consultation process, please notify us.
Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.6(b)(1)(iv), you will need to file the final Memorandum of Agreement (MOA),
developed in consultation with the Rhode Island State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and any
other consulting parties, and related documentation with the ACHP at the conclusion of the consultation
process. The filing of the Agreement and supporting documentation with the ACHP is required in order to
complete the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Thank you for providing us with your notification of adverse effect. If you have any questions or require
further assistance, please contact Katharine R. Kerr at (202) 517-0216 or via e-mail at kkerr@achp.gov.

Dear Mr. Chapman:
The Department of the Navy (Navy) is preparing an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the disposal and reuse
of surplus property at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode
Island.
The EIS will analyze the potential human and natural
environmental consequences of the disposal of surplus property
at NAVSTA Newport and its reuse in a manner consistent with the
Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport
(Redevelopment Plan). The surplus property includes: the former
Naval Hospital site, former Navy Lodge site, Tank Farms 1 and 2,
and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor.
Please see
enclosure 1 for a surplus property overview map.
To support this EIS, we are requesting information from
your office that identifies natural areas, habitats, or features
in the vicinity of the project area.
Specifically, we request
that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service identify populations of
federally listed or candidate rare, threatened, or endangered
species, unique natural communities, or other significant
wildlife communities at or near the surplus property at NAVSTA
Newport. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management, Natural Heritage Program and National Marine
Fisheries Services, Northeast Regional Office are also being
contacted to obtain similar information regarding state and
federally listed species and critical habitats.
Two reuse alternatives for surplus property at NAVSTA
Newport are being assessed for this project:
1. Disposal and Reuse of Surplus Property at NAVSTA Newport Redevelopment Plan (Preferred Alternative) :
The Redevelopment Plan calls for the development of the
following at each surplus property (refer to enclosure 2 for
an Alternative 1 site map for each property) :

January 9, 2013

a. Naval Hospital: Approximately 3.8 acres (54%) of the 7
acres of land-based property would be redeveloped, with a
mix of hotel and residential uses in addition to a
waterfront park with pedestrian paths and a pier. The
remaining 3.2 acres of upland (46%) and 3 acres of
submerged land would be maintained as open space and
natural areas associated with the waterfront park.
b. Navy Lodge: Approximately 1.8 acres (60%) would be
redeveloped with two, one-story retail buildings and
associated parking. Approximately 1.2 acres (40%) would
be maintained as open space.
c. Tank Farms: Existing structures would be demolished prior
to redevelopment of the site. Approximately 31.1 acres
(21%) of the overall combined property would be
redeveloped with a mix of uses including office space,
light industrial, boat storage, multi-modal parking, and
a solar array. About 113.9 acres (79%) would remain as
passive land use or open space.
d. Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor: The
Redevelopment Plan calls for retaining use of the twolane roads, Defense Highway/Stringham Road, with the
addition of an adjacent multi-use pedestrian pathway in a
greenbelt. The remaining land would be used for
recreation/open space areas including a shoreline park
with a public pier.
2. Disposal and Reuse of Surplus Property at NAVSTA Newport (Higher Density Alternative) :
Alternative 2 includes the redevelopment of surplus property
in a manner consistent with the Redevelopment Plan, but with
increased development. Under Alternative 2, increased
development would be as follows (refer to enclosure 3 for an
Alternative 2 site map for each property) :
a. Naval Hospital: Residential use would be replaced by
commercial use and a conference center would be added to
the proposed hotel.
b. Navy Lodge: Two, two-story retail buildings with the same
footprint as the two, one-story buildings under
Alternative 1.
c. Tank Farms 1 and 2: Office space and industrial space
would be increased by 25% over Alternative 1.
Parking/access would also be increased.

Re: Information on Species Listed Under the Endangered Species Act for the Redevelopment
Plan for Surplus Properties at Naval Station Newport.
Dear Mr. Drozd,
This is in response to your letter dated January 9, 2013 regarding the Department of the Navy's
(Navy) proposed Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at Naval Station (NAVSTA)
Newport in Newport, Rhode Island. The project site is located along the west side of Aquidneck
Island in Narragansett Bay at NAVSTA Newport. The proposed project will consist of disposal
and redevelopment of surplus property. The Navy has requested information on the presence of
any species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973,
by NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) within the vicinity of the proposed
project.
Several listed species of whales occur seasonally in the waters off of Rhode Island. Federally
endangered North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are found 'off the coast of Rhode
Island from December 1 -June 30. Federally endangered humpback whales (Megaptera
novaeangliae) are found off the coast of Rhode Island from March 15- November 30. Fin
(Balaenoptera physalus), Sei (Balaenoptera borealis) and Sperm (Physter macrocephalus)
whales are also seasonally present in New England, however, due to the depths and near shore
location, listed marine mammals are unlikely to occur in the action area.
Several species of threatened and endangered sea turtles occur seasonally in New England
waters. The sea turtles in northeastern nearshore waters are typically small juveniles with the
most abundant being the federally threatened Northwest Atlantic Distinct Population Segment
(DPS) of loggerhead (Caretta caretta) followed by the federally endangered Kemp's ridley
(Lepidochelys kempi). Loggerhead turtles have been found to be relatively abundant off the
Northeast coast (from near Nova Scotia, Canada to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina).
Loggerheads and Kemp's ridleys have been documented in waters as cold as 11 °C, but generally
migrate northward when water temperatures exceed l6°C. Federally endangered leatherback sea
turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are located in New England waters during the warmer months as
well. While leatherbacks are predominantly pelagic, they may occur close to shore, especially
when pursuing their preferred jellyfish prey. These species are typically present in New England

waters from June 1- November 1. Green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) may also occur
sporadically in New England waters, but those instances would be rare.
All species of sea turtles noted above are typically present in New England waters from June 1 November 1. You can find more information on listed sea turtle species at:
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/turtles/.
Atlantic sturgeon occur in estuarine and marine waters along the U.S. Atlantic coast and may be
present in Narragansett Bay. The New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South Atlantic and
Carolina DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon are endangered; the Gulf of Maine DPS is threatened.
Individuals originating from any ofthese DPSs could occur in the project area. You can find
more information on sturgeon species at: http://www.nero.noaa.gov/prot res/esp/index.html.
Candidat~ Species
_
_
_
~______ ~
Candidate species are those petitioned species that we are actively considering for listing as
endangered or threatened under the ESA, as well as those species for which we has initiated an
ESA status review that it has announced in the Federal Register. "Candidate" status does not
carry any procedural or substantive protections under the ESA. Two candidate species, alewife
and blueback herring, can occur in the project area. You can find more information on these
species in the Federal Register notice that announced this decision:
http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/fr/fr76-67652.pdf.

As listed species are likely to be present in the vicinity of the proposed project, a consultation,
pursuant to Section 7 of the ESA, may be necessary. The Navy will be responsible for
determining whether the proposed action is likely to affect listed species. If no in water work is
proposed, no listed species will be affected by the proposed project. As such, no consultation
pursuant to Section 7 of the ESA, is required. When project plans are complete, the Navy should
submit their determination of effects, along with justification for the determination, and a request
for concurrence to the attention of the Section 7 Coordinator, NMFS, Northeast Regional Office,
Protected Resources Division (PRD), 55 Great Republic Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930. After
reviewing this information, NMFS would then be able to conduct a consultation under section 7
ofthe ESA.
Should you have any questions about these comments or about the section 7 consultation process
in general, please contact Dan-Marroneat (978)282-8465 or by e-mail(Daniel.Marrone@noaa. gov).

listed and/or proposed endangered or threatened species in relation to the proposed activity
referenced above. These comments are provided in accordance with the Endangered Species Act(87
Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.).
Based on information currently available to us, no federally listed or proposed, threatened or
endangered species or critical habitat under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are
known to occur in the project area. Preparation of a Biological Assessment or further consultation
with us under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not required. No further Endangered
Species Act coordination is necessary for a period of one year from the date of this letter, unless
additional information on listed or proposed species becomes available.
To obtain updated lists of federally listed or proposed threatened or endangered species and critical
. habitats, it is not necessary to contact _!his office. Instead, please visit the Endangered Species
Consultation page on the New England Field Office's website:
www.fws.gov/newenglandlendangeredspec-consultation. htm (accessed January 2013)
On the website, there is also a link to procedures that may allow you to conclude if habitat for a listed
species is present in the project area. If no such habitat exists, then no federally listed species are
present in the project area and there is no need to contact us for further consultation. If the above

Dear Ms. Pirrotta:
The Navy is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for the disposal and reuse of surplus property at Naval
Station (NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode Island. The EIS will analyze
the potential human and natural environmental consequences of
the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport and its reuse
in a manner consistent with the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus
Properties at NAVSTA Newport (Redevelopment Plan) . This letter
provides notification and a request for comments on the scope of
the analysis.
The surplus property includes: the former Naval Hospital
site, former Navy Lodge site, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. Two of the surplus
properties, the former Naval Hospital and the Defense
Highway/Stringham Road Corridor, are located along Narragansett
Bay and would include in-water work.
Please see enclosure 1 for
a surplus property overview map.
The EIS will assess two reuse alternatives, and the No
Action Alternative. The two reuse alternatives for surplus
property at NAVSTA Newport are described below:
1. Alternative 1 - Redevelopment Plan (Preferred Alternative)
The Redevelopment Plan calls for the development of the
following at each surplus property (refer to enclosure 2
for an Alternative 1 site map for each property) :
a. Former Navy Lodge: Approximately 1.8 acres (60%) would be
redeveloped with two, one-story retail buildings and
associated parking. Approximately 1.2 acres (40%) would
be maintained as open space.

b. Former Naval Hospital: Approximately 3.8 acres (54%) of
the 7 acres of land-based property would be redeveloped,
with a mix of hotel and residential uses in addition to a
waterfront park with pedestrian paths and a pier. The
remaining 3.2 acres of upland (46%) and 3 acres of
submerged land would be maintained as open space and
natural areas associated with the waterfront park. At
the waterfront park, the existing pier would be re-used
with the addition of two concrete floating docks. The EIS
will assume that each concrete floating dock would be 8
feet wide by 90 feet long. They would be supported by,
pontoons and anchored in place with pilings and cables.
It is assumed that the pilings would be square, prePile
stressed concrete piles measuring 1 foot by 1 foot.
installation would be completed with an impact hammer
located on a barge. During dock construction, various
vessels would be used, including barges, tugs and
floating cranes.
c. Tank Farms: Approximately 31.1 acres (21%) of the overall
combined property would be redeveloped with a mix of uses
including office space, light industrial boat storage,
multi-modal parking, and a solar array.
About 113.9
acres (79%) would remain as passive land use or open
space.
d. Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor: The
Redevelopment Plan calls for retaining use of the twolane roads, Defense Highway/Stringham Road, with the
addition of an adjacent multi-use pedestrian pathway in a
greenbelt. The remaining land would be used for
recreation/open space areas including a shoreline park
with a public pier. In-water activities would include the
removal of the existing pier and construction of a new
pier. Removal of the existing pier would include
dredging (most likely using a clam shell bucket dredge)
and excavating the existing pier. The EIS will assume
that any piles associated with the existing pier would be
removed via direct-pull or vibratory extraction method.
A new concrete pier (measuring 15 feet wide by 250 feet
long) would be installed. To construct the new pier,
pre-stressed concrete piles would be installed using an
impact hammer located on a barge (similar to the methods
described at the former Naval Hospital site) .
2

Construction vessels such as barges, tugs and floating
cranes would also be required.
2. Alternative 2 (Higher Density Alternative)
Alternative 2 includes the redevelopment of surplus
property in a manner consistent with the Redevelopment
Plan, but with increased development. Under Alternative 2,
increased development would be as follows (refer to
enclosure 3 for an Alternative 2 site map for each
property) :
a. Former Navy Lodge: Two, two-story retail buildings
with the same footprint as the two, one-story
buildings under Alternative 1 with additional parking.
b. Former Naval Hospital: Residential use would be
replaced by commercial use and a conference center
would be added to the proposed hotel. An additional
concrete floating dock (8 feet wide by 70 feet long)
would be added to the existing pier and an onshore
yacht club/office would also be constructed.
In-water
construction would occur as described above for
Alternative 1.
c. Tank Farms 1 and 2: Office space and industrial space
would be increased by 25% over Alternative 1.
Parking/access would also be increased.
d. Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor: Greater
expansion of the shoreline park, including more
parking, a larger playground, and an expanded pier due
to the addition of an 8 foot wide by 50 foot long
floating concrete pier at the end of the concrete pier
(in a T-formation).
In-water construction would occur
as described above for Alternative 1.
Using the NOAA Habitat Conservation EFH Mapper, we have
identified species listed in Table 1 as having potential
Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) within proximity to the two
locations that include in-water work: (1) the former Naval
Hospital, and (2)

the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor.

We are notifying you of the project and requesting your input in
regard to the EFH species and their habitats. The Navy is
committed to working with NOAA Fisheries to ensure potential
effects to EFH are avoided.

Impact Statement (EIS) for the disposal and reuse of surplus property at Naval Station (NAVSTA)
Newport, Rhode Island. Two of the surplus properties at NAVSTA Newport (former Navy
Hospital and Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor) are located along Narragansett Bay and
redevelopment in those locations would involve in-water work. According to your letter, two
alternative reuse development plans will be assessed in the EIS, in addition to the no action
alternative. We provide the following information in an attempt to identify and address potential
adverse impacts on EFH and our trust resources within the project area.

Essential Fish Habitat
Narragansett Bay and the surrounding waters of Rhode Island Sound contain productive fishery
habitats that support numerous important living marine resources including federally managed
finfish and shellfish. EFH has been designated for 17 federally managed species within
Narragansett Bay in the vicinity of the proposed redevelopment project. A complete list of species
and life stages that have been designated for the project location can be found on our Habitat
Conservation Division website at http://www.nero.noaa.gov/ro/doc/webintro.html.
Among those species listed, particular attention should be focused on winter flounder habitat that
may be adversely affected by this project. Adult winter flounder may utilize this area for spawning
and feeding, while eggs, larvae and juveniles use the area for early life stage development. The
substrate found here also serves as habitat for benthic organisms, such as shellfish and other
invertebrates living within and on the surface of the sediment. These organisms contribute to the
productivity of federally managed species by acting as a food source for both juvenile and adult life
stages of finfish and direct or indirect impacts on them are considered adverse effects on EFH.
In addition, the nearshore areas ofNarragansett Bay, including the project area, support eelgrass
beds, which serve as habitat for many of the above-named species. Eelgrass is a type of submerged
aquatic vegetation (SAV) and may be impacted as a result of the proposed redevelopment

activities. SAV is designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a "special aquatic
site" under the Section 404(b)(1) of the Federal Clean Water Act, due ·to its important role in the
marine ecosystem for foraging species, including winter flounder. Impacts to such habitats would
result in negative consequences for fisheries resources, as these environments are particularly
valuable in exporting nutrients, filtering runoff from upland sources, and providing spawning,
nursery and shelter habitat for most of the species utilizing the area. Furthermore, the Mid-Atlantic
Fishery Management Council has designated eelgrass as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern when
associated with summer flounder EFH.
Both ofthe proposed development alternatives involve the construction of a waterfront park and the
addition of docks to an existing pier at the former Navy Hospital, as well as the development of a
shoreline park and replacement of an existing pier at the Defense Highway location. The second
alternative includes the same in-water structures, plus additional dock structures. Your letter
indicates that work barges, tugs, and floating cranes would be used in the construction activities,
and that removal and replacement of the existing pier would require dredging via clamshell bucket.
The proposed redevelopment activities could adversely affect EFH, including eelgrass beds and
shallow subtidal habitats, by increasing turbidity and suspended sediments in the water column,
directly removing habitat and shading sensitive habitats. We recommend that alternatives within
the scope of the analysis include avoidance and minimization of impacts to SAV and shallow
subtidal spawning habitats, as well as discussion of the potential need for mitigative measures to
offset project related impacts.

EFH Assessment
The Magnuson-Stevens Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act require federal agencies to
consult with one another on projects such as this. Insofar as a project inv~lves EFH, as this project
does, this process is guided by the requirements of our EFH regulation at 50 CFR 600.905, which
mandates the preparation ofEFH assessments and generally outlines each agency's obligations in
this consultation procedure.
The required contents of an EFH assessment include: 1) a description of the action; 2) an analysis
of the potential adverse effects of the action on EFH and the managed species; 3) your conclusions
regarding the effects ofthe action on EFH; and 4) proposed mitigation, if applicable. Other
information that should be contained in the EFH assessment, if appropriate, includes: 1) the results
of on-site inspections to evaluate the habitat and site-specific effects; 2) the views of recognized
experts on the habitat or the species that may be affected; 3) a review of pertinent literature and
related information; and 4) an analysis of alternatives to the action that could avoid or minimize the
adverse effects on EFH. Upon submittal of an EFH assessment, we will provide conservation
recommendations for the proposed project, as necessary.

Endangered Species Act
In a letter dated January 31, 2013, our Protected Resources Division provided information to your
office regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species within the vicinity of the
proposed project. As mentioned in the letter, listed species are likely to be present within
Narragansett Bay near the proposed waterfront redevelopment; therefore, a consultation pursuant to
section 7 of the Endangered Species Act may be necessary. Should you have any questions

regarding the section 7 consultation process, please contact Dan Marrone at (978) 282-8465 or at
Daniel.Marrone@noaa.gov.
Conclusions
We appreciate the opportunity to provide these preliminary comments and we look forward to
receiving your EFH assessment for the proposed project. If you have questions regarding these
comments, please contact Jenna Pirrotta at (978) 675-2176 or at Jenna.Pirrotta@noaa.gov.

Dear Ms. Colligan and Mr . Boelke :
As you know , property at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport has been
declared surplus to the needs of the Federal government. The United
States Department of the Navy Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
Program Management Office East (Navy) is preparing an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA , 42 U.S.C . § 432let seq) to analyze the potential human and
natural environmental consequences of the disposal and reuse of the
surplus property. By this letter, the Navy wishes to initiate
informal consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Servi6e
(NMFS) under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA; 16 U.S . C.
1536 et seq) and Section 305 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act (MSA ; 16 U.S.C.
§ 1801 et seq) for
this proposed Federal action (Proposed Action) .
The Navy previously sent a request for information to the NMFS
Northeast Regional Office on January 9 , 2013 regarding information on
protected species and habitats that may be pres e nt within the proposed
project areas.
The Navy received a response from NMFS on January 31,
2013 indicating the potential presence of several protected species
and species of concern within the general project area. No critical
habitat was identified in the vic inity of the proposed action . .
The Navy also previously sent a re quest for information to the
NMFS Northeast Regional Office on Apri l 11, 2013, for additional
information regarding any essenti al f is h habitat (EFH) that may be
present within the proposed proj ect are a s and comments on the scope of
the EIS analysis . The Navy receive d a r esponse from NMFS on May 8,
2013 indicating that EFH has been desi gnated for 17 federally managed

species in the vicinity of the proposed proj e c t areas in Narragansett
Bay.
As described below , the Na vy has performed an ass e ssment of the
potential effects of the Prop o sed Action on the ide ntified ESA
protected species and species of concern and determined that the
proposed project (1) will have no effect on the federally endangered
North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) and the federally
endangered humpback whale (Megaptera novaengliae); (2) may affect but
is not likely to adversely affect the federally endan gered Kemp's
ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempi) , federally threatened
loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), federally endangered
leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) , federally threatened
green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the federally endangered New
York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South Atlantic and Carolina Distinct
Population Segments (DPS) and federally threatened Gulf of Maine DPS
of the Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxy rinchus) ; and (3) is
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species of
concern, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (Alosa
aestivalis) . The Navy requests your concurrence with our ESA
determination.
Addi tionally, the Navy has performed ari evaluation of the
potential effects of the Proposed Action on fish and their habitat to
determine whether the addition of floating docks at the existing pier
. at the former Naval Hospital property and re-construction of the
existing pier at the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property
would result in an activity that the species or fishery has particular
sensitivity to and/or would result in the loss of habitat important to
a species or fishery.
As described below, the Navy has determined
that the proposed project will not adversely affe c t designated EFH
within the Narragansett Bay. Any impacts are expected to be minor and
temporary in nature.
There would be no long-term i mpacts to
designated EFH within the bay. The Navy requests y our concurrence
with our EFH determination.
The Navy's detailed assessment of potential effects pursuant to
the ESA and MSA is based on the information about the Proposed Action
that is currently known, together with reasonable assumptions about
future activities. The detailed assessment is included as Enclosure
. ( 1) to this letter.
The Navy would like to point out that the e v entual construction of
the i n-water components of the Proposed Action by a future redeveloper
would undoubtedly require authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1 899 , among other federal,
state , and local laws that would be implicated . These USACE
authorizations are Federal actions that would b e e x pected to trigger
the requirement to consult with NMFS under the consultation provisions
of the ESA and MSA. At that ti me , add itional project-specific details
would be available, and effect s on li s ted species or EFH c o uld be

evaluated aga in with the futur e developer and USACE to the extent NMFS
felt that additional consultation was war ranted .
If you have any questions regarding t h is correspondence and
request or require additional project inf ormat ion, my point of contact
is S annon Kam, Natura Resourc es Manager.

ENCLOSURE 1: Effects Assessment
1.0

Background and Project Description:

The EIS analyzes two alternatives for disposal and reuse of the surplus property at NAVSTA
Newport. Alternative 1 is the Navy’s preferred alternative and consists of the reuse of the
surplus property in accordance with the 2011 Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at
NAVSTA Newport (Redevelopment Plan) developed and adopted by the Aquidneck Island
Redevelopment Planning Authority. Alternative 2 has a higher density with a larger footprint
and different mix of land uses relative to Alternative 1. Both alternatives include disposal of the
surplus property at NAVSTA Newport and redevelopment with a mix of land uses, including
commercial, industrial, and active and passive recreation space. The Navy is requesting NMFS
to consider this project review on Alternative 1, only, as it is the preferred alternative.
NAVSTA Newport is located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island in Newport County,
Rhode Island. The surplus property includes (1) the former Navy Lodge site, located in the
Town of Middletown; (2) the former Naval Hospital site, located in the City of Newport; (3)
Tank Farms 1 and 2, located in the Town of Portsmouth; and (4) the Defense Highway/
Stringham Road Corridor, located in the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth (see Enclosure 2).
The primary focus of the Redevelopment Plan is land-based; however, two portions of the
overall proposed action include in-water components and are the focus of this informal
consultation. The in-water activities would be components of the redevelopment of the former
Naval Hospital property and redevelopment of the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor
property as shown in Enclosures 3 and 4. For purposes of this assessment, only construction
impacts have been analyzed for both the ESA Section 7 assessment and the EFH assessment1.
Additionally, the Navy assumes that proposed in-water work described below would be
conducted outside of the June 1 through November 1 window, limiting the potential exposure of
many ESA listed species to the effects of the proposed action. However, mitigation measures,
including limitations on the period of construction, would need to be established during the
permitting stage of the project between NMFS and the project developer.

Former Naval Hospital Property:
The former Naval Hospital property is located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island, on
Narragansett Bay, just southeast of Coasters Island in the City of Newport. Under the
Redevelopment Plan, approximately 2.4 acres of the former Naval Hospital property would be
redeveloped as a waterfront park that would include a pier, pedestrian path, water taxi dockage,
and a boat storage facility. A 250- foot pier currently exists at the site. This pier would be reused as-is, with the addition of two concrete floating docks on each side. Each floating dock
1

No detailed information about the expected uses of the piers at the former Naval Hospital property and the
Defense Highway/Stringham Corridor property is provided in the Redevelopment Plan, and the Navy has
determined that it would be overly speculative to make assumptions as to future operational uses and effects. It
is therefore presumed for purposes of the proposed action that impacts from the uses of the redeveloped piers
would be generally similar to their present and historical uses for fishing and light marine activities; operational
impacts are therefore not assessed in this letter or the EIS. As noted in the cover letter, the redevelopment
authority and/or developers will have further detail about the proposed uses of the redeveloped piers at the time
construction is proposed. Any new environmental impacts from operational aspects of the redeveloped piers
can be analyzed by the future property owner at that time in connection with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Section 404 permit process, Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, the Section 401 Water Quality
Certification (WQC) from the state, and other agency approval processes.

would be 8 feet by 90 feet.2 These floating docks would be supported by pontoons and anchored
in place with pilings and cables. It is assumed that the pilings would be square, pre-stressed
concrete piles measuring 1 foot by 1 foot, which would be constructed off-site. Pile installation
would be completed using an impact hammer on a barge and a crane. To construct the floating
docks, various construction vessels would be necessary, including barges, tugs, and floating
cranes. Construction activities would be completed on a limited spatial scale, concentrated
around the existing pier.

Defense Highway / Stringham Corridor Property:
The Defense Highway/Stringham Corridor property includes 3.6 miles of Defense Highway, one
mile of Stringham Road, a 508-foot portion of Greene Lane, and vacant property along the
roadways and near Midway Pier. In addition to the roadways, recreation/open space use is
proposed at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. A shoreline park would be included with a
fishing pier, kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, a 0.3-acre parking lot, picnic areas, and
pathways.
The existing Midway Pier is approximately 250 feet long, and in a dilapidated condition. Under
the Redevelopment Plan, it would be rebuilt to be a 15-foot wide and 250-foot long concrete
pier.
In-water activities would include removing the existing pier, which is assumed to include
dredging with a clamshell bucket or similar equipment and excavation of the existing pier. If
there are piles associated with the existing pier, they would be removed via either a direct-pull or
vibratory extraction method. Additionally, pile driving to construct the new pier and
construction vessels as described above (see Naval Hospital section) would also be necessary.
Similar to the in-water work at the former Naval Hospital property, construction activities would
be completed on a limited spatial scale, concentrated around the existing pier.
The protected species and species of concern identified in the general project area by NMFS are
discussed below, followed by a discussion of EFH.

2.0

ESA-Listed Species Potentially in the Project Area:

The federally endangered North Atlantic right whale, humpback whale, Kemp’s ridley sea
turtle, leatherback sea turtle, and the New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South Atlantic and
Carolina DPSs of the Atlantic sturgeon; the federally threatened Northwest Atlantic DPS of
loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle, and the Gulf of Maine DPS of the Atlantic sturgeon; and
federal species of concern alewife and blueback herring are known to occur seasonally in the
waters off of Rhode Island and may be present in Narragansett Bay (Colligan 2013). Fin
(Balaenoptera physalus), Sei (Balaenoptera borealis), and Sperm (Physeter macrocephalus)
whales are also seasonally present in New England waters. However, due to their preference for
deeper water depths and the near- shore location of the proposed action, NMFS indicated in their
previous letter response that these species were unlikely to exist in the vicinity of the project
area; they will not be discussed further in this letter.

These dimensions were not specified in the Redevelopment Plan. For purposes of the EIS analysis, dimensions
were assumed to be similar to those provided in plans for the Ann Street Pier provided in a Notice to Bidders
for the Ann Street Pier Design-Build Project, as issued by the City of Newport. The Ann Street Pier is located
approximately 1.2 miles south of the former Naval Hospital along Narragansett Bay. These dimensions were
reviewed by AIRPA and their concurrence was provided.

North Atlantic Right Whale:
In recent correspondence between NMFS and the Navy, NMFS indicated that North Atlantic
right whales can occur seasonally in the waters off of the coast of Rhode Island (Colligan 2013).
However, this species has not been observed within the waters of Narragansett Bay, specifically
in the vicinity of the project area. Right whales are primarily found within waters off of Rhode
Island between December 1 and June 30 while they are migrating between their southern calving
grounds and northern feeding grounds. However, right whales have been observed in the waters
off of Rhode Island during all seasons of the year (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010). Although
the waters off of Rhode Island have not been identified as a target feeding region for the species,
an aggregation of 18 North Atlantic right whales was observed feeding off Rhode Island in April
1998, and 98 North Atlantic right whales were observed feeding near Rhode Island Sound on
April 20, 2010 (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010; NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries
Science Center n.d.). It has been assumed that both of these events were episodes of
opportunistic feeding.
While there is a known presence of North Atlantic right whales in the waters off of Rhode Island,
due to their lack of occurrence within Narragansett Bay itself, it is not expected that this species
would be present during in-water project activities. Therefore, the Navy anticipates that the
proposed action would have no effect on North Atlantic right whales.

Humpback Whale:
In recent correspondence between NMFS and the Navy, NMFS indicated that humpback whales
can occur seasonally in the waters off of the coast of Rhode Island (Colligan 2013). This species
has not been observed within the waters of Narragansett Bay, specifically in the vicinity of the
project area. However, there were four strandings of humpback whales on Aquidneck Island
between 2001 and 2005: (1) June 22, 2001 in Easton Bay in Newport; (2) August 10, 2001 on the
western side of Sachuset Point National Wildlife Refuge in Middletown; (3) June 3, 2004 on
East Beach in Ninigret Conservation Area in Charlestown; and (4) July 6, 2005 on Bailey’s
Beach in Newport (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010). Humpback whales can be found within
waters off of Rhode Island during all four seasons; however they are primarily present between
March 15 and November 30.
While there is a known presence of humpback whales in the waters off of Rhode Island, due to
their lack of occurrence within Narragansett Bay itself (other than strandings), it is not expected
that this species would be present during in-water project activities. Therefore, the Navy
anticipates that the proposed action would have no effect on humpback whales.

Atlantic Sturgeon:
Atlantic sturgeon are distributed within estuarine and marine waters along the entire East Coast.
Atlantic sturgeon travel wide ranges from their natal river. They spend spring months spawning
upriver where the salt front and fall line of large rivers meet and inhabit estuarine and coastal
waters when not spawning (NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources 2012). Atlantic
sturgeon have been known to occur in Narragansett Bay. Historically, Atlantic sturgeon were
reported to spawn in the Taunton River (which empties into Narragansett Bay northeast of
Aquidneck Island near Somerset); however, spawning adults have not recently been documented
in the river (Atlantic Sturgeon Status Review Team 2007). Atlantic sturgeon, should they be
present, are currently restricted to the lower 70 kilometers (43.50 miles) of the river due to the
Page 3 of 21

Town River Pond Dam which blocks the fish from migrating further up the river. The river and
the greater Narragansett Bay estuary are likely used by Atlantic sturgeon as nursery habitat.
Should Atlantic sturgeon be present within Narragansett Bay, individuals could be from any of
the five DPSs (Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, Chesapeake, Carolina and South Atlantic).
The potential occurrence of Atlantic sturgeon near the proposed project areas would include the
juvenile and adult life stages, since juvenile Atlantic sturgeon can spend months to years in
estuaries. Their reliance on benthic organisms for food and their affinity for shallow nearshore
areas may bring them to the waters near the former Naval Hospital property and the Defense
Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property. Juvenile Atlantic sturgeon are believed to remain
close to their natal habitats within the freshwater portion of the estuary for at least one year
before beginning their migration out to sea (Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission 2009).
They are typically believed to gradually move downstream into brackish waters and remain in
estuarine waters for months or years (USFWS 2001). Juvenile Atlantic sturgeon have been
documented as being found over a variety of substrates, including sand, rock, silt and mud;
juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in Massachusetts were found mostly over sand substrates (Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission 2009). They feed on benthic organisms. Offshore of the
former Naval Hospital property, within approximately 0.1 miles of the shoreline, marine
sediment types are largely unsampled. Farther out, the dominant sediment type is clay-silt
(Raposa n.d.). Similarly for the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property, within
approximately 0.1 miles of the shoreline, marine sediment types are largely unsampled. Farther
out, the dominant sediment type is clay-silt, with a larger area of sand located between the
former Midway Pier and Weaver Cove. The likely clay-silt substrate, coupled with the existing
hard structures (i.e., piers) at each site, limit the potential for juvenile sturgeon occurrence.
The Navy expects that any Atlantic sturgeon present from any of the DPSs in the proposed
project areas would be transient and would readily disperse from any in-water disturbance.
Nonetheless, Atlantic sturgeon may be present within Narragansett Bay and therefore could be
exposed to effects of the proposed action. Therefore, the Navy anticipates that the proposed
action may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the Atlantic sturgeon.

Alewife and Blueback Herring:
Alewife and blueback herring are referred to collectively as “river herring”. They are
anadramous fish that move from marine waters into coastal rivers during the spring to spawn
(NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service 2007). River herring are distributed along the
Atlantic coast from Canada to southeastern United States (Federal Register [FR] Vol. 76, No.
212). The coastal ranges of the two species overlap, with blueback herring found in a greater
and more southerly distribution ranging from Nova Scotia down to the St. John’s River, Florida;
and alewife found in a more northerly distribution, from Labrador and Newfoundland to as far
south as South Carolina, though the extreme southern range is a less common occurrence (FR
Vol. 76, No.212). Spawning is driven greatly by the water temperature; however they generally
migrate into spawning rivers and estuarine systems (such as Narragansett Bay) from later March
through mid- May (FR Vol. 76, No. 212). Alewife are found in the Narragansett Bay Estuarine
Reserve (NOAA 2013). Alewife utilize Narragansett Bay and its tributaries during their
spawning migration (Narragansett Bay Estuary Program n.d.). Blueback herring are also found
in rivers, streams, and adjacent areas that drain into Narragansett Bay. In 2012 it was reported
that river herring were observed within some Rhode Island rivers in early March, three weeks
earlier than when they are normally first observed (Edwards 2012).
Page 4 of 21

Alewife and blueback herring are both common within Rhode Island waters, and in particular,
Narragansett Bay from spring through late fall (University of Rhode Island n.d.), outside of the
assumed construction window. Nevertheless, to be conservative, it is assumed that they may be
present within Narragansett Bay and therefore could be exposed to the effects of the proposed
action. However, the Navy anticipates that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the species of concern, alewife and blueback herring.

Northwest Atlantic DPS of Loggerhead Sea Turtle:
In recent correspondence between NMFS and the Navy, NMFS indicated that individuals from
the Northwest Atlantic DPS of loggerhead sea turtle can occur seasonally in the waters of New
England (Colligan 2013). This species is the most commonly observed species of sea turtle in
New England waters. They are present between June 1 and November 1 during their migration
to and from wintering grounds and are absent from the region during winter months.
Loggerhead sea turtles generally migrate north when water temperatures exceed 16°Celcius (C)
(61°Fahrenheit [F]). The loggerhead sea turtle abundance at the project location within
Narragansett Bay is unknown; however juveniles are regularly known to occur within the larger
area of the Bay. Loggerheads have been documented within Narragansett Bay around
Aquidneck Island (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010; Narragansett Bay National Estuarine
Research Reserve [NBNERR] 2009). While concentrations of loggerhead sea turtles in Rhode
Island waters are primarily observed over the continental shelf, it is likely that these data may
misrepresent the distribution and abundance of loggerhead sea turtles in New England waters
due to the high likelihood that juveniles are known to occur in embayments and bays, yet this life
stage is often too small to be observed during surveys and that the majority of surveys do not
cover these inland marine and estuarine water bodies (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010).
Loggerhead sea turtles (specifically juveniles) are not known to concentrate in the proposed
project areas, and if they were to be present, it is likely this species would be using the
Narragansett Bay during summer and fall months (Colligan 2013), outside of the assumed
construction window. Nevertheless, to be conservative, it is assumed that they may be present
within Narragansett Bay and therefore could be exposed to the effects of the proposed action.
Therefore, the Navy anticipates that the proposed action may affect but is not likely to adversely
affect the loggerhead sea turtle.

Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle:
In recent correspondence between NMFS and the Navy, NMFS indicated that Kemp’s ridley sea
turtles can occur seasonally in the waters of New England (Colligan 2013). This species is the
second most commonly observed species of sea turtle in New England waters. They are present
between June 1 and November 1 during their migration to and from wintering grounds and are
absent from the region during winter months. The Kemp’s ridley sea turtle abundance at the
project locations within Narragansett Bay is unknown; however juveniles are regularly known to
occur within the larger area of the Bay. Kemp’s ridleys have been documented within
Narragansett Bay around Aquidneck Island (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010; NBNERR
2009). In southern New England, juvenile Kemp’s ridley sea turtles are known to regularly
occur in the shallower waters of Cape Cod Bay and Long Island Sound; therefore, it is likely that
they also occur with some regularity in Narragansett Bay. Similar to loggerhead sea turtles, it is
likely that the current survey data misrepresent the presence of Kemp’s ridley sea turtles within
bays and embayments, such as Narragansett Bay, due to the size of the juveniles likely to be
Page 5 of 21

present and a general lack of survey coverage within bays and embayments (Kenney and
Vigness-Raposa 2010).
Although Kemp’s ridley sea turtles (specifically juveniles) are not known to concentrate in the
proposed project areas, and if they were to be present, it is likely this species would be using the
Narragansett Bay during summer and fall months (Colligan 2013), outside of the assumed
construction window. Nevertheless, to be conservative, it is assumed that they may be present
within Narragansett Bay and therefore could be exposed to the effects of the proposed action.
Therefore, the Navy anticipates that the proposed action may affect but is not likely to adversely
affect the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle.

Leatherback Sea Turtle:
In recent correspondence between NMFS and the Navy, NMFS indicated that leatherback sea
turtles can occur seasonally in the waters of New England (Colligan 2013). While not as
commonly observed as loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, leatherback sea turtles are also
present in New England waters, in particular within Rhode Island waters between June 1 and
November 1. The leatherback sea turtle abundance at the project locations within Narragansett
Bay is unknown. While this species generally prefers deeper pelagic waters, individuals are
known to occur within the vicinity of the mouth of Narragansett Bay. In 2007, a leatherback sea
turtle was disentangled from a buoy line off Hope Island, which is located northwest of the
project areas, further within the Bay. While these species are larger than other sea turtles present
within the area and are more likely to be observed during a survey, it is likely that the current
survey data still misrepresent the presence of leatherback sea turtles within bays and
embayments, such as Narragansett Bay, due to a general lack of survey coverage within bays and
embayments (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010).
Although leatherback sea turtles are not known to concentrate in the proposed project areas, and
if they were to be present, it is likely this species would be using the Narragansett Bay during
summer and fall months (Colligan 2013), outside of the assumed construction window.
Nevertheless, to be conservative, it is assumed that they may be present within Narragansett Bay
and therefore could be exposed to the effects of the proposed action. Therefore, the Navy
anticipates that the proposed action may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the
leatherback sea turtle.

Green Sea Turtle:
In recent correspondence between NMFS and the Navy, NMFS indicated that green sea turtles
can occur seasonally in the waters of New England (Colligan 2013). While it is the rarest of the
four sea turtle species found within New England waters, the green sea turtle can be found within
the region between June 1 and November 1. This species is greatly limited by water
temperature, occurring in New England primarily during the summer months. The green sea
turtle abundance at the project areas within Narragansett Bay is unknown; however it is likely
that should green sea turtles be present within Narragansett Bay, they would most likely be
juveniles, as this is the life stage that is most frequently reported within New England waters,
similar to Kemp’s ridleys (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010). Green sea turtles are not
commonly reported in survey data of New England waters; however, similar to the other sea
turtle species discussed above, it is likely that the current survey data misrepresent the presence
of green sea turtles within bays and embayments, such as Narragansett Bay, due to the size of the

Page 6 of 21

juveniles likely to be present and a general lack of survey coverage within bays and embayments
(Kenney and Vigness-Raposa 2010).
Although green sea turtles (specifically juveniles) are not known to concentrate in the proposed
project areas, and if they were to be present, it is likely this species would be using the
Narragansett Bay during summer and fall months (Colligan 2013), outside of the assumed
construction window. Nevertheless, to be conservative, it is assumed that they may be present
within Narragansett Bay and therefore could be exposed to the effects of the proposed action.
Therefore, the Navy anticipates that the proposed action may affect but is not likely to adversely
affect the green sea turtle.

EFH Designation in the Project Area

Federally Managed Species:
The Navy sent a scoping letter to the NMFS Northeast Regional Office on April 11, 2013,
requesting additional information regarding EFH within the proposed project areas and
comments on the scope of the EIS analysis. The Navy received a response from NMFS on May
8, 2013, indicating that EFH has been designated for 17 federally managed species in the vicinity
of the proposed project sites in Narragansett Bay. Table 1 identifies these species and their
respective life stages as were obtained utilizing NMFS online resources (NOAA 2013).

Habitat Areas of Particular Concern Designation:
As noted in NMFS’s letter of May 8, 2013, eelgrass (Zostera marina) has been designated by the
Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) and
is considered important habitat for fish spawning and foraging.
Offshore of the former Naval Hospital property, the depth to bottom ranges between 10 and 20
feet and the marine sediment is dominated by clay-silt. The open water area south of
Coddington Point is mapped as a macroalgal bed (Naval Facilities Engineering Command MidAtlantic 2001). Shoreline and aquatic habitat typical of this region include eelgrass (NBNERR
2009). However, no mapped eelgrass beds have been documented in the waters offshore of the
former Naval Hospital property according to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management, Narragansett Bay Program and Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management
Council (2003) and Applied Science Associates (2011).
Approximately 2 acres of eelgrass habitat have been identified within the property boundaries of
the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property. In addition, approximately 13 acres of
eelgrass have been mapped within 200 feet of the surplus property generally south of the
Midway Pier. The remaining area between the former Midway Pier and Weaver Cove is
dominated by clay-silt sediment. The water depths around the former Midway Pier are within a
0 to 20-foot bathymetric contour.

Potential Effects of the Action

The following provides an analysis of potential effects under Section 7 and the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

4.1

Noise Effects of Pile Driving:

In-water work at the former Naval Hospital property would include construction of two concrete
floating docks along the existing pier; in-water work at the Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor property would include removal of the former Midway Pier structure and
redevelopment of the site for a fishing pier. Activities assumed to have hydroacoustic noise
impacts include the following: installing concrete piers using a diesel impact hammer, dredging
with a clamshell bucket, and possible piling removal. Pilings would be removed by either directpull or vibratory extraction. At both properties, new pilings would be installed using an impact
hammer, in addition to a barge with a crane. Other noise would also be generated by support
vessels, small boat traffic, and barge mounted equipment; however, this other noise is likely
consistent with existing vessel traffic in the Bay and in the nearby NAVSTA Newport and East
Passage Yachting Center/Melville marinas.

Page 8 of 21

The focus of this analysis will be the noise impacts of pile driving. [Note: Other noise would
also be generated by construction vessels and barge mounted equipment; however, these noises
are not likely to create a short-term adverse effect on fish, as fish in the area are already exposed
to similar noise levels from existing vessel traffic in the Bay and in the nearby NAVSTA
Newport and the East Passage Yachting Center/Melville marinas.] Pile driving associated with
the proposed action would result in increased underwater noise levels potentially affecting fish
and sea turtle species found in the Narragansett Bay.
Three metrics are commonly used in evaluating hydroacoustic impacts on marine species
(California Department of Transportation [CALTRANS] 2009):
■ Peak sound pressure level (Peak) – The absolute value of the maximum variation from
neutral
■ Root mean square (RMS) – The square root of the sum of the squares of the pressure
contained within a defined period of time
■ Sound exposure level (SEL) – The constant sound level over 1 second.
Sound in the water has different properties than sound in the air. Sound moves 4.5 times faster
in water than it does in air, making it a very effective sensory mechanism for species that spend a
large part, if not all of their life, underwater. Similar to in-air sound, in-water sound uses the
decibel (dB) scale for measurement; however, the reference pressure in-water is referenced at
(re) 1 micro Pascal (μPa), whereas in-air it is re 20 μPa.
To determine potential effects of in-water sound on fish and sea turtles it is important to
understand both the potential source level and how the sound will travel away from that source.
As sound travels away from a source it loses power with increasing distance. This is known as
transmission loss (TL). How a sound travels away from a source depends on a variety of factors,
including the original source level, the local salinity and water temperature, substrate
composition, and water depth.

Source Sound Levels:
Actual sound levels produced during pile driving are greatly dependent on specific
characteristics of the pile and the hammer. For example, a larger pile will require more energy to
drive it into the seafloor; therefore, sound produced while driving larger piles is generally greater
than when driving smaller piles which require less energy. The method of pile driving is also
important in the amount of sound produced. Impact pile driving produces a more impulsive and
high energy sound, whereas vibratory pile driving produces a continuous and lower energy
sound. The method of pile driving chosen for a project often depends on the types of piles that
need to be driven and the composition of the sediment the pile will be driven into.
The Compendium of Pile Driving Sound Data, prepared by California Department of
Transportation (CALTRANS 2007) provides information on sound pressures resulting from pile
driving measured throughout Northern California. Eight projects were reviewed for this
compendium, for which both 16-inch and 24 piles were driven into the sea floor. Although the
size of the piles for the proposed Naval Hospital pier and redeveloped Midway Pier would be 12inches, the information presented in the compendium can be used to predict underwater sound
levels from marine pile driving projects when site specific information is unavailable, and to
determine the effectiveness of measures used to control the noise (CALTRANS 2007).

feet) unattenuated sound pressures for in-water pile driving using an impact hammer for a 16inch and 24-inch concrete pile.

Transmission Loss:
Because it is not always possible to obtain all the information necessary to determine sitespecific TL, as with the proposed action, the NMFS recognizes the Practical Spreading Loss
model as the best method to generally determine how sound could travel away from a source.
Table 3 presents the Peak and RMS for pile driving at a distance of 33 feet from the source based
on the source level data for a 16-inch diameter concrete pile at a depth of 23 feet (see Table 2).
Table 3 also presents the SEL and accumulated SEL for pile driving a 24-inch diameter concrete
pile, as these data were unavailable for a 16-inch diameter pile. The accumulated SEL, as
referenced in the available literature, was calculated based on an average number of strikes it
could take to drive a concrete pile to depth. According to CALTRANS (2009), a 24-inch
concrete pile would take approximately 580 individual strikes for each pile to be driven to the
expected depth. (Because more project-specific information was not available, this pile strike
average was used for calculations and thus the accumulated SEL can also be considered
conservative.)

Fish:
Potential physiological impacts on fish from underwater noise include impacts on the swim
bladder as well as fish hearing. Bony fish maintain buoyancy through an internal air sac called a
swim bladder. When a fish is exposed to a sound wave, gas in the swim bladder expands more
than surrounding tissue during periods of underpressure and contracts more than surrounding
tissue during periods of overpressure. This can cause the swim bladder to oscillate and result in
tissue damage, including rupture of the swim bladder (Popper and Hastings 2009). Therefore,
human-generated sources of noise can be fatal to fish.
Page 11 of 21

Additionally, fish hearing can be impacted by noise such as that generated by pile driving. The
primary auditory structures in a fish’s inner ear are sensory hair cells and otoliths, which are
dense calcified structures that overlie a tissue layer containing numerous sensory hair cells (State
University of New York Stony Brook 2001). Exposure to higher levels of sound for shorter
periods of time may result in damage to the sensory hair cells of the ear or temporary hearing
loss, also referred to as Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS) in fish (Popper 2003; CALTRANS
2009).
The potential for injury to fish species from pile driving is based on dual criteria thresholds as
noted in Table 4. These thresholds were developed by the 2004 Fisheries Hydroacoustic
Working Group (FHWG) composed of the Federal Highway Administration; departments of
transportation in California, Oregon, and Washington; representatives from NOAA Fisheries, the
USFWS, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These thresholds were developed to take into
account the three major effects associated with pile driving: non-auditory tissue damage,
auditory tissue damage (hair cell damage), and TTS (FHWG 2008). NMFS recognizes these
thresholds as the accepted criteria to determine injury to fish species. To determine potential
behavioral effects to fish species of all sizes, NMFS uses 150 dB re 1µPa RMS SPL as the
threshold criteria.
Based on the conservative calculations described above, it is expected that injury based on
accumulated SEL could occur to fish greater than 2 grams (i.e. Atlantic sturgeon) within 33 feet
of impact pile driving and to fish less than 2 grams within 66 feet of impact pile driving.
Behavioral disturbance could occur to fish of all sizes within 83 feet of impact pile driving (see
Table 4). However, because the ensonified area is very small and mitigation measures such as a
bubble curtain will be put in place, it is expected that these areas would be reduced in size.
Should Atlantic sturgeon, alewife or blueback herring be found within the vicinity of either
project area, they would be able to detect pile-driving noises which, as a result, may elicit an
avoidance response to the waters around the in-water project area.
If any of the three species were present, using the established injury thresholds for fish and
comparing them with the summary of pile driving sound levels (Table 3), the peak threshold for
injury would not be exceeded. There is a potential for impact based on accumulated SEL for a
single pile within at least 33 feet of active impact pile driving and behavioral disturbance within
83 feet of impact pile driving (Table 3). However, it is anticipated that any protected fish would
not be subject to these injurious levels of sound, as mitigation, such as bubble curtains, to reduce
the sound levels would be implemented during future redevelopment.
To mitigate potential impacts on protected fish species, mitigation measures could include:
■ Install a bubble curtain to reduce in-water noise during pile driving.
■ Drive piles with a cushion made of wood to reduce pressure pulse (Miller et al. 2010).
After pile driving stops, fish would likely return to the area. Popper and Hastings (2009)
reported that various fish species have been found to abandon areas when the sound from human
activities surpasses the local ambient noise levels, only to return after the sound source has been
removed and ambient noise levels return to normal. Therefore, it could be assumed that fish may
alter their normal behavior, including startle response and avoidance of the immediate
Page 12 of 21

construction area, but as pile driving and dredging would be short-term, occurrence of these
species near the construction areas would not change significantly.
Based on the efforts to reduce the level of sound produced by the pile driving, and the already
small calculated transmission loss distances (e.g. 83 foot behavioral disturbance), the only
impacts from pile driving are expected to be behavioral disturbance and would only be
temporary in duration; therefore the effects of pile driving on Atlantic sturgeon, alewife and
blueback herring, if they were present during the construction window, would not be significant
or adverse, and are not expected to result in any “take” of a listed species or species of concern.

Sea Turtles:
Similar to fish, in-water noise may also be audible to sea turtles within the vicinity of the project
areas. Sea turtles are expected to avoid disturbing levels of sound originating from impulsive
sources (O’Hara & Wilcox 1990; McCauley et al. 2000). There are currently no official
threshold criteria for either potential injury or behavioral disturbance/harassment for sea turtles.
However, McCauley et al. (2000) reported that impulsive source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS
were required to induce a behavioral reaction in captive green and loggerhead sea turtles. Based
on this information, NMFS has determined that source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS or greater
could cause behavioral disturbance and/or other behavioral or physiological impacts (Lecky
2009). Little information is available regarding the potential biological consequences of hearing
loss or behavioral responses associated with in-water construction noise. There is also little
known about the potential short-term or long-term impacts to sea turtle populations from
exposure to impulsive noise sources such as impact pile driving.
Based on the threshold level used by NMFS, there is the potential for disturbance to sea turtles
should impact pile driving occur when sea turtles are present in Narragansett Bay (early summer
through late fall). Based on the Practical Spreading Loss model, it is expected that disturbance to
sea turtles could occur within 50 feet of active impact pile driving (see Table 3). It is likely that
sea turtles would avoid the areas where in-water construction was occurring. Therefore, it is
expected that impacts to sea turtles would be temporary in nature, and result in temporary
displacement during pile driving and construction activities. However, large numbers of sea
turtles are not expected to be exposed to pile driving noise during the time frame of in-water
work due to the limited spatial scale of the construction and the low density of sea turtles within
the Narragansett Bay, and in particular within the vicinity of both the former Naval Hospital and
the Defense Highway / Stringham Road Corridor properties. Also, the implementation of the
potential mitigation measures described above for fish would reduce the risk of sea turtles being
exposed to harassing levels of sound. In addition to the possible mitigation measures described
above, a trained Protected Species Observer stationed at shore-side locations or in a boat could
also be present during all pile-driving activities to monitor for the presence of sea turtles. Should
a sea turtle be observed within 50 feet of active impact pile driving, work could be stopped until
the animal has exited the area. As such, the effects of pile driving on loggerhead, Kemp’s ridley,
leatherback and green sea turtles would not be significant or adverse, and are not expected to
result in any “take” of a listed species.

EFH:
Based on the analysis provided above, noise generated by pile driving will not adversely affect
designated EFH within the Narragansett Bay.

4.2

Water Quality Effects of Pile Driving:

During construction, sediment would be displaced as the pilings are embedded in the bottom
sediments. This would displace a volume of sediment at least equivalent to the volume of pilings
below the subsurface. The displacement of this sediment volume would increase suspended
sediment and turbidity during the pile-driving operation but it would be localized in the project
area and would settle soon thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several hours). Once in place,
concrete pilings would not impact surface waters because concrete is an inert material and not
chemically coated and therefore does not leach creosote, heavy metals, or other coating agents.
Removal of the existing pier at the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property would
include dredging with a clamshell bucket, as well as possible piling removal. Pilings would be
removed by either direct-pull or vibratory extraction. The resuspension of bottom sediments
(assumed to be clay-silt) during both the installation of the new piers and the removal of existing
piers would likely have a short-term, minor adverse impact on the water column.
Resuspended bottom sediments may also contain contaminants formerly buried in the sediments.
Subsequent oxidation of sulfides, reduced iron, and organic matter associated with the suspended
sediments would consume some DO in the water column. Overall, the impacts of sediment
resuspension from these activities on DO concentrations would be minimal because of the small
area of disturbance compared to the greater Narragansett Bay area and the effects would be
spatially limited to the areas immediately surrounding the project sites. Furthermore, the
suspended sediments would settle soon thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several hours).
The impacts of sediment resuspension from these activities on DO concentrations would be
minimal because of the small area of disturbance compared to the greater Narragansett Bay area.
Increased suspended sediment concentrations generated by propeller wash from construction
vessel traffic and pile driving activities, could result in reduced light transmittance and increased
oxygen demand, the latter leading to reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations. Increases in
turbidity and decreases in dissolved oxygen concentrations are known to be harmful to marine
species. For example, studies investigating turbidity impacts on salmon from large scale
sediment dredging operations showed that increased turbidity levels from these activities caused
adverse effects (Redding et al. 1987; Servizi and Martens 1991; Nightingale and Simstead
2001a). However, these effects are spatially limited to the areas immediately surrounding the
project site.
Increased turbidity would likely result in displacement of protected fish species and sea turtle
species should they be present during in-water construction; however, displacement would be
temporary (up to several hours) and limited to the time of in-water construction. There would be
minimal degradation of the water column, with little to no impact on dissolved oxygen levels in
the vicinity of the proposed project area because of the small area of disturbance compared to the
greater Narragansett Bay size. Also, protected fish species and sea turtle species occurring in the
area are already exposed to turbidity from existing vessel traffic in the Bay and the nearby
NAVSTA Newport and East Passage Yachting Center / Melville marinas. As a result, the effects
of suspended sediment resulting from construction activities on Atlantic sturgeon, alewife,
blueback herring and any sea turtle species would not be significant or adverse, and are not
expected to result in any “take” of a listed species or species of concern.

EFH:
Page 14 of 21

Based on the analysis provided above, water quality impacts resulting from in-water construction
activities will not adversely affect designated EFH within the Narragansett Bay.

4.3

Habitat Loss from Pile Installation:

The portions of benthic communities within the footprint of the individual piles supporting the
fishing pier and floating piers, as well as in the proposed area for dredging, would likely be
destroyed, resulting in a minor, permanent loss of benthic substrate in the Narragansett Bay.
Benthic organisms, especially slow-moving, fixed, or sediment-dwelling organisms (such as
clams, small crustaceans, marine snails, sea cucumbers, worms, urchins, and sea stars) would be
most vulnerable to this impact. Larger or more mobile benthic species such as the crab, shrimp,
or groundfish would likely sense the construction activity and could move out of the area.
Nevertheless, it is possible that these species may not sense which direction to move to avoid
dredging, or become disoriented and could be caught directly by the dredge. The amount of
suspended sediments settling in the surrounding area would not be significant enough to bury
benthic species in the area. Within a few hours of the dredging, mobile benthic scavenger
species such as crab, shrimp, and sea stars would likely migrate to the impact area to feed on
benthic organisms that had been crushed or injured.
The decrease in soft-bottom habitat (the footprint of the piles) and increase in hard substrate
habitat would result in a localized change in species composition over the long term. Benthic
species that burrow into a substrate, such as clams and worms, thrive in particular types of
materials. By replacing (very small) portions of the seafloor with pilings, pre-construction
benthic communities would be slightly altered by the proposed action. The pilings would
increase the available in-water surface area and create colonization sites for hard-bottom species
such as mussels (Mytilus spp.), barnacles (Balanus spp.), and sea anemones (the fouling
community, or the community of organisms found on artificial surfaces). The new community
also would support other species such as copepods, amphipods, annelids, gastropods, and sea
stars that would feed and take refuge in the newly created environment (Kozloff 1996).
Filter- and suspension-feeding invertebrates (e.g., bivalves, tunicates, crustaceans, and some
polychaetes) may close their shells, suspend feeding, or increase feeding rates in response to
turbidity increases (LaSalle et al. 1991; Cruz-Rodriguez and Chu 2002). Marine invertebrates
have been shown to be tolerant of relatively high suspended solid concentrations over periods of
hours to days, with adverse impacts limited to prolonged exposures (e.g., continuously up to 21
days) and/or to high concentrations (e.g., fluid mud) (reviews in LaSalle et al. 1991; O’Connor
1991; Clarke and Wilber 2000). However, because of the limited time pile driving and dredging
would occur (i.e., minutes at a time for several days) along with the limited increase in turbidity
levels, there would not be a significant loss of benthic species in the vicinity of project areas.
None of the protected species or species of concern discussed in this analysis are known to occur
specifically within the vicinity of the former Naval Hospital or the Defense Highway/Stringham
Road Corridor properties. Therefore, while the Atlantic sturgeon, Northwest Atlantic DPS of
loggerhead sea turtle, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, green sea turtle, alewife,
and blueback herring may be found within Narragansett Bay during specific seasons, their lack
of known occurrence specifically near the two proposed construction areas indicates that habitat
conditions of the Bay within the project area may not be ideal for these species. Therefore, the
minimal loss of benthic substrate resulting from the proposed project would not result in any
significant or adverse impacts to the species discussed here.

EFH:
Based on the analysis provided above, the minimal loss of benthic substrate resulting from the
proposed project will not adversely affect designated EFH within the Narragansett Bay.

4.4

Impacts to Marine Vegetation (EFH Assessment Only):

Marine fish use aquatic vegetation habitat for foraging and refuge. One of the most important
marine vegetation types to the marine ecosystem is eelgrass. Eelgrass beds produce large
amounts of carbon that fuel nearshore food webs. This environment offers habitat to various life
stages of many marine species, including shellfish, such as crabs and bivalves. Within the
vicinity of the former Naval Hospital property, there is no eelgrass present; therefore, there
would be no impacts to the HAPC.
The proposed redevelopment of the former Midway Pier at the Defense Highway/Stringham
Road Corridor property would be located within the same footprint as the existing pier. This
would result in approximately 0.005 acres of disturbance of seafloor. However, the eelgrass
beds that are located along the waterfront near the proposed shoreline park would not be directly
impacted during construction of the pier because the development footprint does not overlap
with the mapped locations of eelgrass.
Research has shown that light-blocking overwater structures can directly impact benthic
productivity in underlying substrates (Simenstad et al. 1999). Dock height over the marine
bottom is an important variable for predicting the relative light reaching the marine vegetation
such as eelgrass, and therefore, the eelgrass bed quality under these structures. In general,
increased dock height reduced the intensity of shading by providing a greater distance for light to
diffuse and refract around the dock surface before reaching the eelgrass canopy (Nightingale and
Simenstad 2001b). The overwater floating docks at the former Naval Hospital property would
increase shading in the immediate area, more so than if they were fixed and elevated. However,
no eelgrass beds or other marine vegetation are located near the Naval Hospital property;
therefore, there would be no impact to these resources.
At the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property, the pier currently at the site would
be reconstructed within the existing pier footprint. This pier would be fixed, not floating. The
elevation would allow sufficient light to diffuse and refract under the pier. Furthermore, the
existing pier is located far enough from nearby eelgrass beds that overshading from the
reconstructed pier is unlikely to significantly impact the HAPC in Narragansett Bay.

Conclusions:
ESA Section 7 Effects Determination:

Based on the foregoing analysis for ESA listed species, the Navy has determined that the
proposed action will (1) have no effect on North Atlantic right whale or humpback whale; (2)
may affect, but with implementation of mitigation measures by a future redeveloper, is not likely
to adversely affect Atlantic sturgeon, Northwest Atlantic DPS of loggerhead sea turtle, Kemp’s
ridley sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, and green sea turtle; and (3) is not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the alewife or blueback herring.

5.2

EFH Effects Determination:
Page 16 of 21

Designated EFH within the vicinity of each project site would be affected as a result of
temporary disturbance and displacement of fish; temporary increase in sediment loads and
turbidity in the water column; and a minor but permanent disruption of benthic communities
within the footprint of the individual piles and dredged area. The effects would generally be
minor and short term, and would be further offset by implementation of mitigation measures. No
eelgrass beds would be directly impacted by the proposed activity. As a result, the Navy has
determined environmental impacts from the proposed reconstruction of the piers will not
adversely affect designated EFH within the Narragansett Bay. All impacts are expected to be
minor and short-term in nature.

Newport, RI 02841
Re: ESA Section 7 and EFH comments on Naval Station Newport Rhode Island surplus
property project

Dear D. D. Dorocz:
We have completed an Endangered Species Act (ESA) section 7 consultation in response to your
letter dated March 27, 2014 regarding the proposed construction activity at Naval Station
(NAVSTA) Newport. We concur with your determination that the proposed project may affect,
but is not likely to adversely affect, any species listed by us as threatened or endangered under
the ESA of 1973, as amended. Our supporting analysis is provided below.
Proposed Project
You are proposing activities for the redevelopment of property at NA VSTA Newport which is
located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island in Newport County, RI. Construction activity
is expected to take place between November and May.

Two concrete floating docks will be installed at the former Naval Hospital Property. Each
floating dock will be 8 feet by 90 feet. The floating docks will be supported by pontoons and
anchored in place with 1 foot by 1 foot square, concrete piles. The piles will be installed via an
impact hammer.
At the Defense Highway/Stringham Corridor Property, an existing 250 foot long pier will be
removed. This will involve using a clamshell bucket dredge, direct pull of the piles, and/or
vibratory extraction method. A new 15 foot wide by 250 foot long concrete pier will be
installed. Concrete piles will be installed via the same method described above.

NMFS Listed Species in Project Area
The action area is defined as "all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action
and not merely the immediate area involved in the action" (50 CFR§402.02). For this project,
the action area includes the project footprint as well as the underwater area where effects of
dredging and pile driving (i.e., increase in suspended sediment, elevated levels of underwater
noise) will be experienced. Based on analysis of other mechanical dredging activities (Burton
1993; ACOE 2007), suspended sediment plumes are expected to be fully dissipated at a distance
of 620-1,500 meters from the dredge site. The exact size of the plume is influenced by the
particular dredge used, the dredge operator, sediment type, strength of current and tidal stage and
is likely to vary throughout the project. Regardless of these variables, the maximum distance of
increased suspended sediment is likely to be 1,500 meters from the dredge bucket. Analysis of
drilling and pile driving activities indicate that effects of increased under water noise will be
experienced from a 10-1,000 meter radius of the pile to be driven/drilled (Illingworth and
Rodkin, Inc. and Jones and Stoke 2009; HDR Alaska, Inc 2011). As such, the action area is
considered to be that area within the Narragansett Bay located within a 1,500 meter radius from
the area to be dredged and a 10-1 ,000 meter radius of piles being driven. This area is expected to
encompass all of the effects of the proposed project.
Sea Turtles
Four species of federally listed threatened or endangered sea turtles under our jurisdiction may
be found seasonally in the coastal waters of Rhode Island: the threatened Northwest Atlantic
Ocean distinct population segment (DPS) ofloggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the endangered
Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempi), green (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback (Dermochelys
coriacea) sea turtles, although leatherbacks are found in deeper, more offshore waters and are
unlikely to occur in the action area. In general, listed sea turtles are seasonally distributed in
coastal U.S. Atlantic waters, migrating to and from habitats extending from Florida to New
England, with overwintering concentrations in southern waters. As water temperatures rise in the
spring, these turtles begin to migrate northward. As temperatures decline rapidly in the fall,
turtles in northern waters begin their southward migration. Sea turtles are expected to be in the
coastal waters of Rhode Island in warmer months, typically when water temperatures are at least
l5°C. This generally coincides with the months of May through November, with the highest
concentration of sea turtles present from June through October (Morreale 1999; Morreale 2003;
Morreale and Standora 2005; Shoop and Kenney 1992). Overlap between sea turtle presence and
the proposed project would occur in May and November.
As the project area is shallower (less than 16 feet) than areas in the Northeast where sea turtles
typically occur, sea turtles are not likely to be present in the sites of the proposed project.
However, as sea turtles are known to be present in Rhode Island waters from May through
November, they may be present in the action area.

Atlantic Sturgeon
There are five DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon listed as threatened or endangered. Atlantic sturgeon
originating from the New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South Atlantic and Carolina DPSs are
listed as endangered, while the Gulf of Maine DPS is listed as threatened. The marine range of
all five DPSs extends along the Atlantic coast from Canada to Cape Canaveral, Florida.

2

Atlantic sturgeon spawn in their natal river, with spawning migrations generally occurring during
February-March in southern systems, April-May in Mid-Atlantic systems, and May-July in
Canadian systems (Murawski and Pacheco 1977; Smith, 1985; Bain 1997; Smith and Clugston
1997; Caron et al. 2002). Young remain in the river/estuary until approximately age 2 and at
lengths of30-36 inches before emigrating to open ocean as subadults (Holland and Yelverton
1973; Dovel and Berggren 1983; Dadswell2006; ASSRT 2007). After emigration from the natal
river/estuary, subadults and adult Atlantic sturgeon travel within the marine environment,
typically in waters between 16 to 164 feet in depth, using coastal bays, sounds, and ocean waters
(Vladykov and Greeley 1963; Murawski and Pacheco 1977; Dovel and Berggren 1983; Smith
1985; Collins and Smith 1997; Welsh et al. 2002; Savoy and Pacileo 2003; Stein et al. 2004;
Laney et al. 2007; Dunton et al. 2010; Erickson et al. 2011). Atlantic sturgeon are occasional
visitors to the project area (Dillingham et al. 1993), most likely while making coastal migrations
or while foraging for benthic invertebrates, shellfish, or small fish.
·
Based on the above information, adult and subadult Atlantic sturgeon from any of five DPSs
could occur in the action area; however, as Atlantic sturgeon spawn in freshwater portions of
large rivers and early life stages are not tolerant of salinity, no eggs, larvae or juvenile Atlantic
sturgeon will occur in the action area.
Effects of the Action
Dredging
Capture ofESA -listed species in dredge
A mechanical dredge outfitted with a clamshell bucket will be used for this project. Sea turtles
are not known to be vulnerable to capture in mechanical dredges, presumably because they are
able to avoid the relatively slow moving dredge bucket. As noted above, sea turtles are unlikely
to occur in the area where dredging will occur. However, even if a transient sea turtle were
present, no sea turtles are likely to be injured or killed as a result of dredging operations.
In order to become captured in the dredge bucket, an Atlantic sturgeon would have to be on the
bottom. Sturgeon do occur on the bottom while foraging; however, because the dredge moves
slowly and the area affected by the dredging is very small, it is likely that subadult or adult
Atlantic sturgeon would easily be able to avoid the dredge. This assumption is supported by
recent monitoring work, completed in the James River (Virginia) and the Delaware River (New
Jersey). During these two studies, the movements of tagged Atlantic and/or shortnose sturgeon
were tracked near a dredge; no interactions between sturgeon and the dredge occurred. Some
tagged sturgeon moved through the area where the dredge was operating multiple times during
the study. The risk is further increased at overwintering areas because evidence suggests that
sturgeon may be less responsive to stimuli while overwintering, which may make it less likely
that sturgeon would avoid a dredge during this time period. However, because no overwintering
sturgeon are likely to occur in the action area, these increased risk factors are not present. Based
on our analysis, it is unlikely that any Atlantic sturgeon would be captured in a clamshell bucket
dredge operating at NAVSTA.

3

Effects on Foraging and Migration
The dredge sites within Narragansett Bay may provide suitable forage for Atlantic sturgeon and
sea turtles (e.g., polychaetes, bivalves, gastropods, and eelgrass adjacent to the channel) (ACOE
2014). Given the depths of the project area (less than 16 feet), sea turtles are not likely to be
present in the area; however, opportunistic foraging may occur at these sites and thus, dredging
could cause effects to sturgeon and sea turtles by reducing prey species through the alteration of
existing biotic assemblages and habitat. Any reduction would be temporary (i.e., recolonization
will begin within two months, with complete recolonization in a year; Burlas et al. 2001; GuerraGarcia and Garcia-Gomez 2006) and would not result in the removal of critical amounts of prey
resources to either species. While some nearshore areas may be more desirable to certain turtles
or sturgeon due to prey availability, there is no information to indicate that the nearshore areas
proposed for dredging have more abundant sturgeon and turtle prey or better foraging habitat
than other surrounding areas.
Sturgeon and sea turtles are not likely to be more attracted to the nearshore waters of the action
area than to other foraging sites in the waters of Rhode Island, and should be able to find
sufficient prey in these alternate areas. As the proposed action will not alter the habitat in any
way that prevents sturgeon or sea turtles from using the action area as a migratory pathway to
other areas that may be more suitable for foraging, there would not be any disruption of essential
behaviors such as migrating or foraging. Based on this and the best available information, while
dredging activities may temporarily disrupt normal feeding behaviors for sturgeon and sea turtles
by causing them to move to nearby areas, dredging activities are not likely to remove critical
amounts of prey resources or alter the habitat in any way that prevents sturgeon and sea turtles
from accessing suitable forage. We therefore conclude that any disruption to normal sea turtle or
sturgeon foraging or migration will be insignificant.
Water Quality Effects of Dredging Operations
Dredging operations cause sediment to be suspended in the water column. This results in a
sediment plume in the water, typically radiating from the dredge site and decreasing in
concentration as sediment falls out of the water column as distai).Ce increases from the dredge
site. The nature, degree, and extent of sediment suspension around a dredging operation are
controlled by many factors including: the particle size distribution, solids concentration, and
composition of the dredged material; the dredge type and size, discharge/cutter configuration,
discharge rate; operational procedures used; and the characteristics of the hydraulic regime in the
vicinity of the operation, including water composition, temperature and hydrodynamic forces
(i.e., waves, currents, etc.) causing vertical and horizontal mixing (ACOE 1983). The turbidity
plume associated with a typical mechanical dredging operation extends approximately 304
meters at the surface and 488 meters near the bottom (ACOE 1983). The maximum distance
reported in the literature is 1,500 meters, which occurred in an area with very strong tidal
currents (ACOE 2007). Several studies have monitored sediment plumes associated with
dredging projects along the Atlantic coast. Turbidity levels associated with these sediment
plumes typically range from 26-350mg/L (ACOE 2007, Anchor Environmental2003) with the
highest levels detected adjacent to the dredge bucket and concentrations decreasing with greater
distance from the dredge (ACOE 2007). The proposed dredging will cause a temporary increase

4

in the amount of sedimentation in the action area; however, suspended sediment is expected to
settle out of the water column within a few hours and any increase in turbidity will be short term.
No information is available on the effects ofTSS on juvenile and adult sea turtles. Studies of the
effects of turbid waters on fish suggest that concentrations of suspended solids can reach
thousands of milligrams per liter before an acute toxic reaction is expected (Burton 1993). TSS is
most likely to affect Atlantic sturgeon and sea turtles if a plume causes a barrier to normal
behaviors or if sediment settles on the bottom affecting prey. As Atlantic sturgeon and sea turtles
are highly mobile they are likely to be able to avoid any sediment plume and any effect on sea
turtle and Atlantic sturgeon movements is likely to be insignificant. Additionally, the TSS levels
expected for dredging (20 to 350 mg/L) are below those shown to have an adverse effect on fish
(580.0 mg/L for the most sensitive species, with 1,000.0 mg/L more typical; see summary of
scientific literature in Burton 1993) and benthic communities (390.0 mg/L (EPA 1986));
therefore, effects to benthic resources that sturgeon or sea turtles may eat are extremely unlikely.
While the increase in suspended sediments may cause Atlantic sturgeon and sea turtles to alter
their normal movements, any change in behavior is likely to be insignificant as it will only
involve short term, localized movements to alter course out of the sediment plume and is not
likely to affect the movement or migration ability of Atlantic sturgeon and sea turtles. Based on
this information, the effect of suspended sediment resulting from dredging activities on Atlantic
sturgeon or sea turtles will be insignificant.

Pile Driving
The installation of piles via pile driving can produce underwater sound pressure waves that can
affect aquatic species. The proposed project will involve the installation of concrete piles via an
impact hammer. Based on the available literature (i.e., Illingworth and Rodkin, Inc. and Jones
and Stoke, 2009), the table below (Table 1) describes the estimated average underwater noise
levels produced by the driving of this type of pile. No information is available for 12 inch
concrete piles, so we will use data for 16 inch concrete piles. The estimated underwater noise
levels are taken from a distance of 10 meters from the pile being driven.

As the distance from the source increases, underwater sound levels produced by pile driving are
known to dissipate rapidly (Illingworth and Rodkin Inc. and Jones and Stoke 2009). Using data
from Illingworth and Rodkin, Inc. and Jones and Stoke (2009), underwater noise levels produced
from the driving of concrete piles will attenuate approximately 5 dB every 10 meters.

Sea Turtles
There is little known about the hearing capabilities of sea turtles, and there is little available
information on the effects of noise on sea turtles. Some studies have demonstrated that sea
turtles have fairly limited capacity to detect sound, although all results are based on a limited
number of individuals and must be interpreted cautiously. Most recently, McCauley et al. (2000)
noted that decibel levels of 166 dB re 1j..tPaRMs were required before any behavioral reaction
(e.g., increased swimming speed) was observed, and decibel levels above 175 dB re 1j..tPaRMs
elicited avoidance behavior of sea turtles. The study done by McCauley et al. (2000), as well as
other studies done to date, used impulsive sources of noise (e.g., air gun arrays) to ascertain the
underwater noise levels that produce behavioral modifications in sea turtles. As no other studies
have been done to assess the effects of noise sources on sea turtles, McCauley et al. (2000)
serves as the best available information on the levels of underwater noise that may produce a
startle, avoidance, and/or other behavioral or physiological response in sea turtles. Based on this
information, we believe that any underwater noise level at or above 166 re 1j..tPaRMs has the
potential to adversely affect sea turtles (e.g., injury, temporary threshold shifts).
As described above, sound levels may be as high as 169 dB re lj..tPaRMS within 10 meters of the
concrete pile being driven with an impact hammer and thus, at a distance beyond approximately
20 meters from the concrete piles being driven, noise levels will be below 166 dB re 1j..tPaRMs·
As noted above, the project area is not known to be a high use area for sea turtles and as such, it
is extremely unlikely that sea turtles will occur within 0 to 20 meters of the piles being driven
and therefore, be exposed to under water noise levels at or above 166 dB re 1j..tPaRMS·

Peak sound pressure level is the largest absolute value of the instantaneous sound pressure and is expressed as dB re: 1 11Pa.
Root Mean Square (RMS) pressure is the square root of the time average of the squared pressure and is expressed as dB re: I
~Pa. Current thresholds for determining impacts to sea turtles typically center around RMS.
2

Sound Exposure Level (SEL) is defined as that level which, lasting for one second, has the same acoustic energy as the
transient and is expressed as dB re: l!!Pa2•sec. Accumulative or cumulative SEL (cSEL) is calculated as SELcumulative =
SELsingle strike+ 10 log(# of pile strikes).

Additionally, based on the habitat characteristics of the portion of the action area where piles will
be installed, and when the action will occur (November - May), it is extremely unlikely that sea
turtle species will occur in the action area where pile driving will occur and therefore, it is
extremely unlikely that sea turtles will be exposed to adverse elevated sound levels. Based on
this information, the noise effects of pile driving on sea turtles is discountable.

Atlantic sturgeon
Pile driving affects fish through underwater noise and pressure which can cause effects to
hearing and air containing organs, such as the swim bladder. Effects to fish can range from
temporary avoidance of an area to death due to injury of internal organs. The type and size of
pile, type of installation method (i.e., vibratory vs. hammer), type and size offish (smaller fish
are more often impacted), and distance from the sound source (i.e., sound attenuates over
distance so noise levels are greater closer to the source) all contribute to the likelihood of effects
to an individual fish. The available literature on effects of pile driving on aquatic species is
difficult to summarize due to inconsistent methods of measuring underwater sound, the diversity
of pile driving methods and receiving substrates, and the differing tolerances of aquatic species
to underwater noise. Generally, however, the larger the pile and the closer a fish is to the pile,
the greater the likelihood of effects.
An interagency work group, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and NMFS,
has reviewed the best available scientific information and developed criteria for assessing the
potential of pile driving activities to cause injury to fish (Fisheries Hydroacoustic Working
Group (FHWG) 2008). The workgroup established dual sound criteria for injury, measured 10
meters away from the pile, of 206 dB re 1 J..LPa Peak and 187 dB accumulated sound exposure level
(dBcSEL; re: 1J..LPa2•sec) (183 dB accumulated SEL for fish less than 2 grams). While this work
group is based on the U.S. West Coast, species similar to Atlantic sturgeon were considered in
developing this guidance (green sturgeon). As these species are biologically similar to the
species being considered herein, it is reasonable to use the criteria developed by the FHWG.
Based on the best available information, peak pressure levels and cSEL levels produced by the
driving of concrete piles described in Table 1 will produce underwater noise levels below 206 dB
re 1 J..LPaPeak and 187cSEL (see Table 1) within 10 meters of the pile being driven. In addition,
only transient Atlantic sturgeon are likely to be in the action area and as such, it is extremely
unlikely that sturgeon will be found in the area where piles will be installed and thus, within 0 to
10 meters ofthe piles being driven. As such, the installation of piles is extremely unlikely to
cause injury to Atlantic sturgeon.
In addition, for purposes of assessing behavioral effects of pile driving at several West Coast
projects, NMFS has employed a 150 dB re 1 J..LPa RMS sound pressure level criterion at several
sites, including the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Columbia River Crossings. As
we are not aware of any studies that have considered the behavior of Atlantic sturgeon in
response to pile driving noise, given the available information from studies on other fish species
(i.e., Anderson et al. 2007; Purser and Radford 2011; Wysocki et al. 2007), we consider 150 dB
re 1 J..LPaRMs to be a reasonable estimate of the noise level at which exposure may result in
behavioral modifications. As such, for the purposes of this consultation, we will use 150 dB re 1

7

J..LPa RMS as a conservative indicator of the noise level at which there is the potential for
behavioral effects. That is not to say that exposure to noise levels of 150 dB re 1 J..LPa RMS will
always result in behavioral modifications, but that there is the potential, upon exposure to noise
at this level, to experience some behavioral response (e.g., temporary startle to avoidance of an
ensonified area).
Based on attenuation rates, underwater noise levels are expected to be below 150 dB re 1 J..LPa RMS
at a distance beyond 50 meters from the pile being driven. As noted above, only transient
Atlantic sturgeon are likely to be in the area and as such, it is extremely unlikely that sturgeon
will be found in the portion of the action area where piles are being driven and thus, within 0 to
50 meters of the piles being driven. However, should a sturgeon occur within the area where
piles are being driven, it is reasonable to assume that sturgeon, on hearing the pile driving sound,
would either avoid the source or move around it. If any movements away from the area where
piles are being installed do occur, it is extremely unlikely that these movements will amount to
substantial changes to essential sturgeon behaviors (e.g., reproduction, foraging, resting, and
migration). The extent of underwater noise is not likely to present a barrier to sturgeon
movements and as such, if individuals are present within the vicinity of the action area, they are
likely to veer/swim away from the pile driving sites and continue normal behaviors (e.g.,
feeding, resting, and migrating) in other portions of the action area and/or in other locations in
Narragansett Bay. Based on this and the best available information, we conclude that the noise
effects of pile driving on Atlantic sturgeon is insignificant and discountable.
Water Quality
The installation and removal of piles will disturb bottom sediments. However, little increase in
sedimentation or turbidity is expected to result from these construction activities. If any
sediment plume does occur, it is expected to be small and suspended sediment is expected to
settle out of the water column within a few hours and any increase in turbidity will be short term.
Additionally, sea turtles and sturgeon are expected to be able to temporarily avoid the area and
continue normal behaviors in nearby portions of the bay. Therefore, there would not be any
disruption of essential behaviors such as migrating or foraging. As such, any effects of
installation and removal of piles are expected to be insignificant and discountable.
Shading
The installation of docks may create new areas of shading that did not exist previously. Due to
the small area of river covered by the structures (approximately 0.33 acres), dissolved oxygen
levels in the action area are not expected to be impacted by the minor amounts of increased
shading. Additionally, as the project area is not a known foraging ground, Atlantic sturgeon and
sea turtles may use the area to forage opportunistically, but are not likely to rely on it as a major
source of forage. Therefore, alteration of habitat (e.g., shading, pile installation) due to this
project is not expected to remove critical amounts of prey resources from the action area for sea
turtles and sturgeon. Also, new docks will not cause any obstruction to migrating sea turtle and
sturgeon and thus, will not alter the habitat in any way that prevents sea turtles and sturgeon from
using the action area as a migratory pathway to other areas of the Narragansett Bay that may be
more suitable for foraging. Based on this information, the effects on sea turtles and Atlantic

8

sturgeon migration and foraging from this project are expected to be insignificant and
discountable.
Conclusions
Based on the analysis that any effects to listed species of sea turtles or Atlantic sturgeon will be
insignificant or discountable, we are able to concur with your determination that the proposed
projects are not likely to adversely affect any listed species under NMFS jurisdiction. Therefore,
no further consultation pursuant to section 7 of the ESA is required.
Reinitiation of consultation is required and shall be requested by the Federal agency or by the
Service, where discretionary Federal involvement or control over the action has been retained or
is authorized by law and: (a) If new information reveals effects of the actions that may affect
listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not previously considered in the
consultation; (b) If the identified actions re subsequently modified in a manner that causes an
effect to the listed species or critical habitat that was not considered in the consultation; or (c) If
a new species is listed or critical habitat designated that may be affected by the identified actions.
No take is anticipated or exempted. If there is any incidental take of a listed species, reinitiation
would be required. Should you have any questions about this correspondence please contact Dan
Marrone at 978-282-8465 or by email (Daniel.Marrone@noaa.gov).
Essential Fish Habitat Comments
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) requires Federal
agencies to consult with the us regarding any action or proposed action authorized. funded, or
undertaken by the agency that may adversely affect Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) identified
under the MSA. The EFH regulations, 50 CFR Section 600.920, outline this consultation
procedure. Unfortunately, our ability to assess potential impacts to EFH and associated marine
resources is being complicated by deficiencies in the EFH Assessment. Though the document
provided on March 31, 2014 provides a general overview of species with EFH designations in
the project area and potential impacts of the project, specific information on construction and
project engineering plans would be necessary to complete an EFH consultation. Specifically, we
request the following infonnation which will allow us to provide the most appropriate EFH
conservation recommendations:
1. Specific project design and/or engineering plans which indicate the exact location of the
proposed piers and in-water work relative to ML Wand benthic habitat are necessary to
detem1ine impacts to EFH.
2. The document indicates dredging will occur during construction of the project. Specific
information on the location of the dredging activity, amount of material to be dredged,
plans for disposal of the material, and timing of dredging activity will be necessary to
provide appropriate EFH conservation recommendations.
3. The information provided indicates impacts may occur due to pile driving activity and
that potential mitigation measures will be used to minimize impacts. The specific plans
for minimizing noise levels from pile driving should be provided.

9

4. The document indicates eelgrass is present in the project boundary, but states that it is not
located near the project. It is not clear that the most updated eelgrass maps were used to
determine the eelgrass location. Eelgrass was most recently mapped in Narragansett Bay
in 2012 (Bradley et al. 2013). These maps should be used to determine the proximity of
eelgrass to the project site and determine if a more detailed in-water survey might be
necessary. The location of the eelgrass beds and distance from the proposed project
should be provided to determine if additional conservation recommendations may be
necessary to avoid impacts to eelgrass beds.
Absent the information listed above, we cannot concur that the project will have minimal
impacts to EFH. Though the information provided in this document will be useful for our
evaluation of potential impacts to EFH, these project-specific details are necessary to complete
an EFH consultation. In your letter dated March 27, 2014, you indicate that additional project
specific details will be available at the time of a request for authorization from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) under Section 404 ofthe Clean Water Act and Section 10 ofthe
Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, as well as other state and local regulations requirements. Once
this information is made available, we can complete our EFH consultation on this project
through the USACE permit process at that time. For any questions regarding EFH or Fish and
Wildlife Coordination Act consultations, please contact Sue Tuxbury at 978-281-9176 or
susan.tuxbury@noaa.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The BRAC
Commission was established by Public
Law 101–510, the BRAC Law, to
recommend military installations for
realignment and closure.
Recommendations of the 2005 BRAC
Commission were included in a report
presented to the President on September
8, 2005. The President approved and
forwarded this report to Congress on
September 16, 2005, which became
effective as public law on November 9,
2005, and must be implemented in
accordance with the requirements of the
BRAC Law.
As a result of implementation of
BRAC Law, on January 5, 2009, certain
land and facilities at NAVSTA Newport
were declared excess to the needs of the
DoN and made available to other
Department of Defense components and
other Federal agencies. The DoN
evaluated all Federal requests and made
a decision on property required by the
Federal Government. The DoN declared
approximately 225 acres of property at
NAVSTA Newport as surplus to the
needs of the Federal Government on
February 9, 2010.
The proposed action for this EIS is the
disposal and reuse of surplus property
at NAVSTA Newport. Upon completion
of the disposal, the surplus property
will be redeveloped in a manner

VerDate Mar<15>2010

17:08 Oct 30, 2012

Jkt 229001

consistent with the Aquidneck Island
Reuse Planning Authority’s (AIRPA)
Redevelopment Plan. The EIS will
consider the alternatives that are
reasonable to accomplish the proposed
action. Alternatives to be considered
include: (1) Disposal of the surplus
property by the DoN and reuse in
accordance with the AIRPA
Redevelopment Plan; (2) Disposal of the
surplus property by the DoN with a
high-density reuse scenario; and (3) No
Action, in which the DoN would retain
ownership in caretaker status and no
reuse or redevelopment of the surplus
property would occur.
Alternative 1 would allow for the
disposal and reuse of surplus property
at NAVSTA Newport. Reuse would be
conducted in accordance with the
AIRPA Redevelopment Plan. The Plan
provides a mix of land uses based on
existing conditions on the surplus
property and in the community, guiding
principles for development established
by AIRPA, and public participation. It is
anticipated that full build-out of the
Plan would be implemented over a 20year period. The Redevelopment Plan
calls for the development of the
following at each surplus parcel:
• Naval Hospital—This waterfront
parcel consists of 7 acres of land and
facilities plus 3 acres of submerged
land. Existing structures would be
demolished prior to redevelopment of
the site. Approximately 3.8 acres (54%)
of the 7 acres of land-based property
would be redeveloped, with a mix of
hotel and residential uses in addition to
a waterfront park with pedestrian paths
and a pier. The remaining 3.2 acres of
upland (46%) and 3 acres of submerged
land would be maintained as open
space and natural areas associated with
the waterfront park.
• Navy Lodge—This parcel consists
of 3 acres of land with no facilities on
the parcel. Approximately 1.8 acres
(60%) would be redeveloped with two,
one-story retail buildings and associated
parking. Approximately 1.2 acres (40%)
would be maintained as open space.
• Tank Farms 1 and 2—This parcel
consists of 145 acres of land and
facilities. Existing structures would be
demolished prior to redevelopment of
the site. Approximately 31.1 acres
(21%) of the overall combined property
would be redeveloped with a mix of
uses including office space, light
industrial, boat storage, multi-modal
parking, and a solar array. About 113.9
acres (79%) would remain as passive
land use or open space.
• Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor—This parcel consists of 67
acres of land, including 4.6 miles of
two-lane roads and 15 acres of adjacent

PO 00000

Frm 00018

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

open land. The Redevelopment Plan
calls for retaining use of the two-lane
roads, with the addition of an adjacent
multi-use pedestrian pathway in a
greenbelt. The remaining land would be
used for recreation/open space areas
including a shoreline park.
Alternative 2 would also allow for
disposal and reuse of the surplus
property at NAVSTA Newport. This
alternative features a higher density of
uses at each parcel and similar to
Alternative 1, it is anticipated that full
build-out of the high-density scenario
would be implemented over a 20-year
period. Under Alternative 2,
redevelopment at each surplus parcel
would include the following:
• Naval Hospital—The residential use
proposed under Alternative 1 would be
replaced with commercial uses and a
conference center would be added to the
proposed hotel. The remainder of the
site would be developed as described
under Alternative 1. This higher density
alternative would result in development
of approximately 4.1 acres (58%) of the
7-acre land-based portion of the site.
• Navy Lodge—The higher density
alternative calls for the development of
two, two-story retail buildings and an
increase in parking compared with
Alternative 1. Alternative 2 would result
in development of approximately 2.1
acres (70%) of the overall site.
• Tank Farms 1 and 2—
Redevelopment would occur with the
same mix of uses as under Alternative
1 however, the amount of office space
and light industrial would be increased
resulting in development of 34.1 acres
(24%) of the overall site.
• Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor—The higher density
alternative calls for greater expansion of
the proposed shoreline park.
Alternative 3 is required by NEPA and
is the No Action Alternative. Under this
alternative, the property would be
retained by the U.S. government in
caretaker status. No reuse or
redevelopment would occur at the
surplus property.
The EIS will address potential direct,
indirect, short-term, long-term, and
cumulative impacts on the human and
natural environments, including
potential impacts on topography,
geology and soils, water resources,
biological resources, air quality, noise,
infrastructure and utilities, traffic,
cultural resources, land use,
socioeconomics, environmental justice,
and waste management. Known areas of
concern associated with the BRAC
action include impacts on cultural
resources, impacts on local traffic
patterns resulting from reuse scenarios,

Notice of Intent (NOI) to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
for the Disposal and Reuse of Surplus Property at Naval Station
Newport, Rhode Island and to Announce Public Scoping Meetings
Pursuant to Section 102(2) (c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as implemented by the
Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500-1508), the U.S.
Department of the Navy (U.S. Navy) announced on October 31, 2012 (Federal Register [FR] Vol. 77, No. 211) its
intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential human and natural
environmental consequences of the disposal and reuse of surplus property at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport,
Rhode Island. The surplus property includes: the former Naval Hospital, former Navy Lodge, Tank Farms 1 and 2,
and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor.
The proposed action is the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport, per Public Law 101-510, the
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005, by the U.S. Navy and its reuse by the
Aquidneck Island Reuse Implementation Authority (AIRIA) in a manner consistent with the Final Redevelopment
Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport (Redevelopment Plan). The Redevelopment Plan has site-specific
redevelopment plans for the former Naval Hospital, former Navy Lodge, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Defense
Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. This surplus property would be dedicated to a variety of active and passive
land uses, including, office, industrial, commercial, and residential spaces as well as recreation, open space, and
natural areas.
The EIS will address potential direct and indirect, short-term, long-term, and cumulative impacts on the human
and natural environments, including resource areas such as geology and soils, water resources, biological
resources, air quality, noise, infrastructure and utilities, traffic, cultural resources, land use, socioeconomics,
environmental justice, and waste management.
The U.S. Navy is initiating a scoping process to provide the community an opportunity to comment on the issues
that need to be addressed in the EIS.
The NEPA scoping process will include two scheduled public scoping open house meetings in Middletown and
Newport, Rhode Island. The public scoping open house meetings are scheduled as follows:

Dear Mr. Fugate:
The Base Realignme nt and Closure (BRAC) Program Office East is
preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) fo r disposal and reuse of
surplus property at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode Island. We are
requesting your review of the enclosed Coastal Consistency Determination
(enclosure · (l)) and response with your _confirmation of potential reuse
impacts.
The EIS analyzes potential environmental impacts resulting from
disposal a nd reuse of the sur plus property in accordance with the Defense
Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005 (BRAC Law). The ·
EIS addresses two alternatives for disposal and reuse of the surplus
property at NAVSTA Newport. Alternative 1 is the Navy's preferred
alternative and consists of the reuse of the surplus property in accordance
with the 2011 Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport
(Redevelopment Plan) developed and adopted by the Aquidneck Island
Redevelopment Planning Authority. Alternative 2 has a higher density with a
larger footprint and different mix of land uses relative to Alternative 1.
Both alternatives include disposal of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport
and redevelopment with a mix of land uses, including commercial, industrial,
and active and passive recreation space.
The Navy is requesting the CRMC to
consider this project review on Alternative l, only, as it is the preferred
alternative.
If you have any questions regarding this correspondence and request or
require additional project information, please do not hesitate to call
Cornelia Mueller at (401) 841 - 7561.
I appreciate y our assistance and thank
you for your attention to this request.

FEDERAL COASTAL ZONE CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION

FOR DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF
SURPLUS PROPERTY AT NAVAL STATION NEWPORT,
RHODE ISLAND
1.0

INTRODUCTION

This Coastal Consistency Determination (CCD) is provided to the State of Rhode Island Coastal
Resources Management Council (CRMC) in accordance with Section 307 of the Coastal Zone
Management Act (CZMA) 16 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 1451 et seq. and implementing regulations
contained in 15 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 930, Subpart C.
The U.S. Department of the Navy (Navy) has reviewed Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management
Program (CRMP) and associated federal enforceable policies and has determined that the Navy's
Proposed Action is reasonably likely to affect uses or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone,
but would be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the state’s CRMP to the maximum extent
practicable.
This CCD provides a description of the Navy’s Proposed Action, and an analysis of its consistency with
the enforceable policies of the Rhode Island CRMP.

2.0

PROPOSED FEDERAL AGENCY ACTION

The proposed federal agency action (Proposed Action) is the disposal of surplus property at Naval Station
(NAVSTA) Newport by the Navy and subsequent redevelopment of the surplus property by the
Aquidneck Island Reuse Implementation Authority (AIRIA).
NAVSTA Newport is located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island in Newport County, Rhode
Island. The surplus property of NAVSTA Newport is located in three separate municipalities on
Aquidneck Island: the City of Newport, the Town of Portsmouth, and the Town of Middletown (see
Figure 1). The collective surplus property comprises four non-contiguous Navy properties:





Former Navy Lodge –Town of Middletown, Rhode Island;
Former Naval Hospital –City of Newport, Rhode Island;
Tank Farms 1 and 2 –Town of Portsmouth, Rhode Island; and
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor - Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth.

Alternative 1, the preferred alternative and the only alternative addressed in this CCD, includes the
disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the Navy and reuse in accordance with the
Aquidneck Island Reuse Planning Authority’s (AIRPA’s) Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at
NAVSTA Newport, i.e., the Redevelopment Plan (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). This alternative has
been identified as the preferred alternative by the Navy and is based on the preferred reuse plan in the
Redevelopment Plan.

Full build-out is proposed to be implemented over a 20-year period, but may differ for each of the
properties. The Redevelopment Plan includes a mix of land use types and densities for each surplus
property as well as open space and natural areas. Details of the proposed redevelopment at each surplus
property are summarized below.
Former Navy Lodge. The 3-acre former Navy Lodge property is proposed for redevelopment as retail
space (see Figure 2). The site is currently vacant, except for a small telephone utility shed and a water
feed vent and concrete pad, so no demolition is proposed. Two one-story buildings on a total of
approximately 0.7 acres are proposed. Retail use would total approximately 30,500 square feet. These
structures are proposed on the northeast and southeast corners of the site, with approximately 0.8 acres (or
approximately 145 spaces) of parking adjacent to the buildings. A total of 1.8 acres (60%) of the 3-acre
site would be redeveloped; approximately 1.2 acres would be maintained as open space.
Former Naval Hospital. Proposed redevelopment at the approximately 15.2-acre former Naval Hospital
property includes a three-story hotel (120 rooms) with additional space on the first floor for retail and a
restaurant comprising approximately 1.3 acres and parking at the northeast corner of the site; a three-story
36-unit residential building with a ground level footprint of approximately 0.60 acres over at-grade
parking in the southeast corner of the site; and a waterfront park of approximately 2.4 acres that would
include a pier, pedestrian path, water taxi dockage, and a boat storage facility (see Figure 3). The
residential building would contain 36 two-bedroom units. Parking and access throughout the site would
total 2.2 acres of developed land under Alternative 1, including the existing road (Riggs Road) that bisects
the site. A total of approximately 54% of the overall site (inclusive of land-based and pier development)
would be developed under Alternative 1.
The waterfront park would include a boat storage facility of approximately 1,300 square feet. The existing
pier would be re-used as-is, with the addition of two concrete floating docks on each side. Each floating
dock would be 8 feet by 90 feet. These floating docks would be supported by pontoons and anchored in
place with pilings and cables. It is assumed that the pilings would be square, pre-stressed concrete piles
measuring 1 foot by 1 foot, which would be constructed off-site. Pile installation would be completed
with an impact hammer on a barge and a crane.
Under Alternative 1, all six existing buildings, Building 1, Building 7, Building 45, Building 63, Building
993, and Quarters A and B, would be demolished. The existing pier, Pier 71, would remain as-is, as
described above.
Tank Farms 1 and 2. Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped as an approximately 136-acre site with
office space, light industrial, boat storage, and multi-modal parking and the potential for a solar array (see
Figure 4). The plan for the tank farms includes a multi-modal parking facility with 400 parking spaces (a
total of 4 acres) on the west side of the site, adjacent to the railroad; 45,000 square feet (1 acre) light
industrial or boat storage also along the railroad; 145,000 square feet of light industrial with 55,000
square feet (1.3 acres) along the rail line and 90,000 square feet (2.1 acres) off of Bradford Avenue;
110,000 square feet (2.5 acres) of office space at the south end of the site (south end of Tank Farm 2).
The solar array would comprise approximately 155,000 square feet (3.6 acres) and would be located near
the center of Tank Farm 2. Parking and access roads would comprise approximately 20.6 acres of newly
redeveloped area. A total of 31.1 acres or 21% of the 136-acre site would be redeveloped; 104.9 acres
(77%) would remain as open space. Access to the redeveloped site would be made from new access
points along Stringham Road and Bradford Avenue.

Under Alternative 1, Tanks 9 and 10 and Buildings 30, 49, and 860 would be demolished at Tank Farm 1.
The fate of the USTs and underground piping at Tank Farm 1 (e.g., removal or leaving in place) has not
yet been determined. Therefore, for the purposes of analysis in this EIS, they have been assumed to
remain in place. This has also been assumed for the tanks and structures at Tank Farm 2.
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. The Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor would
be retained as two-lane roadways, with the addition of a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt on the opposite
side of the railroad tracks, next to the water (see Figure 5). The pathway would be 12 feet wide and
would be surfaced with bituminous concrete. In constrained areas (due to topography or other factors), the
width may be reduced to 10 feet. In addition to the roadways, recreation/open space use is proposed at the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. A shoreline park would be included with a fishing pier, kayak launch,
restrooms, playgrounds, a 0.3-acre parking lot, picnic areas, and pathways. The restrooms, playground
and picnic area would comprise 0.09 acres. The existing pier would be rebuilt to be a 15-foot wide and
250-foot long concrete pier. Access to the proposed park would be provided directly from Defense
Highway.
In-water activities would include removal of the existing pier, which is assumed to include dredging with
a clamshell bucket or similar equipment and excavation of the existing pier. If there are piles associated
with the existing pier, they would be removed via either a direct-pull or vibratory extraction method.
Additionally, pile driving to construct the new pier and construction vessels as described would also be
necessary.
With the exception of the demolition/removal of the existing pier, no further demolition activities would
occur at this property under Alternative 1. No demolition or reuse of Building A105 or the telephone
utility shed are proposed.
The Navy is currently preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) consistent with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for the disposal and reuse of the surplus properties. Additional
detailed information about the Proposed Action and anticipated environmental consequences can be found
in the EIS. Environmental restoration activities under the Navy’s Defense Environmental Restoration
Program are ongoing at Tank Farms 1 and 2. Upon completion of the Final EIS, the Navy will issue a
Record of Decisions documenting its final disposal decisions and disposal and redevelopment will enter
the implementation phase. This phase includes the completion of any remaining environmental
restoration activities for which the Navy is responsible, the Navy’s determination that the property is
suitable for transfer from an environmental standpoint, and the conveyance of surplus installation
property (i.e., real property disposal). Any future development of property would be consistent with the
Redevelopment Plan and would fall under the jurisdiction of the state and local governments. The use of
land, the reuse of existing buildings and facilities, and the development of new buildings on the surplus
NAVSTA Newport property would be subject to applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations,
including local zoning ordinances and other planning documents.
It is anticipated that the Proposed Action would be implemented in phases over a 20-year period;
therefore, it is unknown at this time exactly how the specific redevelopment of the individual sites and
parcels would evolve. However, based on the known elements of the Redevelopment Plan, it is
anticipated that it would be implemented in full compliance with all applicable coastal management
policies. It would be the responsibility of future developers/property owners, as projects are further
defined and identified for construction, to conduct any additional required analyses, prepare appropriate
environmental documentation, and obtain any necessary permits and approvals prior to implementation of
individual projects at the various surplus properties.

BACKGROUND

3.1

Coastal Zone Management Act

The CZMA of 1972 (16 U.S.C., Section 1451, et seq., as amended) provides a framework for states, in
cooperation with federal and local agencies, to develop land and water use programs for coastal zones.
Section 307 of the CZMA stipulates that when a federal will affect any coastal use or resource (land or
water use, or natural resource), that activity must be carried out in a manner consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the affected state's federally approved coastal zone
management plan. Although by definition Federal land is excluded from the coastal zone, Federal
activities on or off Federal property that would have effects on non-Federal lands within a state’s coastal
zone fall within the scope of the CZMA consistency requirement. Federal agencies must also give
consideration to state management program provisions that are in the nature of recommendations.

3.2

Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program

The State of Rhode Island has developed and implemented a federally approved CRMP describing current
coastal legislation and enforceable policies. This program was approved by the federal Office of Ocean
and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) in 1978. The policies of the Rhode Island CRMP
emphasize “preservation and restoration of ecological systems” within the state’s coastal zone to provide
for the state’s social and economic welfare (Coastal Resources Management Council 2010; November
2012). The Rhode Island CRMP is managed by the Rhode Island CRMC, a state agency administrated by
a council composed of appointed state and local government and public representatives. The CRMC
creates policies and plans and adopts regulations to implement the Rhode Island CRMP.
Direct federal actions in Rhode Island are subject to federal consistency requirements if those actions are
reasonably likely to affect any land or water use or natural resource of any of the state's 21 coastal
communities with tidal waters to the outer limit of the State's territorial jurisdiction, which is 3 nautical
miles (nm) into the Atlantic Ocean. Federal agencies undertaking such actions must show that the
proposed action would be “conducted in a manner that is consistent with the enforceable policies of the
[Rhode Island CRMP],” as well as any applicable special area management plans (SAMPs) (Coastal
Resources Management Council n.d.). In this case, the Aquidneck Island SAMP is applicable to the
Proposed Action area.

3.3

Aquidneck Island Special Area Management Plan

The Aquidneck Island SAMP was developed by the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) for
the West Side of Aquidneck Island and the adjacent waters of the Narragansett Bay to protect the
ecological, economic, recreational, historic, cultural and aesthetic values of Aquidneck Island (CRMC
2009). The primary purpose of the Aquidneck Island SAMP and the coastal development regulations
contained therein is to act as a coastal management tool to ensure consistency between local, state, and
federal policies and regulations.

4.0

FEDERAL REVIEW

The Navy does not propose to conduct, nor will it be a permitting or approval authority for, any activities
associated with the Redevelopment Plan, and thus the Proposed Action of property disposal will not
produce any direct effects on any of Rhode Island's coastal zone uses or resources included in Rhode
Island's CZMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP, or their associated enforceable policies. The Navy has
nevertheless evaluated the indirect effects that are reasonably foreseeable from the subsequent
redevelopment of the surplus properties in accordance with the Redevelopment Plan. The Navy’s
evaluation is based on the information presently available as produced and provided by the local

redevelopment authorities. Reasonable assumptions were made based on existing information to the
extent necessary to conduct the evaluation.
Future redevelopment and reuse of the Naval properties will also be required to be conducted in a manner
consistent with the enforceable policies of the Rhode Island CRMP and applicable policies of the
Aquidneck Island SAMP (Coastal Resources Management Council 2009). Redevelopment will be a nonfederal action on non-Federal property and would therefore fall under the CRMC’s direct state permitting
authority to the extent the future projects are located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within
the 200-foot contiguous area. CRMC would thus exercise permitting authority over the redevelopment
activities associated with the former Naval Hospital and Defense Highway/Stringham Road properties,
but would not exercise authority over the former Navy Lodge or the Tank Farms 1 and 2 properties since
they are located away from the shoreline outside the 200-foot contiguous area. However, future activities
at all four surplus properties would be subject to the applicable policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP
since the SAMP jurisdiction extends beyond the 200-foot contiguous area. The detailed analysis of the
consistency of the Proposed Action with the applicable sections of the Rhode Island CRMP and the
SAMP is provided in Enclosure 1 to this letter.

5.0

CONCLUSION

On the basis of the evaluation presented in Enclosure 1, the Navy has determined that the Proposed
Action, the disposal and reuse of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport, is reasonably likely to affect
uses or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone, but the reuse would be conducted in a manner
that is consistent with the Rhode Island CRMP and Aquidneck Island SAMP to the maximum extent
practicable. The Navy’s evaluation and conclusion is based upon the elements of the current
Redevelopment Plan, which is expected to be implemented in phases over a 20-year period. Future
redevelopment activities by non-Federal entities would be directly subject to the enforceable policies of
the Rhode Island CRMP and applicable policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP (Coastal Resources
Management Council 2009). It would be the responsibility of the future developers/property owners to
conduct any additional required analyses, prepare appropriate environmental documentation, and obtain
any necessary permits and approvals on the basis of defined project proposals.

ENCLOSURE 1
1.0

Applicable Enforceable Policies of the Coastal Resources Management Program
and the Aquidneck Island Special Area Management Plan

The following presents a summary of the applicable sections of Rhode Island’s CRMP and the Aquidneck
Island SAMP, as applied to the key elements of the Proposed Action.

1.1

Rhode Island CRMP

Two of the surplus properties are located within the jurisdiction of CRMC's regulatory authority: the
former Naval Hospital and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. The former Naval Hospital
property and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor are located in Rhode Island’s coastal zone,
in the 200-foot contiguous area of Narragansett Bay. These properties are discussed separately below.
(Note: The former Navy Lodge property and Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not located in any tidal waters, on a
shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, therefore, state review of coastal resources is not
applicable. Therefore, these properties are not discussed further with respect to the Rhode Island CRMP;
however, they are discussed below for applicability to the Aquidneck Island SAMP – see Section 4.1.2.).
1.1.1

Former Naval Hospital Property

Section 200.4 Type 4 Waters
The former Naval Hospital property is located adjacent to Narragansett Bay, which is categorized as a
Type 4 Water: Multipurpose Waters.
The applicable enforceable policies of Section 200.4(C) comprise the following:
1. The [CRMC’s] goal is to maintain a balance among the diverse activities that must
coexist in Type 4 waters. The changing characteristics of traditional activities and the
development of new water-dependent uses shall, where possible, be accommodated in
keeping with the principle that the [CRMC] shall work to preserve and restore ecological
systems.
2. The [CRMC] recognizes that large portions of Type 4 waters include important fishing
grounds and fishery habitats, and shall protect such areas from alterations and activities
that threaten the vitality of Rhode Island fisheries.
Federal Consistency
Redevelopment activities at the former Naval Hospital property are comprised, in part, of the
development of a waterfront park. A park adjacent to (and with access to) the waterfront would allow for
the public’s use and enjoyment of diverse activities associated with the contiguous shoreline including
boating, fishing, kayaking, and beachcombing. For example, the former Navy Hospital property would
include the re-use of the existing Pier 71 with the addition of two concrete floating docks on each side.
The Navy informally consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NFMS) regarding designated
essential fish habitat (EFH) in Narragansett Bay and has evaluated the effects of the Proposed Action on
the 17 species of EFH designated for the bay. As a result of the evaluation, the Navy has determined
environmental impacts from the proposed reconstruction of the piers will not adversely affect designated
EFH within the Narragansett Bay. All impacts are expected to be minor and short-term in nature. This

evaluation has been completed in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act.
Thus, the redevelopment activities proposed for the former Naval Hospital property would be consistent
to the maximum extent practicable with the abovementioned policies of CRMP Section 200.4(C).
Section 210.1 Coastal Beach
A small portion of the former Naval Hospital property, approximately 0.08 acres, is sandy beach. The
applicable enforceable policies of Section 210.1 comprise the following:
Policy 3 - Alterations to beaches adjacent to Type 3, 4, 5, and 6 waters may be permitted if: (a) the
alteration is undertaken to accommodate a designated priority use for the abutting water area; (b) the
applicant has examined all reasonable alternatives and the Council has determined that the selected
alternative is the most reasonable; (c) only the minimum alteration necessary to support the designated
priority use is made; (d) there is no change in the usage of the property; (e) there is no change in the
footprint of existing structures; and (f) the construction will meet all current and applicable policies,
standards, and requirements of the RI CRMP.
Federal Consistency
Under the Proposed Action, there would be no permanent impact on existing beach habitat at the former
Naval Hospital property. Temporary disturbance of beach habitat could occur during construction of the
floating docks, but any areas disturbed by equipment staging or other activities will be restored following
completion of construction. Additionally, there would be no change in use of the waterfront portion of the
property; it is currently a mixture of beach, open space and the pier. The future use would be as a
waterfront park with the same elements. Prior to initiation of any redevelopment activities, the
developer(s)/property owner would coordinate with CRMC as part of the state permitting process, to
obtain the appropriate approvals and authorizations; this review process will ensure that construction will
meet all current and applicable policies. Thus, the Proposed Action would be consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with CRMP Section 210.1.
Section 210.3 Coastal Wetlands
The former Naval Hospital property hosts approximately 0.3 acres of marine/estuarine wetland. The
applicable enforceable policies of Section 210.3 comprise the following:
Policy 4 - Coastal wetlands designated for preservation adjacent to Type 3, 4, 5, and 6 waters are
identified on maps available for inspection at the Council's offices and at the town halls of coastal cities
and towns. Dredging and filling in these designated coastal wetlands are prohibited. The maps of
designated coastal wetlands identify individual wetlands; in all cases precise boundaries shall be
determined through a field inspection when proposals that could impact these features are being
considered. In support of this goal, the Council supports a policy of "no net loss" of coastal wetland
acreage and functions as a result of coastal development.
Policy 7 - All alterations to coastal wetlands shall be carried out in accordance with Section 300.12,
Coastal Wetland Mitigation.
Federal Consistency
The former Naval Hospital property includes approximately 0.3 acres of marine/estuarine wetland.
However, this area, while adjacent to Type 4 waters, has not been designated for preservation in the
CRMP, suggesting Policy 4 above does not currently apply to the Proposed Action at the Naval Hospital.
The only redevelopment feature proposed to be located within this wetland under Alternative 1 is a
portion of one of the floating docks, resulting in approximately 0.04 acre of impact. Conservatively

estimating, this floating dock could result in a corresponding 0.04 acre of fill in the form of the pilings to
be used to anchor the floating dock in place; however, final design would determine the actual location of
the piling(s).
Filling of a coastal wetland requires a permit from the CRMC and a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As part of the permitting process, the
developer will be required to coordinate wetland mitigation plans with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) and CRMC. For the CRMC, filling in a coastal wetland located in a Type 4 water is considered
an alteration of a coastal wetland under Section 300.12 of the CRMC regulations, and requires a Category
A assent. Section 300.12(F), Coastal Wetland Mitigation, outlines the mitigation requirements for
alterations to coastal wetlands. As indicated in the regulations, the following requirements apply:
 Replacement by a similar type of wetland, which provides an ecological value equal to or
greater than that of the altered wetland.
 A 2:1 mitigation ratio for the area of costal wetland restored to the area permanently altered or
lost.
Section 404 of the CWA authorizes the USACE to issue permits regulating the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the U.S., including wetlands. The USACE and the EPA issued regulations
governing compensatory mitigation for authorized impacts on wetlands; these are codified in the 40 CFR
230 as the Final Rule for Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources. Compensation
requirements typically vary based on the impacted wetland communities. Specific mitigation
requirements for future development projects would be determined in coordination with the USACE and
CRMC.
The loss of wetlands would be mitigated through the state and federal permitting processes. Therefore,
the Proposed Action is consistent with Policy 7 to the maximum extent practicable.
Section 300 Activities in Tidal and Coastal Pond Wetlands, on Shoreline Features, and Their
Contiguous Areas
Under the Rhode Island CRMP, any alteration or activity proposed within tidal waters, shoreline features,
and contiguous areas is regulated and an assent is required from the Council. The requirements for a
Category B Assent from CRMC are provided in Section 300.1 of the Rhode Island CRMP and include
demonstrating the need for the proposed activity, demonstrating that the activity would not result in
significant impacts on erosion and/or deposition processes along the shore and in tidal waters, and
demonstrating that there would be no significant deterioration in water quality, as well as other
requirements.
Federal Consistency
Section 300 provides an overarching framework for the analysis of impacts and the approval of activities
within the shoreline area. Consistency with the various policies listed in this section would be addressed
through the state permitting process initiated by the developer. Through the permitting process, all
applicable local zoning ordinances, flood hazard standards, and environmental requirements will be
addressed. Therefore, the Proposed Action is consistent with these policies to the maximum extent
practicable.
1.1.2

Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor Property

Section 200.4 Type 4 Waters
The Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property is located adjacent to Narragansett Bay, which
is categorized as a Type 4 Water: Multipurpose Waters.

The applicable enforceable policies of Section 200.4(C) are the same as those discussed above in Section
1.1.1.
Federal Consistency
Redevelopment activities at the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property are comprised, in
part, of the development of a shoreline park. A park adjacent to (and with access to) the waterfront would
allow for the public’s use and enjoyment of diverse activities associated with the contiguous shoreline
including fishing, kayaking, and beachcombing. Demolition and rebuilding of the former Midway Pier
would result in its use as a recreational fishing pier and would enhance public use and access to the
waterfront.
As indicated above under Section 1.1.1, the Navy informally consulted with NFMS regarding designated
EFH in Narragansett Bay and has evaluated the effects of the Proposed Action on the 17 species of EFH
designated for the bay. As a result of the evaluation, the Navy has determined environmental impacts
from the proposed reconstruction of the piers will not adversely affect designated EFH within the
Narragansett Bay. All impacts are expected to be minor and short-term in nature. This evaluation has been
completed in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
Thus, the redevelopment activities proposed for the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property
would be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the abovementioned policies of CRMP
Section 200.4(C).
Section 210.1 Coastal Beach
Approximately 9.7 acres of sandy habitat exists along the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor
property. The applicable enforceable policies of Section 210.1 are the same as those provided above
Section 1.1.1.
Federal Consistency
The proposed multi-use pathway along the waterfront would impact approximately 1.0 acres of
beach/sand habitat cover at the property. The pathway would be installed using bituminous concrete.
Approximately 0.09 acres of beach habitat would be impacted by the redevelopment of the fishing pier.
Additional temporary disturbance of beach habitat could occur during construction of the waterfront park,
but the habitat would be restored to original conditions following completion of construction. The
alterations to the beach habitat would be done to facilitate access to the Narragansett Bay, a multipurpose
waterway, and its waterfront. As such, the Proposed Action would be consistent with this policy to the
maximum extent practicable.
Section 210.3 Coastal Wetlands
Coastal wetlands exist within the boundaries of the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property.
The applicable enforceable policies of Section 210.3 are the same as those discussed above under Section
1.1.1.
Federal Consistency
There are 1.2 acres of estuarine and marine wetlands within the Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor property boundaries, located along the shoreline. Redevelopment under Alternative 1 would not
impact these wetlands, as redevelopment would take place in areas outside these mapped wetland
boundaries. Therefore, the Proposed Action would be fully consistent with these policies.
Section 300 Activities in Tidal and Coastal Pond Wetlands, on Shoreline Features, and Their
Contiguous Areas

Under the Rhode Island CRMP, any alteration or activity proposed within tidal waters, shoreline features,
and contiguous areas is regulated and an assent is required from the Council. The requirements for a
Category B Assent from CRMC are provided in Section 300.1 of the Rhode Island CRMP and include
demonstrating the need for the proposed activity, demonstrating that the activity would not result in
significant impacts on erosion and/or deposition processes along the shore and in tidal waters, and
demonstrating that there would be no significant deterioration in water quality, as well as other
requirements.
Federal Consistency
Section 300 provides an overarching framework for the analysis of impacts and the approval of activities
within the shoreline area. Consistency with the various policies listed in this section would be addressed
through state permitting process initiated by the developer. Through the permitting process, all applicable
local zoning ordinances, flood hazard standards, and environmental requirements will be addressed.
Therefore, the Proposed Action is consistent with these policies to the maximum extent practicable.
Section 300.9 Dredging and Dredged Materials Disposal
Maintenance dredging within tidal waters of Type 4 Waters will require a Category A Assent. By
definition, “maintenance dredging includes projects whose purpose is to restore channels and basins to
dimensions that support and maintain existing levels of use.”1 The maintenance dredging proposed at the
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property would include use of a clamshell bucket or similar
equipment to remove the existing pier and excavation of the existing pier. It will be the responsibility of
the developer(s)/property owners to identify and provide to the Council, environmentally sound disposal
locations and procedures. In addition, according to CRMP Section 300.9, the following prerequisites are
required:
3. All materials to be dredged for either open water disposal or upland disposal must be classified
by the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) based upon an approved analysis
process prior to the Council acting on an application of either dredging or dredged materials
disposal.
4. Any application for open water disposal of dredged materials shall obtain a suitability
determination from the Army Corps of Engineers.
5. All applicable requirements of the Freshwater Wetlands Act have or will have been met.
6. Upland disposal of dredged materials must comply with all applicable local zoning ordinances.
7. When disposal is proposed for approved upland facilities, the applicant shall provide a letter of
acceptance from that facility, unless the disposal is approved for the central landfill.
8. For dredge volumes greater than 10,000 cubic yards, a pre-application meeting is required.
Federal Consistency
Prior to any dredging operation or disposal, the developer(s)/property owner would coordinate with
CRMC in addition to the Rhode Island DEM and the USACE to obtain the appropriate approvals and
authorizations. Through this coordination process, the dredging activities would be conducted in
accordance with all applicable regulations and the Proposed Action would be consistent with this policy
to the maximum extent practicable.
Section 300.18 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and Aquatic Habitats of Particular Concern
Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) refers to rooted, vascular, flowering plants that live and grow below
the water surface in coastal and estuarine waters in large meadows or small beds. SAV species of concern
to CRMC for regulatory purposes, and the most common found in Narragansett Bay, is eelgrass (Zostera
1

The dredging is assumed to be maintenance dredging, as “improvement dredging” was not deemed applicable to
the Proposed Action as the former Midway Pier was previously dredged.

marina). There are eight policies regarding SAV, which focus on the preservation and protection of SAV
and the avoidance and minimization of impacts to SAV habitat.
Federal Consistency
Approximately 2 acres of eelgrass habitat have been identified within the property boundaries of the
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor and approximately 13 acres of eelgrass have been mapped
within 200 feet of the surplus property. In addition to eelgrass, widgeon grass has been previously
documented at this surplus property, likely in similar environments as eelgrass (U.S. Department of the
Navy 2009); however, digital data from the State of Rhode Island did not confirm this (RIDEM,
Narragansett Bay Estuary Program and RI CRMC; Applied Science Associates 2011). The eelgrass
habitat is located the southern end of the property immediately to the south of the former Midway Pier.
The eelgrass beds that are located along the waterfront near the proposed shoreline park would not be
disturbed during construction of the pier because the development footprint, as assessed in the EIS and
this consistency determination, does not overlap with the mapped locations of SAV.
Therefore, the Proposed Action would be fully consistent with the policies of this section.

1.2

Aquidneck Island Special Area Management Plan (SAMP)

The CRMC developed a SAMP for the western side of Aquidneck Island and adjacent waters to protect
the ecological, economic, and cultural values of this area (Coastal Resources Management Council 2009).
Reuse and redevelopment of the surplus properties must also be consistent with applicable SAMP
policies, which include setback and vegetation requirements, storm water management requirements,
open space and public access provisions, and requirements for protecting scenic areas (Coastal Resources
Management Council 2009).
Based upon a review of Figure 1: Aquidneck Island Special Area Management Plan Boundary and
Section 130.1 of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, all four surplus properties are located within the boundary
of the Aquidneck Island SAMP. As such, the Aquidneck Island SAMP Coastal Development Policies
summarized below are applicable to the upland portions of all four surplus properties.
The Coastal Development Policies include provisions for the establishment of a coastal greenway, a
coordinated review process between CRMC and local municipalities, a recommendation for conservation
development techniques for large parcels of land, mitigation of impacts to coastal and freshwater
wetlands, designation of high priority conservation and restoration areas, goals for open space and public
access, as well as preservation of the scenic and visual qualities of the West Side of Aquidneck Island.
Those policies applicable to the Proposed Action are discussed below.
Section 130.2 Coastal Greenway
Coastal greenways are intended to be vegetated with native plant communities and provide an
undeveloped transition zone between the shoreline and adjacent upland development within the 200-foot
contiguous area of a coastal feature. Coastal greenway requirements do not apply to municipal projects
undertaken to provide public access to the shoreline and other public amenities such as ball fields, parks,
playgrounds, public boat ramps, public fishing piers, or boating facilities (Aquidneck Island SAMP
Section 140.4).
Federal Consistency
This policy is applicable to the former Naval Hospital and Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor
properties only, as the former Navy Lodge and Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not along the shoreline. The
proposed actions would be undertaken to enhance public access to the shoreline and would likely be
considered municipal projects not subject to Section 130.2. Nevertheless, redevelopment under
Alternative 1 at the former Naval Hospital and Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor properties

would be inclusive of either the establishment and maintenance of a coastal greenway or the standards for
setbacks and buffers stipulated in Sections 140 and 150 of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as stipulated in
130.2(c) of the Aquidneck Island SAMP. With adherence to one of the two options, the future
developers/property owners would be in compliance with this policy. As such, the Proposed Action
would be fully consistent with this policy.
Section 130.8 Open Space and Public Access
The primary goal/standard for any development project along the shoreline must be a requirement to
provide public access to and along the shoreline within the project property boundary.
Federal Consistency
The former Naval Hospital property and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property would
be consistent with Coastal Policy 130.8 by creating both open space and public access as part of the
Proposed Action. Both properties would open up previously federally held properties along Narragansett
Bay to the public, and would include waterfront uses along Narragansett Bay. Additionally, although the
former Navy Lodge and Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not located along shoreline, redevelopment of both
properties would include the creation of open space within the property boundaries. Therefore, the
Proposed Action would be fully consistent with this policy.
Section 130.9 Visual Elements
The scenic and visual qualities of the West Side of Aquidneck Island coastal area shall be considered and
protected as a resource of public priority. Development should be sited and designed to protect views to
and along coastal areas, minimize the alteration of natural land forms, be visually compatible with the
character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible, restore and enhance visual quality in visually
degraded areas in accordance with Rhode Island CRMP Section 330.
Federal Consistency
The Proposed Action is based upon the Preferred Reuse Plan developed by AIRPA; that plan targets
specific types of development on each property based on each site’s physical and environmental setting
and location. The Plan, in summary, is consistent with Coastal Policy 130.9 because reuse and
redevelopment at each property will restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas. The
visual quality of the former Naval Hospital and Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor properties
would be enhanced due to the creation of waterfront parks and coastal greenways. Deteriorating and/or
outdated pier structures in these areas would be upgraded or replaced under the Proposed Action. As
such, the Proposed Action would be fully consistent with this policy.
Section 150.1 Standards Applicable to Entire Development
This policy includes various development standards that apply to the entire development parcel.
Development standards that are applicable to the Proposed Action are discussed below.
A) 25% Minimum Vegetation Requirement – Applicants must include sustainably landscaped areas in
their proposals to achieve vegetative coverage of at least 25% of the surface area over the entire
development parcel.
B) Stormwater Management – All new development and redevelopment proposals shall meet the
stormwater requirements of CRMP Section 300.6 and as specified in the most recent edition of the
Rhode Island Stormwater Manual to control peak flow rates and volumes and improve water quality.
Communities should be implementing low impact development (LID) practices to meet the 2007
Cleaner Narragansett Bay Act (R.I.G.L. § 45-61.2), which requires LID as the primary means of
managing and treating stormwater.
C) Open Space – There are three aspects to open space designations of importance. First is the
choice of the land that should be set aside and what qualities that land possesses, and second is the

links between the open space parcels that allow greenways throughout the area and improve the
value of the land and mobility for residents. The third aspect is the design of the designated areas that
will ensure their long-term value.
D) Public Access – When applicants choose the Coastal Greenway option, the CRMC requires that
shoreline and arterial public access pathways be provided by the applicant within the development
site, as described in Aquidneck Island SAMP Coastal Development Section 150.5.
E) Construction Setback – A construction setback of 25 feet is required for all new and existing
residential, commercial, mixed-use, and other structures to provide for fire, safety, and maintenance
purposes. The setback is measured from the inland edge of the Coastal Greenway or buffer.
Federal Consistency
As proposed, the redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge, former Naval Hospital, Tank Farms 1 and 2,
and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor properties would include open space areas,
vegetation, and enhanced public access to the shoreline. However, it will be the responsibility of the
developers/property owners to conduct separate and appropriate environmental documentation and obtain
all the necessary permits from state and federal agencies that meet the applicable standards addressing
areas such as stormwater management (i.e., Rhode Island Stormwater Manual and CRMP 300.6),
groundwater protection, infrastructure, vegetation cover (i.e., Section 150.1 Standards Applicable to
Entire Development), SAV, open space, public access (i.e., CRMP Section 335. Protection and
Enhancement of Public Access to the Shore and Aquidneck Island SAMP Section 150.5 Public Access
Standards for all Coastal Greenways), construction setback and water quality associated with the
proposed activity (i.e., Water Quality Certificate from RIDEM and USACE permit, concurrent with their
application to CRMC). These detailed, parcel-specific analyses will be undertaken when detailed
development proposals are submitted by future owners/developers of the subject parcels.
Therefore, as presently envisioned and subject to the identified future permitting and approval processes,
the Proposed Action would be consistent with these standards to the maximum extent practicable.
Section 170 Redevelopment Zone
Large parcels of land within the Aquidneck Island SAMP have been designated as the Aquidneck Island
Redevelopment Zone (Section 170 Redevelopment Zone of the SAMP), composed of areas on the west
side of Aquidneck Island that have been specifically designated for high density development by the local
municipality or the state. For example, the former Naval Hospital property is within a specifically
defined redevelopment zone referred to as the Newport Naval Hospital redevelopment area. Tank Farms 1
and 2 are specifically included in the Melville/Weaver Cove redevelopment area as defined by the
Aquidneck Island SAMP. The policy and standards associated with the Redevelopment Zone, inclusive
of both the Newport Naval Hospital and Melville/Weaver Cover redevelopment areas, are discussed
below.
Section 170.2 Policy. It is the policy of the CRMC to establish and link public access along the entire
west side shoreline within the Aquidneck Island SAMP boundary, including through the areas designated
as Redevelopment Zones that will satisfy the overall goals of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as well as the
applicable Redevelopment standards described herein.
Federal Consistency
The Aquidneck Island SAMP recognizes the importance of the coastal zone for meeting several public
needs, provides guidance for striking a balance among the various uses that affords the public maximum
benefit, seeks harmony rather than conflict among these uses, and regulates the balance among the
competing uses of the state's coastal resources. Therefore, reuse and redevelopment of the former Naval
Hospital property under Alternative 1 will be required to provide public access along the shoreline in

accordance with Aquidneck Island SAMP Section 170.2. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not inclusive of
shoreline property and would not therefore provide access to the shoreline.
Pursuant to Section 170.3 Standards, applicants within the redevelopment zone may choose between
setback and buffer requirements set forth in SAMP Sections 140 and 150 or a Coastal Greenway of 50feet in width that includes a public access path, as described in the Aquidneck Island SAMP.
Reuse and redevelopment also will be required to meet either the optional development standards
included in Section 170.3 of the SAMP or meet the setback and buffer requirements in Rhode Island
SAMP Sections 140 and 150, as discussed above. As assessed in the EIS, the former Naval Hospital
property would include a waterfront park spanning the extent of the property along the Narragansett Bay,
with a public pathway. This waterfront park is assumed to meet the requirements of SAMP Sections 140
and 150. Similarly, the open space and multi-use pathway proposed for the Defense Highway/Stringham
Road Corridor Property would be assumed to meet the same SAMP requirements. Therefore, the
Proposed Action would be consistent with this policy to the maximum extent practicable.

Re:

Federal Coastal Zone Consistency Detern1ination for disposal and reuse of surplus property at
Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island - Reference CRMC File 2014-02-057

Dear Mr. Dorocz:
We are in receipt of your letter dated February 11 , 2014 requesting the Rhode Island Coastal
Resources Management Council (CRMC) to review and concur with the Coastal Consistency
Determination (CCD) for the disposal and reuse of identified federal surplus property at Naval
Station (NAVSTA) Newport, RI. Your letter with enclosures was received in this office on
February 19, 2014. The Navy intends to dispose of the following surplus properties for reuse: the
former Naval Hospital site (Newport); the former Navy Lodge site (Middletown); Tank Farms 1
and 2 (Portsmouth); and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor (Middletown and
Portsmouth). These properties and proposed reuse are described in more detail below. As you
co1Tectly point out, the proposed disposal by the Navy of these surplus properties is a direct federal
action. Therefore, such action is subj ect to federal consistency re iew pursuant to the federal
Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) at 16 USC§§ 1451-1464 and the CZMA' s implementing
regulations at 15 CFR § 930 Subpart C.
There are two reuse alternatives being considered in the Environmental Impact Statement (in
preparation) for these four NAVSTA surplus properties. Alternative 1 is the preferred alternative
while Alternative 2 is the higher density alternative. You ha e indicated that the a 's preferred
b the C D, is the reuse of the surplus
alt ma ti ( t rnati e 1), and the onl alternati e addr
properties in accordance with the preferred reuse plan identified in the quidneck Island Reuse
/
Planning Authority's Redevelopment Planfor Surplus Propertie at 'AVSTA ewport. The
,j7J/
Redevelopment Plan was completed in 20 11 and includes a mix ofland uses, including commercial,'/ l,
industrial and active and passive recreational uses for the surplus properties. The Redevelopment
Plan al~o incorporates the CRMC' s review authority and permitting process for reuse of said
i'IV'I.
properties.

The Coastal Consistency Determination indicates that the Navy's proposed action is reasonably
likely to affect uses or natural resources of the tate' s coastal zone, but would be conducted in a
manner consistent with the State' s Coastal Resources Management Program (CRMP). See CCD

1. The Navy, however, does not propose to conduct, nor will it be a pe1mitting or approval authority
for, any of the activities associated with the Redevelopment Plan. Upon transfer by the Navy of the
surplus properties, redevelopment activities will be a non-federal action on non-federal property and
would therefore fall under the CRMC' s direct state permitting authority. It is anticipated that the
proposed redevelopment of the parcels would be conducted over a 20-year period, but it is unknown
at this time exactly how the specific redevelopment of individual sites and parcels would evolve.
Nevertheless, "it would be the responsibility of future developers/property owners, as projects are
further defined and identified for construction, to conduct any additional required analyses, prepare
appropriate environmental documentation, and obtain any necessary permits and approvals prior to
implementation of individual projects at the various surplus properties." Id. at 3. The surplus
properties and proposed uses under the preferred reuse plan (Alternative 1) are as follows:

•

Former Navy Lodge - a 3-acre parcel located at the intersection of Coddington High a
and West Main Road in Middletown. The proposed reuse is redevelopment fo r retail space
on a total of 1.8 acres with about 1.2 acres of proposed open space. The parcel is outside of
the CRMC 200-foot jurisdictional area.

•

Former Naval Hospital- an approximately 15-acre parcel located along 3rd Street in
Newport. The parcel abuts CRMC designated Type 4 waters and includes an existing granite
block pier. The proposed reuse for the existing building includes a hotel, restaurant and
retail space, a 36-unit residential building, and a waterfront park of approximately 2.4 acres
that would include the pier, a pedestrian path, water taxi dockage and a boat storage facility.
This project is within the CRMC 200-foot jurisdictional area.

•

Tank Farms 1 and 2 - a 136 acre site located in Portsmouth to be redeveloped as light
industrial, office space, boat storage, multi-modal parking facility and solar array. The
redevelopment area would be a total of 31.1 acres ith approximately 105 acres remaining
as open space. We understand that environmental restoration activities are ongoing at this
site under the Navy ' s Defense Environmental Restoration Program. These two tank farms
are outside of the CRMC 200-foot jurisdictional area.

•

Defense Highway/Stringham Road - existing two-lane road in Middletown and
Portsmouth to be maintained with the addition of a 12-foot wide multi-use pathway in a
greenbelt along CRMC designated Type 4 waters. Recreation and open space as pai1 of a
horeline park ill be added at Midwa Pier/Greene Lane. An existing pier will be rebuilt as
a concrete 15-foo t -v ide b 250-foot long public fishing pier. These proposed activities are
within the CRMC 200-foot jurisdictional area.

All four surplus properties are located within the RMC quidneck Island Special Area
Management Plan (SAMP), but the former Naval Ho pital and the Defense Highway/Stringham
Road corridor are wholly or partly located within th 'RMC' s 200-fo ot jurisdictional area.
Accordingly, the development standards contained\ 'thin the Aquidneck Island SAMP will apply to
the former Naval Hospital and the Defense High a I tringham Road corridor projects. These two
quidneck Island SAMP Coastal
reuses may be considered under Section 140.4(e) of th
Development Regulations if they are owned by a municipal, state or federal government entity and
the sole purpose is to provide public access. Subs qu nt property owners/developers of the fo nner

Department of the NAVY
March 25, 2014
Page Three

Naval Hospital and the Defense Highway/Stringham Road corridor projects will be required to
obtain CRMC permits for any work conducted on these parcels in accordance with the Coastal
Resources Management Plan including any applicable requirements of the Aquidneck Island
SAMP.
Based on the information contained in your letter and attachments, we have concluded that the
Navy's proposed action of disposing the identified surplus properties for reuse in accordance with
the preferred alternative described above will be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the
maximum extent practicable with the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Plan.
I would appreciate if you would please forward an executed copy of the
in this matter when it is completed. Thank you.

INTRODUCTION
In accordance with the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) legislation, portions of the
Naval Station Newport have been directed for realignment. Ecology and Environment, Inc.
(E&E) has been selected to complete an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate
potential effects as a result of the Navy’s disposal and reuse of the excess property and its
eventual redevelopment by the local redevelopment authority. Pare Corporation (PARE) has
prepared this traffic impact study in support of the EIS at each of the surplus property locations
based on the recommendations listed in the July 6, 2001 Final Draft Redevelopment Plan. The
excess Navy properties to be studied along with their recommended reuse are as follows:


Naval Hospital, Newport, RI – Located on Third Street in Newport, north of the Pell Bridge
ramps, the former Naval Hospital parcel is 10 acres, containing six buildings and one pier.
The preferred redevelopment alternative for this site includes a 3-story hotel (100 to 200
rooms) with space for retail and/or restaurants over at-grade parking, a 3-story, 36-unit
residential building over at-grade parking, and a waterfront park. The waterfront park is
expected to include amenities such as a pier, a waterfront pedestrian path, a marine harbor
shuttle station, and recreational boat moorings.



Navy Lodge, Middletown, RI – The former Navy Lodge parcel is a 3-acre parcel located on
the northwest corner of the intersection of Coddington Highway and West Main Road (Route
114). The building was demolished in 2004, and the site is currently a vacant, grass-covered
lot. The preferred redevelopment scenario for this parcel includes two retail buildings, each
one-story in size for a total of 30,492 square feet, on a total of approximately 0.7 acres.



Tank Farms 1 and 2, Portsmouth, RI – Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located northeast of the
intersection of Stringham Road with Defense Highway, occupying a combined approximate
146 acres. The preferred redevelopment scenario for these parcels includes office space, light
industrial, boat storage, multi-modal parking, and the potential for a solar array. A total of
31.1 acres of the site would be redeveloped and approximately 113.9 acres would remain as
open space.



Defense Highway/Burma Road Corridor, Portsmouth and Middletown, RI – The Defense
Highway/Burma Road corridor begins at Stringham Road in Portsmouth and continues south
to the Gate 17 Access Road in Middletown. The 67-acre parcel is located along the
northwestern portion of NAVSTA Newport on the western shoreline of Aquidneck Island.
With the preferred redevelopment scenario, this corridor would be retained as a two-lane
roadway with the addition of a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt opposite the railroad tracks,
next to the water. In addition, recreation/open space use is proposed at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane area in the form of a shoreline park. This park is expected to include a
fishing pier, a kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, picnic areas, pathways, and parking.

Three redevelopment alternatives were reviewed for each impacted parcel. Alternative 1 is a
moderate density alternative that proposes reuse of the excess property in accordance with the
July 6, 2001 Final Draft Redevelopment Plan. Full build-out is expected to occur over 20 years.
The second alternative, Alternative 2, was developed to identify the potential for a higher density
of development at each of the surplus sites. Alternative 2 contains a higher level of commercial
uses, including office and retail, and industrial development. Full build-out is expected to occur
over 20 years. The third alternative is the No Action Alternative. Under this alternative, all

-1-

excess property will be retained by the U.S. Government in caretaker status. No reuse or
redevelopment would occur at any of the properties. Alternative 1 is the preferred development
alternative being proposed for each of the four surplus properties.
Included herein is the traffic impact analysis for the surplus properties based on the anticipated
impacts of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action Alternative. Each of the alternatives
was reviewed for the existing 2012 conditions as well as the projected 2032 build conditions.
Potential impacts of the proposed redevelopments of each parcel have been determined, and
mitigation has been recommended as required.
Aerial locus maps for each of the four surplus properties are included in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4.

SAFETY ANALYSIS
Crash Data
Crash data was requested from the Towns of Portsmouth and Middletown and the City of
Newport for the most recent three year period. The specific areas where data was requested were
those in the vicinity of the surplus parcels.
In Portsmouth, data was requested for the following locations:
1. West Main Road (Rt. 114) between Stringham Road and Bradford Avenue
2. Bradford Avenue/Chelsea Drive between West Main Road (Route 114) and East Passage
3. Stringham Road between West Main Road (Route 114) and Defense Highway/Burma
Road
4. Defense Highway/Burma Road between East Passage and the Middletown Town Line
Within these areas, between January 2009 and October 2012, 122 crashes were reported at 11
different intersections. Ninety-five involved property damage only and 27 resulted in an injury.
Sixty-three were rear-end crashes, 23 were angle crashes, 15 were sideswipes in the same
direction, 10 were motorist collisions with an object, 4 were motorist losses of control, 4 were
motorist collisions with an object, 1 was a head-on crash, 1 was a sideswipe in the opposite
direction, and 1 involved a backing vehicle.
The majority of the crashes reported in Portsmouth were rear ends, which are typical at signalized
intersections and generally low severity. The greatest number of crashes within the study area
and time frame occurred at the intersection of West Main Road and Stringham Road, where 57
were reported over the almost four years of data. Thirteen of the crashes reported at this
intersection involved one of the driveways to the Mobil Xtra Mart located just south of the
intersection. It is also worth noting that the east leg of the intersection is a Dunkin Donuts
driveway, which likely contributed to the frequency of crashes at the intersection.
In Middletown, crash data was requested for the following locations:
1. Defense Highway from the Portsmouth Town Line to the Gate 17 Access Road, including
the intersection at Greene Lane
2. West Main Road (Route 114) from the Portsmouth Town Line to Greene Lane, including
the intersection at Greene Lane
3. West Main Road (Route 114) from Chases Lane to East Main Road (Route 138)
4. Coddington Highway from West Main Road (Route 114) to the Newport City Line
Within these areas, between January 2010 and October 2012, 136 crashes were reported at 13
different intersections. One hundred and ten crashes involved property damage only and 26
resulted in an injury. Sixty-five were rear-end crashes, 22 were broadside crashes, 20 were angle
crashes, 14 were sideswipes in the same direction, 5 were head-on crashes, 4 were motorist
crashes with a pedestrian or bicyclist, 3 were motorists that lost control of their vehicle, 2 were
motorist collisions with an object, and 1 was a sideswipe in the opposite direction.
The majority of the crashes reported in Middletown were rear ends, which are typical at
signalized intersections and are generally low severity. The greatest number of crashes within the
study area and time frame were reported at the intersection of West Main Road and East Main
Road. Sixty-one crashes were reported over the almost three years of data that was observed.
This intersection has recently undergone improvements as part of the Reconstruction of Two Mile
Corner project. Many of the crashes reported within the study area occurred on Coddington

- 20 -

Highway. This roadway has also recently undergone striping improvements as part of RIDOT’s
RI*STARS program, under Aquidneck Island Contract 1. A road diet has been implemented on
Coddington Highway between Girard Avenue and West Main Road. This section now has one
travel lane in each direction with a center two-way left turn lane in place. It is likely that the
revision to the existing lane configuration will impact the crash patterns along the roadway.
In Newport, crash data was requested for Admiral Kalbfus Road (Route 138)/Training Station
Road between Third Street and the Pell Bridge On– and Off-Ramps and Third Street between
Admiral Kalbfus Road (Route 138)/Training Station Road and Sycamore Street.
Within the study area, 98 crashes were reported between January 2009 and October 2012 at 8
intersections and the Pell Bridge On- and Off-ramps at J.T. Connell Highway and Admiral
Kalbfus Road. The descriptions for the crashes at the ramps intersections varied considerably,
therefore, the crash locations could not always be accurately identified. Seventy-eight of the
crashes involved property damage only and 20 involved an injury. Sixty were rear-end crashes,
12 were sideswipes in the same direction, 11 were motorist collisions with an object, 9 were
motorist losses of control, 4 were angle crashes, 1 was a sideswipe in the opposite direction, and 1
was a head-on crash.
Similar to Portsmouth and Middletown, the majority of reported crashes were rear-ends, which
are typical at signalized intersections and are expected in a dense urban area. The highest number
of crashes within the study period occurred at the Route 138 eastbound exit ramp intersection
with Admiral Kalbfus Road. Thirty-six crashes were reported at this intersection, of which 33
were rear ends and 32 involved property damage only.
It should be noted that RIDOT has recently reconfigured the approaches to the rotary at the
intersection of J.T. Connell Highway and Admiral Kalbfus Road. The revised approaches include
wider splitter islands, a greater entrance angle, and signing and striping in accordance with
current standards for roundabouts. In addition, this area will undergo major improvements in the
coming years as part of RIDOT’s Pell Bridge Ramps project. Both the approach improvements
and the overall improvements to the area will impact the crash patterns and frequency within the
study area.

Speed Studies
Speed studies were performed on each of the key study area roadways in the vicinity of the
excess Navy property to determine typical travel speeds. The roadways were selected based on
the location of the property and the expected location of the access and egress point(s). Speed
studies were completed at the following locations:
 Third Street – Newport, RI
 Coddington Highway, West of West Main Road – Middletown, RI
 Defense Highway, North of Greene Lane – Middletown, RI
 Stringham Road, West of Sullivan Drive – Portsmouth, RI
 West Main Road, near Browns Lane – Middletown, RI
In general, the 85th percentile travel speeds along these roadways were higher than the posted
speed limits. On Coddington Highway and Defense Highway, the travel speeds were as much as
15 miles per hour higher than the posted speed limit. On West Main Road in Middletown, the

- 21 -

average travel speeds were slightly lower than the posted speed limit. This area is densely
commercial with a number of adjacent driveways and traffic signals. Achieving a true free-flow
speed is difficult along this stretch of roadway.
Summary tables are provided below with the speed study results for each roadway. Complete
speed study results are provided in Appendix A.

FUTURE CONDITIONS
Proposed Development Alternatives
Three redevelopment alternatives were reviewed for each impacted parcel. Alternative 1 is a
moderate density alternative that proposes reuse of the excess property in accordance with the
July 6, 2001 Final Draft Redevelopment Plan. Full build-out is expected to occur over 20 years.
The second alternative, Alternative 2, was developed to identify the potential for a higher density
of development at each of the surplus sites. Alternative 2 contains a higher level of commercial
uses, including office and retail, and industrial development. For this alternative, full build-out is
also expected to occur over 20 years. The third alternative is the No Action Alternative. Under
this alternative, all excess property will be retained by the U.S. Government in caretaker status.
No reuse or redevelopment would occur at any of the properties. Alternative 1 is the preferred
development alternative being proposed for each of the four surplus properties. A summary of
the potential development as part of Alternatives 1 and 2 is provided below for each surplus
property location.
Naval Hospital, Newport, RI
Located on Third Street in Newport north of the Pell Bridge ramps, the former Naval Hospital
parcel is 10 acres, containing six buildings and one pier. Under Alternative 1, the site would be
redeveloped to include 120-room, 3-story hotel with space for retail and/or restaurants over atgrade parking, a 3-story, 36-unit residential building over at-grade parking, a 1.8 acre waterfront
park, including amenities such as a pier, a waterfront pedestrian path, a marine harbor shuttle
station, and recreational boat moorings, approximately 160 parking spaces, and approximately 1.8
acres of open space. Under Alternative 2, the hotel and waterfront park would remain as
proposed in Alternative 1, but the residential units would be replaced by approximately 35,000
square feet of commercial/office space. The number of parking spaces would be increased
moderately to 204 to accommodate the office use, resulting in a slightly lower amount of open
space at 1.5 acres. The table below summarizes the potential development for the Naval Hospital
site under Alternatives 1 and 2. Figures 8 and 9 show the potential development alternatives for
the Naval Hospital site.

Navy Lodge, Middletown, RI
The former Navy Lodge parcel is a 3-acre parcel located on the northwest corner of the
intersection of Coddington Highway and West Main Road (Route 114). The building was
demolished in 2004, and the site is currently a vacant, grass-covered lot. The redevelopment
alternatives for this parcel both include two retail buildings, either one-or two-story in size.
Under Alternative 1, the buildings would be one-story each and total approximately 30,000
square feet, while under Alternative 2, the buildings would increase to two stories each and a total
square footage of approximately 61,000 square feet. The required parking varies between 145
and 185 spaces, and the resulting open space varies between 0.9 acres and 1.2 acres. The Navy
Lodge development alternatives are summarized in the table below. Figures 10 and 11 show the
potential development alternatives for the Navy Lodge site.

Tank Farms 1 and 2, Portsmouth, RI
Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located northeast of the intersection of Stringham Road with Defense
Highway, occupying a combined are of approximately 146 acres. Under Alternative 1, the farms
would be redeveloped to include approximately 192,000 square feet of light industrial space and
109,000 square feet of office space. In addition, 3.6 acres for a solar array, 2,900 parking spaces,
and 114 acres of open space would be included. Under Alternative 2, the light industrial area
would increase to approximately 205,000 square feet and the office space would increase to
approximately 139,000 square feet. The number of proposed parking spaces would also increase
accordingly. The Solar array would remain as proposed in Alternative 1, and the available open
space would decrease slightly to 111 acres as a result of the increase in industrial and office
space. The development alternatives for Tank Farms 1 and 2 are summarized in the table below.

Defense Highway/Burma Road Corridor, Portsmouth and Middletown, RI
The Defense Highway/Burma Road corridor begins at Stringham Road in Portsmouth and
continues south to the Gate 17 Access Road in Middletown. The 67-acre parcel is located along
the northwestern portion of NAVSTA Newport on the western shoreline of Aquidneck Island.
Both redevelopment alternatives call for maintaining the existing two-lane roadway while adding
a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt on the west side of the roadway next to the water, opposite the
railroad tracks. In both alternatives, recreation/open space use is proposed at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane area in the form of a shoreline park. This park is expected to include a fishing
pier, a kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, picnic areas, pathways, and parking. The
restrooms, playground and picnic area, and public pier would encompass approximately 0.7 acres
of the available open space. Under Alternative 2, the size of the park would be increased, with
more parking, a larger playground, and an expanded pier width. The playground would be
approximately 0.1 acres and the picnic area and public pier would be redeveloped on slightly less
than one acre. The development alternatives for the Defense Highway/Burma Road corridor are
provided below. Figures 14 and 15 show the potential redevelopment alternatives for the Defense
Highway/Burma Road corridor.

Sight Distance
According to the AASHTO publication, A Policy on Geometric Design of Streets and Highways,
2011 Edition, sight distance is the length of the roadway that is visible to the driver as he or she is
approaching a driveway, fixed object, or other point of interest. The available sight distance on a
roadway should be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle traveling at or near the design speed to
stop before reaching a stationary object in its path. Stopping sight distance (SSD) measurements
were taken at the proposed site driveway locations for each excess Navy property parcel.
The proposed site entrance(s) at the Naval Hospital and Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located on side
streets with low to moderate existing travel volumes, while the proposed site entrance for the
former Navy Lodge site is located on a higher-volume roadway. Improvements will be required
at each site entrance to accommodate the new site and the potential traffic. Because the locations
of the site entrances are still approximate, stopping and intersection sight distance availability will
need to be reconfirmed if the redevelopment projects move forward to design and construction.
Once the final access/egress locations have been determined, a definite measurement for sight
distance can be obtained. A discussion of the available stopping sight distance at each location is
provided below.
The proposed driveways for the redeveloped Naval Hospital site are located on Third Street,
north of Cypress Street and south of Dorsey Road. Currently, three driveways are proposed. The
northernmost driveway was assumed to be access-only, leading directly to the proposed hotel. It
is expected to be located approximately opposite one of the driveways for the Bayside Village
Apartments. The center driveway, located opposite the Bayside Village Apartments, is expected
to provide egress from the hotel. The southernmost driveway is expected to provide access and

egress to and from the residential building included as part of Alternative 1 or the commercial
building included as part of Alternative 2. The speed study performed on Third Street indicates
that the 85th percentile speed is 34 miles per hour, therefore, a design speed of 35 miles per hour
was selected. The stopping sight distance required by AASHTO for a 35 mile per hour speed is
250 feet. At the location of the site drives, Third Street is flat and straight. Sight distance north
of the driveways is clear to approximately the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third
Street and southerly beyond the Route 138 overpass. Both of these distances are greater than the
250 feet required by AASHTO. Parking is permitted along both sides of the roadway for much of
its length and it is possible that parked vehicles on Third Street could impact the available line of
sight for drivers entering and exiting the property. Consideration should be given to prohibiting
parking on Third Street adjacent to the site driveways.
The proposed driveway for the redeveloped Navy Lodge site in Middletown is located on
Coddington Highway, approximately 200 to 300 feet west of West Main Road. It is unknown at
this time if this driveway will be a full-access driveway, or if it will allow right turns in and out
only. The Town’s West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan shows a right-turn
in/out only driveway on Coddington Highway as part of the overall redevelopment plan, but that
plan also includes site driveways on West Main Road. For this study, the proposed driveway at
the Navy Lodge site was reviewed as both a full and restricted-access driveway.
Based on the speed study performed on Coddington Highway west of West Main Road, the 85th
percentile speed on the roadway is 41 miles per hour. Therefore, a design speed of 45 miles per
hour was selected. It should be noted that this is considerably higher than the posted 25 mile per
hour speed limit. For a speed of 45 miles per hour, the AASHTO required stopping sight distance
is 360 feet. From the location of the proposed site entrance to the east, visibility is clear to the
intersection at West Main Road. The exact distance will depend upon the final location of the site
driveway. From the area of the site entrance to the west, the available sight distance is well over
500 feet, which exceeds the AASHTO requirement for the selected design speed.
Access to the Tank Farms 1 and 2 sites will be available from Stringham Road and Bradford
Avenue. Stringham Road is expected to provide access to the office space and some of the light
industrial use and its associated parking. Bradford Avenue will provide direct access to the
majority of the light industrial, the potential boat storage yard, and the solar array. Depending on
the final layout of the proposed development and the configuration of the internal roadway
network within the Tank Farms, patrons may be able to access all development from either
roadway.
A speed study was conducted on Stringham Road west of Sullivan Drive, in the vicinity of the
proposed entrance to the office space. The posted speed limit in this area is 30 miles per hour,
and the measured 85th percentile speed along the roadway was 36 miles per hour. As such, a
design speed of 40 miles per hour was selected. According to AASHTO, the required stopping
sight distance for the 40 mile per hour design speed is 305 feet. From the approximate location of
the site entrance to the east, sight distance is limited by a crest curve on Stringham Road at
Sullivan Drive. Based on the location of the existing Tank Farm access on Stringham Road, it
appears that the available sight distance would be approximately 440 feet. From the approximate
location of the site entrance to the west, sight distance is limited by the horizontal curve on
Stringham Road, approximately 350 feet. Similar to the other site entrances, these distances
would need to be confirmed once the final location is determined. The approximate available
distances on Stringham Road do exceed the minimum AASHTO requirements based on the 40
mile per hour design speed.

- 34 -

The second access point for the Tank Farms 1 and 2 sites on Stringham Road is located west of
Defense Highway and east of Alexander Road and Maritime Drive. This driveway would likely
provide access to and from one of the light industrial areas. Sight distance measurements were
taken from the existing gated access road to the Tank Farms, assuming that the site entrance
would be at the same location. From the driveway to the east, the available sight distance is
approximately 560 feet to the curve in the road at Defense Highway. From the driveway to the
west, the available sight distance is approximately 265 feet to the split in the roadway at
Alexander Road and Maritime Drive. The posted speed limit on Stringham Road in the vicinity
of this driveway is 25 miles per hour, for which a stopping sight distance of 155 feet is required
by AASHTO. From this driveway location, the available sight distances exceed the AASHTO
requirements for stopping sight distance.
Sight distance measurements were not taken on Bradford Avenue. The roadway currently dead
ends at a gated entrance to the Tank Farms, which will likely become the access to the light
industrial and boat storage uses. If access is provided directly onto Bradford Avenue, it would be
located on the north side of the roadway, west of Sullivan Drive. From this location, sight
distance is clear to the east beyond Sullivan Drive. TO the west, visibility is clear beyond the
gated access, down the hill into the Tank Farm property. There was no posted speed limit on
Bradford Avenue in the vicinity of the site entrance, however, it was posted as 15 miles per hour
east of Sullivan Drive near the Melville Campground. It is likely that improvements will be
required to the pavement structure on Bradford Avenue to accommodate the site traffic.
Potential Development in the Vicinity of the Study Sites
Future traffic volumes are generated by projecting the existing traffic volumes with an annual
growth rate and including known potential developments within the study area. The potential
redevelopment of the excess Navy parcels is expected to occur over a 20-year time frame. The
planning departments for the City of Newport and the Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth
were contacted to determine if there are any developments proposed in the vicinity of the Navy
parcels whose trip generation information should be included in this study. Given the potential
for development to occur over an extended period of time, accurately forecasting proposed
developments can be difficult. Many of the projects identified by the planning departments are
still in the preliminary design stages or are considered conceptual plans. As such, no specific trip
generation values were included as part of the future no-build analysis. It should be noted that if
development of any of the Navy parcels moves forward to design and construction, independent
traffic impact studies will be required. These studies will more specifically estimate the impact of
development based on existing conditions at that time and recent development in the study area.
Portsmouth
The Portsmouth Planning Department has indicated that three specific projects should be
considered for inclusion in this study. The first includes the parcel of land located directly
adjacent to Weaver Cove, owned by O’Neil Properties Group, which could potentially be
redeveloped to include a 1,500 slip and 900 dwelling unit development. Most development is
proposed along the shore of Weaver Cover south of Melville, and a portion is also proposed on
the parcel of land immediately east of (and up the slope from) Defense Highway. Both Defense
Highway and the Newport Secondary rail line separate this upland development from the
waterfront. No specific timeline for the project was provided, although this project has been in
discussion for some time.
A second project that could potentially occur over the next 20 years is the development of the
“backyard” property at Melville. This property is approximately 32 acres, located west of
Alexander Road. The “backyard” property is bounded by Alden Way to the south and the
- 35 -

Melville Marina to the north. Various concepts for development have been discussed to date,
although no plans are currently under review. No specific timeline for the project was provided,
and the planning department had no further information available.
A third potential project is the potential sale of some of the Raytheon property, which is located
on West Main Road. Raytheon is actively trying to sell off two large buildings on the southeast
corner of their property along with an undisclosed amount of land surrounding the buildings.
This area could be redeveloped into any number of uses, including light manufacturing, a
technical school, or indoor storage. The sale or sales have not yet occurred and the planning
department had no further information available.
Middletown
One of the primary significant potential projects within Middletown is the West Main/Coddington
Development Center Master Plan, which involves the redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge
site and abutting Town Land. While this impact study is looking specifically at the Navy Lodge
parcel, the West Main/Coddington plan includes the parcels directly north of the Navy site on
West Main Road, the Town’s Recreation Complex, the Middletown Public Library, and the
former JFK School. The “preferred scenario” outlined for development within the plan explores
the concept of creating a mixed-use center along the west side of West Main Road, including a
mix of civic uses, offices, and retail. The long-term goal is to include buildings closer to the
street, enhance the streetscape, and consolidate driveway entrances by providing shared parking
at the rear of the lots.
One other significant development identified by the Planning Department is a proposed 400,000+
square foot retail development on 70 acres of land roughly bounded by West Main Road and
Browns Lane. This project is in the planning stages, with an application that has been submitted
to the Town, but is currently in court and review has yet to begin.
A third notable property is located further north on West Main Road roughly opposite Marshall
Lane. This area includes approximately 24 acres of land zoned for light industrial use which
offers significant development potential, although there are currently no specific development
plans.
Newport
Discussions with the Newport Planning Department indicated that there are currently no known
projects planned or proposed within the vicinity of the Navy Hospital site on Third Street. It was
mentioned that the property is currently zoned as residential only, and any development will
require a zone change. Future development on the Navy property and in the vicinity of the
property will depend on the outcome of further studies of the area and amendments to the zoning
regulations.
Background Growth
Background growth is the growth expected within a study area based on development projects not
specifically identified as well as annual population and traffic increases. For this traffic study,
several previously developed documents were consulted to determine the appropriate growth
factor. The Statewide Planning Program’s Travel Model Update (2006) offers city and town
growth projections between 2010 and 2030. In Middletown, the growth is expected to be
approximately 0.025% per year, in Portsmouth it is expected to be 0.55% per year, and Newport
is expected to experience a decline of approximately 0.35% per year.

Based on the Aquidneck Island Transportation Study, completed for the Aquidneck Island
Planning Commission in July 2011, West Main Road north of Coddington Highway is expected
to experience a traffic growth of 0.44% per year between 2009 and 2030. Within the same time
frame, the Pell Bridge is expected to experience a traffic growth of 0.55% per year.
Because the rates found for the cities and towns vary, and because the projection of background
growth over such a long time period is difficult, it was decided that the use of a 1% growth rate
per year from 2012 to 2032 would provide a conservative estimate of future traffic volumes.
Future 2032 no-build a.m. and p.m. peak hour volumes for the study areas are provided in Figures
16, 17, and 18.

TRIP GENERATION
Trip Generation estimates were completed for the potential development alternatives at each
location using the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) manual Trip Generation, 8th
edition.
Naval Hospital, Newport, RI
Trip generation for Alternative 1 at the Naval Hospital site was completed using Land Use Code
(LUC) 310 Hotel, LUC 230 Residential Condominium/Townhouse, and LUC 412 County Park.
County Park was used instead of a city or state park as it provided the most conservative estimate
of the trip generation based on the size of the proposed park. For Alternative 2, trip generation
estimates were completed using LUC 310 Hotel, LUC 710 Office, and LUC 412 County Park.
Although the proposed hotel is expected to have both a retail and a restaurant component, the trip
generation studies included as part of LUC 310 include facilities with such uses. There is no
separate trip generation estimate needed to account for potential trips generated by these facilities.
A summary of the trip generation for Alternatives 1 and 2 at the former Naval Hospital site is
provided below.

Navy Lodge, Middletown, RI
As both proposed development alternatives for the former Navy Lodge site include retail uses, all
trip generation was completed using LUC 820 Shopping Center. While shopping centers are
typically much larger than the potential Alternative 1 and 2 developments, the Navy Lodge site is
part of an area currently under review by the Town of Middletown for redevelopment as part of
the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan. This plan includes four parcels:
the former Navy Lodge, the Town’s Recreation Center, the Middletown Public Library, and the
former JFK Elementary School, all of which are located on the west side of West Main Road,
between Coddington Highway and Valley Road. If this plan comes to fruition, this area could
end up as a mix of civic, retail, office, and residential uses. According to the Trip Generation, the

- 41 -

development of the trip generation estimates included surveys at locations including shopping
centers, neighborhood centers, and community centers, some of which included nonmerchandising facilities such as office buildings, movie theaters, restaurants, and recreational
facilities. In addition, the application of LUC 820 for this study allowed for the estimation of
a.m. peak hour trip generation values, which other related retail LUC’s do not. A summary of the
trip generation for Alternatives 1 and 2 for the Navy Lodge site is provided below.

Tank Farms 1 and 2, Portsmouth, RI
The potential development alternatives for Tank Farms 1 and 2 include varying amounts of office
space, light industrial space, and a solar array. Some of the light industrial space, located near the
center of Tank Farm 1, may be used for boat storage during the off-peak months. The remainder
of the light industrial space will be split between two locations, with approximately 40% located
near Stringham Road and the existing railroad line and approximately 60% located off of
Bradford Avenue. The trip generation estimates for these alternatives were completed using LUC
710 General Office Building and LUC 110 General Light Industrial. Although the solar array is
expected to encompass a significant portion of the developed area, it will not be a public-use
facility that will generate daily traffic. A summary of the trip generation estimates for
Alternatives 1 and 2 for the Tank Farms 1 and 2 site is provided below.

Defense Highway/Burma Road Corridor, Portsmouth and Middletown, RI
With development along the Defense Highway/Burma Road corridor, the existing two-lane
roadway would be maintained and a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt on the west side of the
roadway, next to the water, opposite the railroad tracks, would be constructed. As part of both
potential development alternatives, recreation/open space use is proposed at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane area in the form of a shoreline park. This park is expected to include a fishing
pier, a kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, picnic areas, pathways, and parking. Although the
multi-use pathway and other potential uses may generate new trips to the area, it is expected that
most would occur during off-peak hours, primarily weekends. It is also likely that the potential
uses will capture some current drivers along the roadway and that not all trips to the developed
site would be new trips to the area.
For both alternatives, the open space available for development is approximately 15 acres. Under
Alternative 1, the proposed restrooms, playground and picnic area, and public pier included as
part of the shoreline park would comprise approximately 0.7 acres. The remaining 14.3 acre area
would remain open space. Under Alternative 2, the playground would be increased to 0.1 acres
and an expanded pier width would result in slightly less than 1 acre to be redeveloped for use as a
public pier. The remaining 13.9 acre area would remain as open space.
The trip generation land use code estimates for parks are typically based on much larger facilities
than the available developable area, ranging from 100 acres to 2,100 acres. In addition, the uses
at the surveyed parks varied considerably, including boating or swimming facilities, ball fields,
camp sites, picnic facilities, beaches, hiking trails, and general open space. The trip generation
averages are so low per acre for each park use contained in the manual that they would result in
between 1-2 trips new trips per hour during the peak hours for the Defense Highway/Burma Road
corridor. It is not anticipated that a recreational park at this location would have a significant
impact on overall traffic volumes within the area, and is more likely to be used by local residents
or those working at the nearby Navy facility rather than new visitors to the area. As such, no trip
generation estimates are included for this potential redevelopment and no capacity analysis of
nearby intersections has been completed.

- 43 -

TRIP DISTRIBUTION
Trip distribution for the redevelopment of the excess Navy parcels was based on the existing
travel patterns on the roadways directly adjacent to the anticipated site entrance locations. Where
the site entrances are located on a side street with low traffic volumes, the nearest major roadway
was used to determine travel patterns.
Naval Hospital, Newport, RI
Access to and from the redeveloped Navy Hospital site will be provide through new site
driveways on Third Street. The location of the Navy Hospital site with respect to Route 138
allows easy access to and from the site from the north and south on Third Street. Based on the
ATR data recorded on Third Street, it was determined that during the a.m. peak hour, 75% of the
traffic on Third Street is traveling northbound, while 25% is traveling southbound. During the
p.m. peak hour, the volumes are more evenly split, with 45% of traffic traveling northbound and
55% of traffic traveling southbound. The new trips expected to the redeveloped Navy Hospital
site were added to Third Street based on these percentages.
Navy Lodge, Middletown, RI
Access to the redeveloped Navy Lodge site will be provided through a new driveway on
Coddington Highway. It is unknown at this time if the new driveway would be a full-access
driveway or if right turns in and out only would be allowed. Both scenarios were reviewed in the
completion of this report. For the full access driveway, the ATR data recorded on West Main
Road was compared to the data recorded on Coddington Highway to determine the appropriate
splits from each roadway. For both the a.m. and p.m. peak hours, it was assumed that 45% of the
site traffic will travel to and from Coddington Highway and 55% will travel to and from West
Main Road.
Tank Farms 1 and 2, Portsmouth, RI
The proposed redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 will have access from both Stringham Road
and Bradford Avenue. The trips to the site were split based on the expected location of the
development, with all office traffic and approximately 1/3 of the light industrial traffic expected
to use Stringham Road and the remaining 2/3 of the light industrial traffic expected to use
Bradford Avenue. Stringham Road is used as a cut-through for motorists traveling between
Defense Highway and West Main Road. A number of motorists who travel to Naval Station
Newport use the Stringham Road/Defense Highway combination to avoid traveling further south
on West Main Road to the Gate 17 Access Road. The ATR volume data that was collected on
Stringham Road was used to determine that during the a.m. peak hour, 10% of traffic on
Stringham Road is traveling eastbound while the remaining 90% is traveling westbound. During
the p.m. peak hour, 75% of traffic on Stringham Road is traveling eastbound and 25% is traveling
westbound. These percentages were used to split the new Stringham Road trips during both peak
hours. Because Bradford Avenue dead-ends into the Tank Farms, it was assumed that all traffic
to and from the Bradford Avenue light industrial uses will use West Main Road.
Trip distribution calculations are contained in Appendix C. Figures 19 through 24 provide the
future 2032 build traffic volumes for the a.m. and p.m. peak hours for all study intersections and
proposed site driveways for redevelopment Alternative 1 and Alternative 2.

CAPACITY ANALYSIS
Capacity analysis was completed for key intersections surrounding the excess Navy properties in
Portsmouth, Middletown, and Newport. Each of the study intersections was reviewed under
Existing (2012) Conditions, Future 2032 No-Build Conditions, Future 2032 Build Conditions –
Alternative 1, and Future 2032 Build Conditions – Alternative 2. The weekday a.m. peak hour
and the weekday p.m. peak hour was analyzed for each scenario. Rather than determining a
network peak hour for each of the areas, the individual peak hours for each intersection were used
to provide a conservative analysis of the study area and potential impacts. In addition, optimized
signal timings were used for the future 2032 no-build and build conditions to account for signal
timing improvements over the course of the 20-year projected time frame.
Capacity analysis characterizes intersections based on their level of service (LOS). LOS is a
quality measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of
service measures such as speed, travel times, traffic interruptions, etc. Six LOS are defined for
both signalized and unsignalized intersections, from A to F, with A representing the best
operating conditions and F representing the worst operating conditions. The LOS criteria for both
types of intersections are provided below.

Naval Hospital, Newport, RI
Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road and Third Street/Third Street Extension
During the a.m. peak hour, this intersection currently operates at LOS B with approximately 18
seconds of delay per vehicle. The projection of the 2012 volumes to 2032 results in an increase
in LOS to LOS C, with delays of approximately 32 seconds per vehicle. The Alternative 1 and
Alternative 2 redevelopment options could be expected to increase the intersection LOS to LOS
D with 37-39 seconds of delay per vehicle.
During the p.m. peak hour, this intersection currently operates at LOS B with approximately 14
seconds of delay per vehicle. The projection of the 2012 volumes to 2032 results in an increase
in LOS to LOS C, with delays of approximately 22 seconds per vehicle. With implementation of
the Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 redevelopment option, the intersection would remain at LOS C
with approximately 26-33 seconds of delay per vehicle.
Third Street and Proposed Site Driveways
Under future 2032 build conditions, it is expected that the proposed hotel entrance and exit will
be separate driveways. During the a.m. peak hour for both Alternative 1 and 2, the approaches to
both driveways are expected to operate at LOS B or better, with delays less than 14 seconds per
- 51 -

vehicle. The approaches to the driveway for the proposed residential or commercial use is
expected to operate at LOS B with 13 seconds of delay under Alternative 1, and at LOS C with 15
seconds of delay under Alternative 2.
During the p.m. peak hour, the approaches to the hotel driveways are expected to operate at LOS
B or better with delay times for both scenarios less than 13 seconds per vehicle. The approaches
to the residential or commercial development driveway are expected to operate at LOS B or
better, with delays less than 14 seconds per vehicle.

Navy Lodge, Middletown, RI
West Main Road and Coddington Highway/Rockwood Road
The signalized intersection of West Main Road with Coddington Highway and Rockwood Road
currently operates at LOS B with approximately 18 seconds of delay during the a.m. peak hour.
Under future no-build 2032 conditions, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS C with
approximately 22 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the proposed site driveway on Coddington
Highway operating as a full-access driveway, the impact on the intersection as a result of the
Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 development is minimal. The intersection LOS is expected to
remain at LOS C, and delays are expected to remain at approximately 22 seconds per vehicle. If
the proposed site driveway operates as a right turn in/out only, the Alternative 1 and 2 results
remain unchanged.
During the p.m. peak hour, the intersection currently operates at LOS C with approximately 21
seconds of delay per vehicle. Under the future no-build 2032 conditions, the intersection is
expected to remain at LOS C with approximately 35 seconds of delay per vehicle. Following the

- 52 -

Alternative 1 redevelopment with a full-access driveway on Coddington Highway, the
intersection would increase to LOS D with 39 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the Alternative
2 redevelopment, the intersection would operate at LOS D with delays of approximately 43
seconds per vehicle. With a right turn in/out only access on Coddington Highway, the
intersection would operate at LOS D with approximately 35 seconds of delay per vehicle under
Alternative 1, and LOS D with approximately 36 seconds of delay per vehicle under
Alternative 2.
West Main Road and Valley Road
The signalized intersection of West Main Road and Valley Road currently operates at LOS B
with approximately 16 seconds of delay during the a.m. peak hour. Under the future 2032 nobuild and build conditions, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS C with approximately
22 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the right turn in/out only driveway to the site on
Coddington Highway, this intersection would remain at LOS C with approximately 22 seconds of
delay per vehicle.
During the p.m. peak hour, the intersection operates at LOS B with approximately 18 seconds of
delay per vehicle. Under the future 2032 no-build, the intersection is expected to operate at LOS
C with approximately 27 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the Alternative 1 redevelopment, the
intersection would remain at LOS C and increase to approximately 28 seconds of delay per
vehicle. With the Alternative 2 redevelopment, the intersection would remain at LOS C but
increase to approximately 30 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the right turn in/out only
driveway to the site on Coddington Highway, this intersection would remain at LOS C with
approximately 27 seconds of delay per vehicle.
Coddington Highway and Proposed Site Driveway
The approaches to the proposed site driveway on Coddington Highway are expected to operate at
LOS C or better during the a.m. peak hour, with delay times less than 21 seconds per vehicle. If
the driveway operates as a right turn in/out only driveway, the approaches are expected to operate
at LOS B or better with delays less than 15 seconds per vehicle.
During the p.m. peak hour, the southbound approach to the full-access driveway is expected to
operate at LOS E under Alternative 1 and LOS F under Alternative 2. The primary reason for the
increase compared to the a.m. peak hour is the higher through volume on Coddington Highway,
combined with the turning volumes to and from the site.
With the right turn in/out site driveway, the southbound approach to the intersection is expected
to operate at LOS B under both Alternatives during the a.m. peak hour. During the p.m. peak
hour, the southbound approach is expected to operate at LOS C under Alternative 1 and LOS D
under Alternative 2. Similar to the full-access driveway, the primary reason for the increase in
LOS between the a.m. and p.m. peak hours is the increase in exiting traffic and the high through
volume on Coddington Highway.

Tank Farms 1 and 2, Portsmouth, RI
West Main Road and Stringham Road/Dunkin Donuts Driveway
The signalized intersection of West Main Road with Stringham Road and the Dunkin Donuts
driveway currently operates at LOS B with approximately 18 seconds of delay per vehicle during
the a.m. peak hour. Under future 2032 no-build conditions, the LOS increases to LOS C with
approximately 24 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the Alternative 1 development at the Tank
Farms, the intersection is expected to remain at LOS C with approximately 28 seconds of delay
per vehicle, and with the Alternative 2 development, the intersection is expected to remain at
LOS C with approximately 29 seconds of delay per vehicle.
During the p.m. peak hour, the intersection operates at LOS C with approximately 32 seconds of
delay per vehicle. Under the future 2032 no-build condition, the intersection LOS changes to
LOS D, with approximately 49 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the redevelopment alternatives
at the Tank Farms, the intersection is expected to change further to LOS E, with delays of 73
seconds and 78 seconds per vehicle for Alternatives 1 and 2, respectively.

West Main Road and Bradford Avenue
The intersection of West Main Road and Bradford Avenue forms a three-legged unsignalized
intersection. Bradford Avenue is a local side street, posted as a private way, which currently
passes through the parking lot for the Melville Elementary School. It provides access to the
school, as well as to one residential development off of Rainbow Heights Drive. If this roadway
is to become an access point for potential development at the Tank Farms, improvements to the
roadway and upgrades to the intersection will be required.
During the a.m. peak hour, the northbound movements at this intersection operate at LOS C or
better with delays less than 17 seconds per vehicle. The eastbound approach, exiting the roadway
onto West Main Road, operates at LOS F with delays greater than 100 seconds per vehicle.
Under the future 2032 no-build condition, the LOS remain unchanged, although delays continue
to increase. With both the Alternative 1 and 2 build conditions, the northbound approach changes
to LOS D with approximately 33 seconds of delay per vehicle. The eastbound approach remains
at LOS F with increased delays.
During the p.m. peak hour, the northbound movements at this intersection operate at LOS A with
delays less than 10 seconds per vehicle. The eastbound approach, exiting the roadway onto West
Main Road, operates at LOS F with delays greater than 100 seconds per vehicle. Under the future
2032 no-build condition, the northbound LOS remain at LOS B or better, with delays less than 11
seconds per vehicle. With both the Alternative 1 and 2 build conditions, the northbound
movements remain at LOS A, while the eastbound approach remains at LOS F with increased
delays.
As mentioned above, it is likely that improvements will be required at this intersection if either of
the Tank Farms 1 and 2 redevelopment alternatives moves forward. Depending on the volume of
traffic projected to exit using Bradford Avenue, a traffic signal could be warranted at the
intersection. Although a signal installation would impact delays along West Main Road, it would
significantly improve conditions for traffic exiting the proposed site, the existing residential
homes, and the Melville Elementary School.
Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road
The northbound approach to the intersection of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham
Road currently operates at LOS A with approximately 7 seconds of delay during the a.m. peak
hour. The northeast approach, the right turn from Defense Highway/Burma Road to Stringham
Road, currently operates at LOS F with delays greater than 100 seconds per vehicle. At the
intersection, the Defense Highway/Burma Road approach operates under stop sign control while
Stringham Road operates uncontrolled. Under the future 2032 no-build and the Alternative 1 and
2 build conditions, the approach LOS remains unchanged. On the northbound approach, delays
remain between 7-8 seconds per vehicle, and on the northeast approach, the delays continue to
increase above 100 seconds per vehicle.
During the p.m. peak hour, the northbound approach to the intersection operates at LOS A with
approximately 7 seconds of delay per vehicle, while the northeast approach operates at LOD D
with approximately 30 seconds of delay per vehicle. Under the future 2032 no-build condition,
the northbound approach remains unchanged and the northeast approach increases to LOS F with
approximately 94 seconds of delay per vehicle. With the proposed Alternative 1 and 2
redevelopment scenarios, the approach LOS remain unchanged, however, the northeast delays per
vehicle increase to over 100 seconds.

This intersection has been studied several times to determine the feasibility of geometric
improvements. The grade change and the angle of intersection between the two roadways create
potential conflicts. If the redevelopment of the Tank Farms moves forward, the intersection
should be reviewed again to determine the potential for improvements, either geometric or trafficbased. It is possible that this intersection would meet the warrants for signalization or, at a
minimum, for implementation of an all-way stop sign control.
Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane
The approaches to the unsignalized intersection of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene
Lane currently operate at LOS C or better during the a.m. peak hour, with less than 24 seconds of
delay per vehicle. Under the future 2032 no-build condition, the westbound approach to the
intersection increases to LOS F with delays of approximately 53 seconds per vehicle. With the
addition of traffic expected due to the Alternative 1 and 2 redevelopment scenarios, the
westbound approach will remain at LOS F, however, delays are expected to increase by
approximately 10 seconds per vehicle.
During the p.m. peak hour, the approaches to the intersection operate at LOS C or better, with
delays less than 19 seconds per vehicle. Under the future 2032 no-build condition, the westbound
approach increases to LOS D with approximately 26 seconds of delay per vehicle. The addition
of traffic to the intersection based on the Alternative 1 and 2 redevelopment scenarios has little
impact on the intersection, increasing delays on the westbound approach by 5-6 seconds per
vehicle.
Stringham Road and Proposed Site Driveways
The redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would result in the creation of two site driveways on
Stringham Road, one south of Defense Highway and one north of Defense Highway. For both
the Alternative 1 and 2 redevelopment alternatives, the approaches to the new intersections are
expected to operate at acceptable levels of service with minor delays. During the a.m. and p.m.
peak hours, the approaches are expected to operate at LOS C or better, with delays of 20 seconds
per vehicle or less. Overall the impact of the new development on Stringham Road traffic is
expected to be minor.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The redevelopment of the excess Navy properties as established with the 2005 Base Realignment
and Closure (BRAC) legislation and in accordance with the July 6, 2001 Final Draft
Redevelopment Plan will have varied impacts on the roadways surrounding the project sites. The
anticipated timeline for redevelopment is approximately 20 years, which makes accurate
estimation of impacts and required mitigation challenging. The assumed 1% per year background
growth factor may generate anticipated traffic volumes higher than the actual existing condition
in 2032. As a result, the analysis of the potential site redevelopment alternatives could show an
impact greater than what will actually be experienced upon construction.
In general, the overall safety of the roadways surrounding the properties appears adequate. While
there were a high number of reported crashes at many intersections, the travel volumes at the
intersections are also high, and the severity of the crashes was generally low. As discussed
earlier, RIDOT currently has several planned projects or has made recent striping revisions in the
vicinity of several of the sites that could impact the overall traffic and crash patterns. As many of
the key intersections reviewed are signalized intersections, the addition of new traffic is not
expected to create a significant safety concern. At the existing unsignalized intersections, the
need for revised traffic controls and/or signage should be reviewed at the completion of the traffic
study for each of the developments to ensure that the safety of the intersection(s) is not impacted.
The available sight distances from the potential site entrance locations was also reviewed, and
were generally found to meet the AASHTO requirements for the 85th percentile travel speeds
along the applicable roadway. It is recommended that these distances be reconfirmed when the
final location of the site driveway(s) is determined, as the available sight distance will vary based
on the location of the driveway. The access and egress drives at each of these potential
redevelopment sites should be designed to maximize the visibility for motorists turning into and
out of the developments while providing accurate information to the motorist to identify the site.
Street parking exists adjacent to the Naval Hospital, and its limits should be reviewed if the site
development goes to design to ensure that they remain appropriate for all users.
Capacity analysis of the study intersections and the proposed site entrance(s) indicates mixed
operational results. It should be noted that the intersections under existing conditions operate at
varied levels of service, with some approaches currently experiencing poor LOS and significant
delay. The addition of the redevelopment traffic to the study intersections is expected to impact
the overall LOS and delay, however, the future build conditions will not be significantly different
than what would be expected under the same future condition without the added phase of
development. In many cases, the Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 results were similar, while in
other cases the Alternative 2 results showed a higher level of impacts due to the increased density
of development. It should be noted that the future 2032 no-build and build analyses were
completed using optimized signal timings to account for revisions to the existing signal timing
over the next 20 years.

- 59 -

Potential mitigation measures at the study intersection are varied and depend on the location of
the intersection as well as the final design of the site driveways and internal site roadway
network. In some cases, improvements along the roadway could be as simple as revised signage
or striping, while in other cases, it is likely that geometric improvements will be required. In
addition, there are several locations where the redevelopment traffic may result in the need to
review all-way stop control and traffic signal warrants for intersections where they are not
currently installed. The need for the installation of these measures will depend on the final
decision regarding development density as well as the final location of the site driveway(s).

Notes:
a. Emission factors for gasoline worker vehicles from "Emission Facts: Average Annual Emissions and Fuel Consumption for Gasoline-Fueled
Passenger Cars and Light Trucks (EPA420-F-05-22, EPA 2005). It was assumed that the vehicle make-up included 50% cars and 50% light-duty
trucks/SUVs. SO2 emission factor calculated from gasoline consumption rate and a sulfur content of 80 ppm.
b. Emission factors for diesel worker and delivery vehicles (except SO2 and CO2) from "Assessing the Effects of Freight Movement on Air
Quality at the National and Regional Level- Final Report" (U.S. Federal Highway Administration 2005).
c. CO2 and SO2 emission factors for diesel worker and delivery vehicles from "Greenhouse Gas Protocol - Corporate Accounting and Reporting
Standard / Mobile Guide" (World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development 2005). SO2 emission factor
calculated from diesel consumption rate and a sulfur content of 348 ppm.
d. See emission factor derivation table below.
e. Sum of exhaust and road dust emission factors.

Highest (Most Conservative) Emfac 2007 (version 2.3)
Emission Factors for On-Road Passenger Vehicles & Delivery Trucks
Projects in the SCAQMD (Scenario Years 2020)
Derived from Peak Emissions Inventory (Winter , Annual, Summer)
Source: Accessed January 21, 2013 from http://www.aqmd.gov/ceqa/handbook/onroad/onroad.html
Vehicle Class:
Passenger Vehicles (<8500 pounds) & Delivery Trucks (>8500 pounds)
The following emission factors were compiled by running the California Air Resources Board's EMFAC2007
(version 2.3) Burden Model, taking the weighted average of vehicle types and simplifying into two categories:
Passenger Vehicles & Delivery Trucks
These emission factors can be used to calculate on-road mobile source emissions for the vehicle categories
listed in the tables below, by use of the following equation:
Emissions (pounds per day) = N x TL x EF
where N = number of trips, TL = trip length (miles/day), and EF = emission factor (pounds per mile)
This methodology replaces the old EMFAC emission factors in Tables A-9-5-J-1 through A-9-5-L in
Appendix A9 of the current SCAQMD CEQA Handbook. All the emission factors account for the emissions
from start, running and idling exhaust. In addition, the ROG emission factors include diurnal, hot soak, running
and resting emissions, and the PM10 & PM2.5 emission factors include tire and brake wear.

D-3 Methodology and Assumptions for Water Supply and Wastewater Projections

This page intentionally left blank.

D-3 Methodology and Assumptions for Water Supply and Wastewater Projections
The assumptions used in determining the land use-specific multipliers for water and wastewater
projections were obtained from The Planner’s Estimating Guide: Projecting Land-Use and Facility Needs
(Nelson 2004). The demand for treated water for domestic consumption takes into account the land
needed to support major water system elements such as treatment plants; however, water lines are not
included. The demand for wastewater treatment is considered along with land needed to support major
system elements such as the treatment plant and land for irrigation; however, similar to water demand,
wastewater demand does not take into account sewer lines (Nelson 2004).
Tables D-3A through D-3D provide a summary of all calculations for the land uses proposed under
Alternatives 1 and 2.
Commercial Land Use
The most appropriate land use types were used to calculate the projected water demand for the various
commercial land uses under Alternatives 1 and 2. Specific multipliers are discussed below.
Shopping Center
This land use type was used to calculate the projected water demand and wastewater generation for the
retail use proposed at the former Navy Lodge and at the former Naval Hospital properties under both
Alternatives 1 and 2. The multiplier for the shopping center land use water consumption is 125 gallons
per day (gpd) per 1,000 square feet of space (or 0.125 gpd per square foot). The multiplier for
wastewater generation is 119 gpd per 1,000 square feet of space (or 0.119 gpd per square foot). To
project water consumption and wastewater generation under Alternatives 1 and 2, the shopping center
multipliers were multiplied by the number of square feet of this land use proposed for the former Navy
Lodge and former Naval Hospital surplus properties.
Example: Under Alternative 1, a total of 30,500 square feet of retail is proposed at the former Navy
Lodge property. Applying the water consumption multiplier to the number of square feet, yields an
estimate of the amount of water consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
30,500 square feet x 0.125 gpd per square foot = 3,813 gpd of water
Office
This land use type was used to calculate the projected water demand and wastewater generation for the
conference center, commercial and yacht club/office proposed for the former Naval Hospital property
under Alternative 2, and the office space at Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternatives 1 and 2. The
multiplier for the office land use for water consumption is 125 gpd per 1,000 square feet of space (or
0.125 gpd per square foot). The multiplier for wastewater generation is 119 gpd per 1,000 square feet of
space (or 0.119 gpd per square foot). To project water consumption and wastewater generation under
Alternatives 1 and 2, the office multipliers were multiplied by the number of square feet of this land use
proposed for the former Naval Hospital and Tank Farms 1 and 2 surplus properties.
Example: Under Alternative 1, a total of 110,000 square feet of office is proposed at Tank Farms 1 and 2.
Applying the water consumption multiplier to the number of square feet, yields an estimate of the
amount of water consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
110,000 square feet x 0.125 gpd per square foot = 13,750 gpd of water

Hotel/Motel
This land use type was used to calculate the projected water demand and wastewater generation for the
hotel proposed for the former Naval Hospital property under both Alternatives 1 and 2. The multiplier
for the hotel land use with restaurant was chosen, as this most accurately reflected the proposed land
use at the former Naval Hospital. The multiplier for the hotel land use with restaurant for water
consumption is 125 gpd per hotel unit. The multiplier for wastewater generation is 119 gpd per hotel
unit. To project water consumption and wastewater generation under Alternatives 1 and 2, the hotel
multipliers were multiplied by the one unit of this land use proposed for the former Naval Hospital
property.
Example: Under Alternative 1, one hotel unit is proposed at the former Naval Hospital property.
Applying the water consumption multiplier to the proposed hotel with restaurant unit, yields an
estimate of the amount of water consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
1 hotel unit x 125 gpd per unit = 125 gpd of water
Industrial Land Use
The most appropriate land use types were used to calculate the projected water demand for the various
industrial land uses under Alternatives 1 and 2. Specific multipliers are discussed below.
Light Industrial
This land use type was used to calculate the projected water demand and wastewater generation for the
proposed light industrial uses for Tank Farms 1 and 2 under both Alternatives 1 and 2. The multiplier for
the light industrial land use for water consumption is 25 gpd per employee; similarly, the multiplier for
wastewater generation is 24 gpd per employee. To project water consumption and wastewater
generation under Alternatives 1 and 2, the light industrial multipliers were multiplied by the total
number of employees estimated for operation of this land use proposed for Tank Farms 1 and 2.
Example: Under Alternative 1, 170 employees are proposed for the light industrial land use at operation.
Applying the water consumption multiplier to the proposed number of light industrial employees, yields
an estimate of the amount of water consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
170 employees x 25 gpd per employee = 4,250 gpd of water
Car Wash
The car wash land use was assumed to be similar to the boat storage facility proposed under both
Alternatives 1 and 2 for the former Naval Hospital. It was assumed that the boat storage facility would
include an area (assumed to be one bay in size) for washing the boat surface prior to storage; however,
because that area would not be in use year-round, only a quarter of the total allocation for the car wash
land use was allocated as the multiplier.
The multiplier for the car wash land use for water consumption is 900 gpd per bay; one quarter of this
multiplier is 225 gpd per bay. Similarly, 760 gpd per bay is the multiplier for the car wash land use for
wastewater generation; one quarter of this multiplier is 190 gpd per bay. To project water consumption
and wastewater generation under Alternatives 1 and 2, a one quarter fraction of the total multipliers for
the car wash land use were multiplied by the one bay assumed to be included in the boat storage facility
proposed at the former Naval Hospital.

Example: Under Alternative 1, one boat storage facility is proposed for the former Naval Hospital.
Applying ¼ of the water consumption multiplier or 225 gpd per unit, yields an estimate of the amount of
water consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
1 boat storage facility x 225 gpd per unit = 225 gpd of water
Residential Land Use
The residential land use proposed for only the former Naval Hospital under Alternative 1, consists of 36,
2-bedroom units. The multipliers provided in Nelson 2004 are split between apartments with less than
(<) three bedrooms and those with more than (>) three bedrooms. Therefore, to project water
consumption and wastewater generation under Alternative 1 for the former Naval Hospital, the
multiplier for less than three bedrooms (180 gpd) was multiplied by the number of units.
Example: Under Alternative 1, 36 residential units are proposed for the former Naval Hospital. Applying
the water consumption multiplier of 180 gpd per unit, yields an estimate of the amount of water
consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
36 two-bedroom units x 180 gpd per unit = 6,480 gpd for water
Other/Recreation
The waterfront park proposed for the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor property under
Alternatives 1 and 2 would include public restrooms. Because there were no defined land use types in
Nelson 2004 that fit the definition of a public restroom, the most similar land use type was chosen from
the available land use type. This best fit land use type was a campground. The multiplier provided is
based on a campground space which was assumed to be inclusive of at least three people for multiple
uses per day. Therefore, it was assumed that one space would best correspond to the water and
wastewater demand generated from approximately four restrooms and associated sinks.
To project water consumption and wastewater generation under Alternatives 1 and 2 for the shoreline
park, the multiplier for one campground space was multiplied by the number of spaces.
Example: Under Alternative 1, one public restroom (comprised of four stalls and sinks) is proposed for
the shoreline park. Applying the water consumption multiplier of 180 gpd per unit, yields an estimate of
the amount of water consumed by this land use following redevelopment.
One space (public restroom) x 180 gpd per unit = 180 gpd for water

D-4 Methodology and Assumptions for Impervious Surface Area Projections

This page intentionally left blank.

D-4 Methodology and Assumptions for Impervious Surface Area Projections
The total impervious surface areas that would result from the implementation of Alternative 1,
Alternative 2, and the No Action Alternative were projected using the areas provided in Chapter 2,
Section 2.2 Identification of Alternatives. These areas were based upon the Redevelopment Plan. The
total impervious surface area includes existing and potential new surface areas (i.e., buildings,
structures, parking lots, roadways, and sidewalks) resulting from redevelopment. GIS analysis using
aerial photography was used to calculate existing impervious surface areas.
The impervious surface area projections are used only for planning and assessment purposes and should
not be interpreted as an absolute definition of future conditions upon full build-out of either Alternative
1 or Alternative 2. The final build-out of the surplus property is subject to many variables outside of the
Navy’s and developers’ control, including future market conditions, changes to local and state land use
regulations, and other development factors.
The projected total impervious surface area for each alternative at each surplus property is presented in
Tables D-4A and D-4B.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
YU & Associates (YU) served as an environmental sub-consultant to Ecology and Environment, Inc. (E&E)
for the performance of hazardous materials investigation within surplus properties at Naval Station Newport
(Newport Naval Complex or NAVSTA), in support of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the
Disposal and Reuse of Surplus Property at Naval Station Newport. These facilities included the former Naval
Hospital and other buildings in Naval Station Newport and Tank Farms 1 and 2 in Portsmouth, Rhode Island
(RI). The scope of work included review of previous reports, Asbestos-Containing Materials (ACM) and
Lead-Based Paint (LBP) investigations of buildings’ interiors and exteriors, selective soil sampling and
testing for lead, and testing of caulking and glazing materials for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
Project Site
In-scope buildings and structures within the Naval Station Newport include:
 Building 1: Former Naval Hospital (three-stories and basement; approximately 147,500 square feet
(SF)
 Building 45: Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation (two stories, basement and attic; approximately
37,000 SF);
 Building 7: Housekeeping (two stories; approximately 4,800 SF);
 Building 993: Emergency Generator (one story; approximately 1,400 SF);
 Quarters A & B: Housing Units (two stories; basement, crawl space, approximately 3,900 SF each)
 Building 63: Detached Garage (approximately 420 SF);
 Building 72: Public Works Electrical Room and Storage (one story; approximately 480 SF);
 Pier 71: Berthing Pier (approximately 6,300 SF).
In-scope buildings and structures within Tank Farm 1 include:

 Building 219: Utility Building-Electrical Distribution (approximately 150 SF); and
 Building A105: Public works Maintenance Storage (one story; approximately 560 SF).
Fieldwork Summary
Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island, Hazardous Materials
Work Plan dated, January 14, 2013 and accepted by the installation, April 5, 2013. The site-specific Health
and Safety Plan dated December 14, 2012 was accepted by the installation on April 4, 2013. Both documents
were prepared by YU and reviewed and accepted for compliance and consistency with the scope of work by
E&E. The YU team, comprised of licensed personnel, performed hazardous materials inspections from April
10 to April 17, 2013. Inspection activities were conducted in compliance with applicable regulations,
standards, and generally accepted environmental and safety practices at the above referenced facilities. The
investigation included the collection of 342 samples of suspected asbestos materials, field screening of paint
using an X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) device for the presence of lead, collection of 11 paint chip samples from
paints with inconclusive results as analyzed by XRF, collection of 10 composite soil samples for lead content
analysis, and collection of 6 composite samples of caulk from facility window glazing and sealants for PCBs
analysis. Sample analyses were performed by EMSL Analytical, Inc. (EMSL) in Cinnamon, NJ, a laboratory
currently certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Voluntary Laboratory
Accreditation Program (NVLAP) Code 101048-9.

Hazardous Materials Survey Report, Naval Station, Newport, RI
Asbestos Investigation and Findings
The asbestos inspection was conducted on a floor-by-floor and area-by-area basis. Samples of suspect ACM
were placed in homogeneous groups and analyzed using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and/or
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods and determined to either be asbestos-containing or not. A
material is considered to be asbestos-containing if it contains greater than (>) 1% of asbestos (National
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) 40 CFR Part 61). Descriptions of suspect
materials, locations, photographs and sample numbers were collected and correlated with laboratory
analytical test results to generate estimated quantities of various ACM. Per the scope of work, no extensive
destructive sampling was performed during the site survey and sampling.
ACM was identified in all buildings included in the survey, as described within Section 2.2 of this report.
ACM included floor tiles, linoleum, wall and ceiling plaster, floor tiles, window glazing and caulking, pipe
and insulation, cable and electrical wiring insulation, transite ceiling panels, and roof flashing, among others.
While YU identified select materials that are ACM positive, assumed to contain ACM, and confirmed to be
non-ACM, additional concealed ACM might be present on-site.
To protect human health and the environment, YU recommends that if ACM shall be disturbed by proposed
demolition or restoration work, then proper asbestos abatement procedures be implemented prior to work in
accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. This includes:
1. Filing the project with appropriate agencies with jurisdiction (e.g. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), Rhode Island Department of Health).
2. Developing specifications and a schedule for ACM abatement.
3. Retaining an independent testing laboratory to monitor air for possible asbestos contamination before,
during, and after abatement work (complete with record keeping).
4. Stopping work immediately upon encountering and concealed suspect material and utilizing a
certified inspector to investigate.
5. Hiring a licensed abatement contractor to perform abatement of friable and non-friable ACM.
Recommendations for ACM handling and removal are described in Section 2.3.
Lead Investigation and Findings
The lead investigation was designed to address two possible concerns: presence of lead in paint on interior
and exterior surfaces and presence of lead in soils around buildings.
Investigation of Lead Paint
The lead paint inspection was performed by 1) using an XRF device to screen painted surfaces, and 2)
collecting and analyzing paint chip samples for surfaces that came up inconclusive with XRF screening
(within a range of 0.9-1.0 mg/cm2).
Identified lead concentrations in paints were compared to: 1) The Navy Policy and Guidelines presented in
the Facilities Management Guide for Asbestos and Lead Technical Report TR-22554-ENV and 2) Federal
standards. Most tested paints exceeded the Navy guidelines restricting lead content to less than 0.06% lead by
weight. Federal regulation 40 CFR Part 745 Lead defines LBP as paint with lead concentrations above 1.0
mg/cm2 or 0.5% lead by weight. Comparing XRF results to federal standards, LBP was identified in Building
1, Building 45, Building 7, Quarters A & B, Building 63, Building 72, Pier 71, Tank Farm 1 – Building 199,
Tank Farm 2 – Building 48 and Building A105. No LBP was identified in Building 993 and Tank Farm 2 –
Building 219. Of the paint chip samples tested, LBP samples were identified in Building 1 and Quarters B.
Details of sample collection and LBP results by facility are included in Section 3.2 of this report.
To protect human health and the environment, YU developed LBP abatement recommendations. Specifically:

YU & Associates, Inc.

December, 2013
ii

Hazardous Materials Survey Report, Naval Station, Newport, RI
1. Any disturbances to these surfaces shall be treated as a potential lead hazard to workers in accordance
with 29 CFR 1926.62 (Lead Exposure in Construction) and, since there is no safe level of lead in
paint, work protection should be required during building demolition or renovation.
2. For any abatement work, clean-up should be performed under High Efficiency Particulate Air
(HEPA) vacuuming.
3. Construction demolition debris shall be tested by Toxicity Characteristics Leachate Procedures
(TCLP). If the analytical results are below the threshold level of 5 mg/L of lead, the debris shall be
disposed of as a construction waste. If the analytical results exceed the TCLP threshold limit, then the
debris should be considered as hazardous in nature and disposed at a licensed “landfill” facility.
Investigation of Lead in Soils around Building Perimeters
The lead in soils around building perimeters investigation was performed by collecting and analyzing
composite soil samples from shallow depths (0 to 0.5 ft below ground surface) within bare soil/grassy areas.
The sampling was performed in accordance with the United States Development of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) Guidelines and EPA Document for Residential Sampling for Lead: Protocols for Dust
and Soil Sampling. Eight samples were collected close to in-scope buildings in areas where lead based paint
peelings and chips were located in the vicinity of building drip lines. Two reference samples were collected
approximately 130 to 200 feet away from building perimeters in areas without visible evidence of lead paint
contamination. No soil sampling was performed surrounding Building 993, Building 63, Building 72, or Pier
71 because these structures were surrounded by asphalt. No soil sampling was performed at Tank Farm 1 –
Building 199 due to its being surrounded by asphalt and vegetative cover that made soil inaccessible. No
sampling was performed at Tank Farm 2 – Buildings 219 or A105 due to presence of vegetation.
Samples were sent to the laboratory for analysis and results were compared to EPA Bare Soil-Lead Hazard
Identification criteria as well as Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Residential and
Commercial/Industrial Standards for lead in soils as discussed in Section 3.3 of this report. Both reference soil
samples were below EPA and state guidelines. Seven of eight other soil samples collected (from Building 1,
Building 45, Building 7, Quarters A & B, and Tank Farm 2-Building 48) exceeded residential and
commercial/industrial state direct exposure criteria. One sample from the east perimeter of the southeast wing
of Building 1, one sample from Building 45, and one sample from Building 48 exceed the EPA hazard
standard for bare soil. Two samples from Building 1, one sample from Building 7, and one sample from
Quarters A & B were within the EPA Level of Concern range. One sample from Building 1 within the
courtyard between the southeast and southwest wings were at the EPA no action level.
YU provides the following recommendations to address presence of lead in soils:
1. Additional soils sampling to delineate areas of concern for lead in soil.
2. Removal and disposal of, or placement of permanent cover/barrier over, soil with concentrations of
lead within the EPA hazard standard level of concentrations greater than 1,200 ppm.
3. Covering of soil with lead concentrations between 400 and 1,200 ppm by clean soil.
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Fieldwork and Findings
YU collected composite and grab samples of potentially PCB containing window caulking and glazing from
Buildings 1, 7, and 48. YU recorded descriptions of materials, locations of sampling, and collected
photographs for correlation with laboratory results. Samples were sent to a laboratory for analysis and then
compared to the EPA definition of PCB bulk product waste in 40 CFR 761.3. No PCBs were detected by
laboratory analysis in the caulking and glazing samples collected by YU.
Hazardous Materials Disclosure
YU reviewed the Federal Property Management Regulations 41 CFR 102-75.335 and BRAC Policy to
identify regulations and guidelines for transferring properties with ACMs. Based on a review of this
information, the Navy is required to disclose all knowledge of ACM at the surplus property to any property

YU & Associates, Inc.

iii

Hazardous Materials Survey Report, Naval Station, Newport, RI
bidders or transferees. This report should be provided to parties interested in the surplus property and will
serve as the means of disclosure. As included in the Federal Property Management Regulations, any bidders
on the surplus property should be provided with a “Notice of Presence of Asbestos-Warning;” this notice can
be found in 41 CFR 102-75.335.
Based on the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, Title X, the seller must disclose
any known information concerning LBP or LBP hazards. The seller or landlord must also disclose
information such as the location of the LBP and/or LBP hazards, and the condition of the painted surfaces and
provide any records and reports on LBP and/or LBP hazards which are available to the seller or landlord (for
multi-unit buildings, this requirement includes records and reports concerning common areas and other units,
when such information was obtained as a result of a building-wide evaluation). This report should be
provided to parties interested in the surplus property and will serve as the means of disclosure.
This report may provide a potential buyer with the information on presence of hazardous materials within the
facilities.
Conclusions
ACM and LBP have been found within the buildings and structures included in the Naval Station Newport
surplus properties hazardous materials investigation performed by YU. Lead has also been detected in soils
around building perimeters above state residential and commercial/industrial direct exposure criteria. No
PCBs were detected in this investigation. Recommendations to address these findings are included in Sections
2.3 and 3.4.

Guide to this EIS
This EIS presents an analysis of the Navy’s proposed action to
dispose of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport, Rhode
Island. The surplus property comprises four non-contiguous
Navy properties:
• Former Navy Lodge (Town of Middletown)
• Former Naval Hospital (City of Newport)
• Tank Farms 1 and 2 (Town of Portsmouth)
• Midway Pier/Greene Lane (Town of Middletown)
Since these properties are located in three separate
municipalities, the document is organized by presenting the
existing conditions and environmental consequences for the
four properties individually. Therefore, some text is
intentionally repetitive in order to provide a balanced
amount of data, analysis, and context for each property.
The first three chapters of this EIS discuss the alternatives,

DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT FOR THE
DISPOSAL AND REUSE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY AT
NAVAL STATION NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND
March 2016

Abstract
This draft environmental impact statement (EIS) presents an analysis of the U.S. Department of the
Navy’s (Navy’s) proposed action to dispose of surplus property at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport,
located in Newport County, Rhode Island. Public Law 101-510, the Defense Base Closure and
Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005 (BRAC Law), has directed the Navy to realign NAVSTA
Newport. As a result of this action, the Navy has declared approximately 158 acres of property at
NAVSTA Newport to be surplus to the needs of the federal government. The purpose and need for the
proposed action is to comply with the BRAC Law and provide for the disposal and reuse of surplus
property at NAVSTA Newport. The draft EIS examines the potential human and natural environmental
consequences of the proposed action and any impacts associated with the reasonably foreseeable reuse of
the property.
Two redevelopment alternatives and the No Action alternative were considered. Alternative 1, the
preferred alternative, is the disposal of the surplus property and reuse in accordance with the
Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport (Redevelopment Plan), which has been
prepared and approved by the Aquidneck Island Reuse Planning Authority. Alternative 1 includes mixed
land use types and densities for each of four non-contiguous surplus properties as well as open space and
natural areas. Alternative 2 provides for the disposal of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport and
redevelopment at a higher density and with a different mix of uses than Alternative 1. The No Action
alternative is the retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S. government in
caretaker status. The Navy is the lead agency for the proposed action. The surplus properties to be
redeveloped are located in three separate municipalities on Aquidneck Island: the City of Newport, the
Town of Portsmouth, and the Town of Middletown.

Executive Summary
ES.1 Introduction and Description of the Proposed Action

This draft environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluates the potential human and natural environmental
consequences of the disposal of surplus property at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode Island, by
the Navy and its subsequent redevelopment by the respective municipalities in which the surplus property
is geographically located. Public Law (P.L.) 101-510, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of
1990, as amended in 2005 (BRAC Law), has directed the Navy to realign NAVSTA Newport. As a result
of this action, the Navy has declared approximately 158 acres of property at NAVSTA Newport to be
surplus to the needs of the federal government.
This EIS was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the BRAC Law, the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (P.L. 91-190, 42 United States Code [U.S.C.]
4321-4370f); the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA (40 Code of
Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500-1508); Navy procedures for implementing NEPA (32 CFR 775), Office
of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) Manual M-5090.1; and other applicable Department of
Defense (DOD) and Navy policies and guidance. The Navy is the lead agency for the proposed action.
There are no cooperating agencies for the preparation of this EIS.
The purpose of the proposed action is to comply with BRAC Law and provide for the disposal and reuse
of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport in a manner consistent with the Aquidneck Island Reuse
Planning Authority’s (AIRPA) Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport
(Redevelopment Plan; RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). The proposed action is needed to provide the
local community an opportunity for economic development and job creation.

ES.2 Background
ES2.1

BRAC Process and Surplus Property Overview

Base closure and realignment is the process used by the DOD to reorganize its installation infrastructure
to more efficiently and effectively support its forces, increase operational readiness, and facilitate new
ways of doing business. There are three primary phases of the BRAC process:

1

•

Phase 1: Disposal Planning – Federal Transfer – For NAVSTA Newport surplus
property, Phase 1 began on November 9, 2005, when the recommendation to realign
portions of the installation became law, leading to the declaration of certain lands and
facilities to be excess to the Navy’s needs. The first step in the planning involved offering
the property to federal agencies for reuse through a federal transfer process, which
occurred in early January 2009. However, no other federal users indicated an interest in
the surplus property at that time 1.

Phase 2: Surplus Property Notice and Designation as Surplus – The Navy’s notice on
February 9, 2010, stating that approximately 225 acres of property at NAVSTA Newport
were surplus set into motion a series of events and initiatives to plan and redevelop the
property for higher and better uses. Subsequent to that notification, a portion of one of
the properties was determined to no longer be surplus, such that the acreage of the surplus
property is currently estimated to be 158 acres. The Navy is in the process of
withdrawing its determination that Defense Highway is excess property.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) later indicated an interest in the property, although it followed the Navy’s
notice of surplus property.

Draft EIS

ES-1

March 2016

On May 25, 2010, the DOD Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) recognized AIRPA
as the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) responsible for the planning and
redevelopment of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport. AIRPA then began preparing
the Redevelopment Plan, discussed in more detail below.
•

Phase 3: Property Disposal – Upon completion of the NEPA process, the Navy will
issue its final disposal decisions and will convey the surplus property to the local
governments. Mechanisms identified for property disposal, include negotiated sale,
economic development conveyance, and public benefit conveyance.

NAVSTA Newport is located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island in Newport County, Rhode
Island. The surplus property of NAVSTA Newport is located in three separate municipalities on
Aquidneck Island: the City of Newport, the Town of Portsmouth, and the Town of Middletown.
Collectively, the surplus property comprises four non-contiguous Navy properties (see Figure ES-1):

Former Navy Lodge – Approximately 3 acres at the corner of Coddington Highway and
West Main Road in the Town of Middletown, Rhode Island

•

Former Naval Hospital – Approximately 15.2 acres, consisting of 8.3 acres of land and
6.9 acres of offshore riparian rights (access to water only), located on the western shore
of Aquidneck Island, on Narragansett Bay, in the City of Newport, Rhode Island

Tank Farms 1 and 2 – Tank Farm 1 consists of approximately 62 acres of land, and Tank
Farm 2 consists of approximately 74 acres of land in the Town of Portsmouth, Rhode
Island

•

Midway Pier/Greene Lane – This approximately 10.7-acre parcel is located along the
western portion of Aquidneck Island in the Town of Middletown.

Redevelopment Planning Process Summary

As indicated above, AIRPA was recognized as the LRA responsible for developing a redevelopment plan
for the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport. The planning process was guided by previously completed
plans, namely, the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005), the draft
Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan (Town of Portsmouth 2008b), and the West
Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin Inc. and RKG Associates
2011) as well as specific redevelopment goals that were established for each surplus property.
Following the establishment of publicly acceptable redevelopment goals and an evaluation of the
environmental conditions of each property, AIRPA developed different scenarios for each property. A
series of public events were held over an 18-month period to introduce the planning process to the public,
present alternatives for redevelopment, and to select a preferred reuse scenario, referred to as the
Preferred Reuse Plan for each site. The Preferred Reuse Plans for each site were collectively incorporated
into the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport (RKG Associates, Inc. et al.
2011). The Redevelopment Plan was officially adopted on August 8, 2011.
Following the completion of the Redevelopment Plan in 2011, the AIRPA became the Aquidneck Island
Reuse Implementation Authority (AIRIA) to oversee the acquisition of the surplus property and
implement the Redevelopment Plan. However, in early 2014, the three municipalities that comprised the
AIRIA determined that the organization be dissolved. Each municipality would pursue acquisition of
surplus property or properties and implement the Redevelopment Plan for the property or properties
within its jurisdiction, and in some instances, refine and/or re-evaluate the reuse plan for the individual
property or properties. Following the transfer of property, any changes to the reuse plan would require the

ES.3 Scope of the EIS

This EIS evaluates the potential human and natural environmental consequences of the disposal and
subsequent redevelopment of the surplus property. The resource areas examined in this EIS and
potentially impacted are land use, zoning, and coastal zone management; socioeconomics; community
facilities and services; transportation; environmental management; air quality; noise; infrastructure and
utilities; cultural resources; topography, geology, and soils; water resources; and biological resources.
The EIS also addresses potential cumulative impacts that may result from reasonably foreseeable projects
in the region, including both federal (Navy) and local projects.
This EIS addresses impacts based on the construction and full build-out timeframes of the approved
Redevelopment Plan and assumptions regarding foreseeable reuses of the property.

ES.4 Alternatives Considered in the EIS

The proposed action is the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the Navy and subsequent
redevelopment of the surplus property by the three municipalities. The primary approach to development
of the proposed action and alternatives was to (1) focus on the Navy’s disposal of surplus property with
the Redevelopment Plan as the reasonably foreseeable reuse of the property and then (2) consider a range
of reasonable disposal and reuse alternatives.
To assess the potential impacts of the proposed action, the Navy evaluated two property disposal and
reuse alternatives—Alternative 1 and Alternative 2—and the No Action alternative. These alternatives
are described below and summarized in Table ES-1.
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)
Alternative 1 is the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the Navy and reuse in
accordance with the Redevelopment Plan. This alternative has been identified as the preferred alternative
by the Navy. Full build-out is proposed to be implemented over a 20-year period but may differ for each
of the properties. The Redevelopment Plan includes a mix of land use types and densities for each surplus
property as well as open space and natural areas. Details of the proposed redevelopment at each surplus
property are summarized below.
Former Navy Lodge. The 3-acre former Navy Lodge property is proposed for redevelopment as retail
space 2. The site is currently vacant, except for a small telephone utility shed and a water feed vent and
concrete pad, so no demolition is proposed. Two one-story buildings on a total of approximately 0.7 acres
are proposed. Retail use would total approximately 30,500 square feet. These structures are proposed on
the northeast and southeast corners of the site, with approximately 0.8 acres (or approximately 145
spaces) of parking adjacent to the buildings. In addition, 0.3 acres would be used to access the site from
Coddington Highway. A total of 1.8 acres (60 percent) of the 3-acre site would be redeveloped;
approximately 1.2 acres would be maintained as open space. The former Navy Lodge property is
encumbered by several easements, which will transfer with the property. The Landings Real Estate
Group owns an easement across the northeastern portion of the property for a water line to the apartment
housing development adjacent to the former Navy Lodge. In addition, the Rhode Island Department of
2

The former Navy Lodge property is proposed to be part of the Town of Middletown’s West Main/Coddington
Development Center, a large mixed use development totaling approximately 14 acres. The development center
would consist of four parcels: the former Navy Lodge, the town’s recreation complex, Middletown Public
Library, and the former JFK Elementary School (see Sections 4.1.3 and 13.2.3.1).

Draft EIS

ES-5

March 2016

Transportation (RIDOT) holds a “perpetual easement” along the eastern edge of the property that was
acquired in 2004 for the construction of a turning lane on West Main Road for right-hand turns onto
Coddington Highway. No easement currently exists for the small telephone utility shed.
The Navy also holds an easement on property owned by the Landings Real Estate Group that provides
access from the former Navy Lodge property to Lake Erie Street, located on the western edge of the
former Navy Lodge property, which connects to Coddington Highway. Upon transfer of the former Navy
Lodge property, this easement would pass to the new owners.
Additionally, the Navy would retain an easement on the former Navy Lodge property to allow for
continued use of a water line that provides service to NAVSTA Newport.
Former Naval Hospital. Proposed redevelopment at the approximately 15.2-acre former Naval Hospital
property includes a three-story hotel (120 rooms) with additional space on the first floor for retail and a
restaurant comprising approximately 1.3 acres and parking at the northeast corner of the site; a three-story
36-unit residential building with a ground level footprint of approximately 0.60 acres over at-grade
parking in the southeast corner of the site; and a waterfront park of approximately 2.4 acres that would
include a pier, pedestrian path, water taxi dockage, and a boat storage facility. The residential building
would contain 36 two-bedroom units. Parking and access throughout the site would total 2.2 acres of
developed land under Alternative 1; including the existing road (Riggs Road) that bisects the site. A total
of approximately 54 percent of the overall site (inclusive of land-based and pier development) would be
developed under Alternative 1. The redeveloped site would be accessed from Third Street, similar to
current conditions. Cypress Street may also serve as an additional access point to/from the site.
The waterfront park would include a boat storage facility of approximately 1,300 square feet. The existing
pier would be re-used as-is, with the addition of two concrete floating docks on each side. Each floating
dock would be 8 feet by 90 feet. These floating docks would be supported by pontoons and anchored in
place with pilings and cables. It is assumed that the pilings would be square, pre-stressed concrete piles
measuring 1 foot by 1 foot, which would be constructed off-site. Piles would be installed using an impact
hammer on a barge and a crane.
Under Alternative 1, all six existing buildings listed in Table 1-1 would be demolished. The existing pier
would remain as-is, as described above.
The 6.9 acres of offshore riparian rights of the former Naval Hospital property will not transfer with the
property. The riparian rights will remain under the control of the Coastal Resources Management Council
for determining future use.
Tank Farms 1 and 2. Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped as an approximately 136-acre site with
office, light industrial and boat storage space, multi-modal parking uses, and the potential for a solar
array. The plan for the tank farms includes a multi-modal parking facility with 400 parking spaces (a total
of 4 acres) on the west side of the site, adjacent to the railroad; 45,000 square feet (1 acre) light industrial
or boat storage also along the railroad; 145,000 square feet of light industrial with 55,000 square feet (1.3
acres) along the rail line and 90,000 square feet (2.1 acres) off of Bradford Avenue; 110,000 square feet
(2.5 acres) of office space at the south end of the site (south end of Tank Farm 2).
The solar array would comprise approximately 155,000 square feet (3.6 acres) and would be located near
the center of Tank Farm 2. Parking and access roads would comprise approximately 20.6 acres of newly
redeveloped area. A total of 31.1 acres or 23 percent of the 136-acres would be redeveloped; 104.9 acres
(77 percent) would remain as open space. Access to the redeveloped site would be from new access points
along Stringham Road and Bradford Avenue.
Draft EIS

ES-6

March 2016

Under a separate project (unrelated to this EIS), the Navy plans to demolish the underground storage
tanks (USTs) and associated facilities at Tank Farm 1 in accordance with the Rhode Island Department of
Environmental Management (RIDEM) UST closure program (under Rule 13, entitled Closure, of
RIDEM’s Rules and Regulations for Underground Storage Facilities Used for Petroleum Products and
Hazardous Materials). This project is scheduled to be completed in 2016 and before transfer of the
property. The Navy similarly intends to demolish the USTs and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2
under the same RIDEM UST closure program, although the schedule for this demolition has not been
established; the Tank Farm 2 demolition will be scheduled once funding is available. Therefore, for the
purposes of the analysis in this EIS, the USTs and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2 are assumed to be
transferred in place as part of the property transfer for this proposed action. Tank Farm 2 will be
remediated prior to redevelopment.
Midway Pier/Greene Lane. Recreational/open space use is proposed at this approximately 10.7-acre
property. A shoreline park would be included with a fishing pier, kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, a
0.3-acre parking lot, picnic areas, and pathways. The restrooms, playground, and picnic area would
comprise 0.09 acres. The existing pier would be rebuilt to be a 15-foot wide and 250-foot long concrete
pier. Access to the proposed park would be provided directly from Defense Highway. In addition to the
shoreline park, a multi-use pathway would be constructed in a greenbelt on the opposite side of the
railroad tracks, next to the water. The pathway would be 12 feet wide and would be surfaced with
bituminous concrete. In areas constrained by topography or other factors, the width may be reduced to 10
feet.
In-water activities would include removing the existing pier, which is assumed to include dredging with a
clamshell bucket or similar equipment, and excavation of the existing pier. Piles that formerly supported
the pier were previously removed. Pile-driving to construct the new pier and construction vessels as
described above (see Former Naval Hospital section above) would also be necessary.
With the exception of the demolition/removal of the existing pier, no further demolition activities would
occur at this property under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 (High-Density Redevelopment)
Alternative 2 provides for the disposal of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport and redevelopment
at a higher density, with a larger footprint and a different mix of uses than Alternative 1. Although there
are several similar land uses considered, Alternative 2 is not consistent with the Redevelopment Plan. As
with Alternative 1, most of the existing facilities at the surplus property would be demolished. This
alternative also includes a mix of land uses, including commercial, industrial, and active and passive
recreation space. Full build-out would be implemented over a 20-year period but may differ for each of
the properties. Specific redevelopment details for each surplus property are discussed below.
Former Navy Lodge. Proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property (the 3-acre Navyowned parcel only) would be as described under Alternative 1 with the following modifications. Under
Alternative 1, the two retail buildings are single-story, and under Alternative 2, the two retail buildings
would be two stories. Under both alternatives, the retail buildings would have the same footprint (0.70
acres); however, under Alternative 2, the retail buildings would have a total of 61,000 square feet of retail
space compared with 30,500 square feet of retail space under Alternative 1. To accommodate the
increase in retail space, additional parking is proposed under Alternative 2. A total of 1.4 acres of
parking/access would be developed under Alternative 2, resulting in redevelopment of a total of
approximately 2.1 acres or 70 percent of the overall site. No demolition would occur prior to
redevelopment and access would be from Coddington Highway, similar to Alternative 1. The transfer of

Draft EIS

ES-7

March 2016

and retainment of easements on the former Navy Lodge property as discussed above under Alternative 1
would also occur under Alternative 2.
Former Naval Hospital. Redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would be as described
under Alternative 1, with the following modifications: The residential use proposed under Alternative 1
would be replaced by commercial use, and a conference center would be added to the proposed hotel. The
commercial use would have the same footprint as the residential use under Alternative 1 (0.6 acres). The
0.2-acre conference center would be developed behind the hotel, along Third Street. Under Alternative 2,
the shore-based boat storage facility and two concrete floating docks associated with the waterfront park
would be developed as described for Alternative 1. However, under Alternative 2, an additional concrete
floating dock approximately 8 feet wide by 70 feet long would be constructed at the end of the existing
pier with concrete mooring piles (assumed here to be the same as described under Alternative 1). A yacht
club/office would also be constructed next to the boat storage facility, within the footprint of the former
chapel.
In-water construction activities would include pile-driving equipment and various construction vessels, as
described above under Alternative 1.
At 4.8 acres (58 percent) the development footprint is slightly larger than under Alternative 1. The
intensity of use also is higher under Alternative 2.
Lastly, similar to Alternative 1, the current buildings would be demolished to facilitate redevelopment of
the site. Access to the redeveloped property would be via Third Street, with the potential use of Cypress
Street.
Tank Farms 1 and 2. Under Alternative 2, Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped with the same
mix of uses as under Alternative 1. However, under Alternative 2, the amount of office space would
increase by 25 percent from 110,000 square feet (2.5 acres) to 137,600 square feet (3.2 acres), and light
industrial uses along the rail line would increase by 25 percent, from 55,000 square feet (1.3 acres under
Alternative 1) to 68,750 square feet (1.6 acres) for a total of 205,000 square feet. The other two areas of
industrial development are the same as described under Alternative 1: 2.1 acres of light industrial off of
Bradford Avenue and 1.0 acres of boat storage, totaling 4.7 acres of industrial uses under Alternative 2.
The parking/access would be increased to approximately 22.5 acres. That acreage coupled with the
office, industrial, and boat storage uses would result in a total of 34 acres or 25 percent of the overall site
under Alternative 2. Lastly, similar to Alternative 1, the USTs and associated facilities would be
demolished at Tank Farm 1 before transfer and redevelopment through a separate and unrelated project.
The Navy also intends to demolish the USTs and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2; however, the
schedule for this demolition has not been established. For the purposes of analysis in the EIS, the USTs
and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2 are assumed to be transferred in place to the developer and
remediated prior to development.
Midway Pier/Greene Lane. Similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 includes the same multi-use pathway
in a greenbelt on the opposite side of the railroad tracks, next to the water. Alternative 2 would include
greater expansion of the former Midway Pier area, including two areas of cut-and-fill for parking totaling
0.6 acres in addition to the recreation/open space use that is proposed and the shoreline park described
under Alternative 1. Under Alternative 2, the playground would be increased to 0.1 acre and an expanded
pier footprint would allow approximately 0.1 acre for use as a public pier. In addition to the rebuilt pier
discussed under Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would include a floating concrete pier at the end of the pier
(in a T-formation), which would be 8 feet wide and 50 feet long. Approximately 0.9 acres would be
redeveloped at the shoreline park under Alternative 2, including parking, restrooms, playground, picnic

area, and the pier. In-water activities would be the same as those described for the shoreline park under
Alternative 1.
With the exception of the demolition/removal of the existing pier, no further demolition activities would
occur at this property under Alternative 2.
No Action Alternative
The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur on any of the property. The No
Action alternative is evaluated in this EIS as prescribed by CEQ regulations. Navy environmental
restoration activities at Tanks Farms 1 and 2 would continue. Facilities would be maintained in
accordance with the BRAC Program Management Office (PMO) Building Vacating, Facility Layaway,
and Caretaker Maintenance Guidance (March 2007). In accordance with the BRAC PMO Building,
Vacating, Facility Layaway, and Caretaker Maintenance Guidance, only conditions adversely affecting
public health, the environment, and safety would be corrected in nonresidential areas.

ES.5 Summary of Potential Environmental Consequences

The EIS examines the potential human and natural environmental consequences of the proposed action
and any impacts associated with the reasonably foreseeable reuse of the property. Table ES-2 provides a
summary comparison of the total environmental impacts of all surplus properties. Table ES-3 provides a
comparison of the potential environmental impacts, by property, for Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the
No Action alternative.

ES.6 Public Involvement/Agency Coordination
ES6.1

Public Scoping

The first step in the NEPA process was the publication of a Notice of Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register
on October 31, 2012 (see Appendix A). The NOI formally opens the public scoping period and includes a
description of the proposed action and alternatives, locations to be affected, and how scoping comments
may be provided. Scoping is an early and open process for determining the scope of the proposed action
and the significant issues the EIS will analyze in depth. During the scoping process, the public assists the
Navy in defining and prioritizing issues through meaningful participation, including submitting written
comments. The public scoping period began on October 31, 2012 and concluded on December 2, 2012,
and included two public scoping meetings. The meetings were held on November 14 and November 15,
2012 in Middletown and Newport, Rhode Island, respectively. A public scoping notification letter was
mailed to approximately 68 federal, state, and local agencies and members of the public. Media
announcements for the public scoping period and public meetings dates and locations were published in
regional newspapers (Providence Journal, Newport Daily News, and Newport This Week), on public
radio (Rhode Island Public Broadcast Network Radio), and on local public access television (PEG
RI-TV).

members of the public on the scope of the issues to be addressed in the EIS. A total of 32 comments were
received during the scoping period.

ES6.2

Agency Consultation

Consultation letters were sent to the RIDEM Division of Planning and Development, Natural Heritage
Program; the Rhode Island CMRC; the USFWS; and the NMFS. The letters were sent to initiate a
consultation process to identify populations of federally listed and state-listed or candidate rare,
threatened, or endangered species, unique natural communities, or other significant wildlife communities
at or near the surplus property as well as to solicit guidance on applicable coastal management policies.
Consultation has also been initiated with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in accordance
with the Section 106 process as required by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
Correspondence was also sent to the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP). In addition,
government-to-government consultation has been initiated and followed up with the following federally
recognized tribes: Narragansett Indian Tribe, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of
Gay Head (Aquinnah) (see Appendix A).

Draft EIS Distribution

The Draft EIS was distributed to a variety of stakeholders, including congressional representatives,
federal agencies, state elected officials, state agencies, local representatives and agencies, federally
recognized tribes, other entities, and interested residents (see Chapter 18, Distribution List).

ES.7 Summary of Potential Cumulative Impacts
ES.7.1 Alternative 1 (Preferred Redevelopment)
Land Use, Zoning and Coastal Resources. Approximately 158 acres of federal land would be
transferred to local governments. When considered with the other nearby development and redevelopment
projects, the proposed action could have long-term changes and potential cumulative impacts on land use.
Local planning processes are in place to ensure that changes in land use associated with the proposed
development and redevelopment projects would be consistent with local land use controls and compatible
with existing surrounding land use or planned land uses. Multiple private, local government, and federal
projects would occur in the 200-foot contiguous zone of Narragansett Bay. While development and
redevelopment projects would increase the built area along the Narragansett Bay shoreline, maintaining
consistency with the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP would ensure this development occurs in
a way that maintains public access to the shoreline and avoids or mitigates impacts on coastal resources.
Transportation. Projected traffic volumes and the level of service of surrounding roadways would be
affected. Cumulative impacts on traffic from the combined proposed action and proposed projects could
be expected. However, the use of public transportation routes, maximizing visibility for motorists at
driveway locations, and improving roadways would help to address and mitigate cumulative impacts.
Environmental Management. The transfer and redevelopment of the surplus properties would be
compatible with the Navy’s ongoing Environmental Restoration (ER) Program at NAVSTA Newport.
Tank Farms 1 and 2 are ER Program sites that would be remediated under CERCLA before
redevelopment would take place. As a result, these two projects under remediation would pose beneficial
cumulative impacts resulting from site cleanup.
Air Quality. There could be potential cumulative impacts associated with an increase in construction,
building use, mobile source, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Draft EIS

ES-77

March 2016

Infrastructure and Utilities. When considered with the other nearby development and redevelopment
projects, the proposed action could have cumulative impacts on wastewater, water supplies, and other
utilities, and minor cumulative impacts on storm water. The Newport wastewater treatment facility is
currently near capacity and the majority of the Town of Portsmouth relies on on-site treatment or storage
for wastewater. Virtually any new development on Aquidneck Island would require upgrades to
infrastructure and/or capacity.
It is assumed National Grid would be able to meet the increased
electricity and natural gas demand, although some infrastructure improvements may be needed in some
areas. Cumulative impacts on construction and demolition (C&D) waste management and non-C&D
solid waste management would be anticipated. These impacts could be partially offset by recycling and
waste minimization practices. Cumulative impacts on infrastructure and utilities would be offset with the
20-year build-out period and the ability of private service providers to upgrade and expand services, as
needed.
Cultural Resources. One of the other past, present, or future actions considered for cumulative impact
analysis, the proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 as part of a separate future
undertaking, overlaps a portion of the APE for the proposed action at Tank Farms 1 and 2. Therefore,
disposal of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property out of federal ownership, considered in conjunction with the
proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1, represents a cumulative long-term negative
impact on architectural resources and a cumulative adverse effect on historic properties. This is because
the buildings and structures comprising Tank Farms 1 and 2 are considered contributing resources to the
NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District (originally called “Melville Fuel and Naval Net Depot
Historic District”). None of the other past, present, or future actions considered for cumulative impact
analysis overlap the APE for the proposed action. Therefore, there will be no potential cumulative
impacts or cumulative effects on any other cultural resources or historic properties within the APE for the
proposed action, including the U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District.
Water Resources. Cumulative impacts on water quality of the Narragansett Bay would be anticipated
but would not likely be significant. Although potential cumulative impacts on wetlands could occur, the
requirement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands under federal and state permit
programs would prevent significant cumulative impacts on wetlands. Although potential cumulative
impacts on water resources could occur, impacts would be expected to be minor.
Biological Resources.
Vegetation. When considered with other nearby development and redevelopment projects, cumulative
impacts on vegetation and habitat would be considered minor because the foreseeable projects proposed
are in previously developed areas and these habitat types occur throughout Aquidneck Island.
Wildlife. There is a potential for temporary and long-term cumulative impacts on terrestrial wildlife due to
disturbance and displacement during construction and direct habitat loss. Potential cumulative impacts on
marine mammals and fish would be minimized by avoidance and minimization measures during all
planned in-water construction projects. Temporary short-term cumulative impacts could result from
disturbance during in-water construction.
Threatened and Endangered Species. It is not anticipated that implementation of Alternatives 1 or 2
would impact the North Atlantic right, humpback, or fin whales. Similar to marine mammals and fish, inwater noise may also be audible to sea turtles within the vicinity of the project area. Impacts on sea turtles
would be temporary and result in temporary displacement during demolition, pile driving, and
construction. Impacts on the Atlantic sturgeon from operation of construction equipment, including pile
driving equipment, and resulting increased turbidity levels would not be significant. Nearby sturgeon may
be able to detect pile-driving noises which, as a result, may elicit an avoidance response to the waters

around the surplus property. Temporary short-term cumulative impacts could result from the proposed inwater construction of MILCON P469, considering the in-water work also proposed for the Navy surplus
properties. Installing the marina would result in increased boat traffic in the water, which could result in a
minor but long-term cumulative impact on threatened and endangered species due to vessel strikes.
Federally listed species. While the proposed action and other projects will permanently remove shrubland
and forested habitats, given the amount of total forest cover in the state, coupled with remaining forested
areas around Aquidneck Island, cumulative impacts on these habitats may affect, but are not likely to
adversely affect northern long-eared bats in the state.
Significant wildlife habitat. Overall cumulative impacts on EFH would be short-term and minor.

ES.7.2 Alternative 2 (High-Density Redevelopment)
Potential cumulative impacts under Alternative 2 would be similar to those described under Alternative 1
as the mix of land uses for redevelopment are similar.

ES.7.3 No Action Alternative
There would be no cumulative impact on land use, socioeconomics, community facilities, transportation,
air quality, infrastructure and utilities, or water resources under the No Action Alternative since no
redevelopment would occur.

1 Introduction

Public Law 101-510, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, as amended in 2005
(BRAC Law), has directed the Navy to realign NAVSTA Newport. As a result of this action, the
Department of the Navy (Navy) has declared approximately 158 acres of property at Naval Station
(NAVSTA) Newport, Rhode Island, to be surplus to the needs of the federal government.
This environmental impact statement (EIS) evaluates the potential human and natural environmental
consequences of the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the Navy and its subsequent
redevelopment by the respective municipalities in which the surplus property is geographically located.
This EIS was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the BRAC Law, the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended (P.L. 91-190, 42 United States Code [U.S.C.]
4321-4370f); the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing NEPA (40 Code of
Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500-1508); Navy procedures for implementing NEPA (32 CFR 775), Office
of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) Manual M-5090.1; and other applicable Department of
Defense (DOD) and Department of the Navy policies and guidance. The Navy is the lead agency for the
proposed action. There are no cooperating agencies for the preparation of this EIS.

1.1

Background

1.2

Proposed Action

1.3

Study Area Location and Description

In 2005, portions of NAVSTA Newport were designated for realignment under the authority of the
BRAC Law (discussed further in Section 1.5 below). As a result of implementation of the BRAC Law, on
January 5, 2009, certain land and facilities at NAVSTA Newport were declared excess to the needs of the
Department of the Navy and made available to other DOD components and other federal agencies. The
Navy evaluated all federal requests and made a decision on property required by the federal government.
The Navy declared approximately 225 acres of property at NAVSTA Newport as surplus to the needs of
the federal government on February 9, 2010 (75 Federal Register [FR] 6360). Subsequent to that
notification, a portion of one of the properties was determined to no longer be surplus. Therefore, for
purposes of analysis in this EIS, the acreage of the surplus property was estimated to be 158 acres, based
on property boundaries noted in existing documents and figures and changes to the area of one of the
properties deemed to be surplus. This estimate is less than the acreage stated in the Federal Register; the
exact acreage of the surplus property will be determined by a survey of the property boundary of each
surplus property, which will be performed prior to property transfer.

The proposed action is the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the Navy and subsequent
redevelopment of the surplus property by the respective municipalities in which the surplus property is
geographically located.

NAVSTA Newport is located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island in Newport County, Rhode
Island (see Figure 1-1). The surplus property of NAVSTA Newport is located in three separate
municipalities on Aquidneck Island: the City of Newport, the Town of Portsmouth, and the Town of
Middletown (see Figure 1-2). The surplus property includes the former Navy Lodge, the former Naval
Hospital, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Former Navy Lodge. The former Navy Lodge property consists of 3 acres located at the corner of
Coddington Highway and West Main Road (State Route [SR] 114) in the Town of Middletown, Rhode
Island. The Navy Lodge consisted of one building that was constructed in 1971 and demolished in 2004.
The site is currently vacant and covered with grass (see Figure 1-3). A small telephone utility shed is in

Draft EIS

the southwestern corner of the site, and a water feed vent and concrete pad are located in the northeastern
corner of the site (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). Additionally, a chlorine/water meter vent and an
associated 16-inch water main are located along the southern boundary of the site, along Coddington
Highway (see Figure 1-3).
The former Navy Lodge property is encumbered by several easements. The Landings Real Estate Group
owns an easement across the northeastern portion of the property for a water line to the apartment housing
development adjacent to the former Navy Lodge property. In addition, the Rhode Island Department of
Transportation (RIDOT) holds a “perpetual easement” along the eastern edge of the property that was
acquired in 2004 for the construction of a turning lane on West Main Road for right-hand turns onto
Coddington Highway. No easement currently exists for the small telephone utility shed or the water main
along the southern boundary of the site.
The Navy also holds an easement on property owned by the Landings Real Estate Group that provides
access from the former Navy Lodge property across the Landings Real Estate Group property to Lake
Erie Street, located on the western edge of the former Navy Lodge property, and that connects to
Coddington Highway.
Additionally, when the property transfers out of Navy ownership, the meter vent and associated water
main will be retained in an easement (15 feet on either side of the pipe centerline) by the Navy.
Former Naval Hospital. The former Naval Hospital property is located on the western shore of
Aquidneck Island, on Narragansett Bay, just southeast of Coasters Island in the City of Newport. The
Naval Hospital property is approximately 15.2 acres, consisting of 8.3 acres of land and 6.9 acres of
offshore riparian rights. The riparian rights refer to the right of access to use Narragansett Bay offshore of
the former Naval Hospital property and will not transfer with the property; the riparian rights will remain
under the control of the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) for determining future use.
The Naval Hospital provided outpatient services for naval shore activities and fleet operating forces at
NAVSTA Newport, dependents of armed service personnel, and others authorized for treatment from
1913 through 2007. Construction of the Naval Hospital began in 1913 and continued through World War
II. When the New England Naval Medical Center was built in 1993, the main building, Building 1, was
converted to administrative use. By 2007, all the buildings in the Naval Hospital parcel had been vacated.
Table 1-1 provides an overview of the six buildings and one pier located on the Naval Hospital parcel; the
structures are shown on Figure 1-4.

Building 993 houses the emergency generator, which provides backup electricity to the Naval Health
Clinic New England, the installation’s medical clinic and dental clinic. When the property transfers out
of Navy ownership, the Navy will need to retain an easement for the emergency generator and associated
electrical system to the Naval Health Clinic New England, or the emergency electrical system will need to
be modified, requiring additional funding. In addition, a fence will be constructed separating the Navyretained property from the surplused property, and a 10-foot buffer along the fenceline will be needed.
An on-site chapel (Building 62) was demolished in 2011 (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014).
Tank Farms 1 and 2. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located in the Town of Portsmouth. Tank Farm 1,
consisting of 62 acres of land, was used by the Navy from the 1940s to 1974 to store diesel oil, fuel oil,
jet fuel (JP-4, JP-5, or JP-8), gasoline, and aviation fuel. Tank Farm 2, consisting of 74 acres of land, was
also operated by the Navy from the 1940s to 1974. It was used to store fuel oil, distillate fuel, and marine
diesel fuel. In 1974, the Navy leased Tank Farms 1 and 2 and associated facilities to the Defense Energy
Support Center (DESC) to store and distribute petroleum fuel; those operations ceased in 1998. Since
ceasing the operations, the DESC has hired contractors to conduct the environmental closure of the
facility and to determine their operating permits. This action is ongoing, with the anticipated remedy in
place in the 2020 timeframe.
An existing COX Cable facility is located in the southeastern corner of Tank Farm 2. No existing
easement is associated with this facility.
Table 1-2 provides an overview of some of the key facilities at each tank farm (see Figure 1-5).

Midway Pier/Greene Lane. This approximately 10.7-acre parcel is located along the western portion of
Aquidneck Island in the Town of Middletown (see Figure 1-6). The property includes the site of former
Buildings 70, 71, and 111, as well as the former Midway Pier, located near the intersection of Defense
Highway and Greene Lane. Buildings 70, 71, and 111 were demolished before 1999, and the area where
the former buildings stood is now vacant and covered with grass and gravel (U.S. Department of the Navy
2009). The RIDOT railroad right-of-way (ROW) adjacent to the Defense Highway is not included in the
surplus property boundaries.
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is a portion of the property originally declared surplus by the
Navy in 2010, that is, the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. The Defense Highway/Stringham
Road Corridor encompassed approximately 69 acres along the western portion of Aquidneck Island. In
addition to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property described above, the original Defense
Highway/Stringham Road Corridor surplus property included 3.6 miles of Defense Highway, 1 mile of
Stringham Road, a 508-foot portion of Greene Lane, and vacant property along the roadways and near the
former Midway Pier. The portion of Defense Highway, including the ROW and the former Middletown
Transfer Station originally declared surplus, extended from a point just north of Gate 32 and the Naval
Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) on NAVSTA Newport in Middletown to the intersection of
Stringham Road in Portsmouth and included, for the most part, land on both sides of the highway.

Main Road, also was declared surplus. The southern portion of the Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor property also included a 1-acre parcel that was leased to the Town of Middletown and used as a
municipal solid waste collection and transfer station (the former Middletown Transfer Station), which was
decommissioned in 2008 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
However, because of a lack of interest in assuming ownership of the roadways (i.e., Defense Highway,
Stringham Road, and Greene Lane) by both state and municipal entities, the Navy determined these
roadways to no longer be surplus and will continue to be responsible for their maintenance. However, the
portion of the property encompassing Midway Pier as described above remains surplus as it supports the
proposed redevelopment project.

Purpose and Need

1.5

BRAC Process

The purpose of the proposed action is to comply with BRAC Law and provide for the disposal and reuse
of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport in a manner consistent with the Aquidneck Island Reuse
Planning Authority’s (AIRPA) Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport, i.e., the
Redevelopment Plan (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Any subsequent plans by the AIRPA or local
jurisdictions since the approval of the 2011 Redevelopment Plan are not considered in this EIS. The
proposed action is needed to provide the local community an opportunity for economic development and
job creation.

Base closure and realignment is the process used by the DOD to reorganize its installation infrastructure
to more efficiently and effectively support its forces, increase operational readiness, and facilitate new
ways of doing business. The BRAC process is established by the provisions of Title II of the Defense
Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act, P.L. 100-526, and the BRAC Law.

1.5.1

BRAC Commission Recommendations

Congress authorized a 2005 round of BRAC by amending the BRAC Law of 1990. The amendment
created the 2005 BRAC Commission and a timetable for the 2005 BRAC decision-making process. The
Commission conducted its analysis of DOD recommendations, held public meetings, and made
recommendations to the president for closures and realignments, including the realignment of NAVSTA
Newport. The president approved and forwarded the recommendations to Congress on September 15,
2005. The recommended closures and realignments became public law on November 9, 2005.
Seven 2005 BRAC Commission recommendations affect NAVSTA Newport. These recommendations
are as follows:
Realign NAVSTA Newport by relocating the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) to
NAVSTA Norfolk, VA.
Realign NAVSTA Newport and the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C., by consolidating
Naval Reserve Readiness Command Northeast with Naval Reserve Readiness Command Mid-Atlantic
and relocating the consolidated commands to NAVSTA Norfolk, VA.
Realign Maxwell Air Force Base, AL; Naval Air Station Meridian, MS; and NAVSTA Newport by
relocating religious training and education to Fort Jackson, SC, establishing a Joint Center of Excellence
for religious training and education.
Close the naval installation at Athens, GA. Relocate the Navy Supply Corps School and the Center for
Service Support to NAVSTA Newport. Disestablish the Supply Corps Museum.
Draft EIS

March 2016

Realign NAVSTA Pensacola, FL, by relocating Officer Training Command Pensacola, FL, to NAVSTA
Newport, and consolidating with Officer Training Command Newport, RI.
Realign Naval Air Station Patuxent River, MD, by relocating Subsurface Maritime Sensors, Electronic
Warfare, and Electronics Research, Development, and Acquisition, and Test and Evaluation of the Naval
Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, to NAVSTA Newport, RI.
Close the Bristol Army Reserve Center, Bristol, RI, the Harwood Army Reserve Center,
Providence, RI, the Warwick Army Reserve Center, and the Organizational Maintenance Shop,
Warwick, RI. Relocate all units to a new Army Reserve Center on Newport Naval Base, RI.
As a result of implementing the realignments under the BRAC Law, certain land and facilities were
declared excess to the needs of the Navy on January 5, 2009, and available to other DOD components and
other federal agencies. Following the Navy’s evaluation of all federal requests, the Navy declared
approximately 225 acres of property at NAVSTA Newport as surplus on February 9, 2010 (75 FR 6360).
(As discussed above, a portion of one of the properties was determined to no longer be surplus.
Therefore, the acreage of the surplus property is estimated to be 158 acres. The Navy is in the process of
withdrawing its determination that Defense Highway is excess property.)
Realignments of activities with other Navy installations are outside the scope of this NEPA document;
any necessary environmental analysis would be performed by the Navy entity taking on the new activity.

1.5.2

Phases of the BRAC Process

The Navy established the BRAC Program Management Office (PMO) to oversee and manage the
implementation of BRAC actions throughout the Navy. Under BRAC, the Navy acts as the disposal
agency and employs the following procedures.
Phase 1: Disposal Planning – Federal Transfer
Transfer and redevelopment planning is a multi-phase process, most of which is specified by law. For
NAVSTA Newport surplus property, Phase 1 began on November 9, 2005, when the recommendation to
realign portions of the installation became law. The first step in the planning involved offering the
property to federal agencies for reuse through a federal transfer process, which occurred in early January
2009. At the time, no other federal users indicated an interest in the surplus property.
However, in January 2014, at the request of the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the U.S. Department of the
Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), requested the BRAC properties under the federal property
transfer process. Because the request occurred subsequent to the Navy’s notice that the properties were
surplus to the needs of the federal government (75 FR 6360), as described in Section 1.1, the Navy
notified the local communities involved in preparing the Redevelopment Plan for the properties, allowing
them to comment on the request (Preston 2014). In addition, the Navy stated that as a condition of the
federal transfer, the BIA would be responsible for all present and future environmental issues, including
financial responsibility for clean-up and any potential future claims. In August 2014, the Navy made a
final decision to deny the BIA’s application for transfer of any of the surplus properties due, in part, to the
late request and because the BIA would not agree to accept liability for environmental clean-up and any
potential future claims (Ludovici 2014). There has been no response to date from the BIA following the
Navy’s decision.
Phase 2: Surplus Property Notice and Designation as Surplus
The Navy’s notice on February 9, 2010, stating that approximately 225 acres of property at NAVSTA
Newport were surplus set into motion a series of events and initiatives to plan and redevelop the property
Draft EIS

for higher and better uses. On May 25, 2010, the DOD Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA)
recognized AIRPA as the local redevelopment authority (LRA) responsible for planning and redeveloping
surplus property at NAVSTA Newport. Although later dissolved, AIRPA represented the municipalities
of Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth. AIRPA consisted of a board of directors and ex-officio
members appointed through council resolutions of each of the municipalities. The board met in public
session during regular meetings held on the first Tuesday of each month and sought input from the
community on the redevelopment of the surplus property.
After the DOD officially designated the property as surplus, AIRPA began preparing the Redevelopment
Plan. The Redevelopment Plan was officially adopted on August 8, 2011. Since the completion of the
Redevelopment Plan in 2011, AIRPA became the Aquidneck Island Reuse Implementation Authority
(AIRIA) to oversee the acquisition of the surplus property and implement the Redevelopment Plan.
However, in early 2014, the three municipalities that composed the AIRIA decided to dissolve the
organization. Each municipality would pursue acquisition of surplus property or properties and
implement the Redevelopment Plan for the property or properties within its jurisdiction, as discussed
further below under Phase 3: Property Disposal (Howington, Brown, and Klimm 2014). In some
instances, the individual municipalities are refining and/or re-evaluating their plans for the proposed reuse
of the respective property or properties within their jurisdiction.
Following adoption of the Redevelopment Plan (see Section 2 below), the Navy began the NEPA process,
in this case, the preparation of an EIS.
Phase 3: Property Disposal
Upon completion of the NEPA process, as described below, the Navy will issue its final disposal
decisions, and redevelopment will enter the implementation phase. This phase includes the Navy’s
conveyance of surplus installation property (i.e., property disposal) subject to fulfillment of any
environmental restoration and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requirements. Any future
development of property not transferred to other federal agencies would fall under the jurisdiction of the
local government(s) upon transfer and would be subject to the Redevelopment Plan. The use of land, the
reuse of existing buildings and facilities, and the development of new buildings on the surplus NAVSTA
Newport property would be regulated by the local government, its zoning ordinances, and other
applicable plans and regulations.
As indicated above, in early 2014, AIRIA was dissolved and, therefore, the Navy would dispose of
property directly to the respective municipality. Each of the surplus properties is discussed below with
respect to the mechanism of property disposal:

Draft EIS

•

Former Navy Lodge property: The Navy would transfer this property to the Town of
Middletown through a negotiated sale. A negotiated sale can be made to public bodies or
other entities and requires a payment of not less than half the fair market value.
Negotiated sales to public bodies can only be completed if a benefit, which would not be
realized from competitive sale or authorized public benefit conveyance, will result from
the negotiated sale (U.S. Department of Defense 2006)

•

Former Naval Hospital: The Navy would transfer this property to the City of Newport
through a negotiated sale, similar to that discussed above for the former Navy Lodge
property.

•

Tank Farms 1 and 2: The Navy would transfer these properties to the Town of
Portsmouth through an economic development conveyance (EDC). This type of property
transfer is made for the purpose of generating jobs (U.S. Department of Defense 2006).

1-19

March 2016

•

Midway Pier/Greene Lane: The Navy would transfer this property to the Town of
Middletown through a public benefit conveyance (PBC) due to the nature of the future
use of the property as parks and recreation.

The BRAC PMO East would continue to work with each of the three municipalities to complete the
property transfer through the methods identified above.

1.6.1

Environmental Review Process
The National Environmental Policy Act

NEPA requires the consideration of potential environmental consequences of federal actions. The CEQ
established regulations for federal agency implementation of NEPA (40 CFR 1500-1508). Under NEPA,
federal agencies must prepare an environmental assessment (EA) or an EIS for any major federal action,
except those actions that are determined to be “categorically excluded” from further analysis.
An EIS is prepared for those federal actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human
environment. Thus, if the Navy were to determine that the proposed action would have a significant
impact on the quality of the human environment, an EIS would be prepared, leading to a Record of
Decision (ROD).
An EA/EIS should include brief discussions of the purpose and need for the proposed action, the
alternatives, the affected environment, the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives,
a listing of agencies and persons consulted, and a discussion of the cumulative impacts associated with
the alternatives. The FONSI/ROD should summarize the issues presented in the accompanying EA/EIS.
The FONSI/ROD would be signed by the Navy, and a Notice of Availability would be published in local
newspapers and, for an EIS, in the Federal Register.
In this EIS, environmental impacts have been assessed individually for each surplus property for the
following reasons:

Draft EIS

•

Timeframe for redevelopment: The timeframe for redevelopment of each of the surplus
properties may differ due to several factors, most notably the completion of any
environmental restoration requirements before transfer. Addressing impacts on a
property-specific basis acknowledges this. Separating the properties provides the
resource-specific information in a more streamlined fashion that will aid in the
redevelopment review process (i.e., obtaining clearances and permits from local and
state-level authorities, etc.) because the review process is expected to occur on a
property-by-property basis. The future property owners/developers will be able to refer to
two specific chapters rather than having to parse out the information if the properties
were to be addressed collectively throughout the EIS.

•

Geographic location of properties: The surplus property is located in three different
municipalities. Therefore, providing a more user-friendly document, organized by
property, allows the various stakeholders, specifically municipal leaders, to focus on the
property of interest to them and to review and comment more easily on the information
presented herein. Additionally, as discussed above, one municipality may move forward
with redevelopment faster than others; thus, the property-specific EIS format will
facilitate the identification of property-specific information needed for permit
applications and other documentation.

1.6.2

Scoping and Public Involvement

1.6.2.1
Public Notification and Scoping
The first step in the NEPA process was the publication of a Notice of Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register
on October 31, 2012. The NOI formally opens the public scoping period and includes a description of the
proposed action and alternatives, locations to be affected, and how scoping comments may be provided.
Scoping is an early and open process for determining the scope of the proposed action and the significant
issues the EIS will analyze in depth. During the scoping process, the public assists the Navy in defining
and prioritizing issues through meaningful participation, including the submission of written comments.
The public scoping period began on October 31, 2012, and concluded on December 2, 2012, and included
public scoping meetings. A public scoping notification letter was mailed to approximately 68 federal,
state, and local agencies and members of the public. Media announcements for the public scoping period
and public meetings dates and locations were published in regional newspapers (Providence Journal,
Newport Daily News, and Newport This Week), on public radio (i.e., the Rhode Island Public Broadcast
Network Radio), and on local public access television (PEG RI-TV). A newspaper display notice was
published in the above-noted newspapers on the following dates:
•

Newport Daily News: November 2, 11, 12, and 13, 2012

•

Providence Journal: November 2, 11, 12, and 13, 2012

•

Newport This Week: Week of November 8-14, 2012.

During the public scoping period, comments were invited from federal, state, and local agencies and
members of the public on the scope of issues to be addressed in this EIS.
The public scoping meetings held for this EIS were conducted in an open house format. The scoping
meetings were used to inform the public about the EIS process, enable community members to ask
questions, and solicit written comments regarding issues to be addressed in the EIS. The meetings
featured displays, fact sheets, and interaction between Navy staff and the public. The meetings were
scheduled as follows:
•

Wednesday, November 14, 2012 (4 p.m. to 8 p.m.), Joseph H. Gaudet Middle School
Cafeteria, 1113 Aquidneck Avenue, Middletown, RI

•

Thursday, November 15, 2012 (1 p.m. to 5 p.m.), Newport Public Library Program
Room, 300 Spring Street, Newport, RI.

Agency Coordination and Permit Requirements

NEPA requires that federal agencies responsible for preparing NEPA analyses and documentation do so
“in cooperation with State and local governments” and other agencies with jurisdiction by law or special
expertise (42 U.S.C. §§ 4331(a) and 4332(2)). The Navy worked closely with the community, local and
state agencies, and other federal agencies during the preparation of this EIS.
Consultation letters were sent to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM)
Division of Planning and Development, Natural Heritage Program; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS); and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The letters were sent to USFWS and
NMFS to request information on populations of federally listed and state-listed or candidate rare,
threatened, or endangered species, unique natural communities, or other significant wildlife communities
at or near the surplus property. The Navy is continuing to coordinate with the USFWS on the potential
effects of the proposed action on protected species. The Navy has concluded an informal consultation
process with NMFS in regards to the ESA, as outlined in Table 1-4. The Navy provided a Coastal
Consistency Determination to the CRMC and has received concurrence on the consistency of the
proposed action with enforceable coastal management policies (Table 1-4) (Willis 2014). Consultation
has been initiated with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in accordance with the Section 106
process as required by the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Correspondence was also sent to
the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP). Government-to-government consultation has
been initiated with the federally recognized Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe,
and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah). Copies of the letters sent to these tribes to initiate
and follow up on government-to-government consultation are provided in Appendix A. In addition, a
copy of this EIS was filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Copies of
correspondence between the Navy and federal and state agencies are included in Appendix A.
Table 1-4 summarizes the applicable regulatory requirements and approvals. Consistency with other
federal, state, and local plans, policies, and regulations is further described in Section 15 (Other
Considerations Required by NEPA) of this EIS.

1.7

2 Proposed Action and Alternatives

This section provides a detailed description of the proposed action and alternatives. This EIS evaluates
two action alternatives for reuse of the surplus property and the No Action alternative. The preferred
reuse alternative (Alternative 1) is use of the surplus property consistent with AIRPA’s Redevelopment
Plan. Alternative 2 is redevelopment of the property at a higher density with a larger footprint and a
different mix of land uses.
In accordance with NEPA regulations, the EIS also addresses a No Action alternative. The No Action
alternative is the retention of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S. government in caretaker
status. Under this scenario, no reuse or redevelopment would occur at the surplus property.

2.1

Establishment of the Redevelopment Plan

On May 25, 2010, AIRPA was recognized as the LRA responsible for developing a redevelopment plan
for the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport (75 FR 29322). The Redevelopment Plan took into
account previously completed or ongoing planning efforts and the goals and objectives that those plans
had outlined for the use of the surplus property; the existing condition of the surplus property and the
region; other properties available for redevelopment; the needs of the homeless; local zoning;
infrastructure needs and availability; and public participation. The framework for the Redevelopment Plan
was largely built on previously completed plans, namely, the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan
(The Cecil Group et al. 2005), the draft Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan (Town of
Portsmouth 2008b), and the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan (Vanasse Hangen
Brustlin Inc. and RKG Associates 2011).
AIRPA established redevelopment goals for each property, as summarized below:

2.1.1

•

Former Navy Lodge Property: Return to the town’s tax roll; economic development.

•

Former Naval Hospital Property: Economic development with public use along the
waterfront.

•

Tank Farms 1 and 2: Economic development with public uses that connect to the open
spaces currently to the north, east, and west.

•

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property: Public use.

Public and Agency Outreach

After identifying the redevelopment goals that were accepted by the public, AIRPA evaluated the
environmental conditions of each property, existing infrastructure, transportation networks, housing and
commercial markets, and local and regional demographics. Restrictions needed to protect human health
and the environment also were identified.
Outreach to local providers of services for the homeless was part of AIRPA’s property screening. A list of
area homeless service providers was obtained from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). This list included five local homeless assistance providers and other agencies that
support the homeless. Each of these entities was contacted. Additionally, A Notice of Availability of
Surplus Federal Property to State and Local Eligible Parties, Including Homeless Service Providers was
published by AIRPA on June 22, 2010, in the Newport Daily News, and informational meetings were held
on July 23 and July 26, 2010. Two additional notices were published in the Newport Daily News within a
week of the public informational meetings. No Notices of Interest were received from homeless
assistance providers (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin Inc. and RKG Associates 2011). The Homeless Assistance

Draft EIS

March 2016

Application was submitted to HUD in August 2011, and HUD approval of the Redevelopment Plan was
received on August 31, 2011 (Johnston 2011).
AIRPA accepted Notices of Interest for requests for PBCs of the available parcels. Through the PBC
process, surplus military property may be conveyed to public agencies and not-for-profit organizations to
provide public goods and services. Four viable PBC requests were received by AIRPA and have been
incorporated into the reuse scenarios. These are summarized below (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011):

2.1.2

•

City of Newport: Request for recreation/open space use at the former Naval Hospital
property.

•

Town of Middletown: Request for recreation/open space use along the Defense Highway
(e.g., Midway Pier area).

•

Town of Portsmouth: Request for transportation use on a portion of Tank Farm 1.

•

Rhode Island Department of Transportation: A request for transportation use along the
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor that was previously designated as surplus
and has since been withdrawn.

Public Participation during the Planning Process

To engage the public in reuse planning, AIRPA held a series of public events over a two-year period from
July 2010 through July 2011. In February 2011, AIRPA held a public meeting to introduce the planning
team and the planning process to the public. The redevelopment goals for each property were presented
to the public at a meeting on July 14, 2011.
AIRPA held three public-participation workshops and also addressed the planning process during the
regular monthly board meetings at the town of Middletown police station, which were open to the public.
Additional public outreach efforts included a public website, press releases, and newspaper inserts.

2.1.3

Redevelopment Plan Selection

A preferred reuse plan was presented during AIRPA public meetings and public meetings with each
municipality. On July 14, 2011, AIRPA held a public hearing to decide on a preferred reuse scenario.
After presentation of the alternatives, AIRPA selected a development alternative for each site, referred to
as the Preferred Reuse Plan. The Preferred Reuse Plan targets the specific types of development on each
site based on each site’s physical and environmental setting and location.
Former Navy Lodge Property. Two scenarios were developed by AIRPA for the former Navy Lodge
property. Scenarios 1 and 2 were both mixed use development alternatives with retail. Scenario 2
included a larger mix of uses with the addition of residential use and transportation improvements at the
adjacent West Main/Coddington and West Main/East Main intersections. Scenario 1 was selected by
AIRPA through a public hearing as the preferred reuse plan for this site.
Former Naval Hospital Property. Four scenarios were developed by AIRPA for the former Naval
Hospital property. Scenarios 1 and 2 were mixed-use alternatives that included a hotel and commercial
and waterfront park uses. Scenario 2 also included residential uses (a total of 36 units) as part of the
mixed-use alternative. Scenario 3 included residential uses (a total of 90 units) and a waterfront park
only, and Scenario 4 included a research/office use and a waterfront park. Scenario 2 was selected by
AIRPA through a public hearing as the preferred reuse plan for this site.
Tank Farms 1 and 2. AIRPA considered using the tanks at Tank Farms 1 and 2 to store solid or liquid
materials. However, reusing the tank farms was not deemed feasible because the tanks are no longer in
Draft EIS

2-2

March 2016

serviceable condition. Therefore, AIRPA determined that Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped as a
combination of office, light industrial, and boat storage space and multimodal parking.
Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. Two scenarios were developed by AIRPA as part of the
ongoing Aquidneck Island Transportation Study for the previously designated Defense
Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. (Note: As stated in Section 1.5.1, the Navy is in the process of
withdrawing its determination that Defense Highway is excess property. Therefore, only the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane portion of the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor originally identified for
redevelopment is considered to be surplus property in this EIS.) A subset of Scenario 1 is the preferred
reuse plan—a two-lane roadway with the addition of a multi-use pathway and open-space ribbons.
Scenario 2 was a four-lane roadway with the same multi-purpose path. Because of roadway width
constraints, the road portion of the Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor cannot be widened to
allow additional lanes. Therefore, Scenario 1 was selected by AIRPA through a public hearing as the
preferred reuse plan for this site.

2.2

Identification of Alternatives

To assess the potential impacts of the proposed action, the Navy identified and evaluated two property
disposal and reuse alternatives—Alternative 1 (Redevelopment Plan), Alternative 2 (High-Density
Development)—and the No Action alternative. Alternative 1, the preferred alternative, is the reuse of the
property in accordance with the Redevelopment Plan, as adopted by AIRPA. The shoreline park concept
and applicable portions of the open space identified in the Redevelopment Plan have been incorporated
into Alternative 1 under the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The Navy developed Alternative 2 to
identify potential impacts if a higher density and larger footprint with a different mix of development
were to occur at the sites. Alternative 2 includes more commercial uses, including office and retail, as
well as industrial development. It was not chosen as the preferred reuse of the surplus property by
AIRPA; however, it serves as an appropriate alternative for consideration and comparison for this
analysis. The No Action alternative is required by statute and establishes a baseline by which to compare
and identify the potential environmental consequences of redevelopment of the surplus property at
NAVSTA Newport. The No Action alternative is evaluated in detail in this EIS as prescribed by CEQ
regulations.
Both build alternatives, Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, are assumed to be implemented over a 20-year
period, but the timeframe for redevelopment of the separate properties may differ due to factors such as
the completion of environmental restoration requirements before transfer (see Section 3.5.1.4), economic
drivers for development, and the ability of future developers to obtain financing and requisite permits.

2.2.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

Alternative 1 includes the disposal of surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the Navy and its reuse in
accordance with the Redevelopment Plan. This alternative has been identified as the preferred alternative
by the Navy. Full build-out is proposed to be implemented over a 20-year period but may differ for each
of the properties. The Redevelopment Plan includes a mix of land use types and densities for each surplus
property as well as open space and natural areas. The Redevelopment Plan emphasizes the importance of
best management practices (BMPs) to enhance storm water quality for the redeveloped areas.
Estimates included in the Redevelopment Plan indicate that implementing the plan at full build-out could
result directly in the addition of up to 980 new jobs in the regional economy. The total projected cost
associated with preparation of the sites for development (including building demolition at the Naval
Hospital property and Tank Farms 1 and 2), upgrading utilities and infrastructure, building construction,
etc., are estimated to be approximately $116.8 million.

Draft EIS

2-3

March 2016

Figures 2-1 through 2-4 illustrate the Redevelopment Plan at full build-out at each surplus property. A
detailed description of the Redevelopment Plan for each surplus property is provided below, and a
summary of the redevelopment under Alternative 1 is included in Section 2.5 (Table 2-1).
Former Navy Lodge Property. The 3-acre former Navy Lodge property is proposed for redevelopment
as retail space 3. The site is currently vacant, except for a small telephone utility shed and a water feed
vent and concrete pad, so no demolition is proposed. Two buildings are proposed, each one-story, on a
total of approximately 0.7 acres. Retail use would total approximately 30,500 square feet. These
structures are proposed on the northeast and southeast corners of the site, with approximately 0.8 acres (or
approximately 145 spaces) of parking adjacent to the buildings (see Figure 2-1). In addition, 0.3 acres
would be used to access the site from Coddington Highway. A total of 1.8 acres, or 60 percent, of the 3acre site would be redeveloped; approximately 1.2 acres would be maintained as open space.
The former Navy Lodge property is encumbered by several easements, which will transfer with the
property. The Landings Real Estate Group owns an easement across the northeastern portion of the
property for a water line to the apartment housing development adjacent to the former Navy Lodge
property. In addition, the RIDOT holds a “perpetual easement” along the eastern edge of the property
that was acquired in 2004 for the construction of a turning lane on West Main Road for right-hand turns
onto Coddington Highway. No easement currently exists for the small telephone utility shed.
The Navy also holds an easement on property owned by the Landings Real Estate Group that provides
access from the former Navy Lodge property to Lake Erie Street, located on the western edge of the
former Navy Lodge property and that connects to Coddington Highway. Upon transfer of the former
Navy Lodge property, this easement would pass to the new owners. Additionally, the Navy would retain
an easement on the property to allow for continued use of a water line that provides service to NAVSTA
Newport.
The site would be accessed from Coddington Highway; Lake Erie Street may also serve as an additional
access/egress point for the site.
Former Naval Hospital Property. Proposed redevelopment at the approximately 15.2-acre former Naval
Hospital property includes a three-story hotel (120 rooms) with additional space on the first floor for retail
and a restaurant comprising approximately 1.3 acres and parking at the northeast corner of the site; a
three-story 36-unit residential building with a ground-level footprint of approximately 0.60 acres over atgrade parking in the southeast corner of the site; and a waterfront park of approximately 2.4 acres that
would include a pier, pedestrian path, water taxi dockage, and boat storage facility (see Figure 2-2). The
residential building would contain 36 two-bedroom units. Parking and access throughout the site would
total 2.2 acres of developed land under Alternative 1, including the existing road (Riggs Road) that bisects
the site. Approximately 54 percent of the overall site (inclusive of land-based and pier development)
would be developed under Alternative 1. The redeveloped site would be accessed from Third Street,
similar to current conditions. Cypress Street may also serve as an additional access/egress point for the
site. (Note: Three gates previously provided access to the former Naval Hospital when it was in use, one
of which was former Gate 1 located on Cypress Street.)

3

The former Navy Lodge property is proposed to be part of the Town of Middletown’s West Main/Coddington
Development Center, a large mixed use development totaling approximately 14 acres. The development center
would consist of four parcels: the former Navy Lodge, the town’s recreation complex, Middletown Public
Library, and the former JFK Elementary School (see Sections 4.1.3 and 13.2.3.1).

The waterfront park would include a boat storage facility of approximately 1,300 square feet4 constructed
in the footprint of the former chapel. The existing pier would be re-used, with the addition of two concrete
floating docks on each side. Each floating dock would be 8 feet by 90 feet. 5 These floating docks would
be supported by pontoons and anchored in place with pilings and cables. It is assumed that the pilings
would be square, pre-stressed concrete piles measuring 1 foot by 1 foot, which would be constructed offsite. Pile installation would be completed using an impact hammer on a barge and a crane. To construct
the floating docks, various construction vessels would be necessary, including barges, tugs, and floating
cranes.
Under Alternative 1, all six existing buildings listed in Table 1-1 would be demolished. The existing pier
would remain, as described above.
The 6.9 acres of offshore riparian rights of the former Naval Hospital property will not transfer with the
property. The riparian rights will remain under the control of the CRMC for determining future use.
Tank Farms 1 and 2. Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped as a combined approximately 136-acre
site with office, light industrial and boat storage space; multi-modal parking uses; and the potential for a
solar array (see Figure 2-3). The plan for the tank farms includes a multi-modal parking facility with 400
parking spaces (a total of 4 acres) on the west side of the site, adjacent to the railroad; 45,000 square feet
(approximately 1 acre) of light industrial or boat storage, also along the railroad; 145,000 square feet of
light industrial, with 55,000 square feet (approximately 1.3 acres) along the rail line and 90,000 square
feet (approximately 2.1 acres) off of Bradford Avenue; and 110,000 square feet (approximately 2.5 acres)
of office space at the south end of the site (south end of Tank Farm 2).
The solar array would comprise approximately 155,000 square feet (approximately 3.6 acres) and would
be located near the center of Tank Farm 2. Parking and access roads would comprise approximately 20.6
acres of newly redeveloped area (total takes into account the 4 acres of multi-modal parking). A total of
31.1 acres, or 23 percent, of the 136-acre site would be redeveloped; 104.9 acres (77 percent) would
remain as open space. Access to the redeveloped site would be from new access points along Stringham
Road and Bradford Avenue.
The proposed redevelopment at the tank farms is based on a 300-foot setback from the existing tank
locations, as specified in the Redevelopment Plan (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
Under a separate project (unrelated to this EIS), the Navy plans to demolish the underground storage
tanks (USTs) and associated facilities at Tank Farm 1. This project is scheduled to be completed in 2016
and before transfer of the property. The Navy similarly intends to demolish the USTs and associated
facilities at Tank Farm 2, although the schedule for this demolition has not been established. Therefore,
for the purposes of the analysis in this EIS, the USTs and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2 are assumed
to be transferred in place as part of the property transfer for this proposed action.
Midway Pier/Greene Lane. Recreational/open space use is proposed at this property. A shoreline park
would include a fishing pier, kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, a 0.3-acre parking lot, picnic areas,
4

These dimensions were not specified in the Redevelopment Plan. For purposes of the EIS analysis, dimensions
were assumed to be similar to those of the existing Providence Community Boating Center, a shore-based
structure.
These dimensions were not specified in the Redevelopment Plan. For purposes of the EIS analysis, dimensions
were assumed to be similar to those provided in plans for the Ann Street Pier provided in a Notice to Bidders for
the Ann Street Pier Design-Build Project, as issued by the City of Newport. The Ann Street Pier is located
approximately 1.2 miles south of the former Naval Hospital, along Narragansett Bay.

Draft EIS

and pathways (see Figure 2-4). The restrooms, playground, and picnic area would comprise 0.09 acres.
The existing pier would be rebuilt to be a 15-foot-wide, 250-foot-long concrete pier. Access to the
proposed park would be provided directly from Defense Highway. In addition to the shoreline park, a
multi-use pathway would be constructed in a greenbelt on the opposite side of the railroad tracks, next to
the water. The pathway would be 12 feet wide and would be surfaced with bituminous concrete. In areas
constrained by topography or other factors, the width may be reduced to 10 feet.3
In-water activities would include removing the existing pier, which is assumed to include dredging with a
clamshell bucket or similar equipment, and excavation of the existing pier. Piles that formerly supported
the pier have been previously removed. Pile driving to construct the new pier and construction vessels as
described above (see Former Naval Hospital section above) would also be necessary.
With the exception of the demolition/removal of the existing pier, no further demolition activities would
occur at this property under Alternative 1.

2.2.2

Alternative 2 (High-Density Redevelopment)

Alternative 2 also provides for the disposal and redevelopment of the surplus property at NAVSTA
Newport, but at a higher density and with a larger footprint and different mix of uses than Alternative 1.
As with Alternative 1, the existing facilities at the surplus property would be demolished. This alternative
also proposes a mix of land uses, including commercial, industrial, and active and passive recreation
space. Full build-out would be implemented over a 20-year period, but may differ for each of the
properties. Specific redevelopment details for each surplus property are discussed below. Figures 2-5
through 2-8 illustrate the proposed redevelopment at each property.
Former Navy Lodge Property. Proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property (the 3-acre
Navy-owned parcel only) would be as described under Alternative 1 but with the following modifications.
Under Alternative 1, the two retail buildings are single story, and under Alternative 2, the two retail
buildings would be two stories. Under both alternatives, the retail buildings would have the same
footprint (0.70 acres) (see Figure 2-5); however, under Alternative 2, the retail buildings would have a
total of 61,000 square feet of retail space compared with 30,500 square feet of retail space under
Alternative 1. To accommodate the increase in retail space, additional parking space is proposed under
Alternative 2. A total of 1.4 acres of parking/access would be developed under Alternative 2, resulting in
redevelopment of a total of approximately 2.1 acres, or 70 percent, of the overall site. No demolition
would occur before redevelopment, and access would be from Coddington Highway, similar to
Alternative 1. The transfer of and retention of easements on the former Navy Lodge property, as
discussed above under Alternative 1, would also occur under Alternative 2. Access would also be as
discussed above under Alternative 1.
Former Naval Hospital Property. Redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would be as
described under Alternative 1 but with the following modifications. The residential use proposed under
Alternative 1 would be replaced by commercial use, and a conference center would be added to the
proposed hotel. The commercial use would have the same footprint as the residential use under
Alternative 1 (0.6 acres). The 0.2-acre conference center would be developed behind the hotel, along
Third Street (see Figure 2-6). Under Alternative 2, the shore-based boat storage facility and two concrete
floating docks associated with the waterfront park would be developed as described for Alternative 1.
However, under Alternative 2, an additional concrete floating dock measuring approximately 8 feet wide
by 70 feet long would be constructed at the end of the existing pier with concrete mooring piles (assumed
here to be the same as described under Alternative 1). A yacht club/office would also be constructed next
to the boat storage facility within the footprint of the former chapel.

In-water construction activities would involve the use of pile-driving equipment and various construction
vessels, as described above under Alternative 1.
At 4.8 acres (58 percent), the development footprint is slightly larger than under Alternative 1. The
intensity of use also is higher under Alternative 2.
Lastly, similar to Alternative 1, the current buildings would be demolished to facilitate redevelopment of
the site. Access to the redeveloped property would be via Third Street, with the potential use of Cypress
Street.
Tank Farms 1 and 2. Under Alternative 2, Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped with the same mix
of uses as under Alternative 1. However, under Alternative 2, the amount of office space would increase
by 25 percent, from 110,000 square feet (approximately 2.5 acres) to 137,600 square feet (approximately
3.2 acres), and light industrial uses along the rail line would increase by 25 percent, from 55,000 square
feet (approximately 1.3 acres) under Alternative 1, to 68,750 square feet (approximately 1.6 acres) for a
total of 205,000 square feet (see Figure 2-7). The other two areas of industrial development are the same
as described under Alternative 1: 2.1 acres of light industrial off of Bradford Avenue and 1.0 acre of boat
storage, totaling 4.7 acres of industrial uses under Alternative 2. Parking/access would be increased to
approximately 22.5 acres; that acreage, coupled with the office, industrial, solar array, and boat storage
uses, would total 34 acres, or 25 percent of the overall site under Alternative 2. Lastly, similar to
Alternative 1, the USTs and associated piping would be demolished at Tank Farm 1 before transfer and
redevelopment through a separate and unrelated project. However, specific to Tank Farm 2, due to the
preliminary nature of the proposed removal project, for the purposes of analysis in the EIS, the USTs and
underground piping have been assumed to remain in place
Midway Pier/Greene Lane. Similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 includes the same multi-use pathway
in a greenbelt on the opposite side of the railroad tracks, next to the water. Alternative 2 would include
greater expansion of the former Midway Pier, including two areas of cut-and-fill for parking totaling 0.6
acres in addition to the recreation/open space use that is proposed and the shoreline park described under
Alternative 1 (see Figure 2-8). Under Alternative 2, the playground would be increased to 0.1 acre and an
expanded pier footprint would allow approximately 0.1 acre for use as a public pier. In addition to the
rebuilt pier discussed under Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would include a floating concrete pier at the end
of the pier (in a T-formation), which would be 8 feet wide and 50 feet long. Approximately 0.9 acres
would be redeveloped at the shoreline park under Alternative 2, including parking, restrooms,
playground, picnic area, and the pier.
In-water activities would be the same as those described for the shoreline park under Alternative 1.
With the exception of the demolition/removal of the existing pier, no further demolition activities would
occur at this property under Alternative 2.

2.3.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur on any part of the property.
Navy environmental restoration activities at Tank Farms 1 and 2 would continue. Facilities would be
maintained in accordance with the BRAC Program Management Office (PMO) Building Vacating,
Facility Layaway, and Caretaker Maintenance Guidance (March 2007). In accordance with the BRAC
PMO Building, Vacating, Facility Layaway and Caretaker Maintenance Guidance, only conditions
adversely affecting public health, the environment, and safety would be corrected in non-residential areas.

Draft EIS

2-19

March 2016

The Navy would continue to incur costs to maintain these facilities, which no longer support the mission
of NAVSTA Newport.
The No Action alternative, if implemented, would not satisfy the purpose of or need for action and would
not provide the local community with an opportunity for economic development or tax generation.
Although the No Action alternative would not meet the purpose of or need for the proposed action, it is
evaluated as required by CEQ regulations (40 CFR Section 1502.14(d)) implementing NEPA. For the
purposes of this EIS, the No Action alternative provides an environmental baseline against which the
environmental consequences of the other alternatives can be measured.

2.3

Alternatives Considered and Not Further Evaluated

2.4

Comparison of Alternatives

Alternatives that were considered but excluded from further analysis included reusing the property in a
single land use rather than mixed use, such as only open space, residential, or industrial. These
alternatives did not meet the goals of the AIRPA and were not considered reasonably foreseeable reuses
of the property. Additionally, an alternative that would consider the disposal and redevelopment of each
site in multiple phases was not considered due to the small size of the surplus properties.

Table 2-1 provides a comparison of land uses upon full build-out for the surplus property proposed under
Alternatives 1 and 2 and analyzed in the EIS.
Table 2-2 provides a summary comparison by land use of all surplus properties at build-out.
Table 2-3 provides a summary comparison of the total impacts of all surplus properties. The No Action
alternative is considered the environmentally preferred alternative, as it results in the least amount of
impacts on the environment. However, the No Action alternative does not meet the purpose and need of
the proposed action. Alternative 1 does meet the purpose and need of the proposed action and is
consistent with the Redevelopment Plan, and is therefore the preferred alternative.
Table 2-4 provides a comparison of the impacts, by property, of the two action alternatives and the No
Action alternative.

3 Background Information and Methodology for Resource Area
Assessments

The following section provides background information, including the regulatory context, about the
resources on the surplus properties at NAVSTA Newport that have been evaluated in this EIS. The
methodology used by the Navy to assess the existing environment and evaluate potential impacts on
resources at all surplus properties under all alternatives also is described. This background information is
common to all of the surplus properties and is presented here to reduce the redundancy of repeating the
information for each surplus property.

3.1
3.1.1

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

3.1.1.1
Land Use and Zoning
“Land use” generally refers to how land is used within a defined area, whether describing existing
conditions, future planning and development, or need for governing regulations or special protection.
Land use is usually described in broad terms that relate the use to human activities, such as the use of
residential, industrial, commercial, institutional, recreational, and open space. Land use planning and
regulation is the responsibility of the jurisdictions that govern or own the land or resources on the land
such as towns, cities, counties, state or federal agencies, and often with public involvement. Coastal
resources are a special land use feature that has a specific governing framework (see Section 3.1.1.2).
The Rhode Island Comprehensive Planning and Land Use Regulation Act of 1988 (General Laws of
Rhode Island [G.L.] Chapter 45-22.2) requires each municipality in the state to establish a comprehensive
land use planning program and produce and implement a comprehensive plan according to the standards
laid out in the act. Comprehensive plans normally are produced by municipal staff with input from
interested members of the public; reviewed and recommended by the city or town’s planning board; then
adopted by the city or town council. A comprehensive plan contains the goals, objectives, and policies
for land use planning in each municipality.
Municipalities may develop area master plans as part of their comprehensive planning program. Area
master plans are similar to comprehensive plans in that they contain goals, objectives, and policies for
land use planning. However, area master plans generally consider a smaller area or single property that is
the focus of a concentrated development or redevelopment effort. Area master plans also may be used to
coordinate the joint planning efforts of two or several partnering municipalities.
Zoning is the primary land use control used by most towns and cities to guide development on municipal
and privately owned land. Rhode Island G.L. Chapter 45-24 enables all cities and towns in the state to
develop zoning ordinances to regulate in an orderly way the “type, intensity, and arrangement of land
uses” within their boundaries (G.L. Chapter 45-24-29). The state requires each town and city to amend its
zoning ordinance to be consistent with its comprehensive plan (G.L. Chapter 45-24-29). While the
policies included in a town or city’s comprehensive plan take the form of recommendations, the
regulations included in a municipal zoning ordinance are requirements that developers must satisfy.
3.1.1.2
Coastal Zone Management
Congress passed the federal Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) in 1972 to encourage the
appropriate development and protection of the nation’s coastal and shoreline resources (16 U.S.C. 33
§§ 1451-1465). The CZMA gives states the primary role in managing these areas. To assume this role,

Draft EIS

3-1

March 2016

each state develops a coastal zone management plan that describes the state’s coastal resources and how
these resources are to be managed. The CZMA applies to lands within the coastal zone; however, the
CZMA excludes “lands the use of which is by law subject solely to the discretion of or which is held in
trust by the Federal Government, its officers or agents” (16 U.S.C. §1453). Although federal lands are
excluded from direct application of the CZMA, a consistency determination for these federal properties is
conducted to determine if project-related impacts on the neighboring properties would be consistent under
CZMA regulations. Section 307 of the CZMA stipulates that when a federal project initiates reasonably
foreseeable impacts on any coastal resource or use (land or water use or natural resource), that action
must be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of the affected state’s
federally approved coastal zone management plan. Federal agencies must also consider management
program provisions that are in the nature of recommendations.
The State of Rhode Island has developed and implemented a federally approved Coastal Resources
Management Program (CRMP) describing current coastal legislation and enforceable policies. This
program was approved by the federal Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) in
1978. The policies of the Rhode Island CRMP emphasize “preservation and restoration of ecological
systems” within the state’s coastal zone to provide for the state’s social and economic welfare (Coastal
Resources Management Council 2010, 2012). The Rhode Island CRMP is managed by the Rhode Island
Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC), a state agency administrated by a council composed of
appointed state and local government and public representatives. The CRMC creates policies and plans
and adopts regulations to implement the Rhode Island CRMP.
Direct federal actions in Rhode Island are subject to federal consistency requirements if those actions
affect any coastal use or resource. Federal agencies undertaking such actions must show that the
proposed action would be “conducted in a manner that is consistent with the enforceable policies of the
[Rhode Island CRMP],” as well as any applicable special area management plans (SAMPs) (Coastal
Resources Management Council n.d.).
Under the Rhode Island CRMP, any alteration or activity proposed within tidal waters, shoreline features,
and contiguous areas 6 is regulated and a Council Assent is required. Rhode Island tidal waters have been
assigned to one of six use categories:
Type 1–Conservation Areas
Type 2–Low-Intensity Use
Type 3–High-Intensity Boating
Type 4–Multipurpose Waters
Type 5–Commercial and Recreational Harbors
Type 6–Industrial Waterfronts and Commercial Navigation Channels
Shoreline features also have been assigned to the following categories:

6

•

Coastal beaches and dunes

•

Barrier beaches

•

Coastal wetlands

•

Coastal cliffs, bluffs, and banks

The contiguous area is defined as 200 feet landward of a shoreline feature.

Draft EIS

Rocky shores

•

Man-made shorelines.

All four of the surplus properties analyzed in this EIS are under the review authority of the CRMC
because they are all located within coastal communities. The former Naval Hospital and the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane properties are located in Rhode Island’s coastal zone, in the 200-foot contiguous area of
Narragansett Bay, which is categorized as a Type 4 Water: Multipurpose Waters.
All four surplus properties are located in the Aquidneck Island SAMP area. The CRMC developed a
SAMP for the western side of Aquidneck Island and adjacent waters to protect the ecological, economic,
and cultural values of this area (Coastal Resources Management Council 2009). Reuse and
redevelopment of the surplus properties must also be consistent with applicable SAMP policies, which
include setback and vegetation requirements, storm water management requirements, open space and
public access provisions, and requirements for protecting scenic areas (Coastal Resources Management
Council 2009).

3.1.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

The discussion of land use in the existing environment includes a description of the existing land use at
each of the surplus properties, a description of surrounding land use, a description of the comprehensive
plans, master plans, and zoning that apply to the surplus properties and surrounding areas and a
description of the applicable enforceable policies under the Rhode Island CRMP and the Aquidneck
Island SAMP.
The study area for the land use analysis has been defined as an approximate 0.25-mile radius around each
of the surplus properties. For consistency, all existing land use was derived from spatial data provided by
the Aquidneck Island Planning Commission (2013).
Land use plans and policies applicable to the description of the existing environment include NAVSTA
Newport planning documents, local comprehensive plans, zoning ordinances, the Rhode Island CRMP
guidance document, and the Aquidneck Island SAMP.

3.1.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

The impacts of the alternatives on land use were assessed in terms of consistency with adjacent existing
land uses, planned future land uses, local and state land use plans, and local zoning regulations. Potential
impacts on adjacent existing land uses were determined primarily by comparing local zoning regulations
with the proposed redevelopment or reuse presented under each alternative. The type of land use, the
intensity, and potential dimensions proposed under each alternative were considered. Proposed land uses
are considered consistent with applicable land use plans and zoning ordinances if they conform to or
promote the goals, policies, or requirements outlined in the land use controls. Proposed land uses are
considered inconsistent if they would not conform to or would be prohibited by these goals, policies, or
requirements. The impacts of the alternatives on Rhode Island’s coastal zone and coastal uses or
resources were assessed in terms of consistency with the enforceable policies of Rhode Island’s CRMP
and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. Consultation with CRMC during the scoping phase of the EIS solicited
guidance on applicable coastal management policies for analysis; this guidance was used to frame the
analysis of the proposed action’s consistency with the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. The
Navy has received concurrence from the Rhode Island CRMC on its coastal consistency determination
(CCD)(Willis 2014). A copy of the letter is included in Appendix B.

3.2.1

Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Socioeconomics are defined as the demographic and economic characteristics of a defined geographic
area such as a town, city, county, or state. Included in the resource analysis are population; economy,
employment and income; housing and commercial property; taxes and revenue. These are described
below.
•

Population: Number of persons within a defined geographic area from the U.S. Census
Bureau Decennial Census of Population and Housing (Years 1990, 2000, and 2010). In
addition, the 2009-2013 American Community Survey shows the most recent estimated
population.

•

Economy, employment, and income: Employment by industry sector from the U.S.
Census Bureau; annual labor force and unemployment statistics from the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics; and median household and per capita income data from the U.S. Census
Bureau 2009-2013 American Community Survey.
Employment by industry sector refers to the way employment is distributed to companies
producing similar products or providing similar services. Labor force is defined as the
number of persons currently employed or actively searching for work within an area.
Median household income is the total income a household receives from all sources
where 50 percent of an area’s households receive more total income and where 50
percent of an area’s households receive less total income. Per capita income is a measure
of the total income from all sources for all residents divided by the total number of
residents in an area.

•

Housing and commercial property: Number and characteristics of housing units within a
defined geographic area as recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau 2010 Census of
Population and Housing, the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, and local
resources, where available.

•

Taxes and revenue: Included in the resource analysis are property taxes by class of
property (i.e., commercial real estate, residential real estate, personal and motor vehicles).

There are no specific federal statutes that provide protection for or guide the assessment of impacts on
socioeconomic characteristics of a defined area with implementation of the proposed action.
However, closely aligned with socioeconomics are issues of environmental justice and the protection of
children. EPA specifically defines environmental justice as “the fair treatment and meaningful
involvement of all people regardless of race, color, sex, national origin, or income with respect to the
development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies” (U.S.
EPA 2013a).
Executive Order (EO) 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations, was signed by the president on February 11, 1994. This EO requires each
federal agency to identify and address, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health
or environmental impacts of its programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income
populations, including Native American populations. The EPA and CEQ emphasize the importance of
incorporating environmental justice review in the analyses conducted by federal agencies under NEPA
and of developing protective measures that avoid disproportionate environmental impacts on minority and
low-income populations.

Draft EIS

3-4

March 2016

The president issued EO 13045, Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children, on April 21,
1997. This order requires each federal agency to “make it a high priority to identify and assess
environmental health risks and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children and shall . . .
ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and standards address disproportionate risks to children.”
This order was issued because a growing body of scientific knowledge demonstrates that children may
suffer disproportionately from environmental health risks and safety risks.
The Navy implements EO 12898 and EO 13045 through the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations M5090.1, Environmental Readiness Program Manual (January 10, 2014). This policy provides instructions
for naval personnel to identify and assess stressors to, and disproportionately high and adverse impacts
upon, minorities, low-income populations, and children. A component of this policy institutes processes
that result in consistent and efficient consideration of environmental impacts on Navy decision-making.
The CEQ has issued guidance to federal agencies on the terms used in EO 12898, as follows:
•

Low-income Population. Low-income populations in an affected area should be
identified using the annual statistical poverty thresholds from the U.S. Census Bureau.

•

Minority. An individual who is a member of the following population groups: American
Indian or Alaskan Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black, not of Hispanic origin; or
Hispanic.

•

Minority Population. Minority populations should be identified where either: (a) the
minority population of the affected area exceeds 50 percent, or (b) the minority
population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully greater than the minority
population percentage in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic
analysis.

•

Disproportionately High and Adverse Human Health Effects. When determining
whether human health effects are disproportionately high and adverse, agencies are to
consider the following three factors to the extent practicable:
1. Whether the health effects, which may be measured in risks and rates, are
“significant” (as employed by NEPA), or above generally accepted norms
2. Whether the risk or rate of hazard exposure to a minority population, low-income
population, or Indian tribe to an environmental hazard is “significant” (as employed
by NEPA) and appreciably exceeds or is likely to appreciably exceed the risk or rate
to the general population or other appropriate comparison group
3. Whether health effects occur in a minority population, low-income population, or
Indian tribe affected by cumulative or multiple adverse exposure to environmental
hazards.

•

Disproportionately High and Adverse Environmental Effects. When determining
whether environmental effects are disproportionately high and adverse, agencies are to
consider the following three factors to the extent practicable:
1. Whether there is or will be an impact on the natural or physical environment that
significantly (as employed by NEPA) and adversely affects a minority population,
low-income population, or Indian tribe. Such effects may include ecological, cultural,
human health, economic, or social impacts on minority communities, low-income
communities, or Indian tribes when those impacts are interrelated to impacts on the
natural or physical environment;

2. Whether environmental effects are “significant” (as employed by NEPA) and are or
may be having an adverse impact on minority populations, low-income populations,
or Indian tribes that appreciably exceed or are likely to appreciably exceed those on
the general population or other appropriate comparison group; and
3. Whether the environmental effects occur or would occur in a minority population,
low-income population, or Indian tribe affected by cumulative or multiple adverse
exposures from environmental hazards (Council on Environmental Quality 1997a).

3.2.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

The existing environment section presents the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the City
of Newport and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth, including population; economy, employment
and income; housing and commercial property; and taxes and revenue. Data on Newport County and the
state of Rhode Island as a whole also have been presented for comparison purposes, where applicable.
The study area for the socioeconomic analysis of all of the surplus properties encompasses the City of
Newport and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. As a result of this more regional focus, the
existing socioeconomics and environmental justice environment sections for the four surplus properties
have been combined in Section 4.2 rather than being presented separately for each property as for other
resource areas.

3.2.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

Socioeconomics
Factors considered in the analysis of population and housing impacts included the potential effects that
implementing the proposed alternatives would have on the regional economy and whether these impacts
would generate a change in economic activity sufficient to cause an expected influx of new residents to
the area. In addition, any housing developments planned under the proposed alternatives were analyzed
to determine if, at maximum build-out, the additional new housing units would affect the regional housing
market in terms of price, supply or demand.
Factors considered in the analysis of economic impacts included short- and long-term employment,
construction expenditures, and changes to the tax base. For employment, the short-term effects of
construction activities and the longer-term impacts associated with reuse of the properties were evaluated.
Estimates of the long-term employment and income impacts associated with the reuse and redevelopment
of the former Navy properties assumed the maximum build-out was achieved for each proposed
alternative. An estimate of the total long-term employment at maximum build-out was made using
standard planning assumptions that correlated the total number of workers to the number of square feet of
property developed for various types of land use.
The proposed construction associated with implementation of the alternatives would result in an
immediate, short-term influx of money to the local economy from spending on such construction-related
activities as labor, supplies and materials. Once these direct impacts on employment and income were
estimated, the indirect or multiplied economic impacts on employment and income were then calculated
using the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II). The
multipliers from this model are based on regional information derived from databases analyzing
commercial, industrial, and household spending patterns and relationships. The U.S. Department of
Energy’s Jobs and Economic Development Impact (JEDI) Model was used to assess the direct and
indirect economic impacts of the proposed solar energy project at Tank Farms 1 and 2.

Draft EIS

3-6

March 2016

The implications for the local tax base and real property tax receipts were estimated by adapting property
value estimates developed for the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport (RKG
Associates, Inc. et al. 2011) for those properties that would be taxable These cost estimates were assumed
to be equivalent to the fair market value of the real estate. The total assessed value of the properties at
maximum build-out was then calculated from this estimate of fair market value. Current (fiscal year [FY]
2013) real property tax rates were then applied to the estimated assessed value to calculate the potential
tax-generating capacity of these properties at maximum build-out. The waterfront park at the former
Naval Hospital property and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane component were not included in this analysis
of tax-generating capacity because ownership of the property would be tax-exempt.
Given the regional nature of socioeconomic and environmental justice issues, the socioeconomic analysis
focuses on the demographic and economic attributes of the city and the towns; data on Newport County
and the state of Rhode Island as a whole also have been presented for comparison purposes, where
applicable. As a result of this more regional focus, the socioeconomics and environmental justice
environmental consequences sections have been combined and are not presented separately for each
property.
Environmental Justice and Protection of Children
Consistent with EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations (February 11, 1994), and EO 13045, Environmental Health Risks and
Safety Risks to Children (April 21, 1997) the U.S. Navy’s policy is to identify and address any
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its actions on minority,
children, and low-income populations.
Demographic and economic data for all census block groups and/or census tracts that are wholly or
partially within the study area were compared with similar demographic and economic data county-wide
to determine whether the study area included minority or low income populations. (Note: Income data
available through the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey can be found only at the
census block group level. Thus, while race and age data are presented at the census block group level,
low-income population data are presented at the census tract level.) When the percentage of the
population that is either minority or low-income within an affected area exceeds 50 percent or is
“meaningfully greater” than the minority or low income population percentage of the community of
comparison, minority or low-income populations may potentially be subject to a disproportionately high
and adverse effect. The Navy evaluated whether the study area included minority or low-income
populations and whether the proposed action could result in human health or environmental effects. In
addition any environmental health or safety risks that could be unique to children were also assessed.

Community Facilities and Services
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Community facilities and services are those attributes of a community that promote the common welfare
of area residents and include educational facilities, public safety and emergency response services, parks
and recreational facilities, and health care/medical facilities. There are no specific federal statutes that
provide protection for or guide the assessment of impacts on community facilities and services upon
implementation of the proposed action.

3.3.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

The existing environment section presents the community facilities and services of the City of Newport
and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth, including educational facilities, public safety and

would support development at each of the surplus properties.

3.3.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

To address environmental consequences on community facilities and services, the direct population
change as a result of full build-out under each alternative and the potential for an impact on capacity was
the focus of the assessment.

3.4
3.4.1

Transportation
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Transportation encompasses the roads, highways, and public transportation services that allow vehicles
and people to move around the region and that provide access to homes, businesses, and other land uses.
Roadways are classified into one of three types according to the function served in moving traffic:
arterial, collector roadways, and local streets. Arterials facilitate the movement of traffic regionally and
between population and activity centers with a minimal level of access to adjacent properties. Collector
roadways facilitate the movement of traffic from population and activity centers and funnel it onto arterial
highways with a moderate level of access to adjacent properties. Local roadways provide access to
adjacent properties and move traffic onto collector and arterial roadways.
To determine the adequacy of roadways, a capacity analysis is conducted that characterizes roadways and
intersections based on their level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative measure that describes general
operating conditions based on factors such as speed, travel times, and delays. LOS is reported on a scale
of ‘A’ to ‘F.’ ‘A’ represents the best operating conditions with free-flowing traffic, and ‘F’ represents the
worst operating conditions with significant delays.
There are no specific statutes that govern transportation as it pertains to implementation of the proposed
action. The City of Newport does not have any specific regulations in its codified ordinances regarding
traffic or transportation. The Town of Portsmouth has a traffic-sensitive overlay district; however, this
overlay district applies only to lots that have frontage on a specific list of streets, none of which are
applicable to the surplus property in Portsmouth. The Town of Middletown, through the zoning
ordinance, has established traffic-sensitive districts (Middletown Code of Ordinances, Chapter 152 §720).
The “traffic-sensitive” designation has been established by the town to improve traffic flow and safety on
the town’s major roadways. The town has established minimum lot width requirements in traffic-sensitive
districts to reduce the number and increase the spacing of access points to major roadways (Middletown
Code of Ordinances, Chapter 152 §720). Only lots with frontage on the following streets must adhere to
the regulations of this district: East Main Road, West Main Road, Valley Road, and Aquidneck Avenue.
Although the former Navy Lodge property is located within a traffic-sensitive district, the property fronts
Coddington Highway and, therefore, is not subject to these regulations.

3.4.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing conditions related to the roadway networks and intersection operations were established by
reviewing field data, regional planning documents and transportation studies such as the Aquidneck Island
Transportation Study (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. 2011), and discussions with the local planning
departments.
A traffic analysis of existing traffic conditions in October 2012 focused on seven major intersections and
eight roadways in the vicinity of the surplus properties. The intersections and roadways evaluated were

Draft EIS

3-8

March 2016

chosen based on their proximity to the surplus properties and their likelihood to be impacted by proposed
alternatives. These intersections and roadways are depicted in Figure 3.4-1.
Existing physical characteristics of nearby roads and intersections were determined largely by visual
inspection. Traffic volume data, in the form of manual turning movement counts and automatic traffic
recorder (ATR) counts, for the study area were collected on mid-work week days (October 23 and 24,
2012). Manual turning movement counts were made at the following intersections (see Figure 3.4-1) from
6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Pare Corporation 2013):
•

Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road and Third Street (Newport)

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Coddington Highway/Rockwood Road (Middletown)

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Valley Road (Route 214) (Middletown)

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane (Middletown)

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Stringham Road (Portsmouth)

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Bradford Avenue (Portsmouth)

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road (Portsmouth).

Additionally, daily average traffic counts were taken at eight locations in the vicinity of the surplus
properties using ATRs:
•

Third Street, south of Dyers Gate Road (Newport)

•

Coddington Highway, west of Jones Road (Middletown)

•

West Main Road (Route 114) south of Valley Road (Middletown)

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road north of Greene Lane (Middletown)

•

West Main Road (Route 114) north of John Kesson Lane (Middletown)

•

Stringham Road west of West Main Road (Route 114) (Portsmouth)

•

Bradford Avenue east of Sullivan Drive (Portsmouth)

•

Alexander Road south of Bay View Terrace (Portsmouth).

Public transit routes from the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) were also reviewed.
To address safety issues, accident data were requested from the towns of Portsmouth and Middletown and
the City of Newport for the most recent three-year period. Additionally, speed studies were conducted on
each of the key study area roadways in the vicinity of each of the surplus properties to determine typical
travel speeds. Stopping sight distance measurements were taken at the proposed driveway locations for
each surplus property. Sight distances were assessed in conjunction with the American Association of
State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) publication, A Policy on Geometric Design of
Streets and Highways, 2011 Edition (as cited by Pare Corporation 2013).

3.4.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

Impacts on transportation were determined by evaluating the potential change in traffic volumes,
circulation patterns, and LOS on roadways. As previously discussed, LOS is a quality measure describing
operational conditions within a traffic stream, generally in terms of service measures such as speed, travel

Draft EIS

3-9

March 2016

times, traffic interruptions, etc. Adverse impacts on roadways are any that force a road to operate beyond
its full design capacity.
These impacts were assessed using trip generation estimates and a capacity analysis. The Institute of
Transportation Engineers (ITE) Manual Trip Generation, 8th edition (as cited by Pare Corporation 2013),
was used to estimate trip generation of proposed land uses for each property and each alternative. Trip
generation estimates for each property took into account the redevelopment proposed for the other three
properties as well as a 1 percent annual background growth that is expected to occur through the year
2032. Background growth is the growth expected within the study area based on development projects
not specifically identified as well as annual population and traffic increases. Existing travel patterns on
roadways in the vicinity of surplus properties were used to determine the distribution of trips for each
alternative. The capacity analysis identified an LOS for each of the seven intersections studied under
existing and alternative conditions.

Environmental Management
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Environmental management is the handling of specialized materials and wastes that could be an
environmental hazard if not properly managed. Such materials and wastes consist of hazardous waste;
hazardous materials; petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) and other materials stored in tanks; asbestos;
lead-based paint (LBP); PCBs; pesticides; radioactive materials and radon; and medical waste. This
resource area also addresses sites the Navy is managing under the Navy’s Environmental Restoration
(ER) Program.
3.5.1.1
Hazardous Waste
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 regulates the “cradle-to-grave” control of
hazardous waste, including generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal. The Hazardous
and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 added land disposal restrictions and corrective action
requirements, among others. Hazardous waste is specifically defined by the EPA and consists of solid
wastes that contain listed hazardous wastes or exhibit hazardous waste characteristics such as ignitability,
corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. Hazardous wastes also include universal wastes, which consist of
certain batteries, certain pesticides, mercury-containing equipment (such as thermostats), and mercurycontaining light bulbs.
RIDEM regulates hazardous waste management in Rhode Island under Regulation #DEM-OWM-HW1001, Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management. The regulation incorporates EPA’s
hazardous waste regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260 to 273, largely by reference, with some exceptions and
additions (RIDEM 2010a), e.g., Rhode Island identifies certain additional Rhode Island hazardous wastes.
Rhode Island’s hazardous waste regulations apply to all generators and the state does not recognize
federal exemptions for small quantity generators (defined by the EPA as those that generate less than
1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) (RIDEM 2008a). Thus NAVSTA Newport is considered
to be a large-quantity generator (generation of 1,000 kilograms or more of hazardous waste per month)
(NAVSTA Newport 2010).

The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages hazardous waste at the installation 7. NAVSTA
Newport ensures the safe management and control of hazardous waste through the implementation of
several planning documents:
•

Hazardous Waste Management Plan, which provides guidance for hazardous and
universal waste management at the installation, including training, collection, packaging,
labeling, marking, recordkeeping, transfer, storage, and disposal. The plan also addresses
management of special RCRA wastes such as waste oil, which RIDEM considers to be a
hazardous waste; non-RCRA wastes such as asbestos, which is regulated by the Toxic
Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976; and non-RCRA waste such as PCBs, a TSCA
waste that RIDEM considers to be a hazardous waste (NAVSTA Newport 2010).

•

Final Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan, which describes emergency response
preparedness, procedures, and capabilities for areas of NAVSTA Newport where
hazardous waste and specialized wastes (e.g., oil filters, used oil, and oily wastes) are
generated and stored (Michael Baker Jr. Inc. 2011).

•

NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.5D, Hazardous Waste Management, which provides
general naval instruction for developing a Hazardous Waste Management Plan and
properly managing hazardous waste (U.S. Department of the Navy 2011a).

•

NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.20B, Hazardous Waste Munitions (HWM), which
provides general naval instruction for disposal and certification of waste munitions (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2012).

Small quantities of hazardous wastes are generated at NAVSTA Newport during the year from routine
operational activities such as cleaning, painting, equipment maintenance, and installation maintenance.
Such wastes include paints, bilge water, chemical solutions (e.g., potassium hydroxide solutions, phenol
solutions, and trichloroacetic acid solutions), compressed gases, flammable adhesives, used antifreeze,
and lead waste (NAVSTA Newport 2011a, 2012c). NAVSTA Newport generates small quantities of
universal wastes annually such as batteries, fluorescent light bulbs (which contain mercury), and other
mercury-containing items (NAVSTA Newport 2011a, 2012c).
Hazardous waste generated at NAVSTA Newport is collected in one of two satellite accumulation areas
and then consolidated in a single 90-day accumulation area (Michael Baker Jr. Inc. 2011). After 90-day
storage, hazardous waste is transported off-site for disposal in compliance with federal and state
regulations. Universal waste is collected in one of three universal waste storage areas and transported offsite for disposal or recycling within one year of accumulation and storage. Used oil and oily wastes,
which the RIDEM considers to be hazardous wastes, are accumulated in seven “non-regulated” waste
storage areas at NAVSTA Newport (Michael Baker Jr. Inc. 2011).
3.5.1.2
Hazardous Materials
Although hazardous materials and substances have specific regulatory definitions, in this EIS the term
“hazardous materials” is used in a broad sense to mean an item or agent (chemical, physical, biological, or
radiological) that has the potential to cause harm to the environment (including the human environment),
either by itself or through interaction with other factors. NAVSTA Newport is managing hazardous
materials and substances under a variety of regulatory programs, as described below.

The installation’s EPA hazardous waste identification number is RI1170024243.

Draft EIS

March 2016

Hazardous Material Control
NAVSTA Newport employs a Consolidated Hazardous Material Reutilization Implementation
Management Program to achieve life-cycle hazardous material control and management (HMC&M) and
pollution prevention (P2) at the installation. The program provides a standardized approach for HMC&M
that ultimately reduces the quantities of hazardous material that are procured, stocked, and distributed for
operational purposes and that are eventually disposed of as waste (Commander Navy Installations
Command [CNIC] n.d.[a]). Hazardous materials that are routinely acquired to operate NAVSTA
Newport include chemicals, acids, alcohols, solvents, paints, cleaners, oil, and fuel (diesel and gasoline)
(NAVSTA Newport 2004a). Key elements of the program include:
•

A centralized hazardous materials distribution and collection center.

•

The Hazardous Material Control and Management Plan, which governs the
procurement, issue, storage, use, handling, and management of hazardous material
(NAVSTA Newport 2004a).

•

NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.14B, Hazardous Material Control and
Management, which provides general naval instruction for HMC&M (U.S. Department
of the Navy 2007a).

In accordance with the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), NAVSTA
Newport files an annual Tier II Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory of the hazardous
chemicals present on site (NAVSTA Newport 2012d).
Underground Storage Tanks
Operation of USTs is regulated under RCRA Subtitle I, Underground Storage Tanks, which is codified in
40 CFR Parts 280 to 282. The federal program regulates USTs containing petroleum products or
hazardous substances, with a focus on preventing and cleaning up UST releases in order to protect the
nation’s groundwater. 40 CFR 280 provides the technical standards and corrective action requirements
for owners and operators of USTs. 40 CFR 281 provides the requirements for state UST programs to
receive EPA approval. RIDEM regulates USTs in Rhode Island under Regulation #DEM-OWM-UST0311, Rules and Regulations for Underground Storage Facilities Used for Petroleum Products and
Hazardous Materials (RIDEM 2011a).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages USTs under their tank management program,
which is conducted in accordance with the following:
•

The installation’s Tank Management Plan.

•

NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.8F, Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank
Management, which provides general naval instruction for managing USTs and
aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) (U.S. Department of the Navy 2011b).

The purpose of the NAVSTA Newport tank management program is to prevent contamination of soil and
groundwater from USTs and aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) by registering tanks, establishing leaktight design requirements, establishing leak detection and monitoring requirements, remediating
contaminated sites, and ensuring proper UST and AST closure (CNIC n.d.[b]). Active USTs and
associated features (e.g., leak detection systems, spill containment, and piping sumps) are inspected
monthly for integrity in compliance with federal, state, and installation requirements (NAVSTA Newport
2013a). Inactive USTs are addressed under RIDEM’s UST regulations.

Draft EIS

3-14

March 2016

Aboveground Storage Tanks
ASTs used to store petroleum products are regulated primarily under 40 CFR 112, Oil Pollution
Prevention, as codified from the Clean Water Act (CWA). The purpose of 40 CFR 112 is to prevent the
discharge of oil to waters and natural resources of the United States. The regulation focuses on spill
prevention, control, and countermeasures and requirements for facility response plans. RIDEM regulates
ASTs in Rhode Island under their Oil Pollution Control Regulations, which apply to aboveground oil
storage tank facilities with a combined storage capacity of more than 500 gallons (RIDEM 1991). The
NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages ASTs under their tank management program, as
described above for USTs. In addition, the installation manages ASTs in accordance with the following:
•

Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure [sic] Plan (the SPCC plan), which
addresses installation conditions, preventive practices, training, and other mitigating
measures to reduce the potential for a spill of oil to navigable water from NAVSTA
Newport (Aerostar 2012).

•

OPA 90 Facility Response Plan (the FRP), which provides facility information (response
planning data) and the emergency response action plan for postulated incidents involving
oil and related products at NAVSTA Newport (Levine Fricke 2005).

The installation’s SPCC plan and FRP address prevention of and specific response actions for spills from
bulk petroleum containers such as ASTs, USTs, and for other sources of oil at the installation. Like the
USTs, active ASTs and associated features (e.g., leak detection systems, spill containment, and valves)
are inspected monthly for integrity in compliance with federal, state, and installation requirements
(NAVSTA Newport 2013b).
Oil/Water Separators
Oil/water separators (OWSs) are regulated under 40 CFR 112, Oil Pollution Prevention, and subject to
SPCC regulations if the OWSs are used in oil production and to meet the secondary containment
requirements of the rule. OWSs that are used only to treat wastewater and are not used to satisfy any
requirement of 40 CFR 112 are exempt from SPCC requirements (U.S. EPA 2005). OWSs are subject to
regulation under the CWA and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
program (under 40 CFR 122) if the OWS discharges to the environment. In Rhode Island, OWSs are
similarly regulated under the Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program if the OWS
discharges to the environment.
OWSs are used in various locations at NAVSTA Newport, typically to treat and separate oil from water
before discharge of the water at Rhode Island-permitted outfalls. They are used to treat wastewater and
therefore are not regulated under 40 CFR 112 nor addressed in the SPCC Plan.
Asbestos-Containing Materials
Asbestos was used in building materials such as roofing and siding shingles, ceiling and floor tiles,
insulation, cement, textiles, and coatings before the 1970s (U.S. EPA 2012a). The EPA banned the use of
most asbestos-containing products by 1989 following studies that concluded that friable asbestos is an
airborne hazard that is dangerous to the lungs.
Asbestos abatement is regulated under Title II of TSCA (also known as the Asbestos Hazard Emergency
Response Act [AHERA] of 1986), which authorized the EPA to determine the extent of the risk to human
health posed by asbestos in public and commercial buildings and the means to respond to any risk.
Asbestos is also regulated as a human health and environmental hazard under various other federal laws
and regulations, including the Clean Air Act (CAA) (Section 112, National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants [NESHAPs], codified in 40 CFR 61), the Safe Drinking Water Act, and by the

Draft EIS

3-15

March 2016

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) under the Asbestos General Standard (29 CFR
1910.1001) and Asbestos Construction Standard (29 CFR 1926.1101).
Under the authority of Title 23, Chapter 24.5 of the General Laws of the State of Rhode Island, entitled
Asbestos Abatement, the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) regulates asbestos assessment and
abatement in regulation R23-24.5-ASB, Rules and Regulations for Asbestos Control (RIDOH 2007a).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages the identification, control, and abatement of
asbestos-containing materials (ACM) in accordance with Asbestos Operations & Management Plan (U.S.
Department of the Navy 1997). The plan establishes requirements for asbestos inspections, assessments,
surveys, and sampling; labeling ACM; cleaning ACM surfaces; ACM removal; ACM disposal; worker
training; and health and safety. The most comprehensive ACM survey at NAVSTA Newport was made
in 1992 when 200 buildings totaling more than 3,600,000 square feet were surveyed (Halliburton 1994).
One hundred forty-five of the 200 surveyed buildings were found to contain some known or assumed
ACM in varying conditions. Following the survey and the recommendations in the report, the Navy
labeled ACM at the installation and instituted a removal program for ACM with a potential to expose
workers or the public. Individual asbestos surveys of other buildings and areas also have been performed.
Since the time of the survey and the development of the Asbestos Operations & Management Plan,
asbestos and ACM are evaluated on a case-by-case basis when specific maintenance or demolition work
is scheduled for buildings or facilities at NAVSTA Newport.
Lead-Based Paint/Lead
LBP is regulated under Title IV of TSCA, known as Lead Exposure Reduction, which was added to
TSCA in 1992. Among other things, Title IV required the EPA to establish reliable, effective, and safe
standards for performing LBP activities; authorized states to administer and enforce their own LBP
programs; and required the EPA to develop a model state program (Congressional Research Service
2011). Similar to asbestos, lead is regulated as a human health and environmental hazard under various
other federal laws and regulations including the CAA (Section 112, NESHAPs, codified in 40 CFR 61),
the Safe Drinking Water Act, RCRA, and by OSHA under the Lead General Standard (29 CFR
1910.1025) and Lead Construction Standard (29 CFR 1926.62).
Rhode Island’s law and regulations for LBP apply to residential areas and facilities where children could
be at risk from lead poisoning and are not intended to apply to industrial areas at NAVSTA Newport or
the surplus property. The Rhode Island Department of Administration regulates lead mitigation for
dwellings under the authority of the Lead Hazard Mitigation Act (Chapter 42-128.1 of the Rhode Island
General Laws) and the regulation called Rules and Regulations Governing Lead Hazard Mitigation
(Rhode Island Department of Administration 2011). RIDOH regulates the control of lead hazards in
residential and child-occupied areas under the authority of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act (Chapter
23-24.6 of the Rhode Island General Laws) and regulation R23-24.6-PB, Rules and Regulations for Lead
Poisoning Prevention ( RIDOH 2010). RIDEM regulates LBP removal from the exterior surfaces of any
facility under Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 24, Removal of Lead Based Paint from Exterior
Surfaces (RIDEM 2007a), so that LBP removal does not create an airborne exposure hazard for workers
or others nearby. RIDEM regulates the investigation and remediation of releases of lead to the
environment, such as to soil, under regulation DEM-DSR-01-93, Rules and Regulations for the
Investigation and Remediation of Hazardous Material Releases (RIDEM 2004).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages the identification, control, and abatement of
LBP, lead, and lead-containing materials under their LBP program (CNIC n.d.[c]). The objectives of the
program are to manage LBP in residential and child-occupied facilities and protect the safety of
government employees and others engaged in the maintenance of areas with LBP and the general use of
lead or lead-containing materials. The program is conducted primarily in accordance with NAVSTA
Draft EIS

3-16

March 2016

Newport Instruction 5090.9B, Lead Paint Program, which provides general instruction for working with
lead and lead paint at the installation. NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.9B includes brief standard
operating procedures (SOPs) for work on painted surfaces, paint chip sampling, exterior lead projects, and
interior lead projects (U.S. Department of the Navy 2011c).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division maintains a lead log of areas that have been identified as
containing LBP. The installation’s LBP program includes review of design specifications and contracts
for all construction, demolition, and renovation projects—not just those in residential areas—to ensure
that LBP assessment and control are conducted as necessary for those projects (CNIC n.d.[c]; Smith
2012).
Polychlorinated Biphenyls
PCBs are regulated by the EPA under TSCA. Rhode Island regulates PCBs and PCB-contaminated
materials as a Rhode Island hazardous waste (RIDEM 2010a).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages the identification and control of PCBs and
PCB-contaminated materials. Transformers used in the delivery of electrical service are a common
source of PCBs. PCB-containing transformers were removed or replaced at NAVSTA Newport in the
1980s (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009) and the Navy is not otherwise aware of any PCB-containing
transformers at the installation (CNIC n.d.[d]). A transformer without a “PCB-free” label is required to
be tested to verify that it is PCB-free (i.e., does not contain PCBs greater than or equal to 50 parts per
million [ppm]). Because some caulkings, including window caulkings, manufactured before 1980 can
contain PCBs, demolition or renovation projects include testing caulking to determine proper handling
and disposal methods (CNIC n.d.[d]). Fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs are handled as a
hazardous waste.
Pesticides
Pesticides are regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), which provides the basis for the regulation, sale, distribution, and use of pesticides in the United
States. Herbicides are considered to be a class of pesticides. The RIDEM Division of Agriculture
regulates pesticide use in Rhode Island, primarily pursuant to the Pesticide Control Act of 1976 (Chapter
23-25-1 of the Rhode Island General Laws) and the regulation entitled Rules and Regulations Relating to
Pesticides (RIDEM 2006).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division controls pests in accordance with the Integrated Pest
Management Plan (Geo-Marine 2009). The integrated pest management program uses “continuous
monitoring, education, recordkeeping, and communication to prevent pests and disease vectors from
causing unacceptable damage to operations, people, property, materiel, or the environment.” Common
pests that the installation monitors and controls include insects (mosquitos, bees, termites, cockroaches,
and ants), decay fungi, weeds, rodents, and birds. The installation controls pests using non-chemical
methods first (e.g., sanitary conditions, physical controls, mechanical controls, and biological controls),
followed by chemical methods if necessary. Chemical pesticides are required to have as low a toxicity as
possible. Only pesticides approved by the EPA and the RIDEM are used, and NAVSTA Newport
provides a list of pesticides in use to Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantic.
Pesticides are applied by trained and certified pest-control operators who meet DOD and RIDEM
standards for pesticide application. Pest-management staff are required to know the locations of sensitive
habitats at the installation and to apply pest control accordingly.
Radioactive Materials
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for protecting the health and safety of the
public and the environment from civilian (i.e., non-militaristic) uses of radioactive material. The NRC
Draft EIS

3-17

March 2016

delegates its authority to state governments under its Agreement State Program. Although Rhode Island
is an Agreement State, NAVSTA Newport, as a federal entity, is regulated directly by the NRC. The
Navy has authority from the NRC, under the Navy’s Master Materials License of Broad Scope, to receive,
use, transport, transfer, and dispose of radioactive material from Navy activities. Under the broad scope
license, Naval Radioactive Materials Permits are issued to individual installations for activities that use
radioactive materials. NAVSTA Newport does not maintain such a permit because there are no current
activities at the installation, including the surplus property, where radioactive material is routinely used
(Moore 2013). Likewise, NAVSTA Newport does not have a specific radioactive materials or radioactive
waste management plan. The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division requires contractors who bring
radioactive materials on base for specific purposes (e.g., radiography or LBP inspections) to have a
radiation safety program and obtain NRC approval.
Radon
EPA regulates radon in indoor air under Title III of TSCA, known as Indoor Radon Abatement, which
was added to the TSCA in 1988. Under Title III, the EPA is required to publish a citizens’ guide to radon
health risk and perform studies of radon contamination in federal buildings. The EPA maintains guidance
levels for radon in residences and has published numerous guides for testing and mitigating radon in
residences. OSHA regulates radon in the workplace under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1970. The occupational standard for radon is codified in the ionizing radiation standards in 29 CFR
1910.1096, which address limits for exposure to airborne radioactive material.
RIDOH regulates radon in public and high-priority buildings (such as schools) under the authority of the
Radon Control Act (Chapter 23-61 of the Rhode Island General Laws) and regulation R23-61-RC entitled
Rules and Regulations for Radon Control (RIDOH 2007b). Among other things, the regulations provide
measurement and mitigation protocols for public and high-priority buildings. The standards and protocol
are aligned with the EPA’s recommendations.
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages radon in accordance with the Navy Radon
Assessment and Mitigation Program (NAVRAMP), which is addressed in Chapter 25 of OPNAV M5090.1, Environmental Readiness Program Manual (U.S. Department of the Navy 2014). The
NAVRAMP describes radon-testing protocol, action levels, and mitigation measures, which are based on
the EPA’s recommendations (CNIC n.d.[e]). Additional NAVRAMP guidance that NAVSTA Newport
uses is provided in U.S. Navy Radon Assessment and Mitigation Program Guidebook for Radon
Management in Nonresidential Buildings (Oak Ridge National Laboratory 2010).
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division made a comprehensive radon study of many areas at the
installation in 1993, consisting of more than 2,500 measurements. Most of the results were below EPA’s
threshold level of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) (NAVSTA Newport 1996). The few areas with elevated
radon results were identified for potential mitigation. Many of the buildings with elevated results from
the 1990s testing were retested in 2011, for which there were a few elevated results (NAVSTA Newport
2011b). Individual radon studies of other buildings and areas also have been performed.
3.5.1.3
Medical Waste
Medical waste is not regulated at the federal level. The RIDEM Office of Waste Management regulates
medical waste under the authority of Chapter 23-19.12 of the Rhode Island General Laws and the ensuing
regulation DEM-OWM-MW-1-2009, Rules and Regulations Governing the Generation, Transportation,
Storage, Treatment, Management and Disposal of Regulated Medical Waste in Rhode Island (RIDEM
2010b).
NAVSTA Newport manages medical waste in accordance with NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.12B,
Regulated Medical Wastes (RMW) (U.S. Department of the Navy 2011d). Medical waste is generated
Draft EIS

3-18

March 2016

primarily by Naval Health Clinic New England (NHCNE), which is the current on-base medical facility.
In accordance with the instruction, medical waste generated at the installation is managed by a contractor
that services NHCNE.
3.5.1.4
Environmental Restoration Program
Under the Navy’s ER Program, inactive hazardous waste sites and hazardous substance spills are
investigated and cleaned up in compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, commonly known as Superfund. CERCLA
provides federal authority for response actions to clean up contamination from releases or threatened
releases of hazardous substances that may endanger human health or the environment. Under CERCLA,
the EPA developed a National Priorities List (NPL) of sites that present the greatest risk to public health
and the environment. CERCLA was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) of 1986, which mandated that the DOD follow the same cleanup regulations that apply to private
entities. SARA established the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP), which is the broad
program encompassing the Navy ER Program. Through the DERP (and hence the ER Program), the
DOD conducts environmental restoration activities at sites on active installations, installations undergoing
BRAC, and formerly utilized defense sites. The main objectives of the DERP are as follows:
•

The identification, investigation, research and development, and cleanup of
contamination from hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants

•

The correction of other environmental damage (such as detection and disposal of
unexploded ordnance) that creates an imminent and substantial endangerment to public
health or the environment

•

The demolition and removal of unsafe buildings and structures, including at formerly
utilized defense sites.

The Navy established the ER Program to comply with the DERP.
The Navy’s 1983 Initial Assessment Study at NAVSTA Newport identified sites where contamination
was suspected to pose a threat to human health or the environment. NAVSTA Newport was listed on the
NPL on November 21, 1989, under EPA ID RI6170085470 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). On
March 23, 1992, the Navy entered into a Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) with EPA Region I and the
State of Rhode Island under CERCLA §120 (U.S. EPA 1992). The FFA listed the Installation
Restoration Program (IRP) study areas and sites considered to be areas of contamination; established
goals and responsibilities among the Navy and the regulatory agencies; and set enforceable cleanup
schedules for the sites. A restoration advisory board (RAB), established in 1996, comprises community
representatives and state and federal regulators who advise the Navy on environmental cleanup issues and
strategies. CERCLA remedy selection takes into account reasonably anticipated future land uses to
determine the appropriate extent of remediation, which must be protective of human health and the
environment.
CERCLA 120(h)(3)(A) requires that, prior to property transfer, all necessary remedial actions to protect
human health and the environment with respect to any such hazardous substance remaining on the
property be completed or in place and proven to be operating properly and successfully.
CERCLA 120(h)(3) imposes several requirements on all transfers of federal real property “owned by the
United States” to non-federal entities. With regard to the Federal Real Property Disposal Process,
CERCLA requires the federal government to:

Draft EIS

3-19

March 2016

•

Give notice of hazardous substance activity to the grantee

•

Include a covenant in the deed that “all remedial action necessary to protect human health
and the environment with respect to any such substance remaining on the property has
been taken before the date of such transfer”

•

Include a deed covenant that the United States will return and perform any additional
response action that may be required in the future

•

Retain a perpetual right of access necessary to do such additional response actions.

These requirements only apply to conveyances of real property out of federal ownership. They do not
apply to interagency federal real property transfers or to leases, licenses, or easements granted for the use
of federal land.
CERCLA 120(h)(3)(C) allows property at NPL sites to be transferred before all necessary remedial
actions have been taken if the EPA, with the concurrence of the governor of the state in which a facility is
located, determines that the property is suitable for transfer, based on a finding that:
(I)

The property is suitable for transfer for the use intended by the transferee, and the
intended use is consistent with protection of human health and the environment;

(II)

The deed or other agreement proposed to govern the transfer between the United States
and the transferee of the property contains assurances that:
1. Provide for any necessary restrictions on the use of the property to ensure the
protection of human health and the environment;
2. Provide that there will be restrictions on use necessary to ensure that required
remedial investigations, response action, and oversight activities will not be
disrupted;
3. Provide that all necessary response actions will be taken and identify the schedules
for investigation and completion of all necessary response actions as approved by
the appropriate regulatory agency; and
4. Provide that the federal agency responsible for the property subject to transfer [in
this case, the Navy] will submit a budget request to the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget that adequately addresses schedules for investigation and
completion of all necessary response action, subject to congressional authorizations
and appropriations;

(III) The federal agency requesting deferral [in this case, the Navy] has provided notice, by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the property, of the
proposed transfer and of the opportunity for the public to submit, within a period of not
less than 30 days after the date of the notice, written comments on the suitability of the
property for transfer; and
(IV) The deferral and the transfer of the property will not substantially delay any necessary
response action at the property (U.S. EPA 2002).
Transfer of property pursuant to CERCLA 120(h)(3)(C) is commonly referred to as an “early transfer.”
The Navy ER Program encompasses three main program categories: the IRP, the Munitions Response
Program (MRP), and POL spills that are not addressed in the CERCLA framework. The IRP and MRP
are described below. NAVSTA Newport has not designated any POL sites under their ER Program. The
Draft EIS

3-20

March 2016

Navy maintains a Site Management Plan for NAVSTA Newport that describes the IRP and MRP sites,
tasks completed, and the schedule for planned work (Resolution Consultants 2014). The Site
Management Plan is updated annually. The Navy conducts five-year reviews of the ER Program, which
discuss the status of the ER Program sites and evaluate implemented remedies with respect to their
protection of human health and the environment. CERCLA activities under the Navy ER Program
continue regardless of whether the installation or parts of it were recommended for disposal under BRAC.
Because CERCLA excludes petroleum from its definition of hazardous substances, the cleanup of
petroleum releases from USTs is regulated under RCRA and state law. Petroleum cleanup follows an
iterative process similar to the CERCLA cleanup process.

The IRP portion of the Navy ER Program addresses releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or
contaminants that pose toxicological risks to human health or the environment. The Navy’s IRP is
structured in accordance with CERCLA requirements, which specify sequential procedures for initiating
and carrying out the remedial process. These general steps are as follows (U.S. Department of the Navy
2007a):
1. Site discovery and notification
2. Preliminary assessment/site inspection (PA/SI)
3. Remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS)
4. Record of Decision (ROD)
5. Remedial design (RD)
6. Remedial action – construction
7. Remedy-in-place
8. Remedial action – operation
9. Response complete
10. Long-term management
11. Site closeout.
The EPA, state agencies, and the public have opportunities to review and comment on
assessments/studies and proposals for removal/remedial actions throughout the process. The ROD is
prepared after public review of the proposed remedial action plan. The ROD identifies the selected
remedy based on information and technical analysis presented in the RI/FS report. A site may be
removed from the NPL when the final ROD requirements are attained and the site is operational and
functional.
The IRP sites currently identified for NAVSTA Newport are shown on Figure 3.5-1. There are 14 current
IRP sites, two of which are located on surplus properties; these two are noted in Table 3.5-1 along with
IRP sites within approximately 0.5 mile from a surplus property. The list excludes certain sites identified
at the time of the FFA that have since been fully remediated or otherwise moved out of the IRP and
includes some sites added since the FFA. Locations identified as “sites” are areas of concern (AOCs)
where contaminants have been found at concentrations that pose risk. Locations identified as “study
areas” are being evaluated to determine if there is risk (Resolution Consultants 2014).

Finding of Suitability to Transfer
Real property transactions under BRAC require the preparation of a finding of suitability to transfer
(FOST). The FOST summarizes how the applicable requirements and notifications for hazardous
materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials (e.g., ACM, LBP, PCBs, and pesticides)
have been satisfied and whether the property is environmentally suitable for transfer. The Environmental
Condition of Property report that was prepared for the NAVSTA Newport surplus properties provides
baseline information to the BRAC PMO to support disposal decisions and real estate transfer
documentation.
The redevelopment plan for the NAVSTA Newport surplus properties assumes that certain cleanup
actions will occur before property transfer (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). In those cases, NAVSTA
Newport will remove and dispose of hazardous materials in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations and perform any required closures. The FOST(s) for NAVSTA Newport will address any
restrictions, notifications, or covenants in deeds related to hazardous materials at the surplus properties.
The FOST(s) also will specifically address compliance with CERCLA and any applicable CERCLA
§120(h)(3) covenants (see Section 3.5.1.3). Long-term remedies, including land use controls, and
responsibilities for maintenance and reporting are discussed in the FOST(s).
Potentially contaminated properties can be transferred under the “early transfer” process of CERCLA, as
described in Section 3.5.1.3, in which case the Navy would prepare a finding of suitability for early
transfer (FOSET) to transfer property prior to cleanup actions. In the case of a FOSET, either the Navy or
the property recipient may conduct cleanup actions. The benefit of a FOSET is that property can be
transferred sooner in order to begin redevelopment while still being assured of property cleanup.
The FOST(s) for the NAVSTA Newport surplus property will be forwarded to the EPA (and RIDEM) for
review as appropriate (U.S. Department of Defense 2006).

3.5.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing conditions related to environmental management were assessed by obtaining, reviewing, and
summarizing information for each topic area (e.g., hazardous waste, PCBs, radon, the ER Program) as
applicable to NAVSTA Newport in general as well as specifically to the properties to be disposed of;
interviewing NAVFAC and installation personnel; and attending walkover and windshield surveys of the
properties. A survey also was made in April 2013 for ACM, LBP, PCB-containing window caulk, and
lead in soils for applicable structures at the surplus properties in support of this EIS and future disposition
of the properties (YU & Associates 2013). The following structures were surveyed:

•

Field screening for LBP using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) device and
collection/analysis for lead of 11 follow-up paint chip samples

•

Collection and analysis for lead of 10 composite soil samples from around buildings

•

Collection and analysis for PCBs of six composite samples of window caulking and
sealants.

The survey was performed in accordance with established regulatory requirements. The executive
summary of the report documenting the survey (YU & Associates 2013) is provided in Appendix E.
Management, investigation, and cleanup activities are ongoing at the base; therefore, the existing
conditions present the most recent data that were available at the time of preparation of this EIS.

3.5.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

The impact analysis was performed by evaluating the potential impacts, under each alternative, associated
with generating and managing wastes and materials and managing specialized features such as tanks.
This included evaluating, for example, whether and to what extent the alternatives would result in the
generation, handling, or management of hazardous materials and wastes; whether and to what extent the
alternatives would be affected by IRP and MRP sites and activities; and comparisons with applicable
regulatory criteria. The impact analysis included discussing any requirements for property transfer related
to environmental management, e.g., restrictions or covenants due to residual contamination that could not
or need not be remediated and the status of applicable FOSTs for the properties.

3.6.1

Air Quality
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Air quality is defined by ambient air concentrations of specific pollutants that have been determined by
the EPA to be a concern related to the health and welfare of the general public and the environment and
that are widespread across the U.S. The CAA of 1970, 42 U.S.C. 7402, et seq., amended in 1977 and
again in 1990, is the primary federal statute governing the control of air quality. Under the authority of
the CAA, the EPA designates pollutants as “criteria pollutants” for which National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS) have been established to protect public health and welfare. With EPA oversight,
states may set concentration levels for additional pollutants not regulated by the EPA. The State of Rhode
Island administers the provisions of the majority of the CAA.

Draft EIS

3-26

March 2016

The CAA designates pollutants as “criteria pollutants” for which NAAQS have been established to
protect public health and welfare and the environment. “Criteria pollutants” are particularly an issue in
developed countries such as the U.S. and include the following: particulate matter less than 10 microns in
diameter (PM10) and less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), and ozone (O3) (see Table 3.6-1). The CAA established two
types of NAAQS: Primary standards set limits to protect public health, including the health of “sensitive”
populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly. Secondary standards set limits to protect public
welfare, including protection against decreased visibility, damage to animals, crops, vegetation, and
buildings (U.S. EPA 2015a).
A geographic area with air quality that meets the primary standard, because its air is as clean as or cleaner
than the standard, is called an “attainment” area. Areas that do not meet NAAQS for criteria pollutants
are designated “nonattainment areas” for that pollutant. Areas that achieve the air quality standard after
being designated nonattainment are redesignated as attainment following EPA approval of a maintenance
plan. In areas that exceed the NAAQS, the CAA requires preparation of a state implementation plan
(SIP). The SIP details how the state will attain the standards within mandated time frames. Both the
federal CAA and the state CAA identify emission-reduction goals and compliance dates based upon the
severity of the NAAQS violation within a region. The CAA prohibits federal agencies from engaging in,
supporting, providing financial assistance for licensing, permitting, or approving any activity that does
not conform to an applicable SIP. Federal agencies must determine that a federal action conforms to the
SIP before proceeding with the action. This determination is conducted in accordance with the General
Conformity Rule (40 CFR 93).
The location of the proposed action is in Newport County, Rhode Island, and is part of the Providence,
Rhode Island air quality region, which encompasses all of Rhode Island. The state is under the
jurisdiction of the RIDEM for air quality, which implements Air Pollution Control Regulations pursuant
to Rhode Island General Laws § 42-17.1-2(s) and 23-23, as amended, and have been promulgated
pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act, Rhode Island
General Laws, Chapter 42-35 (RIDEM 2013a). Rhode Island is in attainment for all NAAQS (EPA
2015b). Rhode Island had previously been designated nonattainment for the 1997 ozone standard;
however, on March 6, 2015 EPA revoked the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS (80 FR 12264; Federal
Register 2015). The Region is currently in attainment for all NAAQS (U.S. EPA 2015b).
3.6.1.1
General Conformity
The EPA General Conformity Rule applies to federal actions occurring in nonattainment or maintenance
areas when the total direct and indirect emissions of nonattainment pollutants (or their precursors) exceed
specified thresholds. The emission thresholds that trigger requirements for a conformity analysis are
called de minimis levels. De minimis levels (in tons per year) vary from pollutant to pollutant and also
depend on the severity of the nonattainment status (see Table 3.6-2).
A conformity applicability analysis, the first step of a conformity evaluation, assesses whether a federal
action must be supported by a conformity determination. This is typically done by quantifying applicable
direct and indirect emissions that are projected to result due to implementation of the federal action.
Indirect emissions are those emissions caused by the federal action, originate in the region of interest but
may occur at a later time and/or in a different location from the action itself, and are reasonably
foreseeable. The federal agency can control and maintains control over the indirect action through its
continuing program responsibility.

Description

Ozone is formed in the atmosphere
rather than being directly emitted
from pollutant sources. Ozone
forms as a result of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and oxides of
nitrogen (NOX) reacting in the
presence of sunlight in the
atmosphere. VOCs and NOX are
termed “ozone precursors,” and
their emissions are regulated in
order to control the creation of
ozone.
Particulate matter consists of solid
and liquid particles of dust, soot,
aerosols, and other matter small
enough to remain suspended in the
air for a long period of time. PM2.5
refers to particulate matter less than
or equal to 2.5 micrometers in
diameter. PM10 refers to particulate
matter less than or equal to 10
microns in diameter.
A portion of the particulate matter
in the air comes from natural
sources such as windblown dust and
pollen. Other sources of particulate
matter include material combustion,
automobiles, construction activities
or other man-made disturbances of
unpaved areas, and photochemical
reactions in the atmosphere.

3.6.1.2
Hazardous Air Pollutants
In addition to the ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants, national standards exist for
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), which are regulated under Section 112(b) of the 1990 CAA
Amendments. NESHAPs regulates HAP emissions from stationary sources (40 CFR Part 61). HAPs
emitted from mobile sources are called mobile source air toxics (MSATs). MSATs are compounds
emitted from highway vehicles and non-road equipment that are known or suspected to cause cancer or
other serious health and environmental effects. In 2001, the EPA issued its first MSATs Rule, which
identified 21 compounds as being HAPs that required regulation. A subset of six of these MSAT
compounds were identified as having the greatest influence on health: benzene, 1,3-butadiene,
formaldehyde, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and diesel particulate matter. The EPA issued a second MSAT
Rule in February 2007 that generally supported the findings in the first rule and provided additional
recommendations about compounds having the greatest impact on health. The rule also identified several
engine-emission certification standards that must be implemented (40 CFR parts 59, 80, 85, and 86; FR
72 No. 37, pp. 8427-8570, 2007).
Unlike the criteria pollutants, there are no NAAQS for benzene and other HAPs. The primary control
methodologies for these pollutants for mobile sources involves reducing their content in fuel and altering
the engine operating characteristics to reduce the volume of pollutant generated during combustion.
3.6.1.3
Greenhouse Gases
GHGs are gas emissions that trap heat in the atmosphere. These emissions occur from natural processes
and human activities. Scientific evidence indicates a trend of increasing global temperature over the past
century due to an increase in GHG emissions from human activities. The climate change associated with
this global warming is predicted to produce negative economic and social consequences across the globe.
Climate change refers to any significant change in measures of climate lasting for an extended period.
Global climate change threatens ecosystems, water resources, coastal regions, crop and livestock
production, and human health (U.S. EPA 2014). Many scientific studies correlate the observed rise in
global annual average temperature and the resulting change in global climate patterns with the increase in
GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. World-wide use of fossil fuels is the primary cause of that increase
(U.S. EPA 2014).
The EPA issued the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule on September 22, 2009.
GHGs covered under the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule are carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and other
fluorinated gases, including nitrogen trifluoride and hydrofluorinated ethers. Each GHG is assigned a
global warming potential (GWP). The GWP is the ability of a gas or aerosol to trap heat in the
atmosphere. The GWP rating system is standardized to CO2, which has a value of one. For example,
methane (CH4) has a GWP of 25, which means that it has a global warming effect 25 times greater than
CO2 on an equal mass basis. The equivalent CO2 rate is calculated by multiplying the emission of each
GHG by its GWP and adding the results together to produce a single, combined emission rate
representing all GHGs. Under the rule, suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial GHGs, manufacturers of
mobile sources and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year of GHG
emissions as CO2 equivalent (CO2e) are required to submit annual reports to the EPA.
On a national scale, federal agencies are addressing emissions of GHGs by reductions mandated in federal
laws and EOs. On March 19, 2015, President Obama issued EO 13693, “Planning for Federal
Sustainability in the Next Decade,” which requires federal agencies to meet emission-reduction goals
associated with energy use, water use, building design and utilization, fleet vehicles, and procurement and
acquisition decisions. The CEQ provided federal agencies with implementation guidance and plans to

Draft EIS

3-32

March 2016

meet these new goals in June 2015 (CEQ 2015).GHG emissions occur locally, but GHG impacts are both
global in scale and cumulative over time.
On December 18, 2014, the CEQ issued new draft guidance “to provide Federal agencies direction on
when and how to consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their evaluation of
proposed federal actions in accordance with NEPA and CEQ Regulations implementing the NEPA”
(CEQ 2014). This guidance states that projects with GHG emissions greater than 25, 000 metric tons
CO2e should report quantified GHG emissions (CEQ 2014).

3.6.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

The existing environment as it pertains to air quality was assessed through a review of regional air quality
data, including NAAQS attainment status. Additionally existing sources of emissions were identified (if
applicable).

3.6.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

Annual criteria pollutant emissions from all direct and indirect sources associated with the existing
conditions and all alternatives to this action are considered to determine the annual impact on the region.
While the effects of Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 at the four surplus properties are generally considered
in this document on a property-by-property basis, air quality total emissions from all four properties
occurring at the same time are considered because they would occur within the same air quality region.
Total emissions from the operation of all facilities, buildings, and residential units as well as vehicle
usage in roadways before and after implementation are analyzed to evaluate the direct and indirect
changes in emissions.
Construction and Operational Emissions
Sources of potential emissions associated with the proposed action fall into two categories: construction
and operational. Temporary emissions from construction equipment, construction materials delivery, and
construction employee commute have also been considered. These emissions are considered separately
from operational emissions because they would occur before full implementation of the action and only
during the period of construction. Air emissions would result from demolition, material removal,
renovation, building and road construction, and worker commutes and material deliveries. Soil, fill
material, concrete, sheet pile, asphalt, and other construction materials and equipment would be
transported to and from the site by truck. Operational emissions would occur after construction is
complete.
Building emission sources were estimated based on U.S. averages for typical energy types (i.e.,
electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas) for energy use per square foot, obtained from the U.S. Department of
Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) for specific types of building use (U.S. Department of
Energy EIA 2003; 2009). Vehicle emissions were estimated using the California Air Resources Board’s
EMFAC model (California Air Resources Board n.d.) for most conservative assumptions for the year
2020 (see Appendix D for details on assumptions and calculations for these estimates).
General Conformity Rule
Under the exclusions at Section 40 CFR 93.1539(c), the General Conformity Rule does not apply to this
federal BRAC action. Additionally, since the 1997 8-hour ozone standard was revoked in 2015(80 FR
12264; Federal Register 2015), Rhode Island is currently in attainment for all NAAQS (EPA 2015b), and
therefore the Conformity Rule does not apply.
Under the General Conformity Rule, a federal action is exempt if the action’s total net emissions are
below the de minimis levels (see Table 3.6-2) specified in the rule. While not applicable to the action, the

Draft EIS

3-33

March 2016

de minimis thresholds under the General Conformity Rule have been used to consider the potential level
of significance of the air quality impacts under NEPA. If the resulting emissions are below these
thresholds, it is assumed that the action would not result in a significant impact on air quality.
GHG Emissions
Emissions of GHG are also considered in order to evaluate whether the action would result in total annual
GHG emissions over the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule reporting threshold of
25,000 metric tons, above which CEQ requires reporting of the quantification of GHG emissions (CEQ
2014).

Noise
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

3.7.1.1
Noise Fundamentals
Noise can be defined as any unwanted sound. Sound becomes noise when it interferes with normal
activities such as sleep and conversation. The principal human response to noise is annoyance. Human
response can vary according to the type and source of the noise, the distance between the source and the
human receptor, the perceived importance of the noise, its appropriateness in the setting, and the
sensitivity of the person receiving the noise (the receptor).
A noise-sensitive receptor is defined as a location or facility where people involved in indoor or outdoor
activities may be subject to stress or considerable interference from noise. Such locations or facilities
often include residential dwellings, hospitals, nursing homes, educational facilities, and libraries.
Sensitive noise receptors may also include supporting habitat for certain wildlife species or noisesensitive cultural practices.
The measurement and human perception of sound involves three basic physical characteristics: intensity,
frequency, and duration. Intensity is a measure of the acoustic energy of the sound vibrations and is
expressed in terms of sound pressure. As sound pressure increases, the energy carried by the sound
increases, and the perception of loudness of that sound increases as well. Frequency is the number of
times per second the air vibrates or oscillates. Low-frequency sounds are characterized as rumbles or
roars, while sirens or screeches typify high-frequency sounds. Duration is the length of time the sound can
be detected.
The loudest sounds that can be detected comfortably by the human ear have intensities that are a trillion
times higher than those of sounds that can barely be detected. Because of this vast range, using a linear
scale to represent the intensity of sound becomes very unwieldy. As a result, a logarithmic unit known as
the decibel (dB) is used to represent the intensity of a sound. Such a representation is called a sound level.
A sound level of zero dB is approximately the threshold of human hearing and is barely audible under
extremely quiet listening conditions. Normal speech has a sound level of approximately 60 dB and a
garbage disposal has a sound level of about 80 dB; sound levels above 120 dB begin to be felt inside the
human ear as discomfort. Sound levels between 130 and 140 dB are felt as pain (Berglund and Lindvall
1995).
The A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) is the primary descriptor of sound for human use. Noise
measurements assessed relative to human exposure are usually expressed using an “A-weighted” scale
that filters out very low and very high frequencies in order to replicate human sensitivity. It is common to
add the letter “A” to the unit of measurement (dBA) in order to identify that the measurement has been

Draft EIS

3-34

made with this filtering process. Human hearing ranges from approximately 0 dBA (the threshold of
hearing) to between 130 and 140 dBA (the threshold of pain).
Table 3.7-1 list some typical sources and levels of noise and corresponding human responses to the noise.

Human response to changes in sound levels depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the
sound, the magnitude of the changes, the time of day at which the changes take place, whether the noise is
continuous or intermittent, and the individual’s ability to perceive the changes. Human ability to perceive
changes in noise levels varies widely with the individual. Generally, changes in noise levels less than 3
average-weighted decibels (dBA) will be barely perceptible to most listeners, whereas a 10 dBA change is
normally perceived as a doubling (or halving) of noise levels. As the change in dBA increases, the
individual perception is greater, as shown in Table 3.7-2.

Because of the logarithmic nature of the dB unit, sound levels cannot be arithmetically added or
subtracted and are somewhat cumbersome to handle mathematically. However, some simple rules are
useful in dealing with sound levels. First, if a sound’s intensity is doubled, the sound level increases by 3
dB, regardless of the initial sound level (Berglund and Lindvall 1995). For example:
60 dB+ 60 dB =63 dB
80 dB+ 80 dB =83 dB
Second, the total sound level produced by two sounds of different levels is usually only slightly more than
the higher of the two. For example:
60 dB + 70 dB =70.4 dB
The minimum change in the sound level of individual events that an average human ear can detect is
about 3 dB. On average, a person perceives a change in sound level of about 10 dB as a doubling (or
halving) of the sound’s loudness, and this relation holds true for loud and quiet sounds. A decrease in
sound level of 10 dB actually represents a 90 percent decrease in sound intensity but only a 50 percent
decrease in perceived loudness because of the nonlinear response of the human ear (similar to most
human senses).
The sound pressure level (SPL) that humans experience typically varies from moment to moment.
Therefore, various descriptions are used to evaluate noise levels over time. Commonly used descriptors
include the continuous equivalent sound level (Leq) and the level exceeded for 90 percent of the time
(L90).
• The continuous equivalent sound level is the sound energy from the fluctuating SPLs
averaged over time to create a single number to describe the mean energy, or intensity
level.
•

The noise level exceeded for 90 percent of the time is generally considered to be
representative of the background or ambient level of a noise environment.

3.7.1.2
Regulatory Authority
The State of Rhode Island does not have regulations that set community noise exposure criteria. A
community may establish noise regulations through community by-laws.

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing sound levels in the project area are primarily determined by motor vehicle traffic on roads within
NAVSTA Newport and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) and on nearby off-base roads, and
the wind in trees, waves, buoy bells, and aircraft overhead. Traffic noise depends upon the volume and
speed of traffic and the number of trucks in the flow of the traffic. Vehicle noise is a combination of the
noises produced by the engine, exhaust, and tires.
The existing acoustical environment for the City of Newport and towns of Middletown and Portsmouth
was characterized during a baseline sound monitoring study associated with the proposed development of
wind energy facilities at NAVSTA Newport (Tech Environmental 2011). As part of the study, existing
sound levels were measured continuously at three monitoring stations (see Figure 3.7-1) over three
periods in December 2010.
In addition, noise levels from existing vehicle traffic in the vicinity of each of the surplus properties were
modeled using traffic noise model (TNM) model version 2.5, which was developed by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA). Traffic volumes and vehicle mix data, which are inputs to the model,
were taken from the traffic study conducted for this proposed action, Traffic Impact Analysis for the
Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013) (see Section
3.4 and Appendix C).

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

Noise levels were modeled to evaluate impacts on the ambient noise environment during construction and
during operation.
Construction
Noise impacts during construction activities would include construction equipment operating on the
surplus properties and delivery vehicles traveling to and from the sites. Noise impacts would vary widely,
depending on the phase of construction (e.g., demolition, land clearing and excavations, foundation,
construction of new building walls, etc.) and the specific task being undertaken. Increased noise levels
would be most significant during the early stages of each construction phase, although these periods
would be of relatively short duration.
Construction and demolition activities associated with the proposed action would involve operating
construction equipment and commercial vehicles traveling to and from the surplus properties during
regular working, daylight hours. Noise from construction equipment is typically intermittent. For
example, an air compressor will normally be quiet for a period of time (perhaps half an hour or so,
depending on intensity of use) and then will make noise for a few minutes as it compresses more air. At a
distance of 50 feet from a construction or demolition site, noise from the various types of equipment will,
at times, range from 80 to 95 dBA.
Noise levels generated by construction activities such as pilings removal, dock construction, building
demolition and new building construction were analyzed A construction noise model was used to
determine projected noise levels at various distances and receptor locations during a typical hour for each
phase of construction. The algorithm in the model considered construction equipment noise specification
data, usage factors, and the relative distances of the noise-sensitive receptor to the source of noise.
The following logarithmic equation was used to compute projected noise levels:
Lp1 = Lp2 + 10log(U.F.) – 20log(d1/d2):
where:
Lp1 =

the average noise level (in dBA) at a noise sensitive receptor due to the operation of a unit of
equipment throughout the day

Lp2 =

the equipment noise level (dBA) at a reference distance (d2)

U.F. =

a usage factor that accounts for a fraction of time an equipment unit is in use throughout the day

d1

=

the distance from the receiver to the unit of equipment in feet

d2

=

the distance at which equipment noise level data is known (reference distance = 50 feet).

Noise levels (Leq) and usage factor data for construction equipment were obtained from the equipment
manufacturer and government publications. Usage factors were used to account for the fact that
construction equipment use is intermittent throughout the course of a normal workday. The usage factors
were selected from Table 9.1 in the FHWA Highway Construction Noise Handbook (Federal Highway
Administration 2006).

Operation
Noise resulting from the operation of the four sites would arise mainly from an increase in traffic on the
local streets around the sites. Building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems would
not be expected to contribute significantly to the existing background sound levels at the nearest
receptors.
Noise levels from the projected vehicle traffic following the redevelopment at each of the surplus
properties were modeled using TNM version 2.5. Traffic volumes and vehicle mix data, which are inputs
to the model, were taken from the traffic study conducted for this proposed action, Traffic Impact
Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation
2013).
The FHWA provides policies and guidance for the analysis of highway traffic noise and abatement of
highway traffic noise that were adopted by the RIDOT. FHWA-established criteria that represent the
upper limit of acceptable traffic noise levels in areas based on defined land use are identified in Table
3.7-4.
Noise impacts occur when the predicted traffic noise levels approach within 1 dBA of the noise abatement
criteria (see Table 3.7-4) corresponding equivalent sound level (Federal Highway Administration 1995).
Based on this, 66 dBA effectively becomes the noise abatement criterion for the residential land use
category, or when the predicted traffic noise levels substantially exceed (are more than 15 dBA) the
existing noise levels. Traffic noise impacts can occur below the noise abatement criteria. The noise
abatement criteria should not be viewed as federal standards or desirable noise levels. The noise
abatement criteria should only be used as absolute values which, when approached or exceeded, require
that traffic noise abatement measures be considered.

Infrastructure and Utilities
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

The focus of this section is on infrastructure and service components that could be temporarily or
permanently impacted by the proposed action.
“Infrastructure” is the underlying framework of a system. Utility systems—water supply, wastewater
management, storm water management, and electricity and natural gas generation and distribution—rely
on the underlying systems of generation, protection, and transmission: potable water is made available
through either municipal or public water systems; wastewater is managed through municipal wastewater
treatment systems or individual, on-site septic systems; electricity is generated and transmitted through a
series of stations and lines; and natural gas is transmitted through pipelines to supply heat. With the
exception of the regulations discussed below regarding storm water management, there are no specific
statutes that govern the provision of other utilities. This section also addresses solid waste management.
Storm Water
Storm water is rainwater and snowmelt that falls onto surfaces such as roofs, streets, and the ground and
is not absorbed or retained by that surface but flows off, collecting volume and energy, as well as
pollutants from land uses (i.e., roadways, agricultural fields). Storm water runoff management addresses
reducing flow energy and pollutants in storm water and controlling discharge from point and non-point
sources into waterbodies. Non-point source runoff is discharge to a waterbody from diffuse sources.
Point-source discharge is produced by a single, identifiable point source.
Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 requires that any development
or redevelopment project involving a federal facility with a footprint exceeding 5,000 square feet shall use
site planning, design, construction, and maintenance strategies in order to maintain or restore the
predevelopment hydrology of the property with regard to temperature, rate, volume, and duration of flow.
Compliance with this requirement can be met through the implementation of low-impact development
(LID) technologies.
The U.S. Navy has developed a LID policy for storm water management, which was released in
December 2007. This policy focuses on the implementation of LID techniques in lieu of conventional
storm water collection and conveyance systems, because the conventional measures cannot replicate
natural systems and can result in increased storm water volume and flow as well as adverse water quality
impacts on the receiving waterbodies (U.S. Department of the Navy 2007c). LID techniques include a
variety of best management practices (BMPs) that maintain or restore predevelopment hydrology and
reduce pollutant loading of storm water. Examples of LID BMPs include bioretention (vegetated
depressions that collect runoff and facilitate infiltration), filter strips (dense vegetation designed to filter
runoff), grassed swales (shallow, grass-lined channels used to convey and store runoff), and permeable
pavement.
The U.S. Navy’s LID policy sets a goal of no net increase in storm water volume and sediment or nutrient
loading from major renovation and construction projects. This policy dictates that LID be considered in
the design for all projects that have a storm water management component (U.S. Department of the Navy
2007c).
Storm water management in the State of Rhode Island is regulated by the RIDEM, Office of Water
Resources. The Regulations for the Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System stipulate when
a permit is needed for discharges of storm water. In 2010, RIDEM issued a revised Stormwater Design
and Installation Standards Manual that requires recharge or infiltration of a portion of storm water into the

Draft EIS

3-42

March 2016

ground and use of LID techniques as the primary method of storm water control (RIDEM and CRMC
2010).
Solid Waste
Non-hazardous solid wastes are regulated under RCRA and the regulations in 40 CFR Parts 239 to 259.
RCRA provides requirements for state solid waste programs, solid waste incineration, municipal solid
waste landfills, and recycling and materials recovery. The RIDEM Office of Waste Management and
Office of Environmental Coordination regulate solid waste management in Rhode Island under the
authority of numerous laws and associated regulations, including Solid Waste Regulation Numbers 1
through 8, as well as Rules and Regulations for Reduction and Recycling of Commercial and NonMunicipal Residential Solid Waste (RIDEM 1996). Collectively, the regulations address requirements
for solid waste management facilities, landfills, transfer stations, incinerators, resource recovery, waste
tire handling, petroleum-contaminated soil, construction and demolition (C&D) debris, composting, and
recycling.
The NAVSTA Newport Environmental Division manages solid waste in accordance with the following:
•

The Solid Waste Management Plan, which provides guidance for solid waste
management at the installation, including education, collection, recycling, storage, and
disposal (Nobis Engineering, Inc. 2003).

•

NAVSTA Newport Instruction 5090.3C, Recycling Materials Program, which provides
general naval instruction for recycling (U.S. Department of the Navy 2007d).

•

Commander Navy Region Mid-Atlantic Instruction 5090.5, Integrated Solid Waste
Management Program (ISWMP) and Qualified Recycling Program (QRP), which
provides general naval instruction for managing solid waste and accomplishing recycling
in accordance with DOD goals and requirements (U.S. Department of the Navy 2008).

Operations and activities at the installation routinely result in the generation of non-hazardous solid
wastes that consist largely of mixed trash, paper, cardboard, food waste, C&D waste (e.g., wood,
concrete, building materials), industrial scrap materials (e.g., wood, metal), and household waste, much of
which is recyclable (Nobis Engineering, Inc. 2003). NAVSTA Newport has a 50 percent diversion rate
goal (CNIC n.d.[f]), i.e., to divert 50 percent of solid waste from disposal via methods, such as recycling
and reuse.

3.8.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

To assess existing conditions, information on existing infrastructure and utilities was obtained from
various sources and reviewed for an indication of current condition and capacity.

3.8.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

For each alternative, an analysis was undertaken to determine future water, wastewater, electric, and
natural gas demand. This future demand was then compared with the known future capacity of municipal
systems to determine whether that capacity can be met or whether additional capacity would be needed.
A summary description of the methodology used in calculating these projections, along with the
assumptions and definitions of multipliers, is presented in Appendix D.
For solid waste, potential impacts associated with generating and managing solid waste were evaluated
for each alternative. Where possible, this included calculating or estimating quantities of C&D wastes
that would be generated from the planned construction and demolition activities. The methodology for
those calculations is provided in Appendix D.

Cultural Resources
Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Cultural resources are historic districts, sites, buildings, structures, or objects considered important to a
culture, subculture, or community for scientific, traditional, religious, or other purposes. They include
archaeological resources, historic architectural/engineering resources, and traditional resources. Cultural
resources that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are called historic
properties and are evaluated for potential adverse impacts from a major federal action. In addition, some
cultural resources, such as Native American sacred sites or traditional resources, may not be historic
properties, but they are also evaluated under NEPA for potential adverse effects from a major federal
action. These resources are identified through consultation with appropriate Native American or other
interested groups.
National Historic Preservation Act
Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470) requires federal agencies to identify
historic properties within the proposed project’s area of potential effect (APE). The APE is the geographic
area within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or use of
historic properties, if such properties exist. The APE is influenced by the scale and nature of the
undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking. Generally, an
area broader than the project footprint must be considered. Federal agencies must also determine what
potential effects the proposed project may have on identified historic properties and consult with the
SHPO on determinations of eligibility and findings of effects. For undertakings occurring on or affecting
historic properties on American Indian tribal lands, Federal agencies must consult with the Tribal Historic
Preservation Officer (THPO) in lieu of the SHPO.
If the proposed project adversely affects an identified historic property, further consultation with the
SHPO or THPO is required to avoid or minimize the adverse effect. To be considered eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, cultural resources must be determined to be significant by meeting one or more of
the criteria outlined in 36 CFR 60.4 (NRHP, Criteria for Evaluation). A historic property must also
possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. A property
must be 50 years old or older to be considered for eligibility to the NRHP or must have achieved
exceptional importance within the last 50 years. For example, more recent historic resources on a military
installation may be considered significant if they are of exceptional importance in understanding the Cold
War.
Tribal Treaty Rights and Trust Responsibilities
Treaties with American Indian tribes are considered government to government agreements, similar to
international treaties, and preempt state laws. Treaty language securing fishing and hunting rights is not a
“grant of rights (from the federal government to the Indians), but a grant of rights from them - a
reservation of those not granted” (United States v. Winans 1905). This means that the tribes retain rights
not specifically surrendered to the United States. Furthermore, the United States has a trust or special
relationship with American Indian tribes. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce,
pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, issued Secretarial Order 3206, American Indian Tribal
Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities. This order states the following: “The unique and distinctive
political relationship between the United States and the Indian Tribes is defined by statutes, EOs, judicial
decisions, and agreements, and differentiates tribes from other entities that deal with, or are affected by,
the federal government.”
This unique relationship provides the basis for legislation, treaties, and EOs that grant unique rights or
privileges to American Indians (Morton v. Mancari 1974). The trust responsibility has been interpreted to

Draft EIS

3-44

March 2016

require federal agencies to carry out their activities in a manner that is protective of American Indian
treaty rights. EO 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) affirms the trust
responsibility of the United States and directs agencies to consult with American Indian tribes and respect
tribal sovereignty when taking actions affecting such rights. This policy is also reflected in the March 30,
1995, document, Department of Commerce - American Indian and Alaska Native Policy (United States
Department of Commerce 1995). Also, on November 21, 1999, the DOD promulgated its Native
American and Alaska Native Policy emphasizing the importance of respecting and consulting with tribal
governments on a government-to-government basis. The policy requires an assessment, through
consultation, of the effects of proposed DOD actions that may have the potential to significantly affect
protected tribal resources, tribal rights, and Native American lands before decisions are made by the
services.
Other Federal Laws, Regulations, and Executive Orders
Under NEPA, the Navy is required to demonstrate that the proposed action is in compliance with NHPA
of 1966, as amended, as described above. For actions on federal lands, the Navy is also required to
comply with a number of other federal laws, regulations, and executive orders relating to cultural
resources where applicable, including the following: The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of
1974, EO 11593 (Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment; signed in 1971); the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990; the American Indian Religious Freedom Act
of 1978; and EO 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites; signed in 1996).

3.9.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing conditions related to cultural resources were identified based on the results of Phase I
archaeological investigations and the architectural survey and evaluation update conducted for the
proposed action (Gould and LeeDecker 2014; Groesbeck and Bedford 2014, respectively). Additional
information for existing conditions related to cultural resources was identified based on the results of
earlier cultural resources investigations at NAVSTA Newport and the results of Navy’s consultation for
the proposed action in accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA and its implementing regulations at 36
CFR Part 800.

According to 36 CFR 800.16(d), the APE is the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking
may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties, if such properties
exist. The Navy, in consultation with the Rhode Island SHPO, determined that the APE for the proposed
action consists of the areas within the boundaries of the surplus property (Preston 2013; Sanderson
2013a). For the purposes of assessing the existing environment for cultural resources, the Navy
considered the cultural resources and historic properties identified within the APE for the proposed
action. The Navy also evaluated historic properties outside the APE as part of the re-assessment of two
historic districts that would be affected by the proposed action (the NRHP-eligible U.S. Naval Hospital
Newport Historic District and the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District).
In 2013, the Navy conducted a Phase I archaeological investigation within the APE for the proposed
action, the results of which are presented in the Final Phase I Archaeological Investigation, Five Areas
for BRAC Disposal, U.S. Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island report (Gould and LeeDecker
2014). The purpose of this investigation was to supplement or confirm the findings of previous
archaeological investigations, presented in the Cultural Resources Survey, U.S. Naval Complex, Newport,
Rhode Island (Louis Berger & Associates, Inc. 1998) and/or summarized in the Integrated Cultural
Resources Management Plan (2010-2014), Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2010a).
Additionally, in 2013, the Navy conducted an architectural survey and evaluation update for the proposed
action, the results of which are presented in the Final Architectural Survey and Evaluation Update, U.S.
Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014). The purpose of this
investigation was to supplement or confirm the findings of previous architectural surveys and NRHPeligibility evaluations, presented in the Cultural Resources Survey, U.S. Naval Complex, Newport, Rhode
Island (Louis Berger & Associates, Inc. 1998) and/or summarized in the Integrated Cultural Resources
Management Plan (2010-2014), Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island (U.S. Department of the
Navy 2010a).
The cultural resources identified within the APE from all of the studies, including archaeological
resources, architectural resources, and/or Native American resources, are described in order to
demonstrate that the proposed action is in compliance with NEPA. The cultural resources that meet
National Register eligibility criteria (36 CFR Part 63) and have been identified as historic properties are
also described as part of demonstrating that the proposed action was in compliance with Section 106 of
the NHPA. NRHP-eligibility criteria are presented below in Tables 3.9-1 and 3.9-2.

National Register of Historic Places Criteria for Historic Significance
36 CFR 60.4, Part I

The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
36 CFR 60.4, Part II

Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions
or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed
historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved
significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register. However,
such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall
within the following categories:
A. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical
importance; or
B. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for
architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic
person or event; or
C A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or
building directly associated with his productive life; or
D A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance,
from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or
E. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a
dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the
same association has survived; or
F. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, traditions, or symbolic value has invested
it with its own exceptional significance; or
G. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance.

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

The impacts of each alternative on cultural resources were evaluated in terms of whether they were direct
or indirect, temporary or permanent, beneficial or negative, and/or associated with construction or postconstruction activities, for NEPA compliance purposes. Measures developed by Navy to avoid,
minimize, or mitigate impacts on cultural resources were identified as part of evaluating environmental
consequences where appropriate and necessary. The effects of impacts on historic properties were
separately evaluated by Navy as part of compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and its implementing
regulations at 36 CFR Part 800. The criteria of adverse effects are presented in Table 3.9-3. The Section
106 compliance process consisted of Navy consultation with the Rhode Island SHPO, federally
recognized Indian tribes, and other consulting parties to identify the APE for the proposed action,
determine the NRHP-eligibility of cultural resources within the APE, determine the effects of the
alternatives for future development on historic properties, and develop measures stipulated in an
agreement document to mitigate any adverse effects of future development on historic properties.
Table 3.9-3

Findings of Effect on Historic Properties

Finding of No Historic Properties Affected (No Effect on Historic Properties)

“If the agency official finds that either there are no historic properties present or there are historic
properties present but the undertaking will have no effect upon them as defined in §800.16(i), the agency
shall provide documentation of this finding, as set forth in §800.11(d), to the SHPO/THPO” (36 CFR
800.4[d][1]).
Finding of No Adverse Effect

“If the agency official finds that there are historic properties which may be affected by the undertaking,

the agency official shall notify all consulting parties, including Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian
organizations, invite their views on the effects and assess adverse effects, if any, in accordance with
§800.5” (36 CFR 800.4[d][2]). “The agency official, in consultation with the SHPO/THPO may propose
a finding of no adverse effect when the undertakings’ effects do not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)
[of 36 CFR 800.5] or the undertaking is modified or conditions are imposed, such as the subsequent
review of plans for rehabilitation by the SHPO/THPO …to avoid adverse effects” (36 CFR 800.5[b]).
The agency official shall maintain a record of the finding of no adverse effect and provide information
on the finding to the public on request consistent with the confidentiality provisions of §800.11(c)” (36
CFR 800.5[d][1]).
Finding of Adverse Effect

“An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the

characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register in a
manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, or association. Consideration shall be given to all qualifying characteristics of a historic
property, including those that may have been identified subsequent to the original evaluation of the
property’s eligibility for the National Register. Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable
effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be farther removed in distance or
cumulative” (36 CFR 800.5[a][1]).

hazardous material remediation and provision of handicapped access that is not consistent with the
Secretary’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR Part 68) and applicable
guidelines
■ Removal of the property from its historic location
■ Change of the character of the property’s use or of physical features within the property’s setting
that contribute to its historic significance
■ Introduction of visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s
significant historic features
■ Neglect of a property which causes its deterioration, except where such neglect and deterioration are
recognized qualities of a property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native
Hawaiian organization

3.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils
3.10.1

Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

“Topography” is the description or delineation of the physical surface characteristics of the land, e.g.,
slope, elevation, and general surface features. “Soils” refers to unconsolidated earthen materials
overlying bedrock or other parent material. “Geology” deals with the dynamics and physical history of
the earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the physical, chemical, and biological changes that the
earth has undergone or is undergoing. Bathymetry refers to the measurement of water depth at various
points within a body of water. Marine sediments are the deposits of rock and soil particles that are
transported from land areas and that accumulate on the seafloor.
Farmland Protection Policy Act
The Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) and its implementing regulations (7 CFR 658 et seq.) require
that federal agencies identify and take into account adverse effects of federal programs on the protection
of farmland. Agencies are to consider proposed actions and alternatives to lessen any adverse effects on
farmlands and, to the extent practicable, be compatible with state and local programs to protect farmland.
According to the FPPA, protected farmland includes prime farmland soils, unique soils, or statewide or
locally important soils.

3.10.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing conditions related to topography, soils, and geology were characterized by reviewing U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps; Rhode Island soil surveys; U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO),
and the USGS geologic maps, physiographic provinces maps, and earthquake hazards database. Existing
conditions related to bathymetry and marine sediments were characterized primarily by reviewing Rhode
Island geographic information system (GIS) layers.

3.10.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

The impact of the proposed action on prime farmland, as defined under the FFPA, and on various soil
characteristics and limitations was assessed for each alternative.
Draft EIS

3-49

March 2016

Soil Characteristics and Limitations
•

Prime Farmland. Soils that are particularly well-suited for use as farmland are classified
by the NRCS as prime farmland. Some soils that are naturally wet in their undisturbed
state may be considered prime farmland if drained.

•

Farmland of Statewide Importance. Soils important for farming use may be considered
farmland of statewide importance or unique farmland. Farmlands of statewide importance
are not typically as ideal for farmland use as prime farmland but are productive and are
used widely within a given state.

•

Erosion Potential. In general, soils with steeper slopes have greater potential for erosion
via precipitation. Soils with moderate or severe erosion potential require a higher level of
water management and vegetative-cover BMPs than soils with low erosion potential.

•

Hydric Soils. Hydric soils are soils that remain saturated at or near the surface for
sufficient periods of the year during the growing season to create anaerobic conditions.
Hydric soils may require special measures during construction or other uses to overcome
limitations cause by wetness. Limitations may include a high water table or low strength
for supporting construction equipment and structures.

•

Constructability. Constructability can be defined by soil strength and the presence of
saturated layers near the soil surface. Some soils present construction limitations due to
high shrink-swell ratios, which must be accounted for in the design of structural
foundations. Individual soils have different inherent abilities to withstand loading from
heavy equipment, buildings, roads, and other structures. Soil strength is influenced by
wetness, mineralogy, soil-particle shape and size distribution, and soil structure. Such
limitations do not necessarily mean the soil cannot be used for a given purpose but rather
that the construction methods and structural designs may require additional elements to
overcome limitations. Costs usually increase when addressing the limiting soil qualities.

Frost action can destabilize roadways and shallow excavations unless specific design and construction
measures are taken to manage dimensional changes due to freezing and thawing of water in the soil.
Hydric soils may be associated with wetlands that are subject to regulation by federal and/or state
regulation. The wet conditions associated with hydric soils may also present limit development activities
such as excavation and the movement of heavy equipment.
In general, a proposed action would adversely impact topography and soils for the following reasons:

•

Results in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil

•

Results in the loss of prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance

•

Is located on a geologic unit, topography, or soil that is unstable, or that would become
unstable as a result of the proposed project, and potentially result in on-site or off-site
landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction, or collapse

•

Additionally, the impact of the proposed action on bathymetry and marine sediments was assessed by
determining whether existing bathymetric contours or marine sediments would be significantly altered or
disturbed as a result of in-water activities.

3.11 Water Resources
3.11.1

Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

Water resources discussed in the EIS are defined below and include surface water, groundwater,
floodplains, and wetlands.
Surface Water
Surface water includes streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Water quality describes the chemical and
physical composition of water as affected by natural conditions and human activities. The CWA (33
U.S.C. §1251), established the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the
United States. The CWA contains the requirements to set water quality standards for all contaminants in
surface waters. The EPA is the designated regulatory authority to implement pollution control programs
and other requirements of the CWA. However, the EPA delegates regulatory authority for the CWA to the
applicable state agency for the implementation of pollution control programs as well as other CWA
requirements. In Rhode Island, RIDEM issues Water Quality Certifications under Section 401 of the
CWA. The USACE authorizes discharges of fill into waters of the U.S. under Section 404 of the CWA.
The Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) regulates development and
use of the nation's navigable waterways. Section 10 of the Act prohibits unauthorized obstruction or
alteration of navigable waters and vests the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) with authority to
regulate discharges of fill and other materials into such waters.
The CWA designates water quality standards and establishes permitting and certification processes.
Water quality standards are the foundation of a water-quality-based pollution control program, which is
implemented through the states for waterbodies within their jurisdiction. These standards define the goals
for a waterbody by designating its uses and setting criteria to protect these uses.
Water quality standards consist of three primary elements:
1. Designated best uses (also referred to as beneficial uses)
2. Narrative statements and numeric criteria (i.e., for specific physical, chemical, and
biological characteristics) to protect the uses
3. An anti-degradation policy to protect higher quality waters from being further degraded.
The CWA requires that each state conduct water quality assessments to determine whether its streams,
lakes, and estuaries are sufficiently “healthy” to meet their designated best uses. This information is
updated and reported to the EPA every two years. This process is mandated by Section 305(b) of the
CWA, and the state prepares 305(b) reports. The 305(b) report is the primary source of information for
the development of the “Impaired Waters” list for the states, known as the 303(d) list. Impaired waters are
waterbodies that do not meet the water quality standards for their designated uses.
The water quality standards are based on the designated uses. If a waterbody contains levels of pollutants
that are greater than the water quality standards, it will not support one or more of its designated uses and
its water quality will be considered to be “impaired.” Thus, when a waterbody is included on the 303(d)
list, the designated use that is impaired and the specific water quality standards for that use that have not
been achieved are identified.

Draft EIS

3-51

March 2016

In Rhode Island, RIDEM is responsible for assessing water quality and determining whether waters meet
the water quality standards. RIDEM prepares a water quality assessment report every two years that is
submitted to the EPA for review. This report satisfies the requirements of the CWA Sections 305(b) and
303(d) and the Rhode Island Water Quality Regulations. RIDEM submitted the State of Rhode Island
2012 303(d) List – List of Impaired Waters Final (RIDEM 2012a) for 2012 and it was approved by the
EPA on September 27, 2012. This report summarizes the water quality conditions in Rhode Island from
2010 through 2011 and includes a comprehensive list of impaired waters.
In Rhode Island, the state’s water quality standards are promulgated in the Rhode Island Water Quality
Regulations. There are seven designated uses for surface waters, as indicated in Rule 8: Surface Water
Quality Standards:
•

Public drinking water supply

•

Primary contact recreation/swimming

•

Secondary contact recreation/swimming

•

Aquatic life support/fish, other aquatic life and wildlife

•

Fish consumption

•

Shellfishing/shellfish consumption

•

Shellfish controlled relay and depuration.

The surface waters of the state are each assigned to one of the classes defined below; each class is defined
by the designated use(s) that it is intended to protect. Classes of freshwater and seawater are provided in

The Narragansett Bay watershed (hydrologic unit code [HUC] 0109000409) comprises nine subwatersheds that drain a total area of approximately 1,657 square miles. Approximately 39 percent of that
area is located in Rhode Island and 61 percent in Massachusetts (Raposa n.d.). Narragansett Bay is an
estuary with freshwater inputs from three major rivers: Blackstone, Taunton, and Pawtuxet rivers
(Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009).
Total forested land represents approximately 52 percent of the overall land use in the Narragansett Bay
watershed; total developed land represents approximately 25 percent of the overall land use. Open water,
wetlands, and agricultural land, respectively, comprise the remainder of the land uses within the
watershed (Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009).
Aquidneck Island is divided into five sub-watersheds of the Narragansett Bay watershed (see Figure
3.11-1) (Wild 2007):

Groundwater
Groundwater is water beneath the surface found in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock
formations; it can be collected using wells, tunnels, or drainage galleries, or it may flow naturally to the
ground surface via seeps or springs. An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock
or unconsolidated materials (e.g., gravel, sand, silt, or clay) that can yield a usable quantity of water.
Congress originally passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 (42 U.S.C. § 300 et seq.) to protect
public health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. The law, as amended in 1986 and
1996, includes numerous requirements to protect drinking water and its sources. A sole-source aquifer, as
defined under Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act, is an aquifer that has been designated as
the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and that, if contaminated, would create a
significant hazard to public health.
The state’s Groundwater Quality Rules (RIDEM 2010c) have been promulgated to protect and restore the
quality of the state’s groundwater resources for use as drinking water and other beneficial uses.
Groundwater supplies approximately 26 percent of the state’s population with drinking water from public
and private wells, and approximately two-thirds of the municipalities in the state rely on groundwater as a
source of drinking water (RIDEM 2013b). The Groundwater Quality Rules classify groundwater
resources and set forth groundwater quality standards and preventive action limits for each groundwater
classification. These classifications are summarized below (RIDEM 2010c):
•

GAA: Groundwater resources suitable for public drinking water use without treatment
that are located in groundwater reservoirs, wellhead protection areas for community
water supply wells, and physically isolated groundwater-dependent areas, all as
designated by the RIDEM

•

GA: Groundwater resources designated to be suitable for public or private drinking water
use without treatment and that are not described under GAA groundwater resources

•

GB: Groundwater resources that may not be suitable for public or private drinking water
use without treatment due to known or presumed degradation

•

GC: Groundwater resources more suitable for certain waste disposal practices than for
development as a drinking water supply due to present or past land use or
hydrogeological conditions.

The EPA’s Wellhead Protection Program is a community-based approach for the protection of
groundwater that supplies drinking water to public water wells and wellfields. A wellhead protection area
is defined as the surface and subsurface area surrounding a water well or wellfield that supplies a public
water system through which contaminants are reasonably likely to move toward and reach the water well
or a wellfield. The State of Rhode Island has an EPA-approved state wellhead protection program.
Floodplains
A floodplain is flat, or nearly flat, land adjacent to a stream or river that experiences occasional or
periodic flooding. EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) and the regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (44 CFR, Part
60, Criteria for Land Management and Use) establish avoidance of development in floodplains as federal
policy. FEMA defines the regulatory 100-year floodplain as the area covered by a flood that has a 1
percent chance of occurring in any given year (often referred to as the “100-year flood event”).
Development in the regulatory floodplain is discouraged because floodplains provide a natural means of
detaining floodwaters and thus protecting downstream properties from damage.

Under the authority of EO 11988, Floodplain Management, federal agencies are required to avoid, to the
extent possible, the long- and short-term impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of
floodplains and to avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development where there is a practicable
alternative. Federal agencies are also required to reduce the risk of flood loss; minimize the impacts of
floods on human safety, health, and welfare; and restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values
provided by the floodplain.
Wetlands
Wetlands are defined as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by groundwater at a frequency and
duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances, do support a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs
and similar areas” (33 CFR 328.3[b]).
Section 404 of the CWA established a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into
waters of the United States, including wetlands. Activities such as infrastructure development are
regulated under this program, and a permit is required before any dredged or fill material can be
discharged into wetlands or waters of the U.S. EO 11990 requires that new construction in wetlands be
avoided to the extent possible and that all practicable measures be taken to minimize or mitigate impacts
on wetlands.
The EPA and the USACE use the 1987 USACE Wetlands Delineation Manual and regional supplements,
where appropriate, to identify wetlands for the CWA Section 404 permit program. The USACE
administers and enforces Section 404 provisions and conducts or verifies jurisdictional determinations of
waters of the U.S. boundaries. The EPA provides programmatic oversight.
EO 11990, Protection of Wetlands, was issued to help avoid possible long- and short-term adverse
impacts associated with the destruction and modification of wetlands and to avoid direct or indirect
support of development in wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative. EO 11990 requires that
federal agencies establish and implement procedures to minimize development in wetlands.
A jurisdictional boundary has been determined by RIDEM and the CRMC that designates the areas of
freshwater wetland jurisdiction. Through the Freshwater Wetlands Act (Rhode Island General Law
Sections 2-1-18 et seq.), RIDEM regulates all of the freshwater wetlands on the landward side of the
jurisdictional boundary line established for the RIDEM and CRMC, regardless of wetland size (RIDEM
2008b). Through the Rules and Regulations Governing the Protection and Management of Freshwater
Wetlands in the Vicinity of the Coast, the CRMC regulates freshwater wetlands in the vicinity of Rhode
Island’s coast. Under the Freshwater Wetlands Act, an upland area adjacent to certain wetlands is
regulated as a buffer area or perimeter wetland. The perimeter wetland is the upland area located 50 feet
from the landward edge of any bog, marsh, swamp or pond. Two additional state jurisdictional resource
areas are defined below (Rules and Regulations Governing the Administration and Enforcement of the
Freshwater Wetlands Act, Rule 4.00):

Draft EIS

•

Riverbank wetlands – The area of land within 200 feet of the edge of any flowing body of
water having a width of 10 feet or more and that area of land within 100 feet of the edge
of any flowing body of water having a width of less than 10 feet during normal flow.

•

Floodplain wetlands – Land area adjacent to a river or stream or other flowing body of
water that is, on average, likely to be covered with flood waters resulting from a 100-year
frequency storm.

The USFWS classification scheme serves as the national standard for wetland classification. Wetlands are
broadly classified into five systems: 1) marine, 2) estuarine, 3) riverine, 4) lacustrine, or 5) palustrine.
They are further classified by subsystems and classes based on substrate material, flooding regime, or
vegetation.

3.11.2

•

Marine System. Open ocean overlying the continental shelf, including high-energy
shorelines such as beaches and rocky headlands.

•

Estuarine System. Deepwater and wetland areas that are usually semi-enclosed with an
opening to the ocean and in which some mixing of fresh and sea water occurs.

•

Riverine System. Freshwater rivers and their tributaries and most associated wetlands.

•

Lacustrine System. Open freshwater wetlands larger than 20 acres in size situated in
topographic depressions with less than 30 percent vegetative cover.

•

Palustrine System. All non-tidal freshwater wetlands dominated by trees, shrubs, and
persistent emergent vegetation.

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing conditions related to water resources were characterized by reviewing USGS topographic maps,
FEMA floodplain maps, the installation’s Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP)
(Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a), and data published by federal and state natural resource agencies. The INRMP
summarizes ground-truthing field surveys conducted in October 2013 to ground-truth existing mapped
wetlands and identify potential wetlands and waterbodies; these field data have been incorporated into
this assessment. Specific acreages used in the descriptions for wetland areas for the properties being
transferred were calculated using National Wetland Inventory (NWI) data from the USFWS. Although
state data were available, the USFWS data were based on more current aerials and analysis.

3.11.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

For each redevelopment alternative, a GIS impact analysis was undertaken. The redevelopment footprint
was overlaid on top of the digital water resources features to identify areas of impact, including water
quantity and quality as well as buffer areas. In addition, impacts associated with the proposed action and
alternatives were compared with applicable regulatory criteria and used to determine the magnitude of
potential impacts. In general, the proposed action would impact water resources if any of the following
conditions applied:

Draft EIS

•

Federal and/or state water quality standards or waste discharge requirements would be
violated.

•

Groundwater supplies would be depleted or groundwater recharge would be substantially
hindered.

•

Groundwater quality would be degraded through the introduction of contaminants from
site storm water runoff.

•

The existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including the course of a stream or river,
would be substantially altered or the rate or amount of surface runoff substantially
increased in a manner that would result in flooding on- or off-site.

•

Runoff water would be created that exceeded the capacity of existing or planned storm
water drainage systems or that introduced substantial additional sources of polluted
runoff.

Structures and/or fill would be placed within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on
a Federal Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard
delineation map.

3.12 Biological Resources
3.12.1

Resource Overview and Regulatory Authority

The biological resources discussed in this EIS include vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered
species, and significant wildlife habitat. The vegetative communities present on the surplus properties
were grouped into dominant cover-types based on the Rhode Island geographical information systems (RI
GIS) forest habitat classification developed by the University of Rhode Island, Department of Natural
Resources Science GIS Laboratory (Buffam 2012) and the acreages were determined or were based on
the Rhode Island Ecological Communities Classification (Enser 2011). The RI GIS is a digital dataset of
land cover and land use categories across the state of Rhode Island. It uses a combination of forestry data
from multiple datasets, a shrubland dataset, and the NWI wetlands dataset. Habitats found on the surplus
properties include developed, grassland, upland forest coniferous, upland forest deciduous, upland forest
mixed, upland shrubland, wetland forest deciduous, freshwater lakes/rivers, wetland freshwater emergent,
and wetland marine/estuarine.
3.12.1.1 Vegetation
Vegetation on the surplus properties at NAVSTA Newport comprises terrestrial plant communities and
their constituent plant species; aquatic and terrestrial invasive species; and estuarine and freshwater
habitat. There is no regulatory authority in Rhode Island that oversees the protection or preservation of
vegetative ecological communities unless the vegetative community is also categorized as a significant
habitat (see Section 3.12.1.4).
Both federal and state legislation are in place, however, to manage aquatic nuisance species. The
Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, P.L. 101-646, and the National
Invasive Species Act of 1996 were developed in response to the disastrous spread of zebra mussels in the
Great Lakes. The National Invasive Species Act allowed the establishment of the federal interagency
Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Task Force, which is responsible for coordinating both federal ANS
management and private sector efforts. The Act also calls for developing state ANS management plans,
such as the 2007 Rhode Island Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan, which outlines existing
management efforts, existing legislation, and objectives for future statewide ANS control and
management (Coastal Resources Management Council 2007).
This discussion of vegetation at the surplus properties is based on the installation’s Integrated Natural
Resources Management Plan (INRMP) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a), the Environmental Condition of
Property Report (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009), and the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine
Research Reserve’s (NBNERR) An Ecological Profile of the Narragansett Bay (NBNERR 2009). The
NBNERR describes ecological communities and habitats typical of the Narragansett Bay National
Research Reserve, located on Prudence and Patience Islands which, because they are near Aquidneck
Island, should share similarities in species type and density.
Terrestrial Plant Communities
The surplus properties are located in the eastern broadleaf forest (oceanic) province of the humid
temperate division ecoregion of the United States (Bailey 1995). The winter deciduous forest that makes
up the eastern broadleaf forest (oceanic) province is composed predominantly of tall broadleaf trees
among three major associations: mixed mesophytic, Appalachian oak, and pine-oak. Typical species
include American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), buckeye (Aesculus glabra),

Draft EIS

and basswood (Tilia americana). A full herbaceous groundcover emerges in the spring, which gives way
to a dense canopy in the summer that loses its leaves in the winter. Elevations in the eastern portion of
the ecoregion in the Piedmont Plateau and coastal plain range from sea level to 1,000 feet (Bailey 1995).
The Rhode Island Natural History Survey (RINHS) Natural Resources Inventory and Assessment of
Naval Station Newport was completed in 2006. During the summer of 2013, field surveys at NAVSTA
Newport were completed, and these surveys confirmed many of the species previously identified by the
RINHS (Tetra Tech 2014a). Twelve vegetation communities were mapped, including seven upland
communities and five wetland communities (see Table 3.12-1); these communities generally follow those
described in the Rhode Island Ecological Communities Classification (Enser 2011).

Invasive Species
Invasive species discussed in this EIS include any species that has been introduced to an environment
where it is not native and that has since become a nuisance through rapid spread and increase in numbers,
often to the detriment of native species. Problems that arise from the introduction and proliferation of
invasive species include, but are not limited, the reduction in diversity of native plants and animals,
degradation of water quality and wildlife habitat, reduction in finfish and shellfish populations, and
economic impacts on the local economy.
Dominant invasive species in Narragansett Bay include oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus),
which affects all habitats, beach rose (Rosa rugosa) which covers at least 14 percent of the dune
shrublands, and sea lettuce (ulva lactuca), which is a green algae that forms large, odorous mats along the
low tide mark of the shoreline. Sea lettuce is difficult to remove and can negatively impact proliferation
of eelgrass beds, deplete oxygen in the water, and hinder recreational swimming and use of fishing nets.
In emergent freshwater communities, common reed (Phragmites australis) out-competes native
vegetation, while coastal forest habitats have seen an increase in Norway maple (Acer platenoides) and
exotic maples sycamore maples (Acer pseudoplatanus) (NBNERR 2009). Additional invasive species

Draft EIS

documented during 2013 floral surveys at NAVSTA Newport include multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora),
purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), common buckthorn
(Rhamnus cathartica), and autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Estuarine and Freshwater Habitat
Mapped data from the Narragansett Bay Project 8 identifies both estuarine and freshwater habitat at the
surplus properties (NBNERR 2009). Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has also been mapped along
the NAVSTA Newport coastline, including along Coasters Harbors Island, Coddington Point, and near
the former Midway Pier (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). Narragansett Bay is the second largest estuary in the
United States, and dominant vegetation in open water consists of phytoplankton. Open standing water is
defined as having less than 50 percent of the water body surface dominated by persistent emergent
vegetation, shrubs, or trees (RIDEM 2007b). Freshwater marshes in Narragansett Bay are wetlands in
which emergent herbaceous vegetation populates standing water or saturated soil. Additional wetlands
are predominantly nonnative Phragmites (noted above under “Invasive Species”). Shrub wetlands are
populated by highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), red maple tree saplings (Acer rubrum), and
other low woody vegetation (NBNERR 2009).
Eelgrass beds are a particularly important vegetation community, as they provide cover, forage, and
breeding habitats for a variety of aquatic species. Eelgrass is considered a special aquatic site, under
Section 404(b)(1) of the CWA in categorizing disposal sites for placement of dredged or fill material (40
CFR 230). It is considered a vegetated shallow, as it is permanently inundated and maintains a SAV
community.
3.12.1.2 Wildlife
Wildlife discussed here includes all animal and avian species, but not including threatened and
endangered species and significant wildlife habitat, which are discussed in Sections 3.12.3 and 3.12.4,
respectively). Information on wildlife that could occur at the surplus properties was compiled from a
review of existing literature, including but not limited to the installation’s INRMP (Tetra Tech 2014a) and
Environmental Condition of Property Report (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009), An Ecological Profile
of the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NBNERR 2009), and Rhode Island’s
Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (RIDEM 2005).
Most land and water resources at the surplus properties serve as habitat for some form of wildlife.
Buildings, structures, and associated landscape areas (lawns, shrubs and trees) on developed portions
generally support the following mammals and birds: eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), skunk (Mephitidae mephitis), common raccoon (Procyon lotor),
American robin (Turdus migratorius), cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), crow (Corvus), sparrow
(Passeridae), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), and various song birds and raptors, while less
developed areas generally provide “undisturbed” vegetative habitat for species less tolerant of human
activity. The habitat in the open areas of two of the surplus properties consists of limited, if any, grasses,
herbs, shrubs, and vines. The sparsely vegetated developed areas of the former Navy Lodge and former
Naval Hospital are suitable for wildlife species such as the fox (Canidae) (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2001).
Wildlife and associated habitat at NAVSTA Newport is limited by the installation’s industrial land uses.
Occurrence of representative species is dictated largely by available habitat and past land uses.
Widespread habitat alteration in the past also has caused many original species to be eliminated,
particularly reptiles and mammals. Wildlife now is typical of urbanized areas where species have adapted

The Narragansett Bay Project is part of a comprehensive study of Narragansett Bay that is being managed jointly
by the NMFS and the RIDEM; it includes assessments of Bay fish and fisheries and other study elements.

to diverse habitat requirements, such as the coyote (Canis latrans) and common raccoon (Tetra Tech
2014a).
Terrestrial Mammals
Terrestrial mammals common to Rhode Island include the deer (Cervidae), coyote, Virginia opossum,
fisher (Martes pennanti), beaver (Castor canadensis), house mouse (Mus musculus), feral dog (Canis
lupus familiaris) and cat (Felis silvestris), and black (Rattus rattus) and Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus)
(August et al. 2001). While still uncommon, black bears (Ursus americanus) have been increasingly
sighted because there are established bear populations in nearby Connecticut and Massachusetts. Some of
these species adapt to a variety of habitats, while others only succeed in specific ecological environments.
As such, some terrestrial mammals found in the area are vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and
degradation caused by development (RIDEM 2005).
Common mammals observed at NAVSTA Newport include the coyote, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), common raccoon, eastern gray squirrel, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and white-footed
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Eight species of bat are known or believed to occur in Rhode Island: big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus),
eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris
noctivagans), eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), northern longeared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), and tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus). All eight species have a high
likelihood of occurrence at NAVSTA Newport (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Marine Mammals
The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) is administered by the USFWS and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) NMFS to protect and manage marine mammals. The
Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 established, with limited exceptions, a moratorium on
the “taking” of marine mammals in waters or on lands under U.S. jurisdiction. The Act further regulates
“takes” of marine mammals in the global commons (i.e., the high seas) by vessels or persons under U.S.
jurisdiction. The term “take,” as defined in Section 3 (16 U.S.C. 1362) of the MMPA, means “to harass,
hunt, capture, or kill, or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal.” “Harassment” was
further defined in the 1994 amendments to the MMPA, which provided two levels of harassment: Level
A (potential injury) and Level B (potential disturbance).
The MMPA defines “harassment” as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which: (i) has the potential
to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild [Level A harassment]; or (ii) has the
potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of
behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or
sheltering [Level B harassment] (50 C.F.R, Part 216, Subpart A, Section 216.3-Definitions). Level A is
the more severe form of harassment because it may result in injury, whereas Level B only results in
disturbance without the potential for injury.
Section 101(a) (5) of the MMPA directs the Secretary of the Department of Commerce to allow, upon
request, the incidental (but not intentional) taking of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a
specified activity (exclusive of commercial fishing), if certain findings are made and regulations are
issued. Permission will be granted by the Secretary for the incidental take of marine mammals if the
taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock and will not have an immitigable adverse
impact on the availability of such species or stock for taking for subsistence uses.
Harbor seals and harbor porpoises are two marine mammals known to reside in Narragansett Bay; the
harbor seal is the dominant marine mammal present within lands/waters of NAVSTA Newport. Harbor

seals are most commonly sighted offshore of the installation, at haul-out sites near Coddington Point and
Bishop’s Rock (Tetra Tech 2014a). The Rhode Island Ocean Special Area Management Plan (University
of Rhode Island [URI] 2010) identifies an additional 34 species of marine mammals that have been
recorded in Rhode Island waters; 12 of these species are considered common and 5 are regularly noted.
Occurrence of harbor porpoises is mostly seasonal, with the majority of occurrences documented in
spring (URI 2010). Many documented records of whales and dolphins in Rhode Island are isolated
incidents of strandings, but species spotted frequently in Rhode Island coastal waters include the
humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis), fin whale
(Balaenoptera physalus), common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), common bottlenose
dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), and the short-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) (URI 2010).
Herpetofauna
Various species of amphibians and reptiles have been identified in Narragansett Bay, according to
NBNERR surveys and RIDEM inventories (NBNERR 2009). While reptile and amphibian populations
are declining both on a local and global scale, species common to the state of Rhode Island and the
islands of Narragansett Bay include the dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), Fowler’s toad (Bufo
fowleri), green frog (Rana clamitans), black rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta) and the common garter snake
(Thamnophis sirtalis) (NBNERR 2009; RIDEM 2005). Habitats characteristic of these species are ponds,
forested and shrubland wetlands, and woodland pools. The common snapping turtle was documented
during 2013 field surveys along the coastline of NAVSTA Newport (Tetra Tech 2014a).
Benthos
The bottom community of organisms residing in shallow estuaries and their habitat is referred to as
benthos. The benthic community of Narragansett Bay includes fauna of various sizes (ranging from
macro (0.5 mm to 2.0 cm) to micro (less than 100 µm). Common benthic species in Narragansett Bay
include annelids (Phylum Annelida), nematodes (Phylum Nematoda), gastropods (Class Gastropoda),
bivalves (Class Bivalvia), and mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) (URI 2007).
Avian Species
Migratory birds are any species or family of birds that live, reproduce or migrate within or across
international borders at some point during their annual life cycle. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA)
was enacted in the United States in 1918 in order to establish federal protection for migratory birds (16
U.S.C. 703-712). The MBTA prohibits the taking, killing or possessing of migratory birds unless
permitted. The list of bird species protected by the MBTA appears in 50 CFR 10.13. The USFWS is in
the process of preparing a draft EIS regarding alternatives for permitting incidental take of resources
protected under the MBTA, similar to that with the ESA.
In 1940 bald eagles gained protection under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Bald eagles were
listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 on March 11,
1967, and in 1972 the bald eagle became protected under the MBTA. On February 14, 1978 the bald
eagle was listed as an endangered species in 43 of the contiguous states under the Endangered Species
Act (ESA) and listed as threatened in five states (Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon and
Washington) (43 FR 6230, February 14, 1978). Effective 8 August 2007, the USFWS delisted the Bald
Eagle under the authority of the ESA (see 72 FR 37345, July 9, 2007), removing it from the ESA’s list of
endangered and threatened wildlife throughout most of its range. The prohibitions of the ESA no longer
apply except to the Sonoran Desert nesting bald eagle population, which is currently listed as threatened.
In May 2007 the USFWS issued a set of National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines providing
landowners and others with guidance on how to ensure that actions taken on private property are
consistent with the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the MBTA, which both protect Bald Eagles
by prohibiting killing, selling or otherwise harming eagles, and their nests or eggs (USFWS 2007).

Draft EIS

3-63

March 2016

A modification to the definition of “disturb,” a term specifically prohibited as a “take” by the Bald and
Golden Eagle Protection Act was implemented on July 5, 2007 (72 FR 31132, June 5, 2007). The revised
definition defines “disturb” as “to agitate or bother a bald or golden eagle to a degree that causes, or is
likely to cause, based on the best scientific information available:
•

Injury to an eagle

•

A decrease in its productivity, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding,
or sheltering behavior

•

Nest abandonment, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding or
sheltering behavior.”

On September 11, 2009 the USFWS published its Final Rule on Authorizations Under the Bald and
Golden Eagle Protection Act for Take of Eagles (74 FR 46836). This Final Rule establishes permit
provisions for Bald and Golden Eagle takes under limited circumstances.
This description of avian species in and around the surplus properties includes information from literature
specific to Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island coastal environments, as well as from the 2014 INRMP.
Narragansett Bay is home to a variety of songbirds, shore birds, and waterfowl, both breeding and
migratory. The coastal region is in the Atlantic flyway, attracting migratory birds during winter and
summer months. Shorebirds frequenting the bay waters and beaches of Narragansett Bay include loons
(Gavia immer), grebes (Podicipedidae), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), bitterns (Ardeidae), egrets
(Ardeidae), and geese (Anatidae) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). Migratory bird species expected in the
summer typically breed in Narragansett Bay and spend winters farther south. Migratory species may
consist of Canada geese (Branta canadensis), black duck (Anas rubripes), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos),
great blue heron (Ardea herodias), egret, ibis (Threskiornithidae), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea),
black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), and the American oystercatcher (Haematopus
palliatus). Species common to the East Passage of Narragansett Bay in the winter are species that
typically breed farther north during the summer—sea ducks, king eider (Somateria spectabilis), whitewinged scooter (Melanitta fusca), lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), black duck (Anas rubripes), mallard (Anas
platyrhynchos), cormorant (Phalacrocorax), oldsquaw (Clangula hyemalis), common merganser (Mergus
merganser), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), and common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) (RIDEM
2005).
More than 100 species of bird have been observed at NAVSTA Newport, including raptors, wading birds,
and seabirds. Raptors include the sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus), Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter
cooperi), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and American kestrel (Falco sparverius) (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014a). Common wading birds at NAVSTA Newport include great-blue heron (Ardea herodias), blackcrowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), great egret (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula), and
glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus). Seabirds in some of the highest numbers observed at NAVSTA
Newport include the herring gull (Larus argentatus), double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus),
and common tern (Sterna hirundo) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Important Bird Areas
The National Audubon Society has designated eight important bird areas (IBAs) in Narragansett Bay. An
IBA is a site that supports one of the following: species of conservation concern, restricted-range species,
vulnerable species, or congregative species (Audubon 2010). No IBAs have been designated within the
boundaries of the surplus properties.
NBNERR estimates that 187 species of birds are associated with Narragansett Bay. Prudence and
Patience, the two islands off the west coast of Aquidneck Island noted above, have been designated as an

IBA. This IBA, along with the Marsh Meadows Wildlife Preserve are the closest IBAs to the surplus
properties—a distance of approximately 2 miles, although all eight are within 10 miles of the surplus
properties. The remaining IBAs consist of Rumstick/Jacobs Points, Potowomut River, Pettaquamscutt
Cove, Sachuset Point and 3rd Beach, Quicksand/Tunipers Pond, and Sapowet Marsh Wildlife
Management Area. Waterfowl common to these areas include bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), harlequin
duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), and hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus). Gulls (primarily
herring gull [Larus argentatus]), terns (common [Sterna hirundo] and least [Sterna albifrons]), egrets,
herons, piping plover (Charadrius melodus), and double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) are
species of colonial nesting birds found along the Rhode Island coast (NBNERR 2009). Thirty-five
species of songbirds are found in Narragansett Bay, the most common of which include gray catbird
(Dumetella carolinensis), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), rufous-sided towhee (Pipilo
erythrophthalmus), and yellow warbler (Dendroica petechial).
Finfish
Fish populations in Narragansett Bay are monitored to determine diversity and abundance for commercial
and recreational fishing and also to better understand the ecological health of bay waters. Historical
sampling and survey efforts identify the following as fish species common to Narragansett Bay: winter
flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), bluefish (Pomatomus
saltatrix), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), weakfish/squeteque (Cynoscion regalis), and tautog (Tautoga
onitis) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). A more comprehensive list of fish species expected to occur in
Narragansett Bay is provided in Table 3.12-2. Essential fish habitat (EFH) is discussed in Section
3.12.1.4.

Narragansett Bay include quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria), soft-shelled clam (Mya arenaria), mussel
(Mytilus edulis), American lobster (Homarus americanus), and squid (Order Teuthida). All of these
species are harvested from the bay.
RIDEM shellfishing regulations have been established to protect human consumers from shellfish deemed
unsuitable for consumption. Title 20, Chapter 8.1 of the General Laws of 1956, "Shellfish Grounds,"
indicates that “certain water areas in Rhode Island overlying shellfish grounds have been found to be in
an unsatisfactory sanitary condition for the taking of shellfish for human consumption and are declared to
be polluted areas” (RIDEM 2012b). No lobster fishing or shellfishing is permitted within the Naval
Security Zone, located from Pier 2 to the tip of the breakwater (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
RIDEM also designates certain species of fish as restricted finfish: commercial or recreational catch
restricted to a maximum volume limit per day (RIDEM 2013e). Species subject to these regulations
include scup (Stenotomus chrysops), summer flounder, winter flounder, tautog, striped bass (Morone
saxatilis), and black sea bass (Centropristis striata). Additionally, the catch of lobsters, blue crabs, and
horseshoe crabs all require a minimum size.
3.12.1.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
Under NEPA, the impacts of a proposed action to federally listed threatened and endangered (T&E)
species must be considered. The ESA of 1973 established protection over and conservation of federally
threatened and endangered species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. An “endangered” species
is a species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its native habitat, while
a “threatened” species is one that is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout
all or in a significant portion of its native habitat. Federal “species of concern” is an informal term that
indicates species that might be in need of conservation actions. Federal species of concern do not receive
legal protection and this term does not imply the species will eventually be proposed for listing.

Draft EIS

3-66

March 2016

The USFWS and the NMFS jointly administer the ESA and are responsible for listing species (i.e.,
labeling a species as either threatened or endangered). The USFWS has primary responsibility for
managing terrestrial and freshwater species; the NMFS has primary responsibility for marine species and
anadromous fish species (species that migrate from saltwater to freshwater to spawn). The ESA allows the
designation of geographic areas as critical habitat for threatened or endangered species.
Although protection of species listed at the state level as threatened or endangered is not legally mandated
for federal agencies, the Navy encourages cooperation with states to protect such species where such
protection is consistent with the installation’s mission. The U.S. Navy is required under the Sikes Act (16
U.S.C. 670) to prepare and implement an INRMP for each of its military installations with significant
natural resources. INRMPs aim for sustainable natural resources management while ensuring no net loss
in the capability of installation lands to support the military mission. The RIDEM Division of Planning
and Development is responsible for managing Rhode Island’s Natural Heritage Program (NHP). This
statewide inventory catalogs any species considered endangered, threatened, or of special concern in the
state of Rhode Island.
A list of federally and state-listed T&E species potentially occurring on the surplus properties was
developed based on agency correspondence and review of federal and state databases. The USFWS
database indicates the presence of 10 federally listed species in Rhode Island. None of these species have
been identified at the surplus properties. In a letter dated February 13, 2013, the USFWS indicated that no
federally threatened or endangered species or critical habitat under its jurisdiction are known to occur in
the vicinity of the surplus properties (Chapman 2013 [see Appendix A-2]).
Since the February 2013 response letter, the USFWS designated the northern long-eared bat as a
threatened species under the ESA, effective May 4, 2015, based on the species’ risk of extinction
(USFWS 2015a). On January 14, 2016, the USFWS published the Final 4(d) Rule 9, which provides
protective measures to minimize potential adverse impacts on northern long-eared bats and their habitats
(USFWS 2016). It includes stipulations for consultations with the USFWS if a project is located within
the white-nose syndrome zone, which is an area comprising those counties within 150 miles of the
boundaries of the U.S. counties or Canadian districts where the fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans)
or white-nose syndrome has been detected (USFWS 2015a). If a project is located within an area of
potentially suitable habitat; is within the white-nose syndrome zone; and may potentially affect the
northern long-eared bat, certain conservation measures that protect the bat’s most vulnerable life stages
are required. Newport County is located within the designated white-nose syndrome zone; therefore, the
Navy has contacted the USFWS regarding the potential for the northern long-eared bat to be present at the
surplus properties (see Sections 6.12.3, 8.12.3, and 10.12.3 for a more detailed discussion).
The NMFS Northeast Region stated that certain New England coastal waters support various listed
species, including whales, sea turtles, and the Northwest Atlantic distinct population segment (DPS) of
loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) (Colligan 2013). These species are listed in Table 3.12-3. NMFS
Northeast Region indicated the potential occurrence of two listed whales in the waters off of Rhode
Island: federally endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (from December 1 to June
30) and the federally endangered humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (from March 15 to
November 30). Three additional whales were also noted as occurring in New England (fin whale –
Balaenoptera physalus; Sei – Balaenoptera borealis; and Sperm – Physter macrocephalus), but due to
depths and near shore location, these species were deemed unlikely to exist within the vicinity of the
project area (Colligan 2013). Additionally, sea turtles potentially occurring in northeastern New England,
9

A 4(d) rule is one of the tools provided by the ESA to provide flexibility in the ESA’s implementation of
protections for threatened species and to tailor prohibitions to those that make the most sense for protecting and
managing at-risk species (USFWS 2015b).

and potentially Narragansett Bay, are typically small juveniles. NMFS Northeast Region identified listed
sea turtle species potentially occurring in New England waters as the federally endangered leatherback
(Dermochelys coriacea) and federally endangered Kemp’s ridley (Lepidochelys kempi). The federally
threatened green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) has the potential to occur sporadically in New England
waters, but its occurrence is rare. The federally threatened Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus
oxyrinchus) was also referenced by NMFS as potentially occurring in Narragansett Bay, and potentially
originating from the endangered New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South Atlantic, or Carolina DPSs, or
threatened Gulf of Maine DPS. Additionally two federal species of concern, alewife (Alosa
pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), have been identified to potentially occur near
the project area (Colligan 2013). A letter dated February 12, 2013, from the RIDEM indicated there are
no state-listed or candidate, rare, threatened or endangered species, unique natural communities or other
significant wildlife communities at or near the surplus properties (Jordan 2013).

Significant Wildlife Habitat

For the purposes of the Draft EIS, significant wildlife habitats were defined as those locations that would
require a regulatory review if the proposed redevelopment had the potential for adverse affects on the
proposed properties. These included SAV beds, EFH, wetlands, and vernal pools. The RIDEM’s
Division of Planning and Development reviewed the Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program database
and has indicated that no state-designated unique natural communities or other significant wildlife
communities live at or near the surplus property (Jordan 2013).
Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
Eelgrass and widgeon grass are both ecologically significant seagrasses that play an important role in the
marine food web in addition to providing important habitat for many species of fish and wildlife.
Pollution and uncontrolled development have contributed to the decline of eelgrass habitat in
Narragansett Bay. Because eelgrass stands provide nursery, feeding, and resting habitat for such a large
variety of fish and wildlife, Rhode Island state agencies and environmental activist groups consider
protection and recuperation of these habitats a priority. In addition, vegetated shallows, which contain
SAV, are considered a special aquatic site under Section 404 of the CWA.
Under Section 300.18 of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program (RI CRMP),
activities pertaining to Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Public Recreational Structures,
Draft EIS

3-68

March 2016

Recreational Boating Facilities, Sewage Treatment and Stormwater, Dredging and Dredged Materials
Disposal, Filling in Tidal Waters, Aquaculture, and activities undertaken in accordance with municipal
harbor regulations are required to avoid any negative impact on SAV such as eelgrass and widgeon grass
habitat (Coastal Resources Management Council 2010).
SAV has been mapped along the NAVSTA Newport coastline, including along Coasters Harbors Island,
Coddington Point, and near the former Midway Pier (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Essential Fish Habitat
EFH is defined under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA) (P.
L. 94-265), as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-267), as “those waters and
substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, and feeding or growth to maturity.” The Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act established a 200 nautical mile (nm) fishery conservation
zone in U.S. waters and a regional network of Fishery Management Councils. The Fishery Management
Councils are composed of federal and state officials, including the USFWS, which oversee fishing
activities within the fishery management zone. In 1996, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act was reauthorized and amended as the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (MSFCMA), also known as the Sustainable Fisheries Act. The MSFCMA mandated
numerous changes to the existing legislation designed to prevent overfishing, rebuild depleted fish stocks,
minimize by-catch, enhance research, improve monitoring, and protect fish habitat.
One of the most significant mandates in the MSFCMA is the EFH provision, which provides the means to
conserve fish habitat. The EFH mandate requires that the regional Fishery Management Councils, through
federal fishery management plans (FMPs), describe and identify EFH for each federally managed species,
minimize to the extent practicable adverse effects on such habitat caused by fishing, and identify other
actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of such habitats.
Congress defines EFH as “those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or
growth to maturity” (16 U.S.C. 1802[10]). The term “fish” is defined in the MSFCMA as “finfish,
mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of marine animals and plant life other than marine mammals
and birds.” The regulations for implementing EFH clarify that “waters” include all aquatic areas and their
biological, chemical, and physical properties, while “substrate” includes the associated biological
communities that make these areas suitable fish habitats (50 CFR 600.10). Habitats used at any time
during a species’ life cycle (i.e., during at least one of its life stages) must be accounted for when
describing and identifying EFH. In addition to EFH designations, areas called habitat areas of particular
concern (HAPCs), which are a subset of designated EFH that is especially important ecologically to a
species/life stage and/or is vulnerable to degradation, are also to be designated to provide additional focus
for conservation efforts (50 CFR 600.805-600.815). Categorization as HAPC does not confer additional
protection for or restriction of designated areas.
Authority to implement the MSFCMA is given to the Secretary of Commerce and delegated to NMFS.
The MSFCMA requires that EFH be identified and described for each federally managed species. NMFS
and regional Fishery Management Councils determine the species distributions by life stage and
characterize associated habitats, including HAPC. The MSFCMA requires federal agencies to consult
with NMFS on activities that may adversely affect EFH, or when NMFS independently learns of a federal
activity that may adversely affect EFH. The MSFCMA defines an adverse effect as “any impact which
reduces quality and/or quantity of EFH [and] may include direct (e.g., contamination or physical
disruption), indirect (e.g., loss of prey or reduction in species’ fecundity), site-specific or habitat wide
impacts, including individual, cumulative, or synergistic consequences of actions” (50 CFR 600.810).

Draft EIS

3-69

March 2016

EFH designations emphasize the importance of habitat protection of healthy fisheries and serve to protect
and conserve the habitat of marine, estuarine, and anadromous finfish, mollusks, and crustaceans. EFH
embodies both the water column (including its physical, chemical, and biological growth properties) and
its underlying substrate (including sediment, hard bottom, and other submerged structures). Under the
EFH definition, necessary habitat is that which is required to support a sustainable fishery and the
managed species’ contribution to a healthy ecosystem. EFH is designated for a species’ complete life
cycle, including spawning, feeding, and growth to maturity, and may be specific for each life stage (e.g.,
eggs, larvae).
EFH that is judged to be particularly important to the long-term productivity of populations of one or
more managed species, or to be particularly vulnerable to degradation, may also be identified by the
NMFS as HAPCs. For types or areas of EFH to be considered HAPC, the following must be
demonstrated: the importance of the ecological function provided by the habitat; the extent to which the
habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradation; whether, and to what extent,
development activities are, or will be, negatively impacting the habitat type; or the rarity of the habitat.
HAPCs may include high-value intertidal and estuarine habitats, offshore areas of high habitat value or
vertical relief, and habitats used for migration, spawning, and rearing of fish and shellfish. The NMFS has
summarized EFH in major estuaries, bays, and rivers along the northeast U.S. Coast in the NMFS Guide
to Essential Fish Habitat Descriptions in the Northeast United States (NOAA Fisheries Northeast
Regional Office n.d.). EFH has been designated for the following 17 species in Narragansett Bay: Atlantic
sea herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), haddock (Melanogrammus
aeglefinus), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), Spanish
mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), red hake (Urophycis chuss), cobia (Rachycentron canadum),
windowpane flounder (Scopthalmus aquosus), winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), summer
flounder (Paralicthys dentatus), winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata), little skate (Leucoraja erinacea),
bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), scup (Stenotomus chrysops), black sea bass (Centropristus striata), and
sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus) (NOAA Fisheries Northeast Regional Office n.d.; Boelke 2013).
The summer flounder EFH designation includes juvenile and adult HAPC for all native species of
macroaglae, seagrasses, and freshwater and tidal macrophytes in beds. Therefore, any of the eelgrass
beds located adjacent to NAVSTA Newport could be considered a HAPC for summer flounder EFH.
Wetlands
A definition of this resource and an overview of federal legislation pertaining to the protection of
wetlands are discussed in Section 3.11.
Vernal Pools
A vernal pool is a temporary to semi-permanent body of water occurring in a shallow depression that
typically fills during the spring or fall and may be dry during the summer. Vernal pools may be a part of a
larger wetland (commonly forested or scrub-shrub wetlands), or may occur as isolated depressions in
upland landscapes. These pools have no obvious direct surface connection to streams or ponds and do not
support populations of fish. A vernal pool may provide the primary breeding habitat for wood frogs (Rana
sylvatica), spotted salamanders, blue-spotted salamanders, and fairy shrimp (Eubranchipus sp.) as well as
valuable habitat for other plants and wildlife, including several rare, threatened, and endangered species.
In 1994, the State of Rhode Island amended the Rhode Island Fresh Water Wetlands Act (RIFWWA) by
including a new wetland category, special aquatic site (Rule 5.80), defined as “a body of open standing
water . . . which does not meet the definition of pond but which is capable of supporting and providing
habitat for aquatic lifeforms” (R.I.G.L., Sections 2-1-18 through 2-1-27). According to the RIFWWA and
its Rules and Regulations, regardless of the size of the wetland, RIDEM has jurisdiction over all

Draft EIS

freshwater wetlands on the landward side of the jurisdictional boundary, as discussed in Section 3.11. As
such, vernal pools are regulated by both RIDEM and CMRC, depending on their proximity to the coast.

3.12.2

Methodology: Assessing the Existing Environment

Existing conditions related to biological resources were characterized by reviewing current aerial
photography and data published by federal and state natural resource agencies and organizations as well
as data published by NAVSTA Newport. The Navy requested information from the USFWS and NMFS
during the scoping phase of the EIS to assist in identifying species and significant wildlife habitat known
to occur at the surplus properties. The NMFS identified four listed species of turtles and one species of
fish, as well as a total of 17 species for which EFH has been designated in the Narragansett Bay (Colligan
2013; Boelke 2013).
The USFWS originally concurred that no federally listed or proposed endangered species or critical
habitat under its jurisdiction are known to occur at the surplus properties (Chapman 2013). However, the
USFWS designated the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) as a federally listed threatened
species under the ESA, effective May 4, 2015. On June 17, 2015, the Navy contacted the USFWS
regarding the potential presence of northern long-eared bat at the surplus properties (Preston 2015a). The
Navy received a response from the USFWS via electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal
consultation and provide additional information about the potential effects of the proposed action on the
northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015). The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts
on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). To date, USFWS has not provided a response, and informal
consultation with the USFWS on the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared
bat is ongoing.

3.12.3

Methodology: Evaluating Environmental Consequences

For each redevelopment alternative, a GIS impact analysis was made. The redevelopment footprint was
overlaid on top of the digital biological resources features to identify areas of impact, inclusive of
ecological communities, significant wildlife habitat areas, IBAs, and buffer areas. In addition, impacts
associated with the proposed action and alternatives were compared with applicable regulatory criteria
and used to determine the magnitude of impacts. Impacts on listed species and significant wildlife habitat,
as identified through agency consultation, were also assessed.
In general, the proposed action would impact biological resources if any of the following would occur:

Draft EIS

•

Federal and/or state wildlife protection laws would be violated

•

Eelgrass habitat would be substantially impacted

•

Non-native nuisance plants of animal species would spread

•

T&E habitat would be substantially altered or modified, resulting in construction
mortality or displacement

•

Structures were placed in such a way that they would contribute to terrestrial habitat
fragmentation or obstruct the airspace of IBAs.

Former Navy Lodge Property

4 Former Navy Lodge Existing Conditions
4.1

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section summarizes existing land uses at the former Navy Lodge property. A discussion of the land
use and zoning districts surrounding the property and the plans and regulations that guide or direct the
development of this land also is provided.

4.1.1

On-Site Land Use

The former Navy Lodge property occupies 3 acres at the southern end of NAVSTA Newport in the Town
of Middletown. The site is bounded by the town’s recreation complex to the north, Coddington Highway
to the south, West Main Road (State Route 114) to the east, and Lake Erie Street to the west (see Figure
4.1-1).
The former Navy Lodge building was constructed in 1971 and demolished in 2004, when a new Navy
Lodge was built at Coddington Point (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009; EDAW/AECOM 2008). The
site currently is unfenced and vacant, except for a telephone utility shed on the southwestern corner and a
water meter vent on a concrete pad on the northeastern corner of the property. The remainder of the
property is covered in grass. A small portion of the eastern edge of the property was conveyed to RIDOT
around 2004 as part of the ROW for a turning lane on Coddington Road (U.S. Department of the Navy
2009). A water meter pit and an associated 16-inch water main are located along the southern boundary
of the site along Coddington Highway (see Figure 1-3).

4.1.2

Surrounding Land Use

The study area for surrounding land uses is defined as the area within 0.25 miles of the site boundaries.
Land use designations are derived from data provided by the Aquidneck Island Planning Commission
(2013). North of the former Navy Lodge property along West Main Road are several municipality-owned
properties, including the town’s recreation complex, Middletown Public Library, and the former John F.
Kennedy elementary school (now closed).
The remainder of the study area primarily contains residential and commercial land uses. Two Navy
family housing areas composed of multi-unit houses are located west and northwest of the site (see Figure
4.1-1). Four-unit homes are found to the west, in the area known as the former Anchorage Housing,
along with a smaller number of two-unit homes. Single-family residential housing is located south and
east of the site, off Coddington Highway. Commercial land uses primarily are located east and southeast
of the site on West Main Road and East Main Road.

4.1.3

Land Use Plans and Zoning

Land surrounding the former Navy Lodge property is in the jurisdiction of the Town of Middletown.
Land use and development in the town is regulated by the town’s zoning code (Middletown Code of
Ordinances, Chapter 152) and guided by the Town of Middletown, RI, 2014 Comprehensive Community
Plan (Town of Middletown Planning Department 2015).
In addition, the town has completed the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan
(Vanasse Hangen Brustline, Inc., and RKG Associates 2011) to guide redevelopment of the site and the
three adjacent municipality-owned properties identified in Section 4.1.2. A regional planning agency, the
Aquidneck Island Planning Commission, included the site in its regional study, the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005).

Draft EIS

4-1

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

Town of Middletown Zoning Code. The former Navy Lodge property is located in a public (PA)
zoning district. The “A” in the zoning designation indicates that this district is a traffic-sensitive area
(Middletown Code of Ordinances, Chapter 152 §720). The public zoning district designates land owned
by federal or state government agencies or the Town of Middletown. Government land uses are the only
uses permitted in the public zoning district. If a property in a public zoning district is transferred to a
private owner, the town requires the property to be rezoned before it is used for a non-governmental
purpose (Middletown Code of Ordinances Chapter 152 §2600 – §2601). The “traffic-sensitive”
designation has been established by the town to improve traffic flow and safety on the town’s major
roadways. The town has established minimum lot-width requirements in traffic-sensitive districts to
reduce the number and increase the spacing of access points to major roadways (Middletown Code of
Ordinances, Chapter 152 §720). As indicated in Section 3.4.1, only lots with frontage on the following
streets must adhere to the regulations of this district: East Main Road, West Main Road, Valley Road, and
Aquidneck Avenue. The former Navy Lodge property also is included in the town’s watershed protection
district, Zone 2. This watershed protection district has been established to protect, preserve, and maintain
the quality of surface and groundwater used by the town. Any uses permitted in the underlying zones are
allowed in the watershed protection district. There are no additional permitting requirements for
development proposed within Zone 2.
Town of Middletown, RI, 2014 Comprehensive Community Plan. Future land use at the former Navy
Lodge property is designated as institutional, a designation consistent with the current zoning for the site
as noted above (Town of Middletown Planning Department 2015). The site is adjacent to areas
designated for future general business/mixed use in the 2014 comprehensive plan update. Additionally,
the 2014 comprehensive plan update notes that the town may pursue designating the area in the vicinity of
the former Navy Lodge property and the intersection of West Main and East Main Roads as a staterecognized “growth center.” “Growth centers” are priority areas for state investments in urban
development (Town of Middletown Planning Department 2015). The growth center designation would
complement the goals of the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan, described below.
West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan. The Town of Middletown’s West
Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates
2011) is intended to guide an integrated redevelopment of the site and three adjacent municipality-owned
properties, together totaling approximately 14 acres. The master plan identifies goals for redevelopment
of these properties, including creating pedestrian and vehicle access from surrounding residential
neighborhoods to the redeveloped properties and creating a “mixed use center and unique destination” in
the town. The town’s preferred redevelopment scenario, developed through the master planning process,
is to create a mixed-use center, potentially with government, office, retail, multi-family residential, and
open space land uses in the plan area, including the former Navy Lodge property. The master plan
envisions redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property with retail land uses. Draft language for a
new zoning overlay district, the proposed Coddington Center Overlay District, which was recommended
to facilitate redevelopment of the master plan area, was developed as part of the master plan process. The
overlay district would allow commercial, office, municipal government, and multi-family land uses by
right or by special use permit (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates 2011).
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. The Aquidneck Island Planning Commission cites the need
to plan for the reuse of surplus Navy properties as one of the reasons for preparing the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005). The Aquidneck Island Planning Commission is a
regional planning agency that includes representatives of the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth, the

Former Navy Lodge Property

City of Newport, and NAVSTA Newport. The west side planning area includes approximately 5,000
acres on the west side of Aquidneck Island in all three municipalities. The former Navy Lodge property
is located at the southeast boundary of the planning area.
The primary land use goals laid out in the master plan include minimizing sprawl, planning for reuse of
surplus Navy property, and diversifying land use. Accordingly, the overall recommendation for future
land uses in the west side planning area is for “targeted, mixed-use redevelopment that supports existing
land uses and provides public economic benefit, within an attractive and accessible open space system”
(The Cecil Group et al. 2005). Infill development or redevelopment with commercial and compatible
industrial land uses is emphasized. The Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan does not include
recommendations specific to the former Navy Lodge property but does include various recommendations
for planned redevelopment and reuse of surplus Navy properties. These recommendations include the
following:

4.1.4

•

Consistency with the economic, civic, and environmental goals of the master plan

•

Prioritizing local and regional economic goals

•

Focusing on mixed-use redevelopment such as commercial, light industrial, marinerelated, affordable housing, or public utilities

•

Compatibility with and support of the mission at NAVSTA Newport (The Cecil Group et
al. 2005).

Coastal Zone Management

Under the CZMA and the RI CRMP, the CRMC has review authority for all federal actions or activities
regardless of their location within a Rhode Island coastal community or state territorial waters. However,
only the disposal of the surplus property is a federal action; the subsequent redevelopment would be a
non-federal action. Although the CRMC has direct state permitting authority for non-federal projects
located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, the former
Navy Lodge property is not located in any tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot
contiguous area, so state review of coastal resources is not applicable. However, the Coastal
Development Policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP do apply to this property (see Table 4.1-1).

C)

Open Space – There are three aspects to open space
designations of importance. First is the choice of the land that
should be set aside and what qualities that land possesses;
second is the links between the open space parcels that allow
greenways throughout the area and improve the value of the
land and mobility for residents; and third is the design of the
designated areas that will ensure their long-term value.

D) Public Access – When applicants choose the Coastal Greenway
option, the CRMC requires that shoreline and arterial public
access pathways be provided by the applicant within the
development site, as described in Aquidneck Island SAMP
Coastal Development Section 150.5.
E)

Construction Setback – A construction setback of 25 feet is
required for all new and existing residential, commercial,
mixed-use, and other structures to provide for fire, safety, and
maintenance purposes. The setback is measured from the
inland edge of the Coastal Greenway or buffer.

Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice

This section provides a discussion of the socioeconomic conditions in the communities surrounding all
four surplus properties: the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval Hospital property, Tank Farms
1 and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. For the purposes of projecting economic impacts,
the impact area is defined as the three communities in which these properties are located—the City of
Newport, the Town of Middletown, and the Town of Portsmouth. The following subsections also discuss
Newport County and the State of Rhode Island as points of comparison.

4.2.1

Economy, Employment, and Income

The regional economy on Aquidneck Island is strongly influenced by the Navy’s presence in Newport
County; defense contractors and the Navy are major employers in the three communities. In addition,
tourism-related industries centered in the City of Newport are an important economic driver in the
island’s economy. Tourism, health care and social service providers, and Salve Regina University are
major employers in the region (Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation 2011).
The employment by industry sector is similar for the City of Newport and the towns of Middletown and
Portsmouth. During 2013, educational services, health care, and social assistance were the largest single
industrial sectors in terms of employment for the three municipalities. Approximately one quarter of all
employed civilian workers in the communities were employed in these industries (see Table 4.2-1).
Corresponding to the importance of tourism in the local economy, the arts, entertainment, and recreation
and accommodation and food services sector was the second largest employment sector in the City of
Newport and the Town of Middletown in 2013, employing approximately 22.2 percent and 15.0 percent

of the employed civilian workforce, respectively. The professional, scientific, and management,
administrative, and waste management services sector was the next largest employment sector in the City
of Newport and the Town of Middletown, accounting for 12.2 percent and 12.5 percent of total employed
civilian workforce, respectively. In the Town of Portsmouth, the professional, scientific, and
management, administrative, and waste management services sector was the second largest employment
sector, accounting for 13.7 percent of the total civilian employment in 2013, while the arts, entertainment,
and recreation and accommodation and food services sector accounted for 11.4 percent of the total
civilian employment (Table 4.2-1).

The region and the State of Rhode Island as a whole experienced relatively high unemployment rates
between 2011 and 2013, although the rates in 2013 have decreased since 2011. As shown on Table 4.2-2,
2013 average annual unemployment rates in the area ranged from a low of 8.0 percent in the Town of
Portsmouth to a high of 9.4 percent in the City of Newport. The rates in the Town of Portsmouth (8.0
percent) and the Town of Middletown (8.6 percent) were lower than the national rate of 8.9 percent,
whereas the rate in the City of Newport was higher. Newport County’s labor force of 44,157 workers in

Corresponding to the high per capita and median household income levels, the three communities also
have had a smaller percentage of residents living below the poverty level, as defined by the U.S. Census
Bureau, than the state as a whole. In 2013, approximately 10.8 percent of the total population in the City
of Newport had income levels that placed them below the national poverty level. During the same time
period, an estimated 9.6 percent of the residents in the Town of Middletown and 7.8 percent of the
residents in the Town of Portsmouth had incomes that placed them below the national poverty level. In

Population

Total population in the region has been declining for the past 20 years. In 2010, Newport County had a
total population of 82,888 residents, a 4.9 percent decline from its 1990 population. Table 4.2-5 shows
total population statistics from 1990 to 2010 for the City of Newport, the towns of Middletown and
Portsmouth, Newport County as a whole, and the State of Rhode Island as a whole. The City of Newport
is the most populous community in the county and accounted for 29.7 percent of the county’s total 2010
population, with 24,672 residents. During the same year, the Town of Portsmouth had 17,389 residents
and the Town of Middletown had 16,150 residents (see Table 4.2-5).
Partially as a result of the realignments occurring at NAVSTA Newport and reduction in employment by
military contractors located in Newport County, population in the county as a whole declined during the
last decade. Between 2000 and 2010, the populations of the City of Newport and the Town of
Middletown both declined by 6.8 percent. This rate of decline was more than twice the county’s rate of 3
percent between 2000 and 2010. In contrast, the population of the Town of Portsmouth increased by 1.4
percent during that same period (Table 4.2-5).

Housing and Commercial Property

According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, there were a total of 13,152 housing units in
the City of Newport, 7,238 housing units in the Town of Middletown, and 8,369 housing units in the
Town of Portsmouth in 2013. Table 4.2-6 shows the total number of housing units by type of structure.
The City of Newport, which had the largest number of housing units, also had the largest number of
multi-family units. Of the 13,152 housing units in the city, 43.3 percent were classified as single-family
detached units, 4.8 percent were considered single-family attached units, 0.3 percent were mobile homes,
and the remaining 51.6 percent of the units were considered multi-family units. In comparison, over 55
percent of all units in Middletown and more than 75 percent of units in Portsmouth were classified as
single-family detached units (see Table 4.2-6).

Corresponding to the high number of multi-family units located in the City of Newport, there were also a
large number of renters in the city. In 2013, approximately 56.3 percent of the occupied housing units in
the City of Newport were rented accommodations, while only 43.7 percent of all occupied housing was
owner-occupied. In contrast, during the same time period, the Town of Portsmouth had a total of 7,087
occupied housing units; 74.5 percent of these were owner-occupied and only 25.5 percent were renteroccupied. The Town of Middletown had a total of 6,536 occupied housing units in 2013; 52.1 percent of
these were owner-occupied and 47.9 percent were renter-occupied units.
In 2013, all three communities experienced low homeowner vacancy rates, with the Town of Middletown
experiencing the lowest homeowner vacancy rate. Only 0.5 percent of the owner-occupied units were
vacant in the Town of Middletown in 2013. The City of Newport and the Town of Portsmouth had
homeowner vacancy rates of only 1.4 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. Rental vacancy rates were
slightly higher in all three communities. The Town of Middletown had the lowest rental vacancy rate,
which was 3.2 percent in 2013. The City of Newport and the Town of Portsmouth had rental vacancy
rates of 3.9 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively (see Table 4.2-7).

As shown in Table 4.2-8, the Town of Middletown, with nearly 1.2 million square feet of office space,
accounts for the majority of office space on the island; the Town of Portsmouth, with approximately 1.1
million square feet of industrial space, accounts for the majority of industrial space; and the City of
Newport, with 2.3 million square feet of retail space, accounts for the majority of retail space in the area.
As indicated by the vacancy rates shown in Table 4.2-9, the overall Rhode Island market for suburban
office space and industrial properties experienced a significant downturn following the financial crises
and ensuing economic downturn in 2009. Suburban office space in the entire state was experiencing
vacancy rates above 20 percent from 2009 through 2012. In 2013, the vacancy rate dipped to 19.6
percent, closer to 2008 vacancy rates (see Table 4.2-9).

In contrast, Aquidneck Island has seen lower vacancy rates than elsewhere in Rhode Island (CBRE/New
England 2011), due in part to the presence of the defense industry. However, the office space vacancy
rate on the island was 12.6 percent in 2011, nearly twice what it had been in 2008, whereas the suburban
office space market in the entire state had almost returned to its pre-recession 2008 levels by 2012 (see

The vacancy rate for industrial properties in Rhode Island increased slightly between 2008 and 2011 and
began to decline in 2012 and 2013. The Providence Business News reported in February 2013 that the
market for industrial properties had “stabilized” and that vacancy rates in this category had begun to fall;
the paper went on to report that sales prices and rents for industrial properties “are still bouncing along the
bottom” (Providence Business News 2013). According to market analyses published by Capstone
Properties, a real estate development company that serves the State of Rhode Island, there is an “ample”
supply of retail space in Rhode Island and little activity in this market over the past few years (Capstone
Properties 2011, 2012).

Taxes and Revenue

The City of Newport’s total revenues in the FY ending June 30, 2014, were approximately $141.5
million. Local property tax receipts ($71.3 million) accounted for more than 50.0 percent of this total.
Charges for services were another major source of local revenue in the city. In the FY ending June 30,
2014, charges for services generated $42.2 million, or 29.8 percent of total revenues in the city (Sitrin
2014).
The Town of Middletown received approximately $72.5 million in total revenues during the FY ending
June 30, 2014. Approximately 60.1 percent, or $43.6 million, of the town’s revenues were from taxes
levied on real and tangible personal property. An additional 17.0 percent, or $12.3 million, of total
revenue was collected from charges for services (Lefkowitz, Garfinkel, Champi, & DeRienzo P.C. 2012).
In the FY ending June 30, 2014, the Town of Portsmouth collected approximately $64.7 million in total
revenues. Property taxes and payments in lieu of taxes generated $48.0 million, or approximately 74.0
percent of the town’s total revenues. An additional $5.1 million, or 7.9 percent of the town’s total
revenues, were collected through charges for services (Town of Portsmouth 2014).
Table 4.2-10 provides property tax rates in the City of Newport and towns of Middletown and Portsmouth
by class of property for FY 2014. Motor vehicles are assessed at 70 percent of their fair market value in
the Town of Portsmouth. The City of Newport and the Town of Middletown assess motor vehicles at 100
percent of their fair market value. All other property is assessed at 100 percent of their fair market value
at time of assessment in each of the three municipalities (Rhode Island Department of Revenue, Division
of Municipal Finance 2014).

As shown on the table, minorities account for 11.8 percent of the State of Rhode Island’s total population,
while Hispanics or Latinos account for 12.1 percent of the state’s total population. Minorities accounted
for 14.7 percent of the total population in the Town of Middletown, 11.3 percent of the total population in
the City of Newport, and 5.0 percent of the total population in the Town of Portsmouth. All three
municipalities have a lower percentage of Hispanics or Latino population compared with the overall state
figures. In addition, the City of Newport and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth have a
significantly smaller percentage of persons living below poverty level compared with the State of Rhode
Island. Finally, the percent of persons under the age of 21 years ranged from 24.1 percent of the total
population in the City of Newport to a high of 27.1 percent in the Town of Portsmouth (see Table 4.2-11).

Former Navy Lodge Property

Coddington Highway. Coddington Highway is an east/west principal arterial that terminates with its
intersection at West Main Road and transitions to J.T. Connell Highway west of the property.
Coddington Highway has recently been configured to include one travel lane in each direction, with bus
stops on both sides, a left turning lane, and a bicycle lane in each direction. Coddington Highway is in
the RIDOT’s jurisdiction. The roadway provides direct access to NAVSTA Newport at Gate 10. The
posted speed limit is 25 miles per hour (mph).
West Main Road (Route 114). West Main Road is a north/south principal arterial that traverses
Aquidneck Island from Mount Hope Bridge at the north end of the island to the intersection of Admiral
Kalbfus Road, Broadway, and Maintonomia Avenue in the City of Newport. It is designated as State
Route 114 and is in RIDOT’s jurisdiction. West Main Road is generally a four-lane roadway. Left and/or
right turn lanes are present at most of the signalized intersections along the corridor. The posted speed
limit is 30 mph from Forest Avenue to West Main Road in front of the property. Bus stops are located at
several locations along the roadway.
West Main Road (Route 114) and Coddington Highway/Rockwood Road Intersection. The
intersection of West Main Road and Coddington Highway is a four-way signalized intersection that also
includes Rockwood Road. West Main Road forms the northbound and southbound approaches,
Coddington Highway forms the eastbound approach, and Rockwood Road, a local unclassified roadway,
forms the westbound approach. Left and right turn lanes exist in the northbound and eastbound
directions. A right turn lane is on West Main Road in the southbound direction.
West Main Road (Route 114) and Valley Road (Route 214) Intersection. The intersection of West
Main Road with Valley Road is north of the property and forms a three-way signalized intersection. West
Main Road runs north–south and Valley Road runs east–west. A left turn lane is in the southbound
direction and in the westbound direction. Valley Road is classified as an urban principal arterial.

4.4.2

Existing Traffic Volumes

Traffic volumes were collected in October 2012 during peak hours at the intersections of West Main Road
and Coddington Highway and West Main Road and Valley Road, near the former Navy Lodge property.
In addition, total daily traffic counts were conducted on Coddington Highway west of the property and on
West Main Road north of the property. Peak-hour traffic volumes for the morning and evening are shown
in Table 4.4-1. The peak traffic hours varied, but morning peak volumes generally occurred between 7:45
a.m. and 9:00 a.m., while evening peak volumes typically occurred between 4:45 p.m. and 5:45 p.m.
Traffic volume was higher at both intersections during the evening peak hour. Overall traffic volumes for
the two roadways are similar; however, the West Main Road and Valley Road intersection had a higher
volume. Table 4.4-1 also shows the average daily traffic volume at two points near the former Navy
Lodge property. On an average day, traffic volume on West Main Road is more than 26,000 vehicles and
on Coddington Highway more than 18,000 vehicles.

Roadway Intersection Level of Service

A capacity analysis characterized the LOS for the two intersections analyzed near the former Navy Lodge
property. LOS is a qualitative measure that describes general operating conditions based on factors such
as speed, travel times, and delays. LOS is reported on a scale of ‘A’ to ‘F.’ ‘A’ represents the best
operating conditions, with free-flowing traffic; ‘F’ represents the worst operating conditions, with
significant delays. Both signalized intersections currently operate at LOS B during the morning peak
hour (see Table 4.4-2). The West Main Road (Route 114) and Coddington Highway/Rockwood Road
intersection operates at LOS C during the evening peak hour. The West Main Road (Route 114) and
Valley Road (Route 214) intersection operates at LOS B during the evening peak hour.

Safety Conditions

Accident data from January 2010 to October 2012 were reviewed for the following road segments near
the former Navy Lodge property:
•

West Main Road between Chases Lane and East Main Road

•

Coddington Highway between West Main Road and the Newport city line.

During this period, 136 vehicle accidents were reported, including 65 rear-end collisions, 22 broadside
crashes, 20 angle crashes, 15 sideswipes, 5 head-on crashes, 4 involving a bicyclist or a pedestrian, 3
involving a loss of control of the vehicle, and 2 collisions with an object. Of the 13 intersections along
these road segments, the majority of the vehicle accidents (61 [45 percent]) were reported at the
intersection of West Main Road and East Main Road; 27 of these were rear-end collisions. A total of 38
accidents were reported at the intersection of Coddington Highway and West Main Road. RIDOT has
recently improved the intersection of West Main Road and East Main Road as well as sections of
Coddington Highway to improve safety (Pare Corporation 2013).
A speed study was conducted at Coddington Highway west of West Main Road and on West Main Road
near Browns Lane. Coddington Highway has a posted speed of 25 mph, and 98 percent of the vehicles

using the road travel above the speed limit. The average speed of vehicles on this roadway was 36 mph.
West Main Road near Browns Lane has a posted speed of 35 mph, and 19 percent of vehicles travel above
the speed limit. The average speed of vehicles on this roadway was 32 mph (Pare Corporation 2013).

4.4.5

Public Transportation

The RIPTA provides fixed-route bus service throughout Rhode Island, including Aquidneck Island.
Several bus routes serve the community near the former Navy Lodge property and are described below
(RIPTA 2013a).

4.5

•

Route 60 – Route 60 bus service between Newport and Providence via Middletown and
Portsmouth originates at the Gateway Center in Newport; the buses travel along West and
East Main Roads. Several bus stops are located in front of the former Navy Lodge
property (RIPTA 2013b).

•

Route 63 – Route 63 bus service between Newport and Middletown begins at the
Gateway Center in Newport and travels to Newport Towne Center, located just north of
the former Naval Hospital, before continuing along Coddington Highway near the former
Navy Lodge property (RIPTA 2013c).

•

Route 64 – Route 64 connects Newport with the University of Rhode Island in Kingston.
The bus route begins at Gateway Center and travels north to Third Street, providing
service along Coddington Highway in front of the property (RIPTA 2013d).

Environmental Management

This section summarizes the existing conditions regarding hazardous waste, hazardous materials, medical
waste, and the Environmental Restoration Program for the former Navy Lodge property.

4.5.1

Hazardous Waste

Universal wastes such as fluorescent light bulbs and batteries likely were generated at the former Navy
Lodge property when it was in use. In accordance with NAVSTA Newport installation-wide policies,
universal wastes would have been transported off-site for disposal or recycling within one year of
accumulation and storage (Michael Baker Jr., Inc. 2011). No other hazardous waste is known to have
been generated at the former Navy Lodge property before its demolition, and no hazardous waste is
currently generated there (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).

4.5.2

Hazardous Materials

4.5.2.1
Hazardous Material Control
Hazardous materials are not known to be used at the former Navy Lodge property because it is currently
vacant, and the Tier II Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory report for 2011 does not list
hazardous materials for the property (NAVSTA Newport 2012d). The Tier II Emergency and Hazardous
Chemical Inventory report for 2002, when the Navy Lodge was still standing, similarly does not list
hazardous materials for the property (Malcolm Pirnie 2003). Cleaning supplies and similar hazardous
materials most likely were stored and used in the building when it was in use.
The installation spill log for 2002 through 2011 does not list any spills at the former Navy Lodge property
(NAVSTA Newport 2012e).

Draft EIS

Former Navy Lodge Property

4.5.2.2
Underground Storage Tanks
There are no active USTs on the former Navy Lodge property (Aerostar 2012). The environmental
baseline survey checklist prepared for the 2004 demolition of the lodge indicated that a UST may have
been located on the property at one time (NAVSTA Newport 2004b). If so, such a UST likely would
have been used for fuel oil or diesel for an emergency generator.
4.5.2.3
Aboveground Storage Tanks
There are no current or former ASTs associated with the former Navy Lodge property (U.S. Department
of the Navy 2009).
4.5.2.4
Oil/Water Separators
There are no OWSs associated with the former Navy Lodge property.
4.5.2.5
Asbestos-Containing Materials
The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant and covered with grass, and there are no building
sources of ACM. Underground water and steam lines may be insulated with asbestos-containing pipe
wrap. ACM reported for the Navy Lodge from a 1992 sampling event was removed and disposed of offsite before the lodge was demolished in 2004 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
4.5.2.6
Lead-Based Paint/Lead
The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant and covered with grass, and there are no known
sources of LBP or lead on the property. LBP reported for the Navy Lodge from a 1993 sampling event
was removed and disposed of off-site before the lodge was demolished in 2004 (U.S. Department of the
Navy 2009).
4.5.2.7
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
One transformer was located at the former Navy Lodge property, but there is no documentation regarding
transformer or electrical equipment types, conditions, PCB content, or maintenance (U.S. Department of
the Navy 2009). PCB-containing transformers were removed or replaced at NAVSTA Newport in the
1980s (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009), and the Navy is not otherwise aware of any PCB-containing
transformers at the installation (CNIC n.d.[d]). The site is currently vacant and covered with grass, and
there are no sources of PCBs on the property.
4.5.2.8
Pesticides
Pesticides are not known to have been stored, nor are they currently stored, at the former Navy Lodge
property (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). Pesticides likely were used at the lodge when it was
operational and would have been applied in accordance with the policies of NAVSTA Newport in effect
at the time. The property is currently vacant and covered with grass; therefore, current pesticide use
would be minimal.
4.5.2.9
Radioactive Materials
There are no radioactive materials associated with the former Navy Lodge property (U.S. Department of
the Navy 2009).
4.5.2.10 Radon
The records do not indicate that the former Navy Lodge building was tested for radon prior to its
demolition in 2004 (NAVSTA Newport 1996). The property is currently vacant, and radon levels at the
site are unknown.

Draft EIS

4-22

4.5.3

Medical Waste

Medical wastes were not generated at the former Navy Lodge when it was in use and are not generated on
the property now (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).

4.5.4

Environmental Restoration Program

There are no ER Program sites at the former Navy Lodge property. The ER Program site nearest to the
former Navy Lodge property is IRP Study Area 4, Coddington Cove Rubble Fill Area. This ER Program
site is located approximately 0.5 miles west of the former Navy Lodge property, and the two locations are
separated by developed areas (see Section 3, Figure 3.5-1). The Coddington Cove Rubble Fill Area is an
approximately 8-acre site used from 1978 to 1982 to dispose of C&D debris and general fill material such
as rubble, concrete, asphalt, slate, wood, brush, and (possibly) ash. Investigations in 2004 showed
elevated levels of arsenic and lead in groundwater and elevated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), pesticides, and metals in soil (NAVFAC 2013b). Contaminants in site media have little potential
of migrating off-site to other areas and pose minimal risk to human health and the environment. As a
result, no further action has been recommended for the Coddington Cove Rubble Fill Area site
(Resolution Consultants 2014).

4.6

Air Quality

4.6.1

Existing Air Quality

Section 3.6 describes the regional air quality and applicable regulations and requirements. The CAA is
the primary federal statute governing the control of air quality. The former Navy Lodge property is in the
Town of Middletown, Newport County, Rhode Island. This location is within the Providence, Rhode
Island air quality region, which encompasses all of Rhode Island and is currently in attainment for all
NAAQS. The state is under the jurisdiction of the RIDEM for air quality.

4.6.2

Existing Emissions

The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant and covered with grass. Therefore, there are no
existing stationary or mobile sources of criteria pollutants, HAPs, or GHG emissions from the current use
of the property.

4.7

Noise

Ambient sound levels are a function of a variety of sources: local traffic, barking dogs, birds, insects,
lawnmowers, children playing, and the interaction of the wind with groundcover, buildings, trees, shrubs,
power lines, etc. Sound levels vary with time of day, wind speed and direction, and the level of human
activity. The acoustic environment around the former Navy Lodge property is mainly characterized by
traffic noise during daytime hours.
Table 4.7-1 presents the minimum and maximum hourly average Leq sound levels measured in 2010 at the
monitoring station nearest to the former Navy Lodge property (LT-3) (Tech Environmental 2011) (see
Figure 3.7-1 in Section 3.7).

To characterize the existing traffic noise near the former Navy Lodge property, the peak afternoon traffic
volume, vehicle speed, and vehicle mix data for the roadways analyzed in the traffic study conducted in
October 2012 (Pare Corporation 2013) were modeled using TNM version 2.5. Noise levels ranged from
60.7 to 66.6 dBA.

4.8

Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the existing infrastructure, utilities, and solid waste management at the former
Navy Lodge property.

4.8.1

Water Supply

Water was supplied to the former Navy Lodge property by the City of Newport. The City of Newport
owns and maintains two water mains that are located along West Main Street, including a 24-inch water
main along the west side of West Main Road and an 18-inch water main along the east side of West Main
Road (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Lines from the water mains to the former Navy Lodge property
were cut and capped with the closure of the former Navy Lodge property (Carlson 2012).
Two active water lines cross the former Navy Lodge property. A 16-inch water main that supplies water
to NAVSTA Newport and a chlorine/water meter vent are located along the southern boundary of the
property, along Coddington Highway. Additionally, a water line at the northern end of the property
supplies water to an apartment housing development on the west side of the property (RKG Associates,
Inc. et al. 2011).
Most of the Town of Middletown is supplied with potable water from the City of Newport, although some
households rely on groundwater wells. The City of Newport also owns and maintains the water
distribution system in Middletown (City of Newport Department of Utilities 2013a). (Further discussion
of the City of Newport water supply is provided in Section 6.8.1).

4.8.2

Wastewater

The former Navy Lodge property was connected to the NAVSTA Newport wastewater collection system
via a 10-inch line (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). NAVSTA Newport and the Town of Middletown
own and maintain sewer lines within their respective jurisdictions. Wastewater is collected for treatment
in the City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant. The line from the former Navy Lodge property was
cut and capped with the closure of the former Navy Lodge property (Carlson 2012).
The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant is located on J.T. Connell Highway and has a licensed
capacity of 10.7 million gallons per day (mgd). The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant treats
wastewater from the City of Newport, the Town of Middletown, the Melville area of Portsmouth, and
NAVSTA Newport. In 2012, the plant treated wastewater at a rate of 9.46 mgd (City of Newport
Department of Finance 2012a).
The Town of Middletown is allocated 2.1 mgd of treatment capacity from the City of Newport under an
inter-municipal agreement. Historically, Middletown has exceeded this treatment capacity by 2 to 3
percent (Northeast Engineers and Consultants 2008). Much of the extraneous flow is attributed to storm
water infiltration (Northeast Engineers and Consultants 2008). In 2008, a complaint was filed in the U.S.
District Court against the town alleging that the sewer and storm water systems violated standards and
requirements of the CWA. As part of a settlement, the town evaluated projects to address sanitary flow in
2011, and measures to reduce inflow and infiltration were identified as the most feasible (Lefkowitz,
Garfinkel, Champi, and DeRienzo 2012). More than $10 million in sewer improvements in Middletown
are planned between 2014 and 2018 (Lefkowitz, Garfinkel, Champi, and DeRienzo 2012). The former

Navy Lodge is located in subarea G, which was identified as the number one priority for addressing
infiltration and inflow concerns in a 2003 sewer study (The Louis Berger Group, Inc. 2003).

4.8.3

Storm Water

The former Navy Lodge property has a general slope from the southwest corner towards West Main
Road. Storm water runoff flows into five catch basins that discharge to Middletown’s storm water system
under West Main Road or into catch basins west of the property (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009;
RKG Associates et al. 2011).
Storm water from the property is managed by the Town of Middletown. The town relies primarily on a
system of outfalls and 1,420 catch basins for storm water management.

4.8.4

Other Utility Systems

This section provides a discussion of the electrical and natural gas supplies in the communities
surrounding all four surplus properties: the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval Hospital
property, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Electricity
National Grid is the primary electrical utility providing connection and distribution services in the Town
of Middletown. This is a user-supported utility service, and the customers pay for the service and
electricity supplied. Overhead electric lines are located along Coddington Highway and West Main Road
(RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
Table 4.8-1 shows electrical usage for the Town of Middletown between 2009 through 2011. As shown
in Table 4.8-1, the Town of Middletown consumed more than 115 million kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2011.
The 2011 electric consumption represented a decrease from 2010, but it was an increase over the levels
used in 2009. According to the 2012 Regional System Plan developed by ISO New England (2012),
Rhode Island’s overall electricity demand has been forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually
over the next decade.

Natural Gas
The Town of Middletown and the surrounding region is serviced by National Grid. This is a usersupported utility service, and the customers pay for service and natural gas supplied.
Table 4.8-2 shows natural gas usage for the Town of Middletown in 2010 and 2011. The Town of
Middletown consumed more than 105 billion cubic feet (cf) of natural gas in 2011, a 6 percent increase
over usage in 2010.

Solid Waste

Solid wastes were generated at the former Navy Lodge while it was in use. Nonhazardous solid waste
would have consisted primarily of mixed trash, paper, cardboard, and food waste. Solid waste was
disposed of at the installation landfill until the 1980s, after which it was collected by installation
personnel and disposed of at a transfer station in the City of Newport. Since 1995, solid waste generated
at NAVSTA Newport has been collected, disposed of, and recycled off-site by a contractor (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009).

4.9

Cultural Resources

This section describes the existing cultural resources and historic properties that are located within the
APE for the proposed action at the former Navy Lodge property. The boundary of the APE is the same as
the boundary of the property that will be disposed (see Figure 4.9-1). Cultural resources within the APE
would consist of archaeological sites and archaeologically sensitive areas and architectural resources.
Archaeological and architectural resources are discussed in greater detail in Sections 4.9.1 and 4.9.2,
respectively. A discussion of Native American resources is provided in Section 4.9.3. Cultural resources
that were determined to be historic properties are discussed in greater detail in Section 4.9.4.
In general, the APE was considered sensitive for cultural resources that were associated with a variety of
cultural periods of human occupation. Previously recorded archaeological sites or archaeologically
sensitive areas were identified in the vicinity of the APE, indicating prehistoric and historic settlement
and/or use of the general project area. Extant buildings and structures identified in the vicinity of the
APE document more recent occupation and use of the area from the mid-nineteenth century to the
present.
4.9.1
Archaeological Resources
The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation conducted within the APE at the former Navy Lodge
property consisted of the excavation of a total of four shovel tests. Shovel tests were placed outside the
footprint of the former structure to determine whether intact soils were present. None of the shovel tests
contained any artifacts. Generally, shovel test profiles revealed that the entire parcel has been
significantly disturbed by cut and fill associated with construction and demolition of the former structure.
Based on these results, no archaeological sites were identified within the APE at the former Navy Lodge
property, and no further archaeological investigations of the APE at the former Navy Lodge property
were recommended (Gould and LeeDecker 2014). The Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on
the lack of archaeological sensitivity of the former Navy Lodge property; the Rhode Island SHPO
concurred that no further archaeological investigations of this area were required (Lin 2013; Sanderson
2013b).

4.9.2
Architectural Resources
There are two extant support structures within the APE at the former Navy Lodge property: a small utility
shed located in the southwestern corner of the property and a small concrete pad and associated water
meter vent on the northeastern corner (see Figure 4.9-1). Neither of these two structures is a historic
structure or considered NRHP-eligible. The Navy Lodge formerly located on the property was
constructed in 1971 and demolished in 2004 (Gould and LeeDecker 2014). No other buildings or
structures are located within the APE at the former Navy Lodge property. Therefore, the 2013
architectural survey and evaluation update conducted for the proposed action did not include the APE at
the former Navy Lodge property (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014).

4.9.3

Native American Resources

The Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian tribes regarding Native American
resources within the APE at the former Navy Lodge property: the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee
Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for copies of
consultation letters). Consultation remains open.

4.9.4

NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties

The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation conducted for the proposed action resulted in the
determination that no archaeological resources that are historic properties are present within the APE
(Gould and LeeDecker 2014). Additionally, Navy determined that no architectural resources that were
historic properties are present within the APE. The Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on this
determination of no historic properties present; the Rhode Island SHPO concurred that no historic
properties were present within the APE at the former Navy Lodge property (Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b).

4.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the existing topography, geology, and soil conditions at the former Navy Lodge
property.

4.10.1

Topography

The topography of the former Navy Lodge property is relatively flat; a minor slope exists from the
southwest corner towards West Main Road. Elevations range from approximately 65 feet above mean sea
level (amsl) at its northern boundary to approximately 70 feet amsl at its southern boundary). The nearest
body of water is Bailey’s Brook, located approximately 1,000 feet east of the site.

4.10.2

Geology

The former Navy Lodge property lies within the New England physiographic province (USGS 2002).
The site is located on the Rhode Island Formation of the stratified Narragansett Bay Group of the
Pennsylvanian period (323 million to 290 million years ago). The Narragansett Bay Group rocks are part
of the Esmond-Dedham subterrane of the Southeastern New England Avalon zone. The Esmond-Dedham
Subterrane Narragansett Bay Group is deposited upon older rocks of both West Bay and East Bay parts of
the Esmond-Dedham subterrane. The Narragansett Bay Group–Rhode Island Formation consists of metasandstone, meta-conglomerate, schist, carbonaceous schist, and graphite. Plant fossils are common
(USGS 2013).
According to the USGS, only one earthquake has ever been recorded as possibly being centered in the
State of Rhode Island. This earthquake was recorded on February 27, 1883 (USGS 2009). No other
earthquakes have been recorded in the state. The former Navy Lodge property is located in an earthquake
zone (although not near any known fault locations [USGS 2005]) where, in a 50-year period, there is only
a 2 percent chance of an earthquake occurring with a peak acceleration (ground movement) of 8 percent

Draft EIS

4-29

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

to 10 percent acceleration due to gravity (%g). It takes a peak acceleration of 10%g to cause damage to
buildings; therefore, there is minimal risk of an earthquake that would cause damage to a building on the
former Navy Lodge property (USGS 2009).

4.10.3

Soils

4.10.3.1 Soil Types
Soil types present on the former Navy Lodge property include Newport-Urban land complex and Urban
land (see Table 4.10.1 and Figure 4.10-1).

Newport-Urban Land Complex (NP)
Newport-Urban land complex consists of well-drained Newport soils and areas of urban land. The main
limitation of the Newport soils for development is the slow or very slow permeability in the substratum.
Roads and streets require special design to prevent frost-heaving (USDA 1981).
Urban Land (Ur)
Urban land consists mostly of sites for buildings, paved roads, and parking lots. Areas of this soil require
on-site investigation and evaluation for most land use decisions (USDA 1981).
4.10.3.2 Soil Characteristics and Limitations
As indicated in Section 3.10, the USDA rates soils according to characteristics that could limit
development. These characteristics include the following:
•

Erosion Potential. The soil erosion potential for the Newport-Urban land complex is
moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at a depth of 24 to 30 inches, which means
the soils are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff
(USDA 2012; Institute of Water Research [IWR] 2002). No erosion potential was listed
for urban land (USDA 2012).

•

Hydric Soils. Both of the soils (Newport-Urban land complex and Urban land) are listed
as dominantly non-hydric, although non-hydric soil can contain hydric inclusions (USDA
2012).

•

Constructability. There are moderate constraints on development with Newport-Urban
land complex soil and restrictions on residential or commercial development if on-site
septic tanks are to be used.
The more common sources of constructability limitations for these soils include shallow
excavations (slight limitations due to dense to very dense soils), moderate frost action,
and a moderate slope. These soils are dense to very dense, which makes excavation
difficult; however, they have a low shrink-swell potential (USDA 2012, 1981).
Urban land soils have a few restrictions on development if on-site septic tanks are to be
used. These soils are human transported material (fill) (USDA 2012, 1981).

Former Navy Lodge Property

4.10.3.3 Farmland Soils
Soils located at the former Navy Lodge property are not rated for farmland (USDA 2012).

4.11 Water Resources

The following sections summarize the existing conditions and physical characteristics of water resources
found on and in the vicinity of the former Navy Lodge property.

4.11.1

Surface Water

The site does not have any surface water resources. Bailey’s Brook, the closest surface waterbody, is
located approximately 1,000 feet (or approximately 0.2 miles) to the east of the former Navy Lodge
property.
The Aquidneck Island–Frontal Atlantic Ocean subwatershed (HUC 010900040911), in which the former
Navy Lodge property is located, is predominantly covered by urban and suburban areas (University of
Rhode Island Environmental Data Center 2013a). The former Navy lodge property is also in the Town of
Middletown’s designated watershed protection district. The purpose of this watershed protection district
is three-fold:
1. To protect, preserve, and maintain the quality and supply of groundwater and surface
water upon which the residents of the town and others depend;
2. To protect the quality and supply of water by regulating the use and development of land
adjoining water courses or primary water recharge areas and to prevent uses of land
detrimental thereto; and
3. To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
Two zones have been established as part of the watershed protection district:
•

Zone 1 is an area critical to the protection of surface and sub-surface water supplies and
requires a high degree of protection from incompatible land uses.

•

Zone 2 is the watershed area that contributes surface water runoff to the primary water
bodies in Zone 1 and that drains into Zone 1 areas either though surface water runoff or
groundwater movement.

These two zones encompass the majority of the town, with the exception of the most western and eastern
limits. The former Navy Lodge property is located in Zone 2.

4.11.2

Water Quality

The site does not have any surface water resources (see Figure 4.11-1). Bailey’s Brook is the closest
surface waterbody. This waterbody is classified as AA, a source of public drinking water supply (see
Table 3.11-1). Bailey’s Brook and its tributaries are classified by RIDEM in the State of Rhode Island
2012 303(d) List – List of Impaired Waters as impaired for non-attainment of the following designated
uses: fish and wildlife habitat, primary contact recreation, and secondary contact recreation (RIDEM
2012a). Fish and wildlife habitat is indicated as impaired based on the results of benthic
macroinvertebrate bio-assessments and the presence of lead. Both primary and secondary contactrecreation are listed as impaired because of the presence of the pathogen enterococcus (RIDEM 2012a).
The former Navy Lodge property is located in the Narragansett Bay watershed. A general water qualitypollution gradient along the Bay’s north-south axis shows that the sources of pollution in the Bay are

Draft EIS

4-33

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

largely concentrated in the Bay’s upper reaches (Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009). These
pollution sources include public wastewater treatment facility discharges, storm water and combined
sewer overflow (CSO) outlets, and urban runoff from densely populated areas (Narragansett Bay Estuary
Program 2009). Pollution levels typically decrease toward the mouth of the estuary because the water is
diluted by seawater and there are fewer point sources of pollution.
Wastewater treatment facilities are a major source of nitrogen in Narragansett Bay. The facilities that
treat CSOs are also major sources of pathogens and other contaminants during periods of heavy rains,
which can result in discharges to the Bay and its tributaries (Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009).

4.11.3

Groundwater

Groundwater in the East Bay section of Rhode Island is generally provided by aquifers in till and bedrock.
The average depth to groundwater is approximately 5 to 12 feet (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2014). Depth to
the water table in Newport Urban land complex soils, the primary soil type at the surplus property, is less
than 6 feet (University of Rhode Island Cooperative Extension and Rhode Island Health Source Water
Assessment Program 2003).
Groundwater in the vicinity of the former Navy Lodge property is classified by the RIDEM as GA
(RIDEM 2010d). As described in Section 3.11, GA groundwater resources are designated as suitable for
public or private drinking water use without treatment. No wellhead protection areas exist around the
former Navy Lodge property; the closest wellhead protection area is located approximately 1.7 miles to
the southeast (RIDEM 2010d).

4.11.4

Floodplains

No FEMA-delineated floodplains exist on the former Navy Lodge property. The closest floodplains are
those associated with Bailey’s Brook, located approximately 1,000 feet to the east.

4.11.5

Wetlands

No wetlands are present within the boundaries of the former Navy Lodge property. The closest wetlands
are located 1,500 feet (or 0.3 miles) to the southeast.

4.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the existing vegetation and wildlife, including threatened and endangered
species and significant wildlife habitat, at the former Navy Lodge property.

4.12.1

Vegetation

The former Navy Lodge property is highly developed with little to no diversity in vegetation. The
vegetation at the site is limited and consists primarily of maintained grass, which covers approximately
2.5 acres, or 83 percent, of the site. The remainder of the site, approximately 0.5 acres, is developed land.

4.12.2

Wildlife

Potential wildlife present at the former Navy Lodge property is limited because the site is predominantly
maintained grass and impervious surfaces.

Former Navy Lodge Property

Terrestrial Mammals
Mammals occurring at the former Navy Lodge property are limited to those species adapted to
urban/suburban conditions, such as the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), common raccoon
(Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis)
(NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2001). The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and woodchuck are also
likely present at the former Navy Lodge property.
Herpetofauna
The existing habitat at the former Navy Lodge property precludes any species of herpetofauna occupying
the site.
Avian Species
A discussion of avian species common to the areas around the surplus properties, including the former
Navy Lodge property, and nearby IBAs is provided in Section 3.12.1.2.

4.12.3

Threatened and Endangered Species

No federally listed or state-listed species occur at the former Navy Lodge property. Agency review letters
were sent to the USFWS, NOAA Fisheries, and RIDEM requesting updated information regarding listed
species. A response from USFWS received on February 13, 2013, indicated that no federally listed or
proposed threatened or endangered species or critical habitat is known to occur at the former Navy Lodge
property (Chapman 2013). Additionally, a response from RIDEM received on February 12, 2013,
indicated that no state-listed or candidate rare, threatened, or endangered species are known to occur at
the former Navy Lodge property (Jordan 2013). The USFWS designated the northern long-eared bat as a
threatened species under the ESA, effective May 4, 2015. However, no habitat exists for the northern
long-eared bat at the former Navy Lodge property.

4.12.4

Significant Wildlife Habitat

The RIDEM’s Division of Planning and Development reviewed the Rhode Island Natural Heritage
Program database and has indicated that no unique natural communities or other significant wildlife
communities live at or near the surplus property (Jordan 2013).
Wetlands
There are no wetlands or special aquatic habitats at the former Navy Lodge property.
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at the former Navy Lodge property.

5 Former Navy Lodge Environmental Consequences
5.1

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section describes the potential land use impacts resulting from disposal and reuse of the former Navy
Lodge property under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an
examination of site-specific land use impacts, direct and indirect 10 impacts on surrounding existing land
uses, consistency with local zoning and land use plans, and consistency with the enforceable policies of
the RI CRMP. The study area includes the former Navy Lodge property and land within 0.25 miles in the
Town of Middletown.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, the former Navy Lodge
property would be under the jurisdiction of the Town of Middletown. The use of the land and the
development of new buildings or structures on the site would be regulated by the Town of Middletown’s
zoning code and other applicable plans and regulations.

5.1.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.1.1.1
On-Site Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would result in a change to the land use of the former Navy Lodge
property from vacant to retail land uses. Approximately 1.8 acres (60 percent) of the former Navy Lodge
property would be redeveloped with retail land uses. Two one-story retail buildings would be constructed
on 0.7 acres of the site. A parking area covering 0.8 acres would be constructed between and around the
buildings, and 0.3 acres would be used as access to the site from Coddington Highway (see Figure 5.1-1).
The remaining 1.2 acres of the site would be left as open space.
Implementation of Alternative 1 would impact the existing land use through the introduction of a new
retail land use at the currently undeveloped site and through reduction in open space. Implementation of
Alternative 1 also would result in the public having access to the formerly restricted military property.
Due to the development of approximately 60 percent of the property from vacant to retail uses, these
impacts would be considered moderate.
5.1.1.2
Surrounding Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would introduce a new retail land use in the study area, which would be
consistent with nearby commercial land uses. The site is located at the intersection of two local arterial
roadways, Coddington Highway and West Main Road, which are developed with similar commercial land
uses (see Figure 5.1-1). Redevelopment of the property under Alternative 1 is not expected to directly
impact adjacent residential land uses to the west, northwest, and south of the property.
The former Navy Lodge property is located in the Town of Middletown’s West Main/Coddington
Development Center Master Plan planning area (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates
2011). Redevelopment of the site as described under Alternative 1 is included in the master plan and
could influence the timing, type, and scale of redevelopment of the other properties considered in the
plan, including the town’s recreation complex, the Middletown public library, and the former John F.
Kennedy elementary school. These properties together comprise 14 acres. The scale of the
redevelopment proposed in the master plan would result in a change in the type and intensity of land use
around the site that could result in growth-induced changes in land use on other commercial properties on
10

Indirect impacts on surrounding land uses are based on the potential for the proposed action to generate changes
in the land use type, pattern, or density.

Coddington Highway and West Main Road and, subsequently, a need for transportation improvements.
Construction of any transportation improvements would be the responsibility of the Town of Middletown,
and the town has identified potential transportation improvements in the West Main/Coddington
Development Center Master Plan (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates 2011) that may be
warranted, e.g., additional access roads and roundabouts at busy intersections. Because of the potential
for Alternative 1 to contribute to and influence the proposed redevelopment in this area, this alternative
would have a moderate indirect impact on surrounding land use. However, measures are available to the
Town of Middletown to control these impacts during the redevelopment process, and impacts would not
be significant. These measures include a minimum lot-width requirement in traffic-sensitive areas to
reduce the number and increase spacing of access points to major roadways, as well as certain watershed
protection measures to protect, preserve, and maintain the quality of surface and groundwater used by the
town (see Section 4.1.3).
5.1.1.3
Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
The former Navy Lodge property is located in the Town of Middletown’s public zoning district (PA) in
an area designated as traffic-sensitive (Middletown Code of Ordinances Chapter 152 §720). While retail
business is not typically considered a public land use, if the former Navy Lodge property remains under
ownership by the Town of Middletown, this use would be consistent with the current zoning of the site.
The town’s zoning code does not permit privately owned retail land uses in the PA zoning district.
Furthermore, the zoning code requires property in a public zoning district to be rezoned if it is transferred
to a private owner for use for a non-governmental purpose. The Redevelopment Plan does not stipulate
that the site would be transferred to a private owner. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 1 would
be consistent with the existing zoning of the site and would not require rezoning the site to a designation
that allows retail land uses.
As noted in Section 4.1.3, the proposed Coddington Center Overlay District, which would allow
commercial, office, municipal government, and multi-family land uses by right or by special use permit,
was developed during the planning process for the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master
Plan. Implementation of this zoning overlay district would further facilitate implementation of
Alternative 1.
The site also is included in the town’s watershed protection district, Zone 2. The town has established the
watershed protection zone in its zoning code to protect surface water and groundwater supplies from
contamination by incompatible land uses. The proposed retail use under Alternative 1 would be
considered compatible and permitted as a by-right use in watershed protection district, Zone 2. (See also
Section 5.11, Water Resources, for a discussion of the proposed action’s impacts on water quality).
The Town of Middletown, RI, Comprehensive Community Plan Update designates the site for future use
as “institutional,” consistent with the property’s current zoning designation (Town of Middletown
Planning Department 2015). Implementation of Alternative 1 would be consistent with this designation
as long as the property remains under the Town of Middletown’s ownership. Alternative 1 also would be
consistent with the town’s goal to designate the area surrounding the property as a growth center in
conjunction with the proposed development outlined in the West Main/Coddington Development Center
Master Plan.
As noted, redevelopment of the site is included in the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master
Plan. Implementation of Alternative 1 would be consistent with the preferred redevelopment scenario
outlined in the master plan. Furthermore, coordinated redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property
and three adjacent municipality-owned properties would support one of the recommendations of the
town’s comprehensive plan to “promote coordinated planned development of large land parcels” to

address commercial sprawl and protect natural and scenic resources (Town of Middletown Planning
Department 2008).
Redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1 would be consistent with the
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan’s designation of the site and the adjacent municipality-owned
properties as a “mixed-use growth center” (The Cecil Group et al. 2005). Implementation of Alternative
1 would provide an economic benefit to the Town of Middletown, as discussed in Section 5.2.1, and
would be compatible with the mission at NAVSTA Newport. Redeveloping the site, which is located in a
developed area in one of the main commercial corridors in Middletown, would be consistent with the
master plan’s goals for promoting commercial infill development, “minimiz[ing] sprawl,” coordinating
the development of large parcels of land, and supporting municipal planning efforts (The Cecil Group et
al. 2005). In summary, the proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property would be
consistent with local planning, and no inconsistencies would result.
5.1.1.4
Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 1 is not
reasonably likely to affect the use or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the
surplus property under Alternative 1 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. However, redevelopment of the
former Navy Lodge property would not be a direct federal action and would, therefore, fall under the
CRMC’s direct state permitting authority under the Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal projects.
As noted in Section 4.1.4, the former Navy Lodge property is not located in any tidal waters, on a
shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, so state review of coastal resources under the
CRMP is not applicable at this site. Redevelopment would be required to comply with the applicable
policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as outlined in Section 4.1.4. For purposes of this analysis, a
summary of the consistency of the proposed reuse is provided below.
•

Section 130.8 Open Space and Public Access – Although the former Navy Lodge is not
located along the shoreline, redevelopment of this property would include the creation of
open space within the property boundaries. Therefore, the proposed action would be
fully consistent with this policy.

•

Section 150.1 Standards Applicable to Entire Development – The developer/owner of the
former Navy Lodge property will be responsible for providing separate and appropriate
environmental documentation and obtaining all the necessary permits from state and
federal agencies that meet the applicable standards, addressing areas such as storm water
management (i.e., Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual
and CRMP 300.6), groundwater protection, infrastructure, vegetation cover (i.e., Section
150.1, Standards Applicable to Entire Development), SAV, open space, construction
setback, and water quality associated with the proposed activity (i.e., Water Quality
Certificate from RIDEM and USACE permit, concurrent with their application to
CRMC). Therefore, the proposed action would be consistent with these standards to the
maximum extent practicable.

Official consultation with the Rhode Island CRMC was initiated on February 11, 2014, with a letter
outlining the Navy’s coastal consistency determination. The CRMC concurred with the Navy’s
determination that disposal of the surplus property under the preferred alternative would be conducted in
a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the CRMP, and that the developer of
the Navy Lodge property would be required to comply with the applicable policies of the Aquidneck
Island SAMP (Willis 2014). A copy of the letter is included in Appendix B.

5.1.2

Alternative 2

5.1.2.1
On-Site Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in a change in the land uses on the former Navy Lodge
property from vacant land to retail land uses. Approximately 2.1 acres (70 percent) of the former Navy
Lodge property would be redeveloped with retail land uses. Two two-story retail buildings would be
constructed on 0.7 acres of the site. The buildings would occupy the same footprint as the retail buildings
proposed under Alternative 1 but would provide twice as much retail space (61,000 square feet of retail
space compared with the 30,500 square feet proposed under Alternative 1). The parking area would
occupy 1.1 acres between and around the buildings and 0.3 acres would be used as access to the site from
Coddington Highway (see Figure 5.1-2). The remaining 0.9 acres of the site would be left as open space.
Alternative 2 would impact the existing land use at the site by introducing a new retail land use at the
currently undeveloped site and reducing open space. Implementation of Alternative 2 also would result in
opening public access to the formerly restricted military property. These impacts would be considered
moderate.
5.1.2.2
Surrounding Land Use
Introduction of a new retail land use under Alternative 2 would be consistent with nearby commercial
uses (see Figure 5.1-2). Redevelopment of the property under Alternative 2 is not expected to directly
impact adjacent residential land uses to the west, northwest, and south of the property, although
residential land uses may be indirectly impacted by increased traffic associated with the change to retail
land use at the property.
As discussed in Section 5.1.1, redevelopment of the property in conjunction with redevelopment of
adjacent municipality-owned properties as described in the West Main/Coddington Development Center
Master Plan could result in growth-induced changes in land use on other commercial properties. As
noted under Alternative 1, the retail development proposed under Alternative 2 could influence the
timing, type, and scale of redevelopment of surrounding properties. Because twice as much retail space is
proposed under Alternative 2, implementation of this alternative could have a dampening effect on
surrounding redevelopment while this retail space is on the market. Similar to Alternative 1,
implementation of Alternative 2 could generate a need for transportation improvements. The town has
identified potential transportation projects in the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master
Plan (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates 2011). Because of the potential for Alternative
2 to contribute to and influence the proposed redevelopment in this area, this alternative would have a
moderate indirect impact on surrounding land use. However, measures are available to the Town of
Middletown to control these impacts during the redevelopment process.
5.1.2.3
Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
Redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 would be consistent with the
Town of Middletown’s zoning code for the same reasons described in Section 5.1.1. The Town of
Middletown could implement the proposed Coddington Center Overlay District, described in Section
4.1.3, to further facilitate development of the property under Alternative 2, if this alternative is selected.
Redevelopment of the property under Alternative 2 would be consistent with the Town of Middletown, RI,
Comprehensive Community Plan and 2014 comprehensive plan update for the same reasons described
under Alternative 1. Redevelopment under this alternative also would be consistent with the preferred
redevelopment scenario outlined in the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan. The
preferred redevelopment scenario includes 80,000 square feet of retail development (Vanasse Hangen

Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates, Inc. 2011). At full build-out, Alternative 2 would provide 76 percent
of the proposed retail space. The master plan estimates that the unmet demand for retail space in the
Town of Middletown is approximately 70,000 square feet (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG
Associates, Inc. 2011). Based on this, Alternative 2 would concentrate the majority of the proposed retail
space in the West Main/Coddington Development Center on one property at the edge of the development
center and could limit the potential for retail to be developed in other parts of this mixed-use area.
Therefore, while Alternative 2 would be consistent with the master plan, this alternative could impact the
town’s ability to implement the preferred redevelopment scenario.
Redevelopment of the site under Alternative 2 generally would be consistent with the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan for the same reasons described under Alternative 1. However, as noted,
implementation of Alternative 2 may affect the Town of Middletown’s ability to implement the preferred
redevelopment scenario of the West Main/Coddington Development Center Master Plan.
In summary, the proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property would be consistent with
local planning, and no inconsistencies would result.
5.1.2.4
Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 2 is not
reasonably likely to affect the use or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the
surplus property under Alternative 2 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the RI CRMP. However, redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property
under Alternative 2 would not be a direct federal action and would, therefore, fall under the CRMC’s
direct state permitting authority under the Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal projects.
If Alternative 2 is selected, the Navy would be required to prepare a coastal zone consistency
determination for the proposed disposal and reuse of the property under Alternative 2 and submit it to the
Rhode Island CRMC for concurrence. Because the former Navy Lodge property is not located in any
tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, state review of coastal
resources under the CRMP is not applicable at this site. Redevelopment would be required to comply
with the applicable policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as outlined in Section 4.1. 4.
Due to the similarities in land use types proposed, and the same geographic area of the proposed action
under Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 1, impacts of the proposed action on the use and natural
resources of the coastal zone under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1.

5.1.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, the surplus property at the former Navy Lodge property would be
retained by the U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur, and the 3acre site would remain vacant and undeveloped. Implementation of the No Action alternative would have
no direct or indirect impacts on surrounding land uses. Town zoning regulations would not be
enforceable since the properties would continue to be owned by the federal government and would be
outside the jurisdiction of the Town of Middletown. Because land use on the site would not change, the
No Action alternative would be consistent with the town’s zoning code. However, this alternative would
not be consistent with the town’s comprehensive plan, West Main/Coddington Development Center
Master Plan, or the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. These plans recommend development or
redevelopment of the site and surrounding properties with a mixture of retail and business uses that would
be economically beneficial to the town.

Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice

This section provides a discussion of the impacts on socioeconomic conditions in the communities
surrounding all four surplus properties: the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval Hospital
property, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. As indicated in Section 4.2,
for the purposes of projecting economic impacts, the impact area is defined as the three communities in
which these properties are located—the City of Newport, the Town of Middletown, and the Town of
Portsmouth. Therefore, this section describes the potential socioeconomic impacts resulting from
disposal and reuse of all the surplus properties under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action
alternative.

5.2.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.2.1.1
Economy, Employment, and Income
Implementation of Alternative 1 would have a positive short-term and a positive long-term impact on the
local and regional economies. The positive economic impacts that would occur in the short-term would
be as a result of one-time construction expenditures needed to complete the proposed redevelopment plan.
The long-term positive economic impacts would be associated with the increased economic activity that
would be generated once the proposed redevelopment plan is completely implemented (i.e., at full buildout).
Total construction expenditures are estimated to be $72.9 million for the full build-out under Alternative 1
(see Table 5.2-1). This estimate includes the costs for demolition, site preparation, utilities, and new
construction. All figures in the following tables and analysis are expressed in constant 2013 dollars.

Construction cost estimates were developed by adapting information from the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at
NAVSTA Newport (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Additional information was needed to estimate the cost of construction
for the solar array at Tank Farms 1 and 2. This information was obtained using the JEDI model developed by the U.S
Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

Cost estimates for the former Navy Lodge property differ from those shown in the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus
Properties at NAVSTA Newport. The redevelopment plan’s cost estimate includes residential and office construction that
would occur on adjacent property. The cost estimate presented here includes costs for new development on the former Navy
Lodge property only.
3
Cost estimates for the Tank Farms 1 and 2 differ from those shown in the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at
NAVSTA Newport. The redevelopment plan’s cost estimate does not include the costs for construction of the proposed solar
array. The cost estimate presented here includes costs for construction of a 1 megawatt (MW) fixed-mount, crystalline
silicon solar array.

Cost estimates for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are from the Shoreline Park Master Plan. Costs were originally
expressed as $6,075,000 in 2014 dollars. For consistency with other estimates on this table, the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
was used to deflate these cost estimates to 2013 dollars.

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

As shown in Table 5.2-1, development of the surplus properties are expected to cost a total of $72.9
million. Under Alternative 1, redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would cost approximately $33.7
million, and redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would cost $24.8 million. The
proposed redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property would cost $8.5 million and the
redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would cost approximately $6 million.
Assuming that construction is completed by firms located in the regional economy, these expenditures
would increase output, earnings, and employment in Newport County and in the state of Rhode Island as
a whole. The positive direct economic impacts would be generated when local workers and firms are
hired to complete the proposed redevelopment plan. Indirect economic impacts would occur when local
suppliers provide materials for the construction and increase their sales and revenues. The induced
economic impacts would occur when the construction workers spend a portion of their income in the
regional economy, thereby increasing the output, earnings, and employment at local businesses. Table
5.2-2 provides an estimate of the total (direct, indirect, and induced) impacts of the increased construction
expenditures on output, employee earnings, and employment in the regional economy. These estimates
were developed using the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ modeling system RIMS II (U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis 2013).

For the purposes of analysis, total construction expenditures have been analyzed as a lump sum that
would be spent all at one time. However, in actuality, construction is likely to be spread over a 20-year
time frame. Therefore, the results shown on Table 5.2-2 should be viewed as the total economic impact
that would occur as a result of construction, not the annual impacts. If construction expenditures were
evenly divided through a 20-year period, the annual economic impacts of the construction expenditures
under Alternative 1 would be an increase of $5.1 million in regional output, an additional 31 jobs, and an
increase of $1.3 million in employee earnings annually.
Since the construction costs are one-time expenditures, the positive economic impacts of construction are
temporary and would last only while construction is occurring. Once these funds leave the region through
such outlays as savings, taxes, or purchases of goods and services from outside the region, these positive
economic effects would no longer occur.
In contrast, the positive economic impacts that would occur as a result of the ongoing operations would
have a long-term impact on Newport County and on the City of Newport and the towns of Middletown
and Portsmouth. Assuming that the full-build out potential is met and that the surplus property would be
used by business enterprises new to the region, the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 1

Draft EIS

5-11

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

would directly generate nearly 830 new jobs (see Table 5.2-3). The estimated number of new direct jobs
was calculated using standard demographic multipliers collected by the Institute for Public
Administration at the University of Delaware (Mix and Jiang 2009), which show the relationship between
the average number of employees per area of work space for different nonresidential uses. These
demographic multipliers were then applied to the estimated square footage of the type of development
expected to occur under Alternative 1 to project the total direct employment at full build-out (see Table
5.2-3).
In addition to the direct jobs expected to be generated by the proposed redevelopment plan under
Alternative 1, indirect and induced employment impacts are expected to occur as the increased
employment and business activity stimulates the regional economy. As shown on Table 5.2-3, an
additional 252 indirect and induced jobs are expected to be generated by implementation of Alternative 1.
In total 1,079 direct, indirect, and induced jobs are expected to be created under this alternative. The
indirect and induced job estimates were developed using the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’
modeling system RIMS II and the total number of direct jobs estimated to be generated by this project
(U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2013).

5.2.1.2
Population
Implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 1 is anticipated to have a minor
impact on the population and demographic characteristics of the City of Newport and the towns of
Middletown and Portsmouth.
Proposed new residential construction at the former Naval Hospital property may result in an influx of
new residents into the City of Newport by increasing the number of available housing units. However,
the proposed construction of 36 residential two-bedroom units at the former Naval Hospital property
would be estimated to increase the population in the city by 74 residents. This figure was derived by
assuming that each new housing unit would represent one additional household moving into the City of
Newport and by using the city’s 2010 average household size of 2.05 persons (U.S. Census Bureau
2010a). An increase of 74 residents would equate to less than 0.3 percent of the city’s 2010 total
population. There are no residential land uses proposed in the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth
under Alternative 1.
The increased employment opportunities under Alternative 1 as described in Section 5.2.1.1 would have
the potential to slightly increase regional population. However, given the relatively high unemployment
rates in the region, most of these additional jobs are expected to be filled by existing residents and would
not generate much in-migration. Additionally, population levels have been declining in the area since

Draft EIS

5-12

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

1990, so even if each new job were filled by someone relocating to the area with their entire household,
the population of Newport County would still not reach its 2000 population level.
5.2.1.3
Housing and Commercial Property
The proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 1 includes constructing 36 residential two-bedroom
units at the former Naval Hospital property in the City of Newport. These new units would represent an
increase of 0.3 percent of the city’s total housing stock in 2010. This increase in the City of Newport’s
housing stock is not expected to substantially affect housing prices or housing availability in the city or in
Newport County as a whole. Nor, as described further in Section 7.2, is the proposed housing expected to
affect the City of Newport’s affordable housing goals. No residential land uses are proposed in the towns
of Middletown and Portsmouth under Alternative 1.
As described in Section 5.2.1.2, very little in-migration is anticipated to occur as a result of completion of
the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 1. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 1 is
expected to generate few impacts on the local or regional housing market.
Implementation of Alternative 1 may have a minor impact on the commercial property market in the three
communities. The approximately 30,500 square feet of retail space proposed at the former Navy Lodge
property would increase total retail space in the Town of Middletown by 2.3 percent. The approximately
28,300 square feet of retail space in the proposed hotel at the former Naval Hospital property would
increase total retail space in the City of Newport by 1.3 percent. Likewise, total office space in the Town
of Portsmouth would increase by 110,000 square feet, or 18.5 percent, and industrial space in the town
would increase by 190,000 square feet, or 16.6 percent, under Alternative 1.
The additional retail property in the Town of Middletown and the City of Newport is not expected to
substantially affect prices or availability of retail space in the local jurisdictions or in Newport County as
a whole. However, the addition of 110,000 square feet of office space and 190,000 square feet of
industrial space in the Town of Portsmouth could have implications for existing office and industrial
properties. This additional supply, combined with current weak demand, may result in downward
pressure on prices at existing office buildings and industrial space. These impacts would not be
considered significant and could be considered positive or adverse, depending on the individual
stakeholder.
5.2.1.4
Taxes and Revenues
Implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 1 would have a positive or
beneficial impact on the value of taxable real estate in the City of Newport and the towns of Middletown
and Portsmouth. Table 5.2-4 shows the estimated increase in the taxable real estate in each of the
municipalities at full build-out. The market values of the properties upon full build-out were based on
calculations made in the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport (RKG
Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). FY 2014 property tax rates have been applied to these estimates to project
the annual amount of property tax receipts that would be generated by the proposed redevelopment at full
build-out. These estimates are based on an ad valorem tax. 11 Each year as a result of implementing
Alternative 1, the Town of Middletown would receive an estimated $334,000 in additional property tax
revenue, the City of Newport would receive an estimated $412,000 in additional property tax revenue,
and the Town of Portsmouth would receive an estimated $421,000 in additional tax revenue (see Table
5.2-4). Open space and park land properties were assumed to be tax exempt for estimating purposes.

5.2.1.5
Environmental Justice and Protection of Children
This analysis focuses on the potential for disposal and reuse of the surplus properties under Alternative 1
to result in disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations or
children (people aged less than 21 years). Minority populations are considered to be present when either
the minority population is more than 50 percent of the census tract or the minority population percentage
is meaningfully greater than the minority population percentage of a larger geographic area of comparison
(Council on Environmental Quality 1997a). The same thresholds are used to determine low-income
populations and populations younger than 21 years old.
Tables 5.2-5 and 5.2-6 provide the demographic and economic information for all census block groups
and census tracts in which the proposed disposal and redevelopment of surplus properties would occur
under Alternative 1. These demographic and economic data were compared with similar demographic
and economic data for Newport County as the area of comparison. (Note: Income data through the U.S.
Census Bureau’s American Community Survey can be found only at the census block group level. Thus,
while race and age data are presented at the census block group level, low-income population data are
presented at the census tract level; see Table 5.2-6).
Based on these thresholds, the Navy has determined that the census block group that encompasses the
former Navy Lodge property, 402001, includes an Hispanic/Latino population and a higher percentage of
people aged less than 21 years than the geographic area of comparison. In addition, census tract 40200,
which also encompasses the former Navy Lodge property, has a larger low-income population than the
geographic area of comparison. The census block group that encompasses the former Naval Hospital
property, 412001, includes a Hispanic/Latino population and a minority population that is greater than the
area of comparison. In addition, census tract 41200 has a low-income population that is greater than the
area of comparison. The census block group that encompasses Tank Farms 1 and 2 (401034) includes a
Hispanic/Latino population, a minority population, and a higher percentage of people aged less than 21

years than the geographic area of comparison. The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property crosses two
census block groups and two census tracts. One of the census block groups, 403031, has a
Hispanic/Latino population that is greater than the area of comparison and has a higher percentage of
people aged less than 21 years than the geographic area of comparison. Both census block groups include
a significant minority population and a low-income population that is larger than the area of comparison.

As shown on Tables 5.2-5 and 5.2-6, in most cases the percentage of minority and Hispanic races, the
number of children, and the percent of the population living below the poverty level are higher in the
affected census block groups and census tracts than in Newport County as a whole, leading to a
possibility that there may be disproportionate adverse impacts on these communities.
However, the Navy has determined that implementation of Alternative 1 would not have
disproportionately high or adverse health and safety or environmental impacts on minority,
Hispanic/Latino, or low-income populations, or populations aged less than 21 years because no
significant unmitigated environmental, human health or safety impacts are expected to occur in the
surrounding communities as a result of Alternative 1. The properties would be fenced during

construction, and access would be permitted only to construction personnel. Removal and disposal of
hazardous materials, including LBP and ACM, would comply with all applicable federal laws and
regulations. Additionally, no unique environmental health or safety issues would impact children in the
affected communities.
5.2.1.6
Summary
In summary, implementation of Alternative 1 is expected to have a beneficial economic impact on the
regional economy, a minor impact on local population and demographic characteristics, a minor impact
on the local housing and retail space market, and a minor positive fiscal impact on the City of Newport
and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. In addition, no disproportionate impacts on minority,
Hispanic/Latino, low-income, or children are expected to occur under this alternative.

5.2.2

Alternative 2

5.2.2.1
Economy, Employment, and Income
Implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 2 would have a positive short-term
and long-term economic impact on the local and regional economies. Total construction costs would be
slightly greater under Alternative 2 than those described in Alternative 1. These figures are adapted from
the estimates made in the Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport (RKG
Associates, Inc. et al. 2011) using cost estimates for the proposed solar array from the NREL’s JEDI
model and by apportioning construction costs for other proposed uses to determine average costs per
square foot and then applying these averages to the different proposed land uses (see Table 5.2-7).

As a result of increased construction costs, the beneficial short-term economic impacts of Alternative 2
would also be slightly greater than those described for Alternative 1. Table 5.2-7 shows the total
estimated construction costs and the total direct, indirect, and induced impacts associated with
construction activities under Alternative 2. The methodology for determining these impacts is the same
as described for Alternative 1.
The long-term economic impacts associated with Alternative 2 are also expected to be slightly greater
than those described in Alternative 1. As shown on Table 5.2-8, an estimated 1,072 direct and 316
indirect jobs would be created by implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan under
Alternative 2. The methodology for determining these impacts is the same as described for Alternative 1.

5.2.2.2
Population
Implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 2 is not anticipated to have a
significant impact on the population of the City of Newport or the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth.
No new residential construction would occur under Alternative 2.
Similar to Alternative 1, the increased employment opportunities under Alternative 2 would have the
potential to slightly increase regional population. However, given the relatively high unemployment rates
in the region, most of these additional jobs are expected to be filled by existing residents and would not
generate much in-migration. Additionally, population levels have been declining in the area since 1990,
so even if each new job were filled by someone relocating to the area with their entire household, the
population of Newport County would still not reach its 2000 population level.
5.2.2.3
Housing and Commercial Property
Minimal, if any, in-migration is anticipated to occur as a result of completion of the proposed
redevelopment plan under Alternative 2. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 is expected to
generate few impacts on the local or regional housing market.
Implementation of Alternative 2 may have a minor impact on the commercial property market in the three
communities. The approximately 61,000 square feet of retail space proposed for the former Navy Lodge
property would increase total retail space in the town of Middletown by 4.7 percent, and the
approximately 28,300 square feet of retail in the proposed hotel at the former Naval Hospital property
would increase total retail space in the City of Newport by 1.3 percent. Likewise, total office space in the
City of Newport would increase by 26,000 square feet, or 3.6 percent, and total office space in the Town
of Portsmouth would increase by 137,600 square feet, or 23.2 percent. Industrial space in the Town of
Portsmouth would also increase by 205,000 square feet, or 17.9 percent, under Alternative 2.
The additional retail property in the Town of Middletown and the City of Newport is not expected to
substantially affect prices or availability of retail space in the local jurisdictions or in Newport County as
a whole. However, the addition of 137,600 square feet of office space and 205,000 square feet of
industrial space in the Town of Portsmouth could have implications for existing office and industrial
space. This additional supply proposed under Alternative 2, combined with current weak demand, may
result in downward pressure on prices at existing office buildings and industrial space in the area.
However, as indicated above under Alternative 1, these impacts would not be considered significant and
could be considered positive or adverse, dependent upon the stakeholder.

5.2.2.4
Taxes and Revenues
Implementation of the proposed redevelopment plan under Alternative 2 would also have a positive
impact on the value of taxable real estate in the City of Newport and in the towns of Middletown and
Portsmouth. The estimated annual property tax receipts generated by the proposed redevelopment plan
under Alternative 2 at full build-out are shown on Table 5.2-9.

5.2.2.5
Environmental Justice and Protection of Children
Census block groups and census tracts in which the proposed disposal and redevelopment of surplus
properties would occur under Alternative 2 are the same as those identified for Alternative 1. Therefore,
the minority and low-income populations and populations aged less than 21 years that were evaluated for
disproportionately high or adverse health and safety or environmental impacts under Alternative 1 are the
same populations that are evaluated under Alternative 2.
Because no significant unmitigated environmental, human health, or safety impacts are expected to occur
in the surrounding communities as a result of Alternative 2, the Navy has determined that implementation
of Alternative 2 would not have disproportionately high or adverse health and safety or environmental
impacts on minority, Hispanic/Latino, or low-income populations, or populations aged less than 21 years.
The properties would be fenced during construction, and access would be permitted only to construction
personnel. Removal and disposal of hazardous materials, including LBP and ACM, would comply with
all applicable federal laws and regulations. Additionally, no unique environmental health or safety issues
would impact children in the affected communities.
5.2.2.6
Summary
In summary, implementation of Alternative 2 is anticipated to have a beneficial economic impact on the
regional economy, no noticeable impact on local population and demographic characteristics, no
noticeable impact on the local housing market, a minor impact on the retail space market, and a minor

positive fiscal impact on the City of Newport and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. In addition
no disproportionate impacts on minority, Hispanic/Latino, low-income, or children are anticipated to
occur under this alternative.

5.2.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, no redevelopment plan would be implemented and ownership of the
properties would be retained by the Navy. The properties would not be developed and would remain in
caretaker status. No new economic activity would be generated, and no increased employment
opportunities would occur. Regional population and the regional housing market would not be impacted,
nor would there be any impact on the regional commercial property market. Local government tax
receipts would not increase because the properties would retain their current tax-exempt status. The
property would remain fenced, and the Navy would maintain the buildings and fence line to prevent
unauthorized access. The No Action alternative would not have disproportionate or adverse human health
and safety impacts or environmental impacts on minority, Hispanic/Latino, or low-income populations or
populations younger than 21 years.

5.3

Community Facilities and Services

This section provides a discussion of the impacts on community facilities and services in the communities
surrounding all four surplus properties—the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval Hospital
property, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property—from implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative.

5.3.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

Implementation of Alternative 1 would have a minor impact on community facilities and services in the
City of Newport and in the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. As noted in Section 5.2.1.2, only
minor population impacts are expected to occur as a result of Alternative 1. The proposed construction of
36 residential two-bedroom units at the former Naval Hospital property in the City of Newport is
expected to increase population in the city by 74 residents; no population increase is anticipated for the
towns of Middletown and Portsmouth because redevelopment does not include residential uses in those
towns. The employment opportunities that would be created as a result of Alternative 1 would be
anticipated to be largely filled by individuals currently living in the area. Therefore, any increase in
demand for educational facilities, public safety and emergency services, parks and recreational facilities,
and medical facilities is expected to be met by existing facilities and services.
Implementation of Alternative 1 also would create additional recreational facilities in the local
communities, including a waterfront park with a public pier on the former Naval Hospital property, and a
shoreline park with a fishing pier, picnic areas, a playground, and a multi-use pathway located along the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Finally, since the properties are being converted from tax-exempt federal property to, in most cases,
taxable private property, the revenues generated through ad valorem real property tax on these properties
would more than offset any additional expenses incurred by providers of community services (e.g., police,
fire companies, emergency services) for the ultimate redevelopment of these properties, as proposed.

5.3.2

Alternative 2

Implementation of Alternative 2 would have a minor impact on community facilities and services in the
City of Newport and in the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. As described in Section 5.2.2.2, only
minor population impacts are expected to occur as a result of implementing Alternative 2. No new
residential construction would occur under Alternative 2, and the employment opportunities that would be
created would be expected to be largely filled by individuals currently living in the area. Therefore, any
Draft EIS

5-19

Former Navy Lodge Property

increased demand for educational facilities, public safety and emergency services, parks and recreational
facilities, and medical facilities is expected to be met by existing facilities.
Additionally, similar to Alternative 1, implementation of Alternative 2 would create additional
recreational facilities in the local communities, including a waterfront park and a yacht club and boating
area at the former Naval Hospital property, and a shoreline park (larger than the park designed for
Alternative 1) that would be located along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Finally, since the properties are being converted from tax-exempt federal property to, in most cases,
taxable private property the revenues generated through ad valorem real property tax on these properties
would more than offset any additional expenses incurred by local service providers associated with the
proposed redevelopment of these properties.

5.3.3

No Action Alternative

There would be no impact on community facilities and services resulting from the No Action alternative
because the properties would be held in caretaker status by the Navy. No reuse or redevelopment would
occur. There would be no change in population or employment resulting from this alternative. In
addition, no new recreational facilities would be built if the No Action alternative were to be
implemented.

5.4

Transportation

This section summarizes the potential transportation impacts resulting from construction and
implementation of the Redevelopment Plan at the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1,
Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. The evaluation of transportation impacts upon full build-out
is based on the analysis completed for the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess
Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). Roadways and intersections in the
vicinity of the former Navy Lodge property that were evaluated include the following:
•

West Main Road (Route 114)

•

Coddington Highway

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Coddington Highway/Rockwood Road Intersection

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Valley Road (Route 214) Intersection.

Traffic generated from proposed construction was not captured in the traffic impact analysis. An
evaluation of the impacts on existing traffic conditions from proposed construction traffic is based on the
projected volume of construction vehicles and duration of construction at the former Navy Lodge
property.

5.4.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The proposed driveway for the former Navy Lodge property is located on Coddington Highway,
approximately 250 feet west of West Main Road (see Figure 5.4-1). Additionally, as discussed in Section
1.3, the Navy also holds an easement on property owned by the Landings Real Estate Group. The
easement provides access from the former Navy Lodge property to Lake Erie Street, located on the
western edge of the former Navy Lodge property, and that connects to Coddington Highway. This dogleg property connecting to Lake Erie Street will pass to the new owners and, therefore, may provide an
additional driveway for site access. However, for purposes of this analysis, driveway access to the former
Navy Lodge property upon full build-out is assumed to be located directly on Coddington Highway.

Former Navy Lodge Property

The driveway may be a full-access driveway or allow only right turns in and out; both options have been
analyzed for the EIS. Roadways that would directly feed into the driveway access to the site would be
Coddington Highway and West Main Road, both of which have high traffic volumes.
Construction-related traffic would consist of delivery trucks, dump trucks, heavy equipment, and vehicles
driven by construction crews. Based on the square footage of the proposed retail space for redevelopment
of the former Navy Lodge property, an estimated 20 vehicle trips would occur per day for worker
commutes and an estimated two trips would occur per day for delivery of materials and supplies (see
Appendix D for the methodology). Local traffic would be impacted in the short-term, particularly along
West Main Road and Coddington Highway, from additional truck trips and slower-moving vehicles.
However, the impacts would not be significant as they would occur only for the duration of the new
construction period. The period of new construction is estimated to be approximately one year. Impacts
are therefore expected to be minor.
The evaluation of impacts during the full build-out of the former Navy Lodge property includes a
discussion of projected traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS), and
recommended mitigation measures.
5.4.1.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of retail space at the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1 is projected to add
1,309 daily trips to the surrounding road network (Pare Corporation 2013). This would result in a total of
30 vehicles entering and exiting the property during the peak morning hour, and 114 vehicles entering and
exiting during the evening peak hour. Table 5.4-1 shows the morning and evening peak hour trips for the
proposed retail space.

Over the full build-out period, traffic volume in the area is projected to increase. The total morning peak
hour volume at the intersection of West Main Road and Coddington Highway is expected to increase by
476 trips under Alternative 1 compared with the existing conditions. The full build-out period takes into
account a 1 percent annual background growth that is expected to occur through the year 2032.
Background growth is the growth expected within the study area based on development projects not
specifically identified and annual population and traffic increases. The evening peak hour volume is
expected to increase by 662 trips over existing conditions. The volume at the West Main Road and
Valley Road intersection would increase by 570 trips during the morning peak hour and 714 trips during
the evening peak hour. Table 5.4-2 compares existing peak hour traffic volumes at these two
intersections with the projected peak hour traffic volumes under Alternative 1.
Utilizing the proposed driveway, a total of 1,375 trips into and out of the redeveloped former Navy Lodge
property would result during morning peak hours and 1,995 trips would result during evening peak hours
when the background traffic growth is included in the analysis.

The intersections of West Main Road and Coddington Highway and West Main Road and Valley Road
are both signalized. As indicated in Section 4.4, accident data from the Town of Middletown indicates
that the majority of accidents reported were rear-end collisions, which are typical at signalized
intersections and generally low in severity (Pare Corporation 2013). The greatest number of accidents
between January 2010 and October 2012 were reported at the intersection of West Main Road and East
Main Road. Additionally, accidents were also reported on Coddington Highway; however, recent
improvements along that roadway (i.e., striping and the addition of turning lanes) are likely to reduce the
number of future accidents. Therefore, any increase in traffic is not expected to pose a significant safety
concern at these two signalized intersections (Pare Corporation 2013).
5.4.1.2
Projected Level of Service
LOS under Alternative 1 was determined for the intersections of West Main Road and Coddington
Highway and West Main Road and Valley Road as well as the proposed driveway to the property. The
intersection of West Main Road and Coddington Highway currently operates at LOS B during morning
peak hours, with a delay of approximately 18 seconds per vehicle, and LOS C during evening peak hours,
with a delay of 21 seconds per vehicle. Under Alternative 1, the intersection is expected to operate at
LOS C during morning peak hours, with a delay of 22 seconds per vehicle, and LOS D during evening
peak hours, with a delay of 39 seconds per vehicle under full access.
The signalized intersection of West Main Road and Valley Road currently operates at LOS B during both
the morning and evening peak hours, with a delay of approximately 16 to 18 seconds per vehicle.
Assuming the access driveway is a right-turn-only lane under Alternative 1, the intersection would
operate at LOS C during the morning and evening hours, with a delay of approximately 27 seconds per
vehicle. Table 5.4-2 shows the LOS for existing conditions and under Alternative 1.
Exiting the site from the right-turn-only driveway (southbound) onto Coddington Highway is expected to
operate at LOS B or better during the morning peak hour, with a delay of 13.9 seconds per vehicle.
During the evening peak hour, exiting the site from the right-turn-only driveway is expected to operate at
LOS C, with a delay of 22.3 seconds per vehicle under Alternative 1. The primary reason for the drop in
LOS compared with the morning peak hour is the higher through-volume on Coddington Highway during
the evening peak hour combined with the volume of vehicles travelling to and from the site. Exiting from

a full-access driveway onto Coddington Highway is expected to operate at LOS C during the morning
peak hour, with a delay of 19.3 seconds per vehicle, and an LOS of E during the evening peak hour, with
a delay of 45.8 seconds per vehicle. As discussed above, the reason for the drop in LOS is the higher
through-volume on Coddington Highway combined with the volume of vehicles to and from the site.
5.4.1.3
Summary
The projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network surrounding the former Navy
Lodge property and the resulting changes to the LOS at the intersections would result in a significant and
unavoidable impact under Alternative 1.
Public transportation routes are located near the former Navy Lodge property; use of these bus routes to
access the proposed retail space would reduce the number of vehicle trips projected under Alternative 1.
Sight distances for the potential driveway location were reviewed and generally found to meet the
AASHTO requirements for the 85th percentile travel speeds along Coddington Highway. The developer
should reconfirm these distances once the final location of the driveway is determined. The developer
should also design the driveway to maximize visibility for motorists turning into and out of the property
while providing accurate signs enabling motorists to identify the site.
Other potential mitigation measures, to be implemented by the developer, would depend on the final
design of the site driveway and parking lot network. Improvements along the roadway could include
revised signs or striping or possibly geometric improvements to the configuration.
Implementation of potential mitigation measures would be the responsibility of the future developer of the
property and/or the Town of Middletown. The implementation of these mitigation measures would not
reduce the impacts discussed above to “not significant” because of the increase in the number of traffic
trips on the roadway network surrounding the former Navy Lodge property and the resulting changes to
the LOS at the intersections.

5.4.2

Alternative 2

Access to the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 would be the same as described for
Alternative 1 and shown on Figure 5.4-1. In addition, the proposed level of traffic associated with
construction of the proposed retail space under Alternative 2 would be similar to that discussed under
Alternative 1 and would result in minor impacts on local traffic only during the construction period.
The evaluation of impacts during the full-build out of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative
2 includes a discussion of projected traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS),
and recommended mitigation measures.
5.4.2.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of retail space under Alternative 2 is projected to add 2,619 daily trips to the surrounding
road network. This would result in a total of 61 vehicles entering and exiting the property during the peak
morning hour and 227 vehicles entering and exiting during the evening peak hour. Table 5.4-3 shows the
projected morning and evening peak hour trips for the proposed retail space.
Over the full build-out period, traffic volume in the area is projected to increase. The total morning peak
hour volume at the intersection of West Main Road and Coddington Highway is expected to increase by
491 trips under Alternative 2, compared with existing conditions. The full build-out period takes into
account a 1 percent annual background growth that is expected to occur through the year 2032.
Background growth is the growth expected within the study area based on development projects not

specifically identified and annual population and traffic increases. The evening peak hour volume is
expected to increase by 724 trips. The West Main Road and Valley Road intersection would see an
increase of 582 trips during the morning peak hour and 760 trips during the evening peak hour. Table
5.4-4 compares existing peak hour traffic volumes at these two intersections with the projected peak hour
traffic volumes under Alternative 2.

Projected Level of Service
LOS under Alternative 2 was determined for the intersections of West Main Road and Coddington
Highway and West Main Road and Valley Road and for the proposed driveway to the property.
The intersection of West Main Road and Coddington Highway currently operates at LOS B during the
morning peak hour, with a delay of approximately 18 seconds per vehicle, and LOS C during the evening
peak hour, with a delay of 21 seconds per vehicle. Under Alternative 2, the intersection of West Main
Road and Coddington Highway is expected to operate at LOS C during the morning peak hour, with a
delay of 22.3 seconds delay per vehicle, and LOS D during evening peak hour, with a delay of 43.3
seconds per vehicle. Table 5.4-4 shows the LOS for existing conditions and under Alternative 2.
The signalized intersection of West Main Road and Valley Road currently operates at LOS B, with
approximately 16 to 18 seconds of delay per vehicle during the morning and evening peak hours,
respectively. Under Alternative 2, the intersection of West Main Road and Valley Road would operate at
LOS C during the morning peak hour, with 22.2 seconds of delay per vehicle, and LOS C during the
evening peak hour, with 29.5 seconds of delay per vehicle.
A right-turn-only driveway (southbound) would operate at LOS B during the morning peak hour, with
14.4 seconds of delay per vehicle, and LOS D during the evening peak hour, with 31.2 seconds of delay
per vehicle. A full access driveway is expected to operate at LOS C during morning peak hours and LOS
F during evening peak hours. The primary reason for the drop in LOS compared with the morning peak
hour is the higher through volume on Coddington Highway, combined with the turning volumes to and
from the site.

5.4.2.3
Summary
The intersections of West Main Road and Coddington Highway and West Main Road and Valley Road
would see a moderate increase in traffic and a decrease in LOS under Alternative 2 over existing
conditions. The projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network surrounding the
former Navy Lodge property and the resulting changes to the LOS for the intersections would result in a
significant and unavoidable impact under Alternative 2.
The mitigation of impacts due to the implementation of Alternative 2 would be the same as those
discussed for Alternative 1.

5.4.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Currently, there is no driveway or road on the property. Access to the
property would continue to be from Coddington Highway or West Main Road. No reuse or
redevelopment would occur at the property; however, due to background growth, significant impacts on
transportation would occur under this alternative.
The evaluation of impacts under the No Action alternative includes a discussion of projected traffic
volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS), and recommended mitigation measures. The
full build-out period takes into account a 1 percent annual background growth that is expected to occur
through the year 2032. Background growth is the growth expected within the study area based on
development projects not specifically identified and annual population and traffic increases.
5.4.3.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Under the No Action alternative, traffic volumes are projected to increase 1 percent annually through the
year 2032. Traffic volume increases are associated with development projects not specifically identified
and annual population and traffic increases. Table 5.4-5 compares existing peak hour traffic volumes at
the intersections of West Main Road and Coddington Highway and West Main Road and Valley Road
with the projected peak hour traffic volumes under the No Action alternative.
The traffic volume at the intersection of West Main Road and Coddington Highway is expected to
increase by 459 trips during the morning peak hour and by 599 trips during the evening peak hour. The
traffic volume at the intersection of West Main Road and Valley Road is expected to increase by 556 trips
during the morning peak hour and by 667 trips during the evening peak hour.

Projected Level of Service
Under the No Action alternative, the level of service at the intersection of West Main Road and
Coddington Highway is expected to decrease from LOS B to LOS C during the morning peak hour. No
change is expected in LOS for this intersection during the evening peak hour. The LOS at the intersection
of West Main Road and Valley Road would decrease from LOS B to LOS C during both the morning and
evening peak hours.
5.4.3.3
Summary
The projected increase in the number of trips on the roadway network surrounding the former Navy
Lodge property and the resulting changes to the LOS for the intersections would result in a significant and
unavoidable impact under the No Action alternative.
Implementation of any mitigation measures associated with the No Action alternative would be the
responsibility of the Town of Middletown.

5.5

Environmental Management

This section describes the potential impacts on environmental management from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of the potential
impacts on the management of hazardous waste, hazardous materials, and ER Program sites associated
with disposal and reuse of the former Navy Lodge property.
As discussed in Section 3.5.1.4, real property transactions under BRAC require the preparation of a
FOST(s). The FOST summarizes how the applicable requirements and notifications for hazardous
materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials (such as ACM, LBP, PCBs, and pesticides)
have been satisfied and whether the property is environmentally suitable for transfer. The FOST for the
former Navy Lodge property will address any restrictions, notifications, or covenants in deeds related to
hazardous materials at the surplus properties.

5.5.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.5.1.1
Hazardous Waste
Some RCRA hazardous wastes would be generated during construction of the new retail space under
Alternative 1. The operation of heavy equipment and machinery and the performance of construction
tasks would result in wastes such as waste oils and oily wastes, chemicals, acids, paints, solvents, and
degreasers, as well as universal wastes such as batteries and fluorescent light bulbs. Construction
contractors would, by contract, be required to manage hazardous waste in accordance with Town of
Middletown and state and federal requirements. Retailers or their management/service contractors would
routinely produce small quantities of hazardous wastes similar to those generated by construction
activities; such wastes would generally be associated with maintenance of the properties. Retailers or
their management/service contractors would be required to manage hazardous wastes in accordance with
state, federal, and Town of Middletown requirements.
The site of the former Navy Lodge is vacant; therefore, more hazardous waste would be generated by
short-term construction and long-term maintenance activities under Alternative 1 than is currently
generated at the vacant lot. There would, therefore, be minor short-term and long-term impacts on the
generation and management of hazardous waste under Alternative 1. However, these impacts would not
be significant because hazardous wastes would be managed in accordance with state, federal, and Town
of Middletown requirements.

5.5.1.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks and Oil/Water Separators
No active USTs are associated with the former Navy Lodge property. The environmental baseline survey
checklist prepared for the 2004 demolition of the lodge indicated that a UST might have been located on
the property at one time, possibly for fuel oil or diesel for an emergency generator (see Section 4.5.2.2).
The construction contract for property redevelopment should note the possibility of an on-site UST. If a
UST is encountered during redevelopment of the property, it would need to be closed in accordance with
RIDEM’s UST regulations. No ASTs or OWSs are associated with the former Navy Lodge property.
Any new fuel/oil tanks that are installed as part of property redevelopment would have to comply with
applicable RIDEM regulations. No significant impacts would be associated with storage tanks and OWSs
under Alternative 1.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant and covered with grass, and there are no building
sources of ACM or LBP. Underground water and steam lines might be insulated with asbestoscontaining pipe wrap. The construction contract for property redevelopment should note the possibility of
asbestos wrap on underground utility pipes. Any underground asbestos encountered during building
construction would need to be evaluated by a specialized ACM removal contractor. There would be no
significant impacts from ACM, LBP, or lead removal under Alternative 1. No asbestos or LBP impacts
would be associated with construction and future use of the property because asbestos and LBP are no
longer used in new building materials.
PCBs and Pesticides
The one transformer reported to be at the former Navy Lodge property would not contain PCBs because
NAVSTA Newport removed all PCB-containing transformers in the 1980s (see Section 4.5.2.7). If the
transformer is handled or removed during redevelopment activities under Alternative 1, it should be
inspected for a “PCB-free” label. If such a label is not found, the transformer should be evaluated for the
presence of PCBs.
Pesticides are currently used at NAVSTA Newport properties as needed and in accordance with the
Integrated Pest Management Plan (see Section 3.5.1.2). Under Alternative 1, it is expected that any
future use of pesticides by the retailers or their management/service contractors would be done
responsibly and in accordance with all applicable local or state regulations.
Under Alternative 1, no impacts would be associated with PCB and pesticide management.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Radioactive materials would not be expected to be used during construction or operation of retail space at
the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1.
Although there is no record of radon surveys for the former Navy Lodge, base-wide radon surveys
indicate that radon is not generally a concern in the NAVSTA Newport area (see Section 3.5.1.2).
Similarly low levels would be expected to be seen in any newly constructed buildings. RIDOH regulates
radon levels in public buildings, schools, and child care centers (RIDOH 2007b), none of which are
proposed for the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1.
There would be no impacts from radioactive materials and radon under Alternative 1.

5.5.1.3
Medical Waste
No medical waste would be associated with the proposed reuse of the former Navy Lodge property for
retail space under Alternative 1; therefore, there would be no impact.
In summary, although impacts from hazardous materials under Alternative 1 would not be significant, any
such impacts would be reduced through standard construction and operational practices.
5.5.1.4
Environmental Restoration Program
The one ER Program site in the general vicinity of the former Navy Lodge property—IRP Study Area 4,
Coddington Cove Rubble Fill Area—is about 0.5 miles west of the former Navy Lodge property and is
separated from the property by developed areas (see Section 3, Figure 3.5-1). Contaminants in site media
have little potential of migrating off-site to other areas and pose minimal risk to human health and the
environment (see Section 4.5.3). As a result, no further action has been recommended for the Coddington
Cove Rubble Fill Area site. Therefore, there would be no impact associated with ER Program sites under
Alternative 1. Redevelopment would be compatible with the Navy’s program and commitment to clean
up hazardous waste sites.

5.5.2

Alternative 2

5.5.2.1
Hazardous Waste
Hazardous wastes would be routinely generated by the implementation of Alternative 2, and they would
be the same as those described under Alternative 1. There would, therefore, be minor short-term and
long-term impacts on the management of hazardous waste under Alternative 2. These impacts would not
be significant.
5.5.2.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks and Oil/Water Separators
No significant impacts associated with storage tanks and OWSs would occur under Alternative 2, as
described for Alternative 1.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
No significant impacts from ACM, LBP, or lead removal would occur under Alternative 2, as described
for Alternative 1. No ACM or LBP impacts associated with construction and reuse of the property would
occur because asbestos and LBP are no longer used in new building materials.
PCBs and Pesticides
No impacts associated with PCBs or pesticide management would occur under Alternative 2, as described
for Alternative 1.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
No impacts from radioactive materials or radon would occur under Alternative 2, as described for
Alternative 1.

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, the former Navy Lodge property would be maintained in a caretaker
status with no redevelopment.

Hazardous Waste
No hazardous wastes are currently generated at the former Navy Lodge property, which is vacant land.
There would be no impact on hazardous waste management under the No Action alternative.
5.5.3.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks and Oil/Water Separators
There are no known USTs at the former Navy Lodge property, although the environmental baseline
survey checklist prepared for the 2004 demolition of the lodge indicated that a UST might have been
located on the property at one time (see Section 4.5.2.2). If there is such a UST, it is inactive and not
subject to monthly inspection. There are no ASTs or OWSs on the property. There would be no
significant impacts associated with storage tanks and OWSs under the No Action alternative.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant and covered with grass, and there are no building
sources of ACM or LBP. If underground water and steam lines are insulated with asbestos-containing
pipe wrap, they would not be an immediate hazard while underground. No significant impacts associated
with ACM, LBP, or lead would occur under the No Action alternative.
PCBs and Pesticides
The one transformer reported to be at the former Navy Lodge property would not contain PCBs because
NAVSTA Newport removed all PCB-containing transformers in the 1980s (see Section 4.5.2.7). Under
the No Action alternative, pesticides would continue to be used at the property as needed and in
accordance with the installation Integrated Pest Management Plan. Therefore, no impacts associated
with PCBs or pesticide management would occur under the No Action alternative.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
No radioactive materials are associated with the former Navy Lodge property. Radon is not a concern for
open spaces. No impacts from radioactive materials or radon would occur under the No Action
alternative.
5.5.3.3
Medical Waste
Medical waste is not generated at the former Navy Lodge property, which is vacant land. No impacts
associated with medical waste management would occur under the No Action alternative.
5.5.3.4
Environmental Restoration Program
No ER Program sites are close to the former Navy Lodge property. Therefore, no impact associated with
ER Program sites would occur under the No Action alternative, the same as described for Alternatives 1
and 2.

Air Quality

This section provides a summary of the projected emissions associated with the disposal and reuse of the
former Navy Lodge property, including emissions from operation of the proposed retail space and
associated vehicle trips on local roadways after full build-out. For purposes of analysis, construction
emissions under both Alternatives 1 and 2 for the former Navy Lodge property are assumed to be the
same, primarily because the footprints for the proposed redevelopment under both alternatives are similar.
Construction emissions have been estimated based on Alternative 2, which has a slightly larger footprint
than Alternative 1.
An analysis of the impact of the proposed action on regional air quality is provided in Chapter 12, which
includes an evaluation of criteria pollutants, GHG and HAPs from continuing actions at all surplus
properties upon final build-out. (See Chapter 12, Summary of Impacts for all Surplus Property, for a
discussion of the total impacts from this action in the Providence, Rhode Island, air quality region.)
Construction and operation emissions have also been evaluated for each individual surplus property (see
Sections 7.6, 9.6, and 11.6).
Construction emissions have been evaluated individually for each surplus property, based on the
assumption that construction emissions are temporary and are not likely to occur within the same year at
all locations or at the same time as ongoing operational emissions, especially considering a 20-year buildout period for the Redevelopment Plan. Detailed calculations of the estimated construction emissions are
provided in Appendix D-1. (Section 3.6 discusses regional air quality, applicable regulations and
requirements, and methods used to assess the environmental consequences.)

5.6.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The 3-acre former Navy Lodge property is proposed for redevelopment as retail space under Alternative
1. Two buildings are proposed, each one-story in size, for a total of approximately 30,500 square feet of
space and a building footprint of 0.7 acres. These structures are proposed on the northeastern and
southeastern corners of the site, with parking between and around the buildings covering approximately
0.8 acres. Approximately 0.3 acres would be used as access, and the remaining 1.2 acres of the site would
be left as open space (see Chapter 2, Figure 2-1).
Construction-related emissions would be primarily exhaust emissions from construction vehicles and
equipment, construction materials delivery, construction employee commutes, and dust resulting from
ground disturbance and road traffic. Construction emissions resulting from this action at the former Navy
Lodge property under Alternative 1 would be similar yet slightly less than emissions estimated under
Alternative 2, which are discussed below in Section 5.6.2. These emissions would be short term and
localized, resulting in minor impacts on air quality.
Mitigation of construction emissions would be implemented with best management practices, which
could include proper maintenance of equipment, idling-reduction measures, and the use of newer, more
efficient equipment with diesel retrofits to control fine particulate matter (PM10) emissions. Particle
emissions can also be controlled through regularly watering graded areas and cleaning streets after
grading activities.
Operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic.
Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural gas, primarily for
heating, as well as the indirect use of electricity. Emissions from increased vehicle use was calculated
based on the new vehicle trips attributed only to the proposed retail space at the former Navy Lodge
property in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station
Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). Total operational emissions after full build-out of the former Navy

To mitigate operational emissions, buildings can be designed to meet stringent energy-efficiency
standards. Implementation of traffic-easing roadway designs to lower vehicle speed and reduce
congestion, in addition to expansion of public transportation and carpooling programs, would reduce
vehicle emissions.

5.6.2

Alternative 2

Under Alternative 2, the proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property includes the
development of two two-story retail buildings, resulting in 61,000 square feet of retail uses that would
have the same footprint (0.7 acres) as Alternative 1 (see Chapter 2, Figure 2-5). To accommodate the
increase in density between the preferred alternative and Alternative 2, an increase in parking is proposed.
A total of 1.4 acres of parking/access would be developed under Alternative 2.
Construction emissions resulting from the proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property
under Alternative 2 are provided in Table 5.6-2. These emissions would be temporary and would occur
only during the period of construction, which is conservatively assumed to be one year. Construction
emissions would be short term and localized, resulting in minor impacts on air quality. Measures to
mitigate construction emissions are the same as those discussed above under Alternative 1.
Similar to Alternative 1, operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased
vehicle traffic. Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural
gas, primarily for heating and the indirect use of electricity. As determined in the Traffic Impact Analysis
for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013),
vehicle traffic would increase because of the proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property,
resulting in additional vehicle emissions. Operational emissions would result in minor impacts on air
quality, and mitigation would further reduce adverse impacts. Total operational emissions after full buildout of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 are provided in Table 5.6-3. (See Chapter 12
for a discussion of regional air quality impacts.)

No Action Alternative

The site is currently vacant and covered with grass. Therefore, under the No Action alternative, there
would be no new stationary or mobile sources of criteria pollutants, HAPs, or GHG emissions from the
use of the property. Therefore, the No Action alternative would not impact air quality at the former Navy
Lodge property.

5.6.4

General Conformity Rule Applicability

Rhode Island is in attainment for all NAAQS; therefore, the General Conformity Rule does not apply to
this action. While not applicable to the action, the de minimis thresholds under the General Conformity
Rule have been used to consider the potential level of significance of the air quality impacts under NEPA.

Draft EIS

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

Emissions from construction and operation at the former Navy Lodge property under either alternative
would be below the General Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds. Thus, changes in air quality would
not be significant as a result of this construction, and mitigation would reduce adverse impacts.

5.7

Noise

This section includes an analysis of the potential noise impacts that would result from the proposed
redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action
alternative

5.7.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.7.1.1
Construction
Proposed redevelopment at the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1 involves the construction
of two one-story buildings. Table 5.7-1 provides an estimate of the number and type of construction
equipment that would be required and the associated sound pressure level (SPL) for each type of
equipment at a distance of 50 feet from the source and at the nearest residence. The nearest residence has
been determined to be at a location on Lake Erie Street at a distance of 185 feet from the center of the
former Navy Lodge property (see Figure 5.7-1). The SPL at this location is estimated to range from 61 to
71 dBA. As indicated in Section 3.7.1.1, normal speech has a sound level of 60 dB and a garbage disposal
has a sound level of 80 dB. The composite sound level due to construction would be in between these
sound levels.
Construction noise impacts would be temporary and would occur only during the period of construction,
which is conservatively assumed to be one year. In addition, construction would occur between 7:30 a.m.
and 7:00 p.m. when the noise would be less disturbing to area residents and in accordance with the zoning
regulations of the Town of Middletown.
Temporary increases in construction-related vehicle noise would also be expected. Traffic associated
with trucks and construction vehicles (e.g., dump trucks, material deliveries, debris removal, etc.) within
and near the former Navy Lodge property would produce localized noise for brief periods, but this would
not be expected to create any long-term, adverse noise impacts on the neighboring community.
Construction noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation
(conforming to zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
5.7.1.2
Operation
Noise impacts following full build-out of the former Navy Lodge property are primarily associated with
increased vehicle traffic. To characterize the projected traffic noise near the former Navy Lodge
property, the evening peak hour traffic volume, vehicle speed, and vehicle mix data for the roadways
analyzed in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station
Newport (Pare Corporation 2013) were modeled using TNM version 2.5 at the receptor locations shown
in Table 5.7-2. In addition to traffic volume generated by the proposed reuse, a 1 percent growth rate per
year from 2012 to 2032 was factored in to provide a conservative estimate of future traffic volumes.

Former Navy Lodge Property

Changes in the traffic-related noise levels would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise
environment; no mitigation measures are proposed.

5.7.2

Alternative 2

5.7.2.1
Construction
Although the redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 would have
increased square footage of retail use and additional parking space, the estimated construction noise levels
would be similar to Alternative 1; however, the duration of construction may be slightly longer due to the
additional story of the buildings under Alternative 2.
Temporary increases in construction-related vehicle noise would, however, be expected. Traffic
associated with trucks and construction vehicles (e.g., dump trucks, material deliveries, debris removal,
etc.) within and near the former Navy Lodge property would produce localized noise for brief periods, but
this would not be expected to create any long-term, adverse noise impacts on the neighboring community.
Construction noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation
(conforming to zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
5.7.2.2
Operation
Implementation of Alternative 2 for the former Navy Lodge property would not be expected to generate
significant traffic-related noise impacts within the study area. Traffic-related noise would occur in areas
already experiencing such noise and would not be expected to cause additional impacts. The predicted
traffic noise levels for the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 are provided below in Table
5.7-3. The largest estimated increase in traffic noise would be 1.2 dBA. An increase in noise of 3 dBA is
considered to be barely noticeable. As shown in Table 5.7-3, projected traffic noise levels would slightly
exceed FHWA guidance noise abatement criteria thresholds for land uses proposed under Alternative 2
but would not substantially exceed (greater than 15 dBA) existing conditions. Adjacent land uses under
Alternative 2 would include FHWA activity categories ‘B’ and ‘C.’ The traffic noise abatement criteria
threshold is 67 dBA for activity Category B and 72 dBA for activity Category C. (For more information
on FHWA traffic noise abatement criteria, see Section 3.7.2.) Changes in the traffic-related noise levels
would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment; no mitigation measures are proposed.

No Action Alternative

Under this alternative, all excess property would be retained by the U.S. government in caretaker status.
No reuse or redevelopment would occur at the former Navy Lodge property; therefore, no additional
noise would be generated.

5.8

Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the potential impacts on infrastructure and utilities from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of impacts on
water supply, wastewater, storm water, other utilities, and solid waste management from disposal and
reuse of the former Navy Lodge property.

5.8.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.8.1.1
Water Supply
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity to meet the future water demands
resulting from implementation of Alternative 1.
Water Demand
Full build-out of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1 would create more than 30,000
square feet of retail space. At full occupancy, water demand is estimated to be approximately 3,813
gallons per day (gpd) under Alternative 1. This represents a full increase of 3,813 gpd over 2012 existing
conditions because the property is currently vacant. Water demand was projected using planning
multipliers for retail land uses based on square footage (see Table 5.8-1) (Nelson 2004). For more
information on the methodology and assumptions used to estimate water demand, see Appendix D-3.

Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
City of Newport’s water treatment and distribution system. The current average daily demand on the City
of Newport water supply is 5.59 mgd, including demand by users in the City of Newport and the Town of
Middletown, which are supplied through the City of Newport’s distribution system, and NAVSTA
Newport and the Portsmouth Water and Fire District, which are supplied with water at wholesale by the
City of Newport. Total average daily demand is projected to increase to between 7.50 and 7.96 mgd by
2033 (Pare Corporation 2014).
Replacement of one of the existing plants and upgrades to the other plant have increased capacity to 16
mgd (Water World 2012; City of Newport Department of Utilities 2014). The expected 3,813 gpd under
Alternative 1 represents less than 1 percent of the average daily demand projected for 2033. The
combined current treatment capacity of the two water treatment plants is 16 mgd, and the project average
daily demand in 2033 is between 7.50 and 7.96 mgd. Therefore, the increase in projected water demand
would represent a minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s water treatment
plants and would be met with current capacity.

Draft EIS

5-40

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

Distribution System
Existing water lines at the former Navy Lodge property have been cut and capped. Redevelopment of the
property would require installing a new water supply distribution system, which would be the
responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact on the
existing distribution system. Ground would be disturbed when new distribution lines are laid, and the
developer would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new
distribution system(s) would be constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized. In addition, the
design and installation of any new water supply infrastructure would require, if applicable, municipal
review and approval and would need to comply with applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in an increase in water demand and a need for infrastructure.
New water distribution infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate redevelopment.
5.8.1.2
Wastewater
The City of Newport and the Town of Middletown would be expected to have sufficient capacity for the
collection and treatment of wastewater associated with development of the former Navy Lodge property
under Alternative 1.
Wastewater Volume
The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant; therefore, no wastewater is being produced at this
time. Full build-out of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1 would create more than
30,000 square feet of retail space. At full occupancy, wastewater generation is estimated to be
approximately 3,630 gpd under Alternative 1 based on standard multipliers for retail land uses (Nelson
2004). Estimates of volumes for Alternatives 1 and 2 are shown in Table 5.8-2. For more information on
the methodology and assumptions used to estimate wastewater generation, see Appendix D-3.

Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
City of Newport’s wastewater treatment capacity and the Town of Middletown’s collection system. The
City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant has a current capacity of 10.7 mgd and in 2012 processed
9.46 mgd. Although historically the Town of Middletown has exceeded its 2.1 mgd allotment, more than
$10 million in sewer improvements in Middletown are planned between 2014 and 2018 to reduce inflow
and infiltration in the town’s sewer collection system. Therefore, the increase in projected wastewater
demand would represent a minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s
wastewater treatment and collection system.
Wastewater flows generated under Alternative 1 would represent less than 1 percent of the town’s 2.1
mgd treatment allotment. However, the future developer would need to coordinate with the three local
municipalities and their utility providers to identify an alternative for wastewater treatment if the
allocation from the City of Newport is exceeded at the time of redevelopment.
Collection System
Existing sewer lines at the former Navy Lodge property have been cut and capped. Redevelopment of the
property would require installing a new wastewater collection system, which would be the responsibility

Former Navy Lodge Property

of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact. Ground would be
disturbed when laying new collection lines, and the developer would be required to comply with local and
state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new collection system(s) would be constructed to ensure
that they are adequately sized. In addition, the design and installation of any new wastewater collection
infrastructure would require, if applicable, municipal review and approval and would need to comply with
applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
Under Alternative 1, wastewater flows from the former Navy Lodge property would be discharged into
the Town of Middletown’s sewer system. The Wave Avenue pump station that serves the area
surrounding the property is currently operating at capacity, and additional wastewater would need to be
directed towards the Coddington Highway pump station (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Cost
estimates for connecting the property and surrounding parcels to the Coddington Highway gravity sewer
would cost between $150,000 and $200,000 for a dedicated pump station and force main (Vanasse
Hanglin Brustline Inc. 2011). The Town of Middletown estimates that needed upgrades to the
Coddington Highway pump station would cost between $750,000 and $1,000,000 (Vanasse Hanglin
Brustlin, Inc. 2011).
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in an increase in demand on wastewater capacity and a need for
infrastructure. Wastewater flows generated under Alternative 1 would represent less than 1 percent of the
Town of Middletown’s 2.1 mgd treatment allotment. New water distribution infrastructure would be
constructed to accommodate redevelopment.
5.8.1.3
Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 1 would increase the amount of impervious surface area on the property,
resulting in a greater volume of storm water runoff. Impervious surface is expected to result from the
proposed retail space, associated parking, and access to the property. Full build-out under Alternative 1 is
estimated to create a total of 78,400 square feet of impervious surface area; 30,500 square feet from the
retail structure, 34,800 from parking areas and 13,100 from the access road. This would be an addition of
approximately 77,790 square feet to the existing conditions (approximately 610 square feet). The amount
of impervious surface area for Alternatives 1 and 2 are shown in Table 5.8-3. For more information on
the methodology and assumptions used to calculate existing and future impervious surface, see Appendix
D-4.

The Town of Middletown requires that a storm water management plan be developed before a building
permit can be obtained, as per Chapter 153, Stormwater Management Ordinance. The storm water
management plan would describe measures to control the volume and quality of storm water runoff and
would incorporate BMPs for water quality control as described in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design
and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Additionally, the storm water
management plan must demonstrate soil and erosion control in accordance with the Town of Middletown
Construction Site Runoff Ordinance (Chapter 151) and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control Handbook (RIDEM, USDA Soil Conservation Service, and Rhode Island State Conservation
Committee 1989).
Draft EIS

5-42

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

A General Permit—Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity—would also be necessary because redevelopment of the former
Navy Lodge would disturb more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction General Permit, RIDEM
requires submittal of an NOI and a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), which must include a
discussion of erosion and sediment controls. Through compliance with applicable state and local
regulations, the addition of impervious surface would not be considered a significant impact.
Additionally, as indicated in Section 3.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, Section 438 of the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires that any development or redevelopment project
involving a federal facility with a footprint exceeding 5,000 square feet shall use site planning, design,
construction, and maintenance strategies in order to maintain or restore the predevelopment hydrology of
the property with regard to temperature, rate, volume, and duration of flow. Compliance with this
requirement can be met through the implementation of LID technologies.
Section 438 applies to the “sponsor of any development or redevelopment project involving a federal
facility.” The act of transferring the installation will result in the property being no longer federally
owned; consequently, Section 438 would not apply to the redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge
property. However, as outlined in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards
Manual, the use of LID techniques is required as a primary method of storm water control (RIDEM and
CRMC 2010). Thus, although not required through federal ownership of the property, it is expected that
the redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property would be consistent with the terms in Section 438
of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system may require modifications, and new storm water infrastructure
may be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under this alternative.
Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure, and the developer would be
required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion of the
BRAC disposal process, the future developer would be required to identify any infrastructure
requirements that may be necessary.
Operation and Management
Under Alternative 1, the property would likely be transferred to a non-federal agency and infrastructure
would no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future
property owner would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure located on the property and for its
service and maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a significant increase in impervious surface area, and new
storm water infrastructure would be required; however, through compliance with state and local
regulations and permit conditions regarding storm water management, the impact would be considered
minor.
5.8.1.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
Electricity at the property would continue to be supplied by National Grid. Upon full build-out of
Alternative 1, total electricity demand is estimated to be 438,036 kWh using U.S. averages for energy use
per square foot for specific types of building use (U.S. Department of Energy EIA 2003; 2009). These

Draft EIS

5-43

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

averages were used to estimate total energy use by the proposed new retail spaces. (The same
assumptions have been applied in Section 5.6, Air Quality.)
As shown in Table 5.8-4, the Town of Middletown consumed 116 million kWh in 2011. The 2011
electric consumption represented a decrease from 2010 but was still an increase over the levels used in
2009. According to the 2012 Regional System Plan developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode
Island’s overall electricity demand has been forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the
next decade.

The annual electricity demand under Alternative 1 would represent less than one-half percent of 2011
energy usage in the Town of Middletown and less than a tenth of a percent of total annual energy usage
for Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012). Considering the 0.8
percent future annual growth rate in electricity demand at the state level, and that Aquidneck Island
comprises approximately 5.5 percent of the state’s overall population, the annual growth rate for
electricity demand would be expected to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the electricity demand
resulting from redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge under Alternative 1 would be expected to be
supported by current electrical capacity and would represent a negligible impact on regional demand.
However, the future developer would need to coordinate with the three local municipalities and National
Grid to identify an alternative for electricity provision if, at the time of redevelopment, regional capacities
are exceeded.
All electrical connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and properly built electric
transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed during construction of new systems.
Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed by
the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the development
review process at the local level.
Natural Gas
Natural gas would continue to be supplied to the property by National Grid. It is expected that a total of
1,018,700 cf of natural gas would be needed each year under full build-out of Alternative 1. Similar to
electricity usage, estimates of future natural gas usage were calculated for full build-out as proposed
under Alternative 1 using U.S averages for natural gas use per square foot, which were obtained from the
U.S. Department of Energy’s EIA for specific types of building use. These averages were used to
estimate total natural gas use by the proposed new building spaces. (The same assumptions were used in
Section 5.6, Air Quality.) An abandoned 2-inch gas pipe connects the property to a main on Coddington
Highway. This pipe would need to be extended or replaced, depending on the orientation of the retail
buildings. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would work with
National Grid to identify any infrastructure requirements that may be necessary.
The natural gas usage for Middletown and surrounding communities is shown in Table 5.8-5.
Middletown consumed more than 105 billion cubic feet (cf) of natural gas in 2011. The quantity of
natural gas needed under Alternative 1 equates to one one-thousandth of a percent of the amount
consumed in Middletown in 2011 and, therefore, would represent a negligible impact on regional

demand. It is assumed that this additional demand would be accommodated within existing capacities
servicing existing demand. Redevelopment under Alternative 1 is not anticipated to create a strain on
natural gas resources.

All natural gas connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and properly built gas
transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed during construction of new systems.
Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed by
the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the development
review process at the local level.
5.8.1.5
Solid Waste
Approximately 270 cubic yards (cy) of C&D wastes would be generated from the construction activities
that are planned for redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 1 (see Appendix
D-2). Those wastes would consist of wood, concrete, masonry, metal, building materials, and mechanical
components. Much of the C&D waste would be recyclable, and it is anticipated that the demolition and
construction contracts would contain traditional terms and conditions requiring the recycling of C&D
waste to the extent practicable, which reduces disposal costs and is also protective of the environment.
Solid wastes also would be routinely generated by the retailers or their management/service contractors.
Such solid wastes would consist of mixed trash, food waste, and traditional recyclables such as paper,
cardboard, and containers. There would be a minor impact associated with solid waste management
under Alternative 1.

resulting from implementation of Alternative 2.
Water Demand
Full build-out of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 would create more than 60,000
square feet of retail space. At full occupancy under this alternative, it is expected that the property would
need 7,625 gpd of water (see Table 5.8-1). This represents a full increase of 7,625 gpd over 2012 existing
conditions because the property is currently vacant. Water demand was projected using planning
multipliers for retail land uses based on square footage. For more information on the methodology and
assumptions used to project water demand, see Appendix D-3.
Operation and Maintenance
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
City of Newport’s water treatment and distribution system. The current average daily demand on the City
of Newport water supply is 5.59 mgd. Total average daily demand is projected to increase to between
7.50 and 7.96 mgd by 2033 (Pare Corporation 2014). Replacement of one of the existing plants and
upgrades to the other have increased capacity to 16 mgd (Water World 2012; City of Newport

Draft EIS

5-45

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

Department of Utilities 2014). The expected 7,625 gpd under Alternative 2 represents less than 1 percent
of the average daily demand projected for 2033. Therefore, the increase in projected water demand would
represent a minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s water treatment plants
and would be met with current capacity.
Distribution System
As indicated under Alternative 1, existing water lines at the former Navy Lodge have been cut and
capped. Redevelopment of the property would require installing a new water distribution system, which
would be the responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate
impact. As indicated under Alternative 1, ground would be disturbed when laying new distribution lines,
and the developer would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance.
All new distribution system(s) would be constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized. In addition,
the design and installation of any new water supply infrastructure would require, if applicable, municipal
review and approval and would need to comply with applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would result in an increase in water demand and a
need for infrastructure. New water distribution infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate
redevelopment.
5.8.2.2
Wastewater
The City of Newport and Town of Middletown would be expected to have sufficient capacity for the
collection and treatment of wastewater associated with development of the former Navy Lodge property
under Alternative 2.
Wastewater Volume
The former Navy Lodge property is currently vacant, and no wastewater is being produced at this time.
Full build-out of Alternative 2 would create more than 60,000 square feet of retail space. Based on
standard multipliers for retail land uses, it is projected that the proposed retail space would produce 7,259
gpd of wastewater (see Table 5.8-2).
Operation and Management
Similar to Alternative 1, wastewater flows generated under Alternative 2 would represent less than 1
percent of the town’s 2.1 mgd treatment allotment. The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant has
a current capacity of 10.7 mgd and processes 9.46 mgd. With implementation of the sewer improvements
discussed above under Alternative 1, additional capacity may be realized by reducing the amount of the
current wastewater treated, thus allowing for accommodation of the additional wastewater treatment
required under Alternative 2. Therefore, the projected increase in wastewater demand would represent a
minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s wastewater treatment and collection
system. However, the future developer would need to coordinate with the three local municipalities and
their utility providers to identify an alternative for wastewater treatment if the allocation from the City of
Newport is exceeded at the time of redevelopment.
Collection System
Under Alternative 2 and similar to Alternative 1, wastewater flows from the Navy Lodge property would
be discharged into the Town of Middletown’s sewer system. The Wave Avenue pumping station that
serves the area surrounding the property is currently operating at capacity and additional wastewater
would have to be directed towards the Coddington Highway pumping station (RKG Associates, Inc. et al.
August 2011). The costs of connecting the property and surrounding parcels to the Coddington Highway
gravity sewer are estimated to be between $150,000 and $200,000 for a dedicated pump station and force
main (Vanasse Hanglin Brustline, Inc. and RKG Associates, Inc. 2011). The Town of Middletown
estimates that needed upgrades to the Coddington Highway Pumping station would cost between
Draft EIS

5-46

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

$750,000 and $1,000,000 (Vanasse Hanglin Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates, Inc. 2011). This would
be considered a moderate impact. Ground would be disturbed when laying new collection lines, and the
developer would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new
collection system(s) would be constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized.
In summary, as with Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would result in an increase in demand on wastewater
capacity and a need for infrastructure. New wastewater distribution infrastructure would be constructed
to accommodate redevelopment.
5.8.2.3
Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 2 would increase the amount of impervious surface area on the property,
resulting in a greater volume of storm water runoff. Impervious surface is expected to be created by
construction of the proposed retail space, associated parking, and access to the property. Currently, the
amount of impervious surface area is minimal. Full build-out under Alternative 2 is estimated to result in
a total of 91,500 square feet of impervious surface area—30,500 square feet from the retail structure,
47,900 from parking areas, and 13,100 from access roads. The amount of impervious surface area is
shown in Table 5.8-3. This would be an addition of approximately 90,890 square feet to the existing
conditions (approximately 610 square feet). (For more information on the methodology and assumptions
used to calculate existing and future impervious surface, see Appendix D-4.)
Similar to Alternative 1, compliance with local and state storm water management regulations would be
necessary. The Town of Middletown requires development of a storm water management plan before a
building permit can be obtained, as per Chapter 153, Stormwater Management Ordinance. The storm
water management plans shall describe measures to control the volume and quality of storm water runoff
and shall incorporate BMPs for water quality control, as described in the Rhode Island Stormwater
Design and Installation Standards Manual. Additionally, the storm water management plan must
demonstrate soil and erosion control in accordance with the Town of Middletown Construction Site
Runoff Ordinance (Chapter 151) and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
A General Permit—Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity—would also be necessary because redevelopment of the former
Navy Lodge would disturb more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction General Permit, RIDEM
requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a discussion of erosion and sediment
controls. Lastly, as discussed above under Alternative 1, Section 438 would not apply to redevelopment
of the former Navy Lodge property. However, as outlined in Rhode Island Stormwater Design and
Installation Standards Manual, using LID techniques are required as a primary method of storm water
control (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Thus, although not required through federal ownership of the
property, it is expected that redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property would be consistent with
the terms contained in Section 438 of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system may require modifications, and new storm water infrastructure
may be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under this alternative.
Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure, and the developer would be
required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion of the
BRAC disposal process, the future developer would be required to identify any infrastructure
requirements that may be necessary.

Draft EIS

5-47

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

Operation and Management
Under Alternative 2, the property would likely be transferred to a non-federal agency and infrastructure
would no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future
property owner would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure located on the property and for its
service and maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 2 would result in a significant increase in impervious surface area and new storm
water infrastructure would be required; however, through compliance with state and local regulations and
permit conditions regarding storm water management, the impact would be considered minor.
5.8.2.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
National Grid would continue to supply electricity to the property. Under full build-out of Alternative 2,
it is expected total electricity demand would be 876,071 kWh, based on U.S. averages for energy use per
square foot obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s EIA for specific types of building use. These
averages were used to estimate total energy use by the proposed new building spaces. (The same
assumptions have been applied in Section 5.6, Air Quality.)
As discussed under Alternative 1, the Town of Middletown consumed 116 million kWh in 2011. The
2011 electric consumption represented a decrease from 2010 but was still an increase over the levels used
in 2009. According to the 2012 Regional System Plan developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode
Island’s overall electricity demand has been forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the
next decade.
The annual electricity demand of Alternative 2 would represent less than three-quarters of a percent of
2011 energy usage in the Town of Middletown and less than a quarter of a percent of total annual energy
usage for Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012). Considering
the 0.8 percent future annual growth rate in electricity demand at the state level, and the fact that
Aquidneck Island comprises approximately 5.5 percent of the state’s overall population, the annual
growth rate for electricity demand would be expected to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the
additional electricity demand resulting from redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under
Alternative 2 would be expected to be supported by current electrical capacity and would represent a
negligible impact on regional demand. However, the future developer would need to coordinate with the
three local municipalities and National Grid to identify an alternative for electricity provision if, at the
time of redevelopment, regional capacities are exceeded.
Similar to Alternative 1, all electrical connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and
properly built electric transmission and conveyance system; construction of new systems would be
associated with ground disturbance. Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would
be fully funded and constructed by the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding
such would be part of the development review process at the local level.
Natural Gas
National Grid would continue to supply natural gas to the property. It is expected that a total of
2,037,400 cf of natural gas would be needed each year under full build-out of Alternative 2. An
abandoned 2-inch gas pipe connects the property to a main on Coddington Highway. This pipe would
need to be extended or replaced, depending on the position of the shopping center. Upon completion of
the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would work with National Grid to identify any
infrastructure requirements that may be necessary.

Draft EIS

5-48

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

The quantity of natural gas needed under Alternative 2 for redevelopment proposed for the former Navy
Lodge property represents less than one-one thousandth of a percent of the amount consumed in
Middletown in 2011 and is not anticipated to create a strain on resources (Rhode Island Energy 2012). It
would represent a negligible impact on regional demand.
Similar to Alternative 1, all natural gas connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized
and properly built gas transmission and conveyance system; construction of new systems would be
associated with ground disturbance. Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would
be fully funded and constructed by the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding
such would be part of the development review process at the local level.
5.8.2.5
Solid Waste
Approximately 540 cy of C&D wastes would be generated from the construction activities that are
planned for redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property under Alternative 2 (see Appendix D-2).
Those wastes would consist of wood, concrete, masonry, metal, building materials, and mechanical
components. Much of the C&D waste would be recyclable, as described under Alternative 1. Solid
wastes would be routinely generated by the retailers or their management/service contractors, as described
under Alternative 1. There would be a minor impact associated with solid waste management under
Alternative 2.

5.8.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property, there would be no
demand for water, electricity, or natural gas, nor would wastewater or solid waste be generated. Some
storm water runoff would occur from the existing approximately 610 square feet of impervious surface
area.

5.9

Cultural Resources

As discussed in Section 3.9, NEPA guidance requires the evaluation of impacts of a proposed action on
cultural resources, including archaeological resources and architectural or built resources (see Sections
5.9.1.1 and 5.9.1.2, respectively) as well as Native American resources (see Section 5.9.1.3). The Navy
has also evaluated the potential impacts of the proposed action in terms of their effects on cultural
resources that are historic properties, pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (see Section 5.9.1.4).

5.9.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.9.1.1
Archaeological Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have no impacts on archaeological resources because none are present within the
APE at the former Navy Lodge property.
5.9.1.2
Architectural Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have no impacts on architectural resources. Under Alternative 1, once the former
Navy Lodge property has been transferred out of Navy ownership, the existing utility shed and the
concrete pad would remain on the property.

5.9.1.3
Native American Resources
As indicated in Section 4.9.1.3, the Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian
tribes regarding Native American resources within the APE at the former Navy Lodge property: the
Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head
(Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for copies of consultation letters). Consultation remains open.
5.9.1.4
NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties
Under Alternative 1, the transfer of the former Navy Lodge property out of federal ownership or control
would have no effect on historic properties as none are located within the property. The Navy consulted
with the Rhode Island SHPO regarding the lack of historic properties (archaeological or architectural) at
the former Navy Lodge property (Lin 2013). The Rhode Island SHPO concurred that transfer of the
former Navy Lodge property out of federal ownership or control would have no effect on historic
properties (Sanderson 2013b).

5.9.2

Alternative 2

5.9.2.1

The NEPA impacts of Alternative 2 on archaeological resources are the same as those identified for
Alternative 1.

The NEPA impacts of Alternative 2 on Native American resources are the same as those identified for
Alternative 1.
5.9.2.4
NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties
The Section 106 effects of Alternative 2 on historic properties are the same as those identified for
Alternative 1.

5.9.3

No Action Alternative

The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of the No Action alternative under NEPA and determined
that the No Action alternative would have no impacts on archaeological resources because none are
present. It would have no impacts on architectural resources because there would be no redevelopment of
the property. The Navy has evaluated the Section 106 effects of the No Action alternative and determined
that the No Action alternative would have no effect on historic properties within the APE at the former
Navy Lodge property because none are present.

5.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the potential impacts on topography, geology, and soil resources resulting from
the implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative at the former Navy
Lodge property.

5.10.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The majority of proposed development would be located in areas that have been previously developed by
the Navy (buildings have been removed; the site is currently vacant land). Therefore, implementation of

Draft EIS

5-50

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

Alternative 1 would be expected to result in minor long-term impacts on topography, geology, and soil
resources (e.g., due to construction of new buildings, parking lots, utilities).
5.10.1.1 Topography
As a result of previous development associated with this site, the topography is relatively flat. Based on
the proposed development, the flat topography would be maintained and impacts on topography would be
minor.
5.10.1.2 Geology
Alternative 1 would not impact geologic resources at the former Navy Lodge property.
5.10.1.3 Soils
The majority of redevelopment proposed under Alternative 1 would be concentrated on approximately 1.8
acres of land in areas that have already been developed by the Navy. Since a lodge previously existed on
this property and a small utility building currently exists on the property, it is assumed that urban/manmade soils located within these areas have been modified from their original condition. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have both temporary and permanent minor
impacts, based on the size of the redevelopment footprint at full build-out as new structures and
supporting infrastructure are constructed.
Erosion Potential
All soil types located at the former Navy Lodge have the potential to be impacted by development,
including erosion from wind, water, and construction activities. The soil erosion potential for the
Newport-Urban land complex is moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at depths of 24 to 30 inches,
which means the soils are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff
(USDA 2012; IWR 2002). No erosion potential was listed for Urban land (USDA 2012). To varying
degrees, all such soils may require specific measures to control soil erosion and limit runoff of sediment
during clearing and construction activities. In addition, construction activities (clearing, grading,
landscaping, and movement of equipment, material, and vehicles) would expose soils to wind and storm
water erosion, compaction, and rutting.
Soils would be impacted during implementation of Alternative 1, but the impact would be mitigated
through the implementation of temporary erosion and sediment control measures during construction,
permanent storm water management measures, and appropriate building site location and design.
Because existing vegetation is limited to maintained grass and because the topography of the site is flat,
there would be no need to stabilize slopes after vegetation is removed.
Additionally, to mitigate these impacts, it is expected that the developer would implement appropriate
erosion and sediment control measures at construction and demolition sites in accordance with Rhode
Island’s Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (RIDEM et al. 1989) and other applicable state
laws. The handbook provides descriptions of structural measures (e.g., grassed waterway, sediment
basin, riprap, etc.) and non-structural measures (e.g., mulching, placing topsoil, silt curtains, etc.).
RIDEM requires a General Permit—Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water
Discharge Associated with Construction Activity—for projects that disturb more than 1 acre (RIDEM
2013c). Prior to approval of a Construction General Permit, RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a
SWPPP that must include a discussion of erosion and sediment controls. This permit is discussed further
in Section 5.11.

Draft EIS

5-51

Former Navy Lodge Property

Farmland
The former Navy Lodge property contains soils that are neither prime nor state-wide important soils (not
rated for farmland).
Hydric Soils
The soils at the former Navy Lodge property are non-hydric soils; however, non-hydric soils can contain
hydric inclusions and vice versa. However, new construction under Alternative 1 could impact hydric
soils (if the non-hydric soils contained hydric inclusions). Hydric soils may require special measures
during construction or other uses to overcome limitations caused by wetness. Limitations may include a
high water table or low strength for supporting construction equipment and structures. Hydric soils may
also present limitations to development activities (e.g., excavation and movement of heavy equipment)
due to wet conditions.
Constructability
The restrictions or constraints on commercial development at the former Navy Lodge property include a
restrictions on developments with on-site septic systems in Newport-Urban land complex soils and the
Urban land soils; however, on-site septic is not anticipated as part of redevelopment. The more common
sources of constructability limitations for the soils include shallow excavations (slight limitations due to
dense to very dense soils), moderate frost action, and a moderate slope. The moderate frost action is
unfavorable, but limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning or design. The NewportUrban land complex soils are also dense to very dense, which makes excavation difficult. However,
because much of the area where those soils are located may be modified, it is not possible to determine
the magnitude or severity of the limitations based on available information. Prior to construction,
engineering evaluations will be completed and appropriate engineering techniques identified to mitigate
any soil limitations.
Organic Soils
None of the soils located at the former Navy Lodge property are listed as organic soils.
In summary, there would be minor impacts on soils under Alternative 1, and mitigation would reduce any
temporary impacts. Mitigation would include implementation of appropriate erosion and sediment
control measures in accordance with local and state laws and the Construction General Permit, as
discussed in detail above.

5.10.2

Alternative 2

Similar to Alternative 1, the majority of proposed development would be located in areas that have been
previously developed by the Navy. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in minor
temporary impacts on topography, geology, and soils due to redevelopment of the property (e.g.,
construction of new buildings, parking lots, utilities).
5.10.2.1 Topography
Impacts on topography under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed above for Alternative 1.
5.10.2.2 Geology
Alternative 2 would not impact the geologic resources at the former Navy Lodge property.
5.10.2.3 Soils
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have similar impacts on soils as described for
Alternative 1, including impacts associated with erosion potential, hydric soils, and constructability. As
with Alternative 1, the proposed redevelopment would be concentrated in areas that have been previously

Former Navy Lodge Property

developed by the Navy. The building footprints for Alternative 2 would be the same as under Alternative
1; because the buildings are two stories under Alternative 2, additional parking would be provided under
Alternative 2. Therefore, Alternative 2 would result in approximately 2.1 acres of disturbance associated
with the redevelopment footprint, compared with 1.8 acres under Alternative 1. There would be minor
impacts on soils. The same mitigation measures discussed for Alternative 1 would be implemented under
Alternative 2 to minimize soil impacts.

5.10.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at the former Navy Lodge property by the
U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur at any of the property. As a
result, the No Action alternative would be expected to have no direct or indirect impacts on topography,
geology, or soils.

5.11 Water Resources

This section summarizes the potential environmental impacts on water resources resulting from
implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative at the former Navy Lodge
property. It includes a discussion of surface water, water quality, groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, and
proposed mitigation measures.

5.11.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.11.1.1 Surface Water
No surface water resources exist at the former Navy Lodge property (see Figure 4.11-2), and
redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property would have only a minor indirect impact on a nearby
surface water. Indirect impacts on surface waters near this property (i.e., Bailey’s Brook) in the form of
erosion or sedimentation could temporarily result from construction activities. Bailey’s Brook is the
nearest waterbody, located approximately 1,000 feet to the east. The distance between the former Navy
Lodge property and Bailey’s Brook, coupled with the implementation of BMPs, indicate that indirect
impacts would be anticipated to be negligible. Redevelopment would require compliance with applicable
local and state laws and regulations pertaining to storm water management. These include the Town of
Middletown’s Stormwater Management Ordinance, the Town of Middletown’s Construction Site Runoff
Ordinance, and the RIDEM General Construction Permit. All of these are discussed above in Section
5.8.1.3 and Section 5.11.1.2 below.
5.11.1.2 Water Quality
Full build-out of Alternative 1 is projected to result in a total of 1.8 acres (78,400 square feet) of
impervious surface area, which would predominantly comprise building roofs and parking areas. This
would be a net increase of approximately 1.79 acres above existing conditions (0.01 acre) (see Section
5.8.1.3 for more detail). The additional impervious surface area would generate a long-term increase in
precipitation runoff into the watershed and, ultimately, to waterbodies in the area, including Bailey’s
Brook and Narragansett Bay. It would be expected that full build-out would have a minor impact since
the proposed redevelopment is located within a highly developed area, and storm water runoff would be
collected into a storm water management system (see Section 5.8.1.3). (For more information on the
methodology, assumptions, and calculations used to project the impervious surface area resulting from
implementation of Alternative 1, see Appendix D-4.)
The developer would be required to follow all applicable state and local laws to reduce impacts on water
quality from storm water runoff. These include the Town of Middletown’s Stormwater Management
Ordinance and the Town of Middletown’s Construction Site Runoff Ordinance, Chapters 151 and 153 of
the town code, respectively.
Draft EIS

5-53

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

In accordance with these ordinances and prior to redevelopment, the developer would be required to
receive a permit from the Town of Middletown. Chapter 153 requires storm water management controls
that are consistent with the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (as
amended) (RIDEM and CRMC 2010) and erosion and sediment controls in accordance with both Chapter
151 of the Town Code (Town of Middletown Planning Department 2006) and the Rhode Island Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (as amended) (RIDEM et al. 1989). Additionally, a General
Construction Permit would be required from RIDEM for disturbing more than 1 acre of land.
Compliance with these laws and regulations and implementation of BMPs would result in minor impacts
on water quality due to storm water runoff.
5.11.1.3 Groundwater
As described in Section 4.11.3, the water table is less than 6 feet from the surface for the primary soil type
at the former Navy Lodge property. Construction activities could extend below ground surface to a depth
that would directly impact the underlying water table. The developer/contractor would be required to use
standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion and sediment control plans and BMPs that would
involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate discharge location, removing sediment from
collected water, and preserving downgradient natural resources. Potential spills of fuels or other
chemicals and hazardous materials could occur during construction activities. Impacts on groundwater
resources would be minimized through compliance with storm water permits and management plans and
implementation of BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards
Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on groundwater would result; mitigation would
reduce adverse construction impacts.
5.11.1.4 Floodplains
Implementation of Alternative 1 would not result in any impacts on floodplains at the former Navy Lodge
property because there are no FEMA-delineated floodplains on the property.
5.11.1.5 Wetlands
Alternative 1 would not result in any impacts on wetlands at the site. No wetlands are within the
boundaries of the former Navy Lodge property.

5.11.2

Alternative 2

5.11.2.1 Surface Water
Impacts on surface water under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed under Alternative 1.
5.11.2.2 Water Quality
Full build-out of Alternative 2 is projected to result in a total of 2.1 acres (91,500 square feet) of
impervious surface area, which would predominantly comprise building roofs and parking areas. This
would be a net increase of approximately 2.09 acres over existing conditions (0.01 acre) (see Section
5.8.2.3 above for more detail). The additional impervious surface area would generate a long-term
increase in precipitation runoff into the watershed and ultimately into waterbodies in the area, including
Bailey’s Brook and the Narragansett Bay. It is expected that full build-out would have a minor impact
since the proposed redevelopment is located within a highly developed area and storm water runoff would
be collected into a storm water management system (see Section 5.8.2.3). (For more information on the
methodology, assumptions, and calculations used to project the impervious surface area resulting from
implementation of Alternative 2, see Appendix D-4.)
The developer would be required to follow all applicable state and local laws as discussed for Alternative
1 to decrease impacts on water quality from storm water runoff. Compliance with these laws and
Draft EIS

5-54

March 2016

Former Navy Lodge Property

regulations and implementation of BMPs would result in minor impacts on water quality from storm
water runoff.
5.11.2.3 Groundwater
Similar to Alternative 1, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in construction activities that could
extend below ground surface to a depth that would directly impact the underlying water table. The
developer/contractor would be required to use standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion
sediment control plans and BMPs that would involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate
discharge location, removing sediment from collected water, and preserving downgradient natural
resources. Potential spills of fuels or other chemicals and hazardous materials could occur during
construction activities. Impacts on groundwater resources would be minimized through compliance with
storm water permits and management plans and implementation of BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island
Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on
groundwater would result; mitigation would reduce adverse construction impacts.
5.11.2.4 Floodplains
Implementation of Alternative 2 would not result in any impacts on floodplains at the former Navy Lodge
property because there are no FEMA-delineated floodplains on the property.
5.11.2.5 Wetlands
Alternative 2 would not result in any impacts on wetlands at the site because there are no wetlands within
the boundaries of the former Navy Lodge property.

5.11.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property, there would be no
impacts on water resources from redevelopment. Some storm water runoff would occur from the existing
approximately 610 square feet of impervious surface area.

5.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the potential impacts on biological resources from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of impacts on
vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, and significant wildlife habitat from disposal and
reuse of the former Navy Lodge property.
GIS analysis was used to determine the extent of potential impacts on vegetation communities and
wildlife habitat from implementation of the redevelopment alternatives (see Section 2 for more
information on the proposed redevelopment).
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, any future reuse of the
former Navy Lodge property would be required to comply with local, state, and federal laws and
regulations pertaining to biological resources.

5.12.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

5.12.1.1 Vegetation
Alternative 1 would result in conversion of approximately 60 percent of the 3-acre former Navy Lodge
property from maintained grass to redeveloped land. This would require the permanent removal of
grassed areas—a direct impact—to accommodate the new retail building and associated parking and

access. However, because the quality of the habitat provided by maintained grass is low, this conversion
is considered a minor impact. Approximately 1.2 acres of the site would be maintained as open space.
Temporary indirect impacts on the grass in the form of temporary disturbance could occur during
construction. The maintained grass would remain as open space following redevelopment, but it is
located next to areas slated for construction. However, any temporarily disturbed areas designated to
remain as open space following redevelopment would be restored back to either maintained grass or other
maintained conventional landscaping.
5.12.1.2

Wildlife

Terrestrial Mammals
As indicated above, approximately 1.8 acres of maintained grass would be removed as part of the
redevelopment associated with Alternative 1. Wildlife that use this habitat would be forced to migrate to
other areas with suitable habitat. However, given the lack of habitat diversity at the former Navy Lodge
property, permanent removal of the maintained grass is expected to be a minor impact on local wildlife.
Wildlife species may be temporarily displaced in peripheral areas during construction, when noise and
human activity levels increase. Species that would be most affected include those with relatively small
home ranges, such as small mammals. During construction, short-term impacts may include displacement
of mobile species such as eastern gray squirrel, common raccoon, Virginia opossum, white-footed mouse,
woodchuck, and striped skunk. These species would avoid areas of construction where equipment and
human activities create disturbance.
Herpetofauna
Alternative 1 would not result in any impacts on herpetofauna. There is no suitable habitat for
herpetofauna on the site, and no herpetofauna are present.
Avian Species
Short-term impacts on avian species, such as displacement, may result during Alternative 1 construction
activities. Birds would avoid areas of construction where equipment and human activities create
disturbance. However, because habitat diversity is limited, large numbers of birds are not expected to be
present or to use the site for stopover or foraging habitat. In May of 2015, the USFWS initiated a NEPA
review of alternatives to authorize take under the MBTA. At the time of the publication of this Draft EIS,
it is uncertain if the future implementation of the Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1 may require a
take permit under the MBTA. The future developer would be required to minimize impacts on migratory
birds as required under state and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the
CWA. Pursuant to the MBTA and BGEPA, the Navy has determined that implementation of Alternative
1 would have minor impacts on avian species and the disposal and reuse of the former Navy Lodge
property would not result in significant impacts on, or harm of, migratory birds and bald and golden
eagles.
5.12.1.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
As discussed in Section 4.12.1.3, no federally listed or state-listed threatened and endangered species
occur at the former Navy Lodge property (Chapman 2013; Jordan 203). The USFWS designated the
northern long-eared bat as a threatened species under the ESA, effective May 4, 2015. However, no
northern long-eared bat habitat exists at the former Navy Lodge property. As such, construction and
operation of the redevelopment proposed under Alternative 1 would not impact federally listed or statelisted threatened and endangered species.

5.12.2.1 Vegetation
Compared to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would result in approximately 0.2 additional acres of impact on
the existing grassland habitat cover at the former Navy Lodge property, for a total of 2 acres of
permanently removed grassed areas. However, because of the low quality of the habitat provided by
maintained grass, this conversion is considered a minor impact. Approximately 1 acre of the site would
be maintained as open space. Maintained grassy areas that would remain as open space following
redevelopment could experience temporary indirect impacts during construction if located next to areas
slated for construction. However, any temporarily disturbed areas designated to remain as open space
following redevelopment would be restored back to either maintained grass or other maintained
conventional landscaping.

No Action Alternative

No reuse or redevelopment would occur at any portion of the property. As a result, the No Action
alternative would be expected to have no direct or indirect impacts on biological resources such as
vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, or significant wildlife habitat. The grass at the
former Navy Lodge property would be maintained by periodic mowing; however, this periodic mowing
would not result in any adverse impacts on biological resources.

6 Former Naval Hospital Existing Conditions
6.1

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section summarizes existing land uses at the former Naval Hospital property. A discussion of the
land uses and zoning districts surrounding the property and the plans and regulations that guide or direct
the development of this land also is provided.

6.1.1

On-Site Land Use

The former Naval Hospital property is located on the western shore of Aquidneck Island, at the southern
end of NAVSTA Newport in the City of Newport. The property occupies 8.3 acres of land and 6.9 acres
of offshore riparian rights in Narragansett Bay. The site is bounded by Dorsey Road to the north, Cypress
Street to the south, Third Street to the east, and the Bay to the west (see Figure 6.1-1). Construction of
the Naval Hospital began in 1913 and continued through World War II. When the New England Naval
Medical Center was built in 1993, the main building, Building 1, was converted to administrative use. As
indicated in Section 1.3, from 1913 through 2007 the Naval Hospital provided outpatient services for
Naval shore activities and fleet operating forces at NAVSTA Newport, dependents of armed service
personnel, and others authorized for treatment.
Six buildings are on the site—the main hospital building (Building 1) and five administration or storage
buildings—and a pier. Building 1, the former main hospital building, is the largest structure at more than
147,000 square feet; Building 1 includes Buildings A72 and 1189. Building 7 was the former morgue and
was also used for housekeeping and storage. Building 45, at more than 30,000 square feet, is the second
largest building and was used as the former nurses’ quarters as well as for drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
Buildings 63 and 993 are detached garages and an emergency generator, respectively. Quarters A and B
are the former housing units. All of the buildings on the site were vacated by 2007. The buildings and
associated parking lots and access driveways cover approximately 4.3 acres of the site (52 percent of the
property). The remaining 3.9 acres of the site consist of open space (48 percent of the property). The
pier—Pier 71—is the only structure that extends offshore of the site. The site is within the NAVSTA
Newport fence line.

6.1.2

Surrounding Land Use

6.1.3

Land Use Plans and Zoning

The study area for surrounding land uses includes the area within 0.25 miles of the boundaries of the site
(see Figure 6.1-1). Land adjacent to the north of the former Naval Hospital property is part of the
NAVSTA Newport main base and contains Navy facilities, parking areas, and maintained open space.
This area of the base is designated in the NAVSTA Newport Vision 2035 Master Plan for
“medical/dental” land use and includes the Naval Health Clinic New England, which comprises the
installation’s medical clinic and dental clinic (EDAW/AECOM 2008). These areas are currently gated
and designated as restricted access; access is provided through a manned gate. Land adjacent to the east
and south of the site is not owned by the Navy and is developed with high-density residential and open
space land uses (see Figure 6.1-1). Narragansett Bay is located west of the site. Navy personnel and
community support facilities on NAVSTA Newport, including the station’s morale, welfare, and
recreation (MWR) marina, are located across Narragansett Bay on Coasters Harbor Island. The study
area west of the former Naval Hospital property is occupied primarily by the Pell Bridge interchange and
associated open space.
Land surrounding the former Naval Hospital property is in the City of Newport’s jurisdiction. Land use
and development in the city is regulated by the city’s zoning code (Newport Codified Ordinance Chapter

Draft EIS

6-1

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

17) and guided by the City of Newport’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan (City of Newport 2004). In
addition, the former Naval Hospital property is included in the study area analyzed in the City of
Newport’s 2006 North End Master Plan. The site also is included in the study area considered in the
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005).
City of Newport Zoning Code. The former Naval Hospital property is located in the city’s Residential
R-10 zoning district (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). The intent of this zoning is to provide for
medium-density residential development outside of the high-density residential uses in the city’s urban
core (Newport Codified Ordinance Section 17.20.010). The following uses are permitted by right in the
Residential R-10 zoning district: single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, home occupations,
churches and places of worship, nursery schools/day care centers, parks and playgrounds/playing fields,
community residences, family day care homes, municipal and public service corporation buildings and
facilities, and accessory uses associated with these permitted uses. The following uses require a special
use permit: multi-family dwellings; guest houses; libraries; museums; cemeteries; community
institutions; agricultural and horticultural societies; schools of limited instruction; hospitals; convalescent
and rest homes; undertaker’s establishments; clubs for outdoor recreation; neighborhood parking lots;
nonprofit multi-family housing for the elderly and/or handicapped; and federal, state, and municipal
buildings.
The zoning regulations for this district include dimensional requirements meant to preserve appropriate
residential densities. Minimum lot size in the district is 10,000 square feet, and building coverage on a lot
must not exceed 20 percent (Newport Codified Ordinance Sections 17.20.030 and 17.20.050).
City of Newport Comprehensive Land Use Plan. The city’s comprehensive plan identifies future land
use on the former Naval Hospital property as “Medium Density Residential (<1/4 to 1 acre lots)” (City of
Newport 2004). This designation reflects the existing zoning of the site, and the guidelines for land uses
in medium density residential areas largely follow the regulations included in the city’s zoning ordinance.
The comprehensive plan notes that medium-density residential areas are “located on the fringe of the
high-density residential and [serve] as a buffer to the low-density residential. Commercial uses are not
allowed with the exception of home occupations” (City of Newport 2004). Because the city largely is
developed, the guidelines for future land uses presented in the comprehensive plan closely follow existing
development patterns and zoning, with some exceptions where there are opportunities for redevelopment
of larger properties (City of Newport 2004).
The comprehensive plan addresses reuse and redevelopment of the surplus Navy properties, including the
former Naval Hospital property. Several goals and policies identified by the city in the comprehensive
plan are relevant to the proposed action at the former Naval Hospital property. One of the city’s goals is
to “protect Newport’s historic character and natural and cultural resources” and the city’s policy is to
preserve areas of historic significance (City of Newport 2004). The city’s stated goal is that
redevelopment of surplus Navy property should be compatible with surrounding land uses and should
meet the city’s economic and housing needs. According to the comprehensive plan, reuse of surplus
property should be compatible with NAVSTA Newport, contribute to the city’s tax base, and maintain
public access to waterfront property.
2006 North End Master Plan. The City of Newport developed the 2006 North End Master Plan to
provide a coordinated planning strategy to take advantage of potential short-term and long-term
development opportunities in the North End area that could arise from reconfiguration of the Pell Bridge
interchange and transfer of the former Naval Hospital property. The master plan recommends housing
and hotel land uses on the former Naval Hospital property, including 100 housing units, 100 hotel rooms,

surface parking, a waterfront park, a public and private marina, and a walkway and bikeway from Third
Street to Washington Street along the waterfront and along the northern boundary of the site. The master
plan also recommends use of the pier as a public pier with a water shuttle dock. The master plan
highlights the fiscal and employment benefits that would be provided by the recommended
redevelopment and reuse of the former Naval Hospital property (City of Newport 2006).
In a separate but related planning effort, the City of Newport is proposing to develop an area of the city’s
North End as the Newport Innovation Hub in partnership with state and federal agencies such as the
Chamber of Commerce, RIDOT, the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority, Statewide Planning,
and the Navy (City of Newport n.d.[b]). Creation of the Innovation Hub as a means to diversify the city’s
employment base was adopted as city policy with adoption of the city’s 2004 comprehensive plan (City
of Newport n.d.[c]). The Innovation Hub area includes the former Naval Hospital property (City of
Newport n.d.[b]). A development plan for the Innovation Hub area is still in progress but will guide
development of properties surrounding the former Naval Hospital property in the future. The current
vision for the Newport Innovation Hub is to create a scientific and technological center that focuses on
oceanographic research, defense/cyber applications, environmental technology, alternative energy,
emerging digital industries, and community resilience (City of Newport 2015). No detailed schedule
information is available for the project. The city is working to identify potential funding and will be
updating its Comprehensive Plan to incorporate the planning goals and objectives of the Innovation Hub
into the new Comprehensive Plan (City of Newport 2014a).
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. The Aquidneck Island Planning Commission cites the need
to plan for the reuse of surplus Navy properties as one of the reasons for preparing the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan. The former Naval Hospital property is located in the southern part of the
planning area.
The primary land use goals laid out in the Aquidneck Island master plan include minimizing sprawl,
planning for reuse of surplus Navy property, and diversifying land use. Accordingly, the overall
recommendation for future land uses in the west side planning area is for “targeted, mixed-use
redevelopment that supports existing land uses and provides public economic benefit, within an attractive
and accessible open space system” (The Cecil Group et al. 2005). Infill development or redevelopment
with commercial and compatible industrial land uses is emphasized. The redevelopment scenario for the
former Naval Hospital property proposed in the master plan is reuse of the site as a “technology transfer
center” (The Cecil Group et al. 2005). The master plan notes that any reuse and redevelopment of the
former Naval Hospital property should be economically beneficial, provide access to and allow use of the
waterfront by the public, and include a ferry and water shuttle service point to support expansion of water
transportation service along the west side.

6.1.4

Coastal Zone Management

Under the CZMA and the RI CRMP, the CRMC has review authority for all federal actions or activities
regardless of their location within a Rhode Island coastal community or state territorial waters. However,
only the disposal of the surplus property is a federal action; the subsequent redevelopment would be a
non-federal action and would fall under CRMC’s direct state permitting authority for non-federal projects
located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area.
The former Naval Hospital property is located in the 200-foot contiguous area of Narragansett Bay, which
the RI CRMP categorizes as a Type 4 Water: Multipurpose Waters. As discussed in Section 3.1.1, tidal
waters, shoreline features, and contiguous areas are regulated by the state. Figure 6.1-2 shows the
presence of the offshore portion of the site as a Type 4 water and two shoreline features within the site

Policy

1. The [CRMC’s] goal is to maintain a balance among the diverse
activities that must coexist in Type 4 waters. The changing
characteristics of traditional activities and the development of
new water-dependent uses shall, where possible, be
accommodated in keeping with the principle that the [CRMC]
shall work to preserve and restore ecological systems.
2. The [CRMC] recognizes that large portions of Type 4 waters
include important fishing grounds and fishery habitats, and
shall protect such areas from alterations and activities that
threaten the vitality of Rhode Island fisheries.
Policy 3 - Alterations to beaches adjacent to Type 3, 4, 5, and 6
waters may be permitted if: (a) the alteration is undertaken to
accommodate a designated priority use for the abutting water area;
(b) the applicant has examined all reasonable alternatives and the
Council has determined that the selected alternative is the most
reasonable; (c) only the minimum alteration necessary to support
the designated priority use is made; (d) there is no change in the
usage of the property; (e) there is no change in the footprint of
existing structures; and (f) the construction will meet all current
and applicable policies, standards, and requirements of the RI
CRMP.
Policy 4 - Coastal wetlands designated for preservation adjacent to
Type 3, 4, 5, and 6 waters are identified on maps available for
inspection at the Council's offices and at the town halls of coastal
cities and towns. Dredging and filling in these designated coastal
wetlands are prohibited. The maps of designated coastal wetlands
identify individual wetlands; in all cases precise boundaries shall be
determined through a field inspection when proposals that could
impact these features are being considered. In support of this goal,
the Council supports a policy of “no net loss” of coastal wetland
acreage and functions as a result of coastal development.
Policy 7 - All alterations to coastal wetlands shall be carried out in
accordance with Section 300.12, Coastal Wetland Mitigation.
Under the Rhode Island CRMP, any alteration or activity proposed
within tidal waters, shoreline features, and contiguous areas is
regulated and an assent is required from the Council. The
requirements for a Category B Assent from CRMC are provided in
Section 300.1 of the Rhode Island CRMP and include
demonstrating the need for the proposed activity, demonstrating
that the activity would not result in significant impacts on erosion
and/or deposition processes along the shore and in tidal waters, and
demonstrating that there would be no significant deterioration in
water quality, as well as other requirements.

Former Naval Hospital Property

The site also is located in the Aquidneck Island SAMP area encompassing the western side of Aquidneck
Island and adjacent water. Both the Coastal Development Policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP and
specific policies regarding location within a targeted redevelopment zone apply to the former Naval
Hospital property. The former Naval Hospital is located within a specifically defined redevelopment zone
called the Aquidneck Island Redevelopment Zone. As indicated in Section 170 of the SAMP, the
Aquidneck Island Redevelopment zone comprises areas on the west side of the island that have been
specifically designated for high-density development. Actions proposed in a redevelopment zone are
provided the option of meeting the setback and buffer requirements for that zone or the requirements in
the RI CRMP. Table 6.1-2 provides a summary of the applicable policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP.

Policy

Coastal greenways are intended to be vegetated with native plant communities
and provide an undeveloped transition zone between the shoreline and adjacent
upland development within the 200-foot contiguous area of a coastal feature.
Coastal greenway requirements do not apply to municipal projects undertaken
to provide public access to the shoreline and other public amenities such as ball
fields, parks, playgrounds, public boat ramps, public fishing piers, or boating
facilities
The primary goal/standard for any development project along the shoreline
must be a requirement to provide public access to and along the shoreline
within the project property boundary.
The scenic and visual qualities of the West Side of Aquidneck Island coastal
area shall be considered and protected as a resource of public priority.
Development should be sited and designed to protect views to and along
coastal areas, minimize the alteration of natural land forms, be visually
compatible with the character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible, restore
and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas in accordance with
Rhode Island CRMP Section 330.
A) 25% Minimum Vegetation Requirement – Applicants must include
sustainably landscaped areas in their proposals to achieve vegetative
coverage of at least 25% of the surface area over the entire development
parcel.
B)

Storm Water Management – All new development and redevelopment
proposals shall meet the storm water requirements of CRMP Section
300.6 and as specified in the most recent edition of the Rhode Island
Stormwater Manual to control peak flow rates and volumes and improve
water quality. Communities should be implementing LID practices to
meet the 2007 Cleaner Narragansett Bay Act (R.I.G.L. § 45-61.2), which
requires LID as the primary means of managing and treating storm water.

C)

Open Space – There are three aspects to open space designations of
importance. First is the choice of the land that should be set aside and
what qualities that land possesses, and second is the links between the
open space parcels that allow greenways throughout the area and improve
the value of the land and mobility for residents. The third aspect is the
design of the designated areas that will ensure their long-term value.

Road Network and Access

The former Naval Hospital property is bordered by Third Street to the east, Cypress Street to the south,
and Dorsey Road on the northern edge of the property. Riggs Road connects Dorsey Road and Cypress
Street on the western side of the property. Dorsey and Riggs Road are currently part of NAVSTA
Newport and are not public roadways. Within the surplus property, Biello Road provides access from
Riggs Road to the pier and paved parking areas exist along Third Street and Cypress Street on the
property. Gated and secured driveways are on Third Street, Cypress Street, and Dorsey Road. Access to
the property is primarily from Third Street. The roadways and intersection near the former Naval Hospital
property evaluated in the traffic study are described below.
Third Street. Third Street is a two-lane north-south roadway that extends from Admiral Kalbfus
Road/Training Station Road north of the property to the Long Wharf waterfront south of the property.
Third Street has a posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour and is an unclassified local roadway under the
City of Newport’s jurisdiction. School bus stops and RIPTA bus stops are located along Third Street.
Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road. Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road is a twolane roadway running in an east-west direction from the west coast of Newport to West Main Road. The
roadway transitions from Training Station Road to Admiral Kalbfus Road at Third Street. Training
Station Road is classified as an urban collector, while Admiral Kalbfus Road is an urban principal arterial
under the jurisdiction of RIDOT. With the exception of Admiral Kalbfus Road, the remainder of the roads
discussed in this section are under the jurisdiction of the City of Newport. Admiral Kalbfus Road is
designated as Route 138 for its entire length. Turning lanes are also present at the intersections along the
roadway. The posted speed limit on Training Station Road is 20 miles per hour, and the posted speed
limit on Admiral Kalbfus Road is 25 miles per hour.
Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road and Third Street/Third Street Extension

A capacity analysis was conducted to characterize the LOS of the Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station
Road and Third Street/Third Street Extension intersection. LOS is a qualitative measure that describes
general operating conditions based on factors including speed, travel times and delays. LOS is reported
on a scale of ‘A’ to ‘F.’ ‘A’ represents the best operating conditions with free-flowing traffic and ‘F’
represents the worst operating conditions with significant delays. During both morning and evening peak
hours, this intersection currently operates at LOS B.

6.4.4

Safety Conditions

Accident data from January 2010 to October 2012 were reviewed for the following road segments near
the former Navy Hospital property:
•

Admiral Kalbfus Road between Third Street and the Pell Bridge on and off-ramps

•

Third Street Road between Admiral Kalbfus Road and Sycamore Street.

During this period, a total of 98 vehicle accidents were recorded, including 60 rear-end collisions, 13
sideswipes, 11 vehicle collisions with an object, 9 involving loss of control of the vehicle, 4 angle
crashes, and 1 head-on collision (Pare Corporation 2013). Of the intersections studied in Newport, the
majority of accidents were reported at the Route 138 eastbound exit ramp intersection with Admiral
Kalbfus Road. Thirty-six accidents were reported at this intersection, 33 of which were rear-end
collisions.
A speed study was conducted on Third Street near the former Naval Hospital property. Third Street has a
posted speed of 25 mph and 85 percent of vehicles travel above the speed limit (Pare Corporation 2013).
The average speed of vehicles on this roadway was 30 mph.

Environmental Management

This section summarizes the existing conditions regarding hazardous waste, hazardous materials, medical
waste, and the Environmental Restoration (ER) Program for the former Naval Hospital property.

6.5.1

Hazardous Waste

Between 800 and 1,500 pounds of hazardous waste were generated per year at the former Naval Hospital
when it was in operation. Some of the hazardous waste contained heavy metals, mostly silver generated
during X-ray development. A 90-day hazardous waste storage area was located in Building 1. After 90day storage, hazardous waste was transported off-site for disposal in compliance with federal and state
regulations. The waste was disposed of by a licensed contractor. The 90-day storage area at Building 1
was decommissioned in 2003 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
Any universal wastes generated at the former Naval Hospital property, such as spent fluorescent light
bulbs, batteries, and thermostats, are transferred to universal waste accumulation areas and transported
off-site for disposal or recycling by a contractor (see Section 3.5.1.1). No other hazardous waste is
currently known to be generated at the complex or Pier 71 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).

6.5.2

Hazardous Materials

6.5.2.1
Hazardous Material Control
The Tier II Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory report for 2011 shows that lead (i.e., lead acid
batteries) and sulfuric acid (liquid) are stored in Building 993 (NAVSTA Newport 2012b; Malcolm Pirnie
2005). There are no records of hazardous materials currently being stored in any of the other former
Naval Hospital buildings or Pier 71. When the hospital was in operation, substances such as alcohol,
xylene, and formalin were stored in a chemical storage room in Building 1 near the histology laboratory
and flammables were stored in flammables cabinets. Cleaning supplies are presumed to have been stored
in Building 7, where housekeeping was located, and it is suspected that chemicals used for preservation
also were stored in Building 7 as it was also used as a morgue (Malcolm Pirnie 2005).
According to the installation spill log for 2002 through 2011, 4 gallons of fuel oil were spilled near
Building 7 in 2003 and 2 gallons of latex paint were spilled near Building 7 in 2004. The spills were
cleaned up and were below the requirements for reporting to the National Response Center or RIDEM
(NAVSTA Newport 2012e).
6.5.2.2
Underground Storage Tanks
No USTs are located at the former Naval Hospital property.

Draft EIS

6-18

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

6.5.2.3
Aboveground Storage Tanks
Two steel ASTs formerly used to store diesel fuel are located at the emergency generator building,
Building 993. One is a 2,000-gallon tank and the other is a 275-gallon tank. They were closed in 1998
and are not active (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
6.5.2.4
Oil/Water Separators
There are no OWSs on the former Naval Hospital property.
6.5.2.5
Asbestos-Containing Materials
Various asbestos surveys were conducted between 1988 and 1997 in most of the buildings at the former
Naval Hospital property, and a visual survey for ACM was conducted in 2004 in conjunction with the
environmental baseline survey for transfer of the property. A focused asbestos survey was conducted in
April 2013 to provide information for this EIS and to update and fill in gaps from the previous surveys.
The executive summary of the report documenting the April 2013 survey (YU & Associates 2013) is
provided in Appendix E.
Table 6.5-1 summarizes the results of the surveys conducted between 1988 and the present. ACM has
been identified or observed in all of the structures on the former Naval Hospital property. ACM has been
found in materials such as floor and ceiling tiles, pipe insulation, electrical insulation, wall plaster,
roofing materials, and window caulk, which is common of construction prior to 1989, when asbestos use
was banned.
Much of the ACM identified in Building 45 has been removed, but the ACM identified in the other
buildings has not (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
6.5.2.6
Lead-Based Paint/Lead
Various locations in the buildings at the former Naval Hospital property were tested for LBP in
1995/1996 and a visual survey was conducted in 2004 in conjunction with the environmental baseline
survey for transfer of the property. A focused LBP survey was conducted in April 2013 to provide
information for this EIS and to update and fill in gaps from the previous survey. The executive summary
of the report documenting the April 2013 survey (YU & Associates 2013) is provided in Appendix E.
Table 6.5-2 summarizes the results of the surveys. LBP has been identified or observed in all of the
structures on the former Naval Hospital property with the exception of Building 993. LBP has been
commonly found on walls, floors, ceilings, window components, door components, metal pipes, radiators,
staircases, and miscellaneous painted wood. The environmental baseline survey reported that much of the
paint at Buildings 1, 7, and 45 was peeling (Malcolm Pirnie 2005).

In the April 2013 survey LBP was identified based on a combination of screening and analytical results, visual survey and
observations, and professional judgment. XRF measurements were used as a screening and measurement method, with
follow-up chip or bulk sampling in cases where XRF readings were inconclusive.
The report for the April 2013 survey identifies specific material types positive for LBP for each building, e.g., concrete floors
vs. wood floors.
Soil sampling was performed at facility drip lines where potential LBP was observed to be peeling or chipping.

The April 2013 survey also included an evaluation of lead in soils surrounding the former Naval Hospital
buildings. Seven soil samples were collected at facility drip lines where potential LBP was observed to
be peeling or chipping. As shown in Table 6.5-2, lead was found in discrete areas of soil around
Buildings 1, 7, and 45 and Quarters A and B at levels exceeding the RIDEM residential direct exposure
criterion (DEC) for lead of 150 mg/kg.
Five of the results also exceeded the RIDEM
industrial/commercial DEC for lead of 500 mg/kg. LBP was not evaluated in the environment around
Buildings A72, 63, and 993 or Pier 71 because there is no soil around or near those structures.
6.5.2.7
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
There are 11 transformers located on the former Naval Hospital property, primarily near Building 1 and
Building 993. “PCB-free” stickers are affixed to six of the transformers. Two other transformers are
suspected to be PCB-free because facility personnel indicated that they were manufactured after PCB oil
was no longer used in transformers. The remaining three transformers were installed in 2000 to replace
three PCB-containing transformers (Malcolm Pirnie 2005). PCB-containing transformers were removed
or replaced at NAVSTA Newport in the 1980s (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009) and the Navy is not
otherwise aware of any PCB-containing transformers at the installation (CNIC n.d.[d]).
Based on the age of the buildings, PCB-containing light ballasts could be present in fluorescent light
fixtures. Window caulking and glazing were evaluated for PCBs in April 2013 to provide information for
this EIS. The executive summary of the report documenting the April 2013 evaluation (YU & Associates
2013) is provided in Appendix E. The five window caulking/glazing samples collected (three from
Building 1 and two from Building 7), many of which were composite samples, did not contain PCBs.
6.5.2.8
Pesticides
Pesticides are not known to have been stored, nor are they currently stored, at the former Naval Hospital
property (Malcolm Pirnie 2005). Pesticides likely have been, and continue to be, applied inside and
outside of the buildings as necessary in accordance with the NAVSTA Newport Integrated Pest
Management Plan (Geo-Marine 2009 [see Section 3.5.1.2]).

6.5.2.9
Radioactive Materials
There are no records of radioactive materials use or radioactive waste generation at the former Naval
Hospital property (Malcolm Pirnie 2005). However, because of its use as a hospital, it is possible that
radioactive materials were used for diagnosis and treatment purposes during routine activities at Building
1. Radioactive materials have been commonly used for diagnosis and treatment since the early 1900s.
The use of radioactive materials in medicine includes brachytherapy, where radioactive sources are
inserted into the body near the site of cancerous tissue, and diagnostic tests that use radioactive materials
as tracers during imaging and scans.
6.5.2.10 Radon
Several areas of Building 1 were tested for radon from 1991 to 1992 and in 1993. Most of the 1991-1992
results, consisting of more than 100 tests, were well below the EPA (and Navy Radon Assessment and
Mitigation Program) indoor-air action level of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). Five of the 1991-1992
results exceeded the limit—radon levels ranged from 6.8 pCi/L to 8.6 pCi/L in the exam room and the
military sick call rooms. Radon mitigation was not performed in those rooms following the testing. For
the 1993 survey, all of the approximately 20 results for Building 1 were lower than 1.4 pCi/L (Malcolm
Pirnie 2005).
Radon detectors were placed in a group of housing units in 1993, including Quarters A and B on the
former Naval Hospital property. The results, which were reported for the group as a whole, ranged from
0.1 pCi/L to 2.6 pCi/L (Malcolm Pirnie 2005).
There are no reports of radon testing at the remaining areas of the former Naval Hospital property.

6.5.3

Medical Waste

Medical waste was routinely generated at Building 1 until 1993, when Building 1 was converted to
administrative use. The medical waste was burned in an incinerator located east of Building A-33 (which
is north of Building 1 and outside the surplus property boundary) until 1988, when medical waste was
transported off-site for disposal by an outside contractor. No records of the medical waste generated at
Building 1 are available because they are only maintained for five years (Malcolm Pirnie 2005). Based
on current activities at Naval Health Clinic New England, medical waste generated in Building 1 likely
consisted of sharps, live and attenuated vaccines, human pathological wastes, and human blood and body
fluids.
There are no reports of medical waste generation at the other former Naval Hospital buildings.

6.5.4

Environmental Restoration Program

There are no ER Program sites near the former Naval Hospital property. The closest site is IRP Site 9, the
Old Fire Fighting Training Area (OFFTA), located at the northern end of Coasters Harbor Island (see
Section 3, Figure 3.5-1). The OFFTA is approximately 0.5 miles from the former Naval Hospital
property and is separated from it by the waters of Narragansett Bay.

Air Quality
Existing Air Quality

Section 3.6 provides information about regional air quality and applicable regulations and requirements.
The CAA is the primary federal statute governing the control of air quality. The former Naval Hospital
property is in the City of Newport, Newport County, RI. This location is within the Providence, RI air

quality region, which encompasses all of Rhode Island and is currently in attainment for all NAAQS. The
state is under the jurisdiction of RIDEM for air quality.

6.6.2

Existing Emissions

The former Naval Hospital property comprises six buildings and one pier; by 2007, all buildings within
the Naval Hospital complex had been vacated. Since the buildings are not in use, energy usage is
minimal, as are activities of maintenance personnel who occasionally visit the property. Therefore, there
are no existing stationary or mobile sources of criteria, HAPs, or GHG emissions from the current use of
the property.

6.7

Noise

Ambient sound levels are a function of a variety of sources: local traffic, barking dogs, birds, insects,
lawnmowers, children playing, and the interaction of the wind with groundcover, buildings, trees, shrubs,
power lines, etc. Sound levels vary with time of day, wind speed and direction, and the level of human
activity. The acoustic environment around the former Naval Hospital property is mainly characterized by
traffic noise during daytime hours.
Table 6.7-1 presents the minimum and maximum hourly average Leq sound levels measured in 2010 at the
monitoring station nearest to the former Naval Hospital property (LT-3) (Tech Environmental 2011) (see
Figure 3.7-1 in Section 3.7).

To characterize the existing traffic noise near the former Naval Hospital property, the peak afternoon
traffic volume, vehicle speed, and vehicle mix data for the roadways analyzed in the traffic study
conducted in October 2012 (Pare Corporation 2013) were modeled, using TNM version 2.5. The
modeling results for the existing traffic noise in the vicinity of the former Naval Hospital property ranged
from 61.0 to 66.2 dBA.

6.8

Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the existing infrastructure, utilities, and solid waste management at the former
Naval Hospital property.

6.8.1

Water Supply

Drinking water for the former Naval Hospital property was previously provided by the City of Newport
through water purchased wholesale from the city and distributed through the Navy-owned water system;
that water distribution system is still owned by NAVSTA Newport, although service to the property is no
longer operational.
Drinking water in the City of Newport is supplied by the Department of Utilities Water Division, which
manages the city’s source water, treatment plants and distribution system; this distribution system also
serves the Town of Middletown and parts of Portsmouth. In addition to supplying water for Newport and
Middletown, the City of Newport sells water wholesale to Portsmouth and NAVSTA Newport (City of

Draft EIS

6-26

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Newport Department of Utilities 2013b). The City of Newport obtains its drinking water from nine fresh
water reservoirs (City of Newport Department of Utilities 2012): Easton North Pond, Easton South Pond,
Lawton Valley Reservoir, Gardiner Pond, St. Mary’s Pond, Paradise Pond, Sisson Pond, Nonquit Pond,
and Watson Reservoir. The safe yield for these surface water reservoirs is 12.2 mgd and 14.1 mgd for the
Aquidneck region as a whole (Pare Corporation 2014).
Drinking water from the reservoirs is treated at one of two water treatment plants owned by the City of
Newport. The Lawton Valley water treatment plant (WTP), located in Portsmouth, was built in 2014,
adjacent to the original Lawton Valley WTP built in 1942, which it replaced. The new Lawton Valley
WTP has a capacity of 7 mgd (City of Newport Department of Utilities 2014). Station 1, located in
Newport, was built in 1991 (NAVSTA Newport 2012a) and has a maximum treatment capacity of 9 mgd;
upgrades were recently completed to Station 1, which had been operating at a treatment capacity of only
approximately 6 mgd (City of Newport Department of Utilities 2013b).
The City of Newport’s water distribution system services the City of Newport, Town of Middletown and
parts of Portsmouth and includes 168 miles of transmission and distribution mains and 10,500,000 gallons
of storage capacity (City of Newport Department of Finance 2012).
Between 2002 and 2011, the City of Newport replaced 10.8 miles of water mains in Newport and
Middletown (City of Newport Department of Utilities 2012). As part of the FY 2011-2012 budget, the
City of Newport proposed spending $10.8 million between 2011 and 2016 to replace water mains that
were old or in poor condition (City of Newport 2011). Current average daily demand for water distributed
through the Newport Water Division is 7.8 mgd (Rhode Island Division of Planning 2012). The Town of
Portsmouth, which purchases its water wholesale from the Newport Water Division, has a current demand
of 1.3 mgd (Rhode Island Division of Planning 2012).
The total average daily demand from Newport’s water supply in 2033 is projected to be between 7.50 and
7.96 mgd (Pare Corporation 2014). Table 6.8-1 shows the projected water demand. Based on the
combined treatment capacity of the two water treatment plants of 16 mgd, the anticipated average daily
demand in 2033 would be met.

Wastewater

The former Naval Hospital property is currently serviced by the NAVSTA Newport sewer collection
system. Because the buildings at the Naval Hospital are not currently in use, no wastewater is being
generated from that site.
The Department of Utilities Water Pollution Control Division is responsible for wastewater management
in the City of Newport. The city contracts with United Water, Inc. to operate its sewer lines and the City
of Newport WWTP (City of Newport Department of Utilities 2013a). The city’s wastewater
infrastructure includes 88 miles of sanitary sewers, 46.5 miles of storm sewers and 14 pumping stations
(City of Newport Department of Finance 2012c; United Water n.d.). The majority of the city has

Draft EIS

6-27

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

combined storm water and sewers. The City of Newport also collects and treats wastewater from the
Town of Middletown and NAVSTA Newport.
The city’s WWTP is located on J.T. Connell Highway and has a licensed capacity of 10.7 mgd (City of
Newport Department of Finance 2012a). In 2012, the plant treated 9.46 mgd of wastewater for the City
of Newport, Town of Middletown, the Melville area of Portsmouth and NAVSTA Newport (City of
Newport Department of Finance 2012a).

6.8.3

Storm Water

Storm water runoff is handled by a network of storm water lines at the former Naval Hospital property,
and two outfalls discharge water into the Narragansett Bay (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
Discharge from the two outfalls at the former Naval Hospital are permitted under NAVSTA Newport’s
Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System General Permit.
Storm water in the City of Newport is handled by the Department of Utilities Water Pollution Control
Division. The city has a system of 45 miles of separate storm water lines in addition to combined stormsewer lines. Additional infrastructure includes 2,500 catch basins and 50 outfalls and 24 pumping
stations. During heavy precipitation, large quantities of storm water enter the combined sewer system and
can exceed capacity (CH2M Hill 2012). Excess flow is discharged into Newport Bay at one of two
outfalls. In an effort to reduce this discharge, the city has completed several projects to separate storm
and sewer drains and has constructed partial treatment facilities and a storage facility to control
discharges (CH2M Hill 2012).

6.8.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
National Grid is the primary electrical utility providing connection and distribution services in the City of
Newport. This is a user-supported utility service, and the customers pay for the service and electricity
supplied. (Information about electricity uses for the three communities surrounding all four surplus
properties is provided in Section 4.8.4.)
Natural Gas
The City of Newport and the surrounding region is serviced by National Grid. This is a user-supported
utility service, and the customers pay for service and natural gas supplied. (Information about natural gas
uses for the three communities surrounding all four surplus properties is provided in Section 4.8.4.)

6.8.5

Solid Waste

Solid wastes were generated at all of the former Naval Hospital buildings and areas while they were in
operation. Nonhazardous solid waste would have consisted of mixed trash, paper, cardboard, food waste,
C&D waste (e.g., wood, concrete, building materials), and industrial scrap materials (e.g., wood, metal)
(see Section 3.5.1.2). Solid waste was disposed of at the installation landfill until the 1980s, after which it
was collected by installation personnel and disposed of at a transfer station in Newport. Since 1995, solid
waste generated at NAVSTA Newport has been collected, disposed of, and recycled off-site by a
contractor (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).

6.9

Cultural Resources

This section describes the existing cultural resources and historic properties that are located within the
APE for the proposed action at the former Naval Hospital property. The boundary of the APE is the same
as the boundary of the property that will be disposed (see Figure 6.9-1). Cultural resources within the

APE would consist of previously recorded archaeological sites and archaeologically sensitive areas, and
previously identified and evaluated architectural resources. Archaeological and architectural resources
are discussed in greater detail in Sections 6.9.1 and 6.9.2, respectively. A discussion of Native American
resources is provided in Section 6.9.3. Resources that were determined historic properties are discussed
in greater detail in Section 6.9.4.
In general, the APE was considered sensitive for cultural resources that were associated with a variety of
cultural periods of human occupation. Previously recorded archaeological sites or archaeologically
sensitive areas were identified in the vicinity of the APE, and indicate prehistoric and historic settlement
and/or use of the general project area. Extant buildings and structures in the vicinity of the APE
document more recent occupation and use of the area from the mid-nineteenth century to the present,
including the construction of the former Naval Hospital at the turn of the twentieth century.

6.9.1

Archaeological Resources

A 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation conducted at the former Naval Hospital property was an
investigation of the terrestrial portion of the APE only; offshore portions of the APE at the former Naval
Hospital property were not surveyed as part of the 2013 Phase I archaeological investigations (Gould and
LeeDecker 2014). A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated in unpaved areas of the terrestrial portion of
the APE at the former Naval Hospital property. Two of the 27 shovel tests contained two fragments of
historic ceramic; none of the other 25 shovel tests contained artifacts. All of the shovel tests revealed
evidence of prior surface and subsurface disturbance in the form of fill overlying cut and truncated natural
soils. Based on these results, no archaeological sites were identified within terrestrial portions of the APE
at the former Naval Hospital property and no further archaeological investigations of terrestrial portions
of the APE at the former Naval Hospital property were recommended (Gould and LeeDecker 2014). The
Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the lack of archaeological sensitivity of terrestrial
portions of the APE at the former Naval Hospital property, and the Rhode Island SHPO concurred that no
further archaeological investigations of the terrestrial portion of the APE at the former Naval Hospital
property were required (Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b).
The Navy has not conducted underwater archaeological investigations at the offshore portion of the APE,
where Pier 71 of the former Naval Hospital property is located. However, other investigations have
indicated that no known submerged or underwater cultural resources or historic properties have been
identified within the offshore portion of the APE (Louis Berger and Associates, Inc. 1998; Gould and
LeeDecker 2014). The Navy’s cultural resources survey of U.S. Naval Complex Newport in 1998
generally assessed the waters of Narragansett Bay offshore of U.S. Naval Complex Newport as being
considered sensitive with respect to submerged historic archaeological resources (Louis Berger and
Associates, Inc. 1998), and identified one underwater or submerged archaeological site, consisting of a
Revolutionary War-era shipwreck, in an offshore location that is outside, but in the vicinity of, the APE at
the offshore portion of the former Naval Hospital property. The survey indicated that the Rhode Island
Marine Archaeology Project had been working at the site, assisted by a grant from the Department of
Defense Legacy Program (Louis Berger and Associates, Inc. 1998).
The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation conducted for terrestrial portions of the APE at the former
Naval Hospital property acknowledged the presence of the previously identified submerged
archaeological site RI-2125 (also known as the British Transport Site), describing it as an NRHP-eligible
submerged archaeological site comprising an historic (18th century, Revolutionary War) shipwreck and
confirming that it is located offshore of the former Naval Hospital property. The site consists of a ballast
pile, two cannons, and an exposed timber. Archaeological material recovered from the submerged
archaeological site, consisting of wood, leather, kaolin pipe fragments, glass and creamware (ceramics),
confirmed the 18th century age of the site (Gould and LeeDecker 2014).

Draft EIS

6-31

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

As noted in the 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation report, submerged archaeological site RI-2125
is the remains of a private British transport ship, believed to be one of at least ten private British
transports that were documented as being present in Newport Harbor in 1778. These British transport
ships were private vessels used to transport men and materiel across the Atlantic for the British Navy and
may also have been used as a prison ship to house American sympathizers of the Revolution (Gould and
LeeDecker 2014. Additionally, it is possible that the shipwreck comprising Site RI-2125 may be the
remains of the ship Lord Sandwich ex Endeavor, a British Royal Navy research vessel that was sailed by
Captain James Cook of the British Navy on his first voyage to the South Pacific from 1769 to 1771
(Gould and LeeDecker 2014). The Endeavor was sold into private hands following this voyage, was
subsequently used as a transport, and was documented as being in Newport Harbor during the
Revolutionary War. The fate of the Endeavor after the Revolutionary War is currently unknown,
although its absence from the historical record after 1779 suggests that it is one of the transports that were
lost during the British naval blockade of Newport Harbor. Additional information would be necessary to
determine whether Site RI-2125 is the remains of the Lord Sandwich ex Endeavor (Gould and LeeDecker
2014).
In 2006, during the Navy’s consultation with the Rhode Island SHPO for another project involving excess
property disposal at the former Naval Hospital property, the Rhode Island SHPO noted that the 18th
century shipwreck (RI 2125) was located offshore of the former Naval Hospital property but indicated
that the full extent of the site and its boundaries was unknown (Sanderson 2006). While the Rhode Island
SHPO further recommended that possible effects of this other project on this underwater archaeological
site should be taken into account (Sanderson 2006), the Navy did not undertake an assessment of possible
effects on Site RI-2125 because this other earlier project was not carried forward by the Navy.
In 2013, during the Navy’s consultation with the Rhode Island SHPO on the results of the Phase I
archaeological investigations for the current proposed action, including archaeological investigations of
terrestrial portions of the APE at the former Naval Hospital property, the Rhode Island SHPO noted that
offshore land off of the former Naval Hospital property had not been surveyed as part of this study and
indicated that offshore land off of the former Naval Hospital property will need to be surveyed to
determine if currently unknown significant sites are present. The Rhode Island SHPO also indicated that
an evaluation of preservation or mitigation options for the known shipwreck site (RI-2125), a possible
Revolutionary War era transport vessel, must be conducted before the off-shore land is disposed of by the
Navy (Sanderson 2013b).

6.9.2

Architectural Resources

As a result of the Navy’s cultural resources survey of U.S. Naval Complex Newport in 1998, the U.S.
Naval Hospital Newport Historic District was recommended NRHP-eligible under Criterion C. The
original permanent buildings of the Newport Naval Hospital were largely intact and, as a group,
represented the Navy’s plan for hospital construction just prior to World War I. As such, the district was
considered representative of the theme of architecture and engineering of twentieth century military
buildings. Although alterations and additions had diminished the integrity of some of the buildings,
collectively they were still able to clearly portray the distinctive characteristics of their type and time
(Louis Berger and Associates, Inc. 1998). The Rhode Island SHPO concurred with the eligibility
recommendations for the U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District (U.S. Department of the Navy
2010a).
The 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update conducted for the proposed action confirmed that the
U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District has retained its integrity since the previous NRHPeligibility evaluation in 1998 and remains eligible for the NRHP in the areas of Health/Medicine,

Draft EIS

Architecture, and Military under Criteria A and C. Additionally, the boundaries of the historic district
have been expanded to include the Pier (Structure 71) and the period of significance has been revised to
begin in 1913 and end in 1942 (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014). With the results of the 2013 architectural
survey and evaluation, a total of 16 elements of the NRHP-eligible U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic
District have been identified (nine contributing elements and six non-contributing elements). Nine of the
16 elements are within the APE at the former Naval Hospital property, including five that are contributing
elements of the historic district and four that are non-contributing elements (see Table 6.9-1 and Figure
6.9-1). The Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the evaluation of the buildings and
structures within the APE at the former Naval Hospital property for NRHP-eligibility and the Rhode
Island SHPO concurred that these buildings and structures were NRHP-eligible (Lin 2013; Sanderson
2013b).

Native American Resources

The Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian tribes regarding Native American
resources within the APE at the former Naval Hospital property: the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the
Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for
copies of consultation letters). Consultation remains open.

6.9.4

NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties

The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation and the 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update
conducted for the proposed action resulted in the identification of a portion of one historic property that is
located within the APE at the former Naval Hospital property. This historic property is the NRHPeligible U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District. The Navy has determined that the previously
identified U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District remains NRHP-eligible under Criteria A and C
and as a result of the 2013 architectural survey and evaluation, expanded the boundaries of the district to
include the pier (Pier 71) and revised the period of significance to between 1913 and 1942. With these
changes, the historic district would comprise 16 elements (nine contributing and seven non-contributing
elements). The APE at the former Naval Hospital property overlaps a portion of the historic district. As
discussed in Section 6.9. 2 and summarized in Table 6-9.1, nine of the 16 elements of the historic district
are also in the APE for the proposed action at the former Naval Hospital property: five contributing
elements (Buildings 1, 7, and 45; Pier 71; and Quarters A and B) and four non-contributing elements
(Buildings 63, 993, the gate house, and the retaining wall).
The Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the identification of historic properties for the
proposed action at the former Naval Hospital property (Lin 2013). The Rhode Island SHPO concurred
with the identification of historic properties within the APE for the proposed action at the former Naval
Hospital property (Sanderson 2013b).

Former Naval Hospital Property

6.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the existing topography, geology, and soil conditions at the former Naval
Hospital property. This section also includes a discussion of existing conditions for bathymetry and
marine sediment in Narragansett Bay off-shore of the former Naval Hospital property.

6.10.1

Topography

The former Naval Hospital property topography is relatively flat. Elevations range from approximately
20 feet amsl at its eastern land boundary to sea level at the western land boundary. From the western land
boundary, the site extends into Coasters Harbor (part of Narragansett Bay, approximately 550 feet west).

6.10.2

Geology

The former Naval Hospital property lies within the New England Physiographic Province (USGS 2002).
The site is located on the Rhode Island Formation of the stratified Narragansett Bay Group of the
Pennsylvanian period (323 to 290 million years ago). The Narragansett Bay Group rocks are part of the
Esmond-Dedham subterrane of the Southeastern New England Avalon zone. The Esmond-Dedham
Subterrane Narragansett Bay Group is deposited upon older rocks of both West Bay and East Bay parts of
the Esmond-Dedham subterrane. The Narragansett Bay Group – Rhode Island Formation consists of
meta-sandstone, meta-conglomerate, schist, carbonaceous schist, and graphite. Plant fossils are common
(USGS 2013).
The former Naval Hospital is not near any known fault locations (USGS 2005). According to the USGS,
only one earthquake has ever been recorded as possibly being centered in the State of Rhode Island. This
earthquake was recorded on February 27, 1883 (USGS 2009). No other earthquakes have been recorded
in the state. The former Naval Hospital property is located in an earthquake zone where in a 50-year
period, there is only a 2 percent chance of an earthquake occurring with a peak acceleration (ground
movement) of 8 percent to 10 percent acceleration due to gravity (%g). Because it takes a peak
acceleration of 10%g to cause damage to buildings, there is minimal risk of an earthquake that would
cause damage to the former Naval Hospital property (USGS 2009).

6.10.3

Soils

6.10.3.1 Soil Types
The soil type present on the former Naval Hospital property is the Newport-Urban land complex (see
Table 6.10-1 and Figure 6.10-1). The remaining portion of the site is water.

Newport-Urban Land Complex (NP)
Newport-Urban land complex consists of well-drained Newport soils and areas of urban land. The main
limitation of the Newport soils for development is the slow or very slow permeability in the substratum.
Roads and streets require special design to prevent frost heaving (USDA 1981).
6.10.3.2 Soil Characteristics and Limitations
As indicated in Section 3.10, the USDA rates soils according to characteristics that could limit
development. These characteristics include:

Draft EIS

6-35

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

•

Erosion Potential. The soil erosion potential for the Newport-Urban land complex is
moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at a depth of 24" to 30", which means the
soils are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff (USDA
2012; IWR 2002).

•

Hydric Soils. Newport-Urban land complex soils are listed as dominantly non-hydric,
although non-hydric soil can contain hydric inclusions (USDA 2012).

•

Constructability. There are moderate constraints on development on Newport-Urban
land complex soils and a few restrictions on residential or commercial development if onsite septic tanks are to be used. The more common sources of constructability limitations
for the soils include shallow excavations (slight limitations due to dense to very dense
soils), moderate frost action, and a moderate slope. The moderate slope and moderate
frost action is unfavorable, but limitations can be overcome or minimized by special
planning or design. These soils are dense to very dense, which makes excavation
difficult; however, there is a low shrink-swell potential (USDA 1981; USDA 2012).

6.10.3.3 Farmland Soils
Soils on the former Naval Hospital property are not rated for farmland uses (USDA 2012).

6.10.4

Bathymetry

The bathymetric contours for the Narragansett Bay offshore of the former Naval Hospital property range
from 0 to 20 feet and from 20 to 40 feet (see Figure 6.10-2).

6.10.5

Marine Sediment

Eleven sediment types have been identified in Narragansett Bay, ranging from clayey silt to coarse gravel
(NBNERR 2009 [see Figure 6.10-3]). The distribution of these sediment types depends on two key
factors: currents and circulation patterns. These factors generally result in finer grained materials such as
sand-silt-clay and clayey silt being located in the middle and upper portions of the Bay and in protected
coves and harbors. Coarser sediments, mostly sandy, are found in the lower reaches of the Bay and in
constricted areas. The most prevalent sediment types found in Narragansett Bay are clay-silt and sandsilt-clay sediments (Raposa n.d.).
Offshore of the former Naval Hospital property, within approximately 0.1 mile of the shoreline, marine
sediment types are largely unsampled (see Figure 6.10-3). Farther out, the dominant sediment type is
clay-silt (Raposa n.d.).

6.11 Water Resources

The following sections summarize the existing conditions and physical characteristics of water resources
found on and in the vicinity of the former Naval Hospital property.

6.11.1

Surface Water

No surface freshwaters exist on the former Naval Hospital property other than Narragansett Bay. The
waters offshore of the former Naval Hospital property are also classified by the CRMC as a Type 4
Water: Multipurpose Waters (see Section 6.1.4).

Former Naval Hospital Property

Narragansett Bay has a mean depth of 27 feet and the mean tidal range at Newport is 3.5 feet, with
extremes ranging to 7.5 feet (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2001). Offshore of the former Naval Hospital
property, depth to bottom ranges between 0 and 40 feet (see Section 6.10.4 for additional discussion of
Narragansett Bay).
The former Naval Hospital property is located in the Lower East Passage subwatershed (HUC
010900040909) of the Narragansett Bay watershed. Developed land (residential, commercial, and
industrial) comprises the largest land use within the watershed—approximately 16.8 percent of the total
watershed—followed by forested land, which is approximately 15 percent of the land use (University of
Rhode Island Environmental Data Center 2013b).

6.11.2

Water Quality

Narragansett Bay is classified as an SB water by the RIDEM in the RIDEM Water Quality Regulations.
As defined in Section 3.11, Class SB waters are designated for primary and secondary contact
recreational activities, shellfish harvesting for controlled relay and depuration, and fish and wildlife
habitat.
The section of Narragansett Bay next to the former Naval Hospital property is not listed as impaired by
the RIDEM on the State of Rhode Island 2012 303(d) List – List of Impaired Waters; however, the section
of Newport Harbor/Coddington Cove located north of the Training Station Road bridge in Newport does
not support the fish and wildlife habitat designated use because sediments in that area require monitoring
(RIDEM 2012a) (see Section 4.11.2 for additional discussion regarding the overall water quality of
Narragansett Bay).

6.11.3

Groundwater

Groundwater in the east bay section of Rhode Island is generally provided by aquifers in till and bedrock.
Groundwater resources at NAVSTA Newport can be found at relatively shallow depths due to the low
elevation of the installation relative to sea level (NAVFAC Engineering Field Activity Northeast 2006).
Depth to the water table in the primary soil type at the surplus property (Newport-Urban land) is less than
6 feet (University of Rhode Island Cooperative Extension and Rhode Island Health Source Water
Assessment Program 2003). The groundwater is susceptible to saltwater intrusion because of its
proximity to sea level (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Groundwater in the vicinity of the former Naval Hospital property is classified by the RIDEM as GB
(RIDEM 2010d). As described in Section 3.11 of this EIS, GB groundwater resources are designated as
known to be or presumed to be unsuitable for drinking water use without treatment. No wellhead
protection areas exist around the former Naval Hospital property; the closest wellhead protection area is
located approximately 1.8 miles to the east (RIDEM 2010d).

6.11.4

Floodplains

Areas in the 100-year floodplain have been mapped by FEMA. Approximately 2 acres of FEMAdelineated floodplains exist on the western portion of the former Naval Hospital property, along
Narragansett Bay (see Figure 6.11-1). During a 100-year storm, flooding may be expected to inundate
extensive areas between the Newport-Pell Bridge and upland areas on Coddington Point, leaving only
isolated upland areas on Coasters Harbor Island and areas along Third Street north of Gate 10 unflooded
(Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).

6.11.5

Wetlands

The former Naval Hospital property has one linear estuarine and marine wetland located on the site (see
Figure 6.11-2). It is associated with the coastline along Narragansett Bay and is approximately 0.2 acres.
This wetland is discussed in more detail in Section 6.12.1

6.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the existing vegetation and wildlife, including threatened and endangered
species and significant wildlife habitat, at the former Naval Hospital property.

6.12.1

Vegetation

The former Naval Hospital property is highly developed with buildings and impervious surfaces.
Vegetation is limited primarily to maintained grass and several trees. As indicated in Table 6.12-1, more
than 40 percent of the property at the former Naval Hospital is developed, while the remaining areas
comprise upland (13 percent), open water (45 percent), wetland marine/estuarine (2 percent) and beach
(0.5 percent).

Open Water
The former Naval Hospital property abuts Narragansett Bay. The land offshore of the property is under
the control of the CRMC, although the Navy maintains offshore riparian rights to 6.9 acres, which
provides the Navy the right of access to use Narragansett Bay offshore of the former Naval Hospital
property. These 6.9 acres are open water habitat, characteristically subtidal sand with the benthos defined
as a dredged channel. The most common vegetation found in the open water in Narragansett Bay is
phytoplankton, which nourishes all other life in the bay. The open water area south of Coddington Point
is mapped as a macroalgal bed (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2001). Shoreline and aquatic habitat typical of
this region include eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) (NBNERR 2009).
Neither of these types of SAV occur at the former Naval Hospital property.
Marine/Estuarine Wetland
The former Naval Hospital property hosts approximately 0.2 acres of marine/estuarine wetland (see
Figure 6.11-2). Low marsh vegetation in estuarine wetlands is dominated by tall smooth cordgrass
(Spartina alterniflora) (NBNERR 2009). Cordgrass is shorter along the high-tide line and is a high marsh
species like the following: spike grass (Distichlis spicata), glassworts (Salicornia spp.), sea lavender
(Limonium nashii), salt marsh aster (Aster tenuifolius), black grass (Juncus gerardii), and hightide bush
(Iva frutescens). Much of the vegetation in this habitat cover breaks down to create a decomposing plant
material called detritus. Detritus is a critical component in the health of wildlife found in these wetlands
(NBNERR 2009).

Former Naval Hospital Property

Beach
A small portion of the former Naval Hospital property, approximately 0.08 acres, is sandy beach (see
Figure 6.12-1). Little vegetation is present in this habitat. The vegetation that does occur is along the
upper edges of the beach where tidal influence is limited and consists of a variety of herbaceous plants,
mostly nonnative (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2001). Vegetation in this area is subject to harsh extremes of
temperature, salinity, desiccation, and wave action (NBNERR 2009).

6.12.2

Wildlife

The potential for the presence of wildlife species on the former Naval Hospital property is limited because
of the predominance of maintained grass and impervious surfaces.
Terrestrial Mammals
Mammals occurring at the former Naval Hospital property are limited to species adapted to
urban/suburban conditions such as the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), common raccoon
(Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Small
mammals such as the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), and woodchuck also are likely to be
present (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
Marine Mammals
Harbor seals are frequently found at Coddington Cove, north of the former Naval Hospital property, and
could potentially be found along other areas of the installation (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). Harbor seals
make use of seaweed covered and rocky-ledged haul-out sites for resting, mating, and protection. There
are no haul-outs at the former Naval Hospital property, but harbor seals and other marine mammals still
have the potential to occupy the property (see Section 3.12.1.2 for discussion of marine mammals likely
to occur at the former Naval Hospital property). Reports of harbor porpoises also have been documented
in the winter in Coddington Cove.
Herpetofauna
The herpetofauna common to Rhode Island are not likely to be present at the former Naval Hospital
property because of the lack of ponds, forested/shrubland wetlands, and woodland ponds, the preferred
habitat for such species.
Benthos
Benthic species likely to occur in the open water and tidal flat areas of the surplus areas, including the
former Naval Hospital property, include annelids (Phylum Annelida), nematodes (Phylum Nematoda),
gastropods (Class Gastropoda), bivalves (Class Bivalvia), and mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) (Frithsen
1989).
Avian Species
A discussion of avian species common to the areas around the surplus properties, including the former
Naval Hospital property and respective nearby IBAs is provided in Section 3.12.1.2.
Finfish
An ichthyoplanktonic survey of fish species likely to occur in Narragansett Bay was conducted by the
Narragansett Bay Project from November 1989 to November 1990 (Keller et al. 1999). The results of this
survey are provided in Table 6.12-2.

Former Naval Hospital Property

Shellfish and Crustacea
As indicated in Section 3.12.1.2, species typical of Narragansett Bay include quahog, soft-shelled clam,
mussel, American lobster, and squid. All of these species are harvested from the Bay. These species
could occur off shore of the former Naval Hospital property (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2014).

6.12.3

Threatened and Endangered Species

As indicated in Section 3.12.2, agency-review letters were sent to the USFWS, NMFS, and RIDEM in
order to obtain updated information regarding listed species. A response from the USFWS received on
February 13, 2013, indicated that no federally listed or proposed threatened or endangered species or
critical habitat within its jurisdiction are known to occur on the former Naval Hospital property (Chapman
2013). Subsequent to this correspondence, the northern long-eared bat was listed as a threatened species
and is discussed below. Also, a response from RIDEM received on February 12, 2013 indicated that no
state-listed or candidate rare, threatened, or endangered species are located at the former Naval Hospital
property (Jordan 2013). The American oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is a state-protected avian
species that has been observed on NAVSTA Newport, although no nests have ever been found. The
glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), a state-listed species of concern, has also been observed at NAVSTA
Newport. The 2014 INRMP indicates observations of both species at the former Naval Hospital property
(Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
NMFS stated that certain New England coastal waters support various listed species under its jurisdiction,
including whales, sea turtles, and five DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus)
(Colligan 2013) (Table 6.12-3).

The NMFS also indicated the potential occurrence of two listed whales in the waters off of Rhode Island:
the federally listed as endangered North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) (from December 1 –
June 30) and the federally listed as endangered humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) (from March
15 – November 30). Three additional whales were also noted as occurring in New England: the fin whale
(Balaenoptera physalus); sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis); and sperm whale (Physter macrocephalus).

But because of their preference for deeper water depths and the near-shore location of the proposed
action, these species were deemed unlikely to exist in the vicinity of the project area (Colligan 2013).
Sea turtles potentially occurring in northeastern New England, and potentially in Narragansett Bay, are
typically small juveniles. NMFS identified sea turtle species potentially occurring in New England
waters as the federally listed as endangered leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) and Kemp’s ridley
(Lepidochelys kempi). The federally listed as threatened green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) has the
potential to occur sporadically in New England waters, but its occurrence is rare. The federally listed
threatened Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) was also referenced by NMFS as
potentially occurring in Narragansett Bay and potentially originating from the endangered New York
Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South Atlantic, or Carolina DPSs, or the threatened Gulf of Maine DPS. Two
federal species of concern, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), also
have been identified as potentially occurring near the project area (Colligan 2013). However, in August
2013, the NMFS determined that these two species were not warranted for listing as threatened under the
ESA.
Following Navy’s initial informal consultation with the USFWS, the northern long-eared bat was listed as
a threatened species, as discussed in Section 3.12.1.3. The northern long-eared bat is a migratory bat that
is found in the U.S. from Maine to North Carolina on the Atlantic Coast, westward to eastern Oklahoma
and north through the Dakotas, and into eastern Montana and Wyoming (USFWS 2014a). Historically,
this species has been documented as common throughout its range and has not been considered at risk in
the U.S. The USFWS listed the northern long-eared bat as federally threatened based on the species’ risk
of extinction predominantly due to the threat of white-nose syndrome, which is a fungal infection that is
decimating certain bat species. Northern long-eared bat numbers have declined by 99 percent in the
northeast due to white-nose syndrome (USFWS 2013b). Additional threats to the northern long-eared bat
include destruction or degradation of habitat and hibernacula (USFWS 2013a).
The Navy conducted various passive acoustic monitoring surveys for bats between 2009 and 2013 at
NAVSTA Newport in support of a proposed 20-megawatt wind energy facility within the NAVSTA
Newport installation. The general survey areas were coastal areas at the southern end of the station (such
as the Bishop Rock peninsula and a coastal met tower) and Tank Farms 4 and 5. Results for northern
long-eared bats are summarized in Table 6.12-4. The 2009 and 2010 surveys did not report results for
northern long-eared bats, which was not a named species for those surveys. During a survey conducted in
the spring and late summer of 2011, northern long-eared bats were detected at two of the three locations
monitored: the coastal met tower and a 1.5-meter-high stake at Tank Farm 4. The third survey location
used in 2011 consisted of a met tower at Tank Farm 4, at which the northern long-eared bat was not
detected (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2011c). Fifteen northern long-eared bat calls were reported for the 2013
survey: three calls at Bishop Rock peninsula, two calls at a stake location at Tank Farm 4, five calls at a
stream location at Tank Farm 4, and five calls at a wetland location at Tank Farm 5 (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014b, 2014c). The Bishop Rock peninsula is the closest monitoring location to the former Naval
Hospital property, located approximately 1.1 miles to the northwest. No monitoring was conducted in
2012 (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014b). Of the 8,826 total call sequences reported at NAVSTA Newport from the
passive acoustic monitoring conducted for bats from 2009 to 2013, 73 calls were documented as nonspecific Myotis species calls, and 1,397 were documented as “unknown high-frequency” calls, which can
be attributable to Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014c).
Active acoustic monitoring for bats was conducted in summer 2013 along transects in the same general
areas of the station—coastal areas at the southern end of the station and Tank Farms 4 and 5. Northern
long-eared bat calls were not specifically reported as a result of the active acoustic monitoring. The Navy
conducted mist netting for bats over seven nights in July 2013 at various locations; however, the closest
location to the former Naval Hospital was over three miles to the northeast. Few bats were caught, and

none were northern long-eared bats; therefore, radiotelemetry has not been performed for northern longeared bats. Echolocation bat passes that were documented in conjunction with the mist-netting survey did
not attribute any of the passes to the genus Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014b).

The former Naval Hospital property is primarily developed land, with areas of maintained lawn and
scattered trees. These trees do not meet the characteristics of northern long-eared bat roosting trees, as
described in Section 6.12.3.2. Additionally, the scattered trees on the former Naval Hospital property are
located more than 1,000 feet from a forest stand. USFWS Interim Guidance for northern long-eared bat
indicates that individual trees that are more than 1,000 feet from other forested habitats are not considered
suitable roost trees (USFWS 2014b). Developed land on and off-base dominates the land use within the
1,000 ft-radius around the former Naval Hospital property, and the coastline is largely comprised of
developed areas with maintained grass up to the water’s edge, further excluding the potential for suitable
habitat in proximity to the former Naval Hospital property.
The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding the potential presence of the northern long-eared bat at the
surplus properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston 2015a). The Navy received a response from the USFWS via
electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal consultation and provide additional information
about the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015).
The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b), To date,
USFWS has not provided a response, and informal consultation with the USFWS on the potential effects
of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat is ongoing.

Significant Wildlife Habitat

The RIDEM Division of Planning and Development’s review of the Rhode Island Natural Heritage
Program database indicated that no unique natural communities or other significant wildlife communities
exist at or near the surplus property (Jordan 2013).
Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
No eelgrass habitat exists at the former Naval Hospital property according to the RIDEM, Narragansett
Bay Estuary Program, and RI CRMC (2003) and Applied Science Associates (2011) data.
Wetlands
Approximately 0.2 acres of marine/estuarine wetlands are associated with the former Naval Hospital
property. These wetlands provide one of the few areas for potential cover, nesting, and feeding
opportunities for wildlife. (See Section 6.12.1 for further discussion.)
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at the former Naval Hospital property.
Essential Fish Habitat
As indicated in Section 3.12.2, agency consultation with the NMFS was completed during the scoping
phase of the EIS to assist in identifying species of EFH in Narragansett Bay. As identified in Table
6.12-5, the waters off the coast of the former Naval Hospital property are designated EFH for Atlantic sea
herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), haddock (Melanogrammus
aeglefinus), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), Spanish
mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), red hake (Urophycis chuss), cobia (Rachycentron canadum),

7 Former Naval Hospital Environmental Consequences
7.1

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section describes the potential land use impacts resulting from disposal and reuse of the former
Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an
examination of site-specific land use, direct and indirect 12 impacts on surrounding existing land uses,
consistency with local zoning and land use plans, and consistency with the enforceable policies of the RI
CRMP. The study area includes the former Naval Hospital and land within 0.25 miles in the City of
Newport.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, the former Naval
Hospital property would be under the jurisdiction of the City of Newport. The use of the land and the
development of new buildings or structures on the site would be regulated by the City of Newport, the
city’s zoning code, and other applicable plans and regulations.

7.1.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.1.1.1
On-Site Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would change the use of the former Naval Hospital property from a
vacant, institutional (e.g., hospital) land use to a mixture of commercial, residential, and recreational land
uses (see Figure 7.1-1). A total of 4.5 acres (54 percent of the property) would be developed, including
land-based and in-water activities (construction of floating piers), while 1.8 acres (46 percent of the
property) would be maintained as open space. As a comparison, in its existing condition, 52 percent of the
property is developed and 48 percent is open space.
Existing structures on-site, including the main hospital building and five administrative or storage
buildings, would be demolished. The upland portion of the site would be redeveloped with a three-story
hotel (120 rooms) with retail and restaurant space on the first floor (1.3 acres), a three-story residential
building with 36 two-bedroom units (0.6 acres), and parking and roadway access (2.2 acres). The
shoreline and open water would be primarily maintained as open space and natural areas associated with
the waterfront park. The waterfront park would include a pier, pedestrian path, water taxi dockage, a
1,300-square-foot boat storage facility and two new concrete floating docks, which would be constructed
on either side of the existing pier. The existing pier would be reused in its current condition.
Therefore, Alternative 1 would impact the existing land use conditions at the site. These impacts would
result from demolition of the existing buildings, replacement of the existing institutional land use with the
mixture of the new land uses identified above, and creation of additional open space; these impacts would
be considered moderate. Implementation of Alternative 1 also would result in open public access to the
formerly restricted military property.
7.1.1.2
Surrounding Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would introduce a new mixed-use area to the study area, which primarily
includes institutional (Navy) land, roads, and open space associated with the Pell Bridge interchange, and
high-density residential land use. The waterfront park use proposed under Alternative 1 would be similar
to and consistent with these surrounding land uses. Redevelopment of a portion of the property with a
multi-family residential building and a hotel would introduce new types of land use into the study area
12

Indirect impacts on surrounding land uses are based on the potential for the proposed action to generate changes
in the land use type, pattern, or density.

Draft EIS

7-1

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

and a more dense residential land use but, because the proposed redevelopment would be contained
entirely within the site boundaries, there would be no direct impacts on surrounding land uses, which are
predominantly residential on the south and east sides. However, adjacent land uses may be indirectly
impacted by increased traffic associated with the change to mixed uses at the property that was previously
vacant. Access to the site would be provided off of Third Street and would require the creation of new
access points. Cypress Street could serve as an additional potential access point. Third Street currently
provides access to nearby Navy facilities and other institutional land uses. Therefore, creating new access
points to a more populated land use such as the proposed hotel and multi-family residential building
would have a moderate, long-term impact on the adjacent land uses and adjacent roadways. Indirect
impacts on the surrounding transportation network are discussed in Section 7.4.
While the residential and park uses proposed under Alternative 1 would be consistent with surrounding
land uses, the city’s zoning code currently does not allow hotels in any high-density or medium-density
residential districts. A hotel would introduce a larger-scale building and additional people and vehicle
traffic into the study area.
Mixed-use redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property could result in growth-induced changes
in land use on other undeveloped or vacant properties in the vicinity. Because the surrounding area is
largely built-out, these growth-induced impacts are likely to be limited. Open space in the study area
consists primarily of lawns in surrounding residential neighborhoods and undeveloped ROWs associated
with the Pell Bridge interchange. Therefore, any additional development in the study area would occur as
infill redevelopment of existing property or development of the limited open space around the Pell Bridge
interchange. The City of Newport considers redevelopment of the Pell Bridge interchange area following
the planned reconfiguration of the interchange in the 2006 North End Master Plan (City of Newport
2006). The city received funding in early 2012 to continue the planning assessment for future
development in the area of the former Naval Hospital property and the Pell Bridge interchange (Rhode
Island Office of the Governor 2012). Reconfiguration of the interchange could provide the city
opportunities to create new parcels for redevelopment, and any redevelopment of these parcels would be
undertaken in conjunction with redevelopment and reuse of the former Naval Hospital property, as
indicated by the continuing planning efforts. Thus, implementation of Alternative 1 could influence the
type and scale of redevelopment of vacant parcels in the study area and, therefore, would have moderate,
indirect impacts on land use.
Local sensitivity to Alternative 1 at the former Naval Hospital property, although limited, was
documented during public outreach conducted during the development of the AIRPA’s Redevelopment
Plan. One comment was received at the final public hearing for the Redevelopment Plan on July 14, 2011
(RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). The commenter, an abutting property owner, expressed concerns
regarding existing traffic congestion and requested that the city address traffic concerns before
redeveloping the former Naval Hospital property (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). As noted, indirect
impacts on the surrounding transportation network resulting from the proposed action are discussed in
Section 7.4. It is expected that the final design of the redevelopment would include vegetation buffering
and other measures to minimize impacts from operation of the new buildings on adjacent properties.
7.1.1.3
Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
The former Naval Hospital property is located in the City of Newport’s Residential R-10 zoning district,
which is intended to include primarily medium-density residential development. The waterfront park
proposed under Alternative 1 would be consistent with this zoning designation. Multi-family residential
buildings are included as special uses in the R-10 zoning district and require special use permits from the
city’s zoning board of review. Any developer proposing to construct a multi-family residential building
on the site would be required to obtain a special use permit to ensure consistency with the zoning

ordinance. The proposed hotel would not conform to the zoning designation, which does not permit
hotels or commercial uses in this district. The Redevelopment Plan acknowledged this and indicated that
the proposed redevelopment at this site was based on the assumption that zoning would be modified to
enable the proposed uses (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). To permit the hotel proposed in the
Redevelopment Plan, the City of Newport would need to change the site’s zoning designation by rezoning
the area or revising the types of uses permitted in the Residential R-10 zoning district. Alternately, any
developer proposing to construct a hotel or commercial use on the site would be required to obtain a use
variance from the requirements of the zoning ordinance from the city’s zoning board of review.
Adherence to the city’s process for amending the zoning ordinance or obtaining a variance would ensure
consistency with the zoning ordinance.
Reflecting the existing zoning designation, future land use on the site is identified as “Medium Density
Residential” in the City of Newport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (City of Newport 2004). The
comprehensive land use plan notes that there are some multi-family residential land uses in mediumdensity residential zones, but, like the zoning ordinance, notes that commercial uses are not allowed. The
waterfront park and residential development proposed under Alternative 1 would be consistent with the
planned future land use, which largely reflects existing conditions in the city’s residential areas. The
proposed hotel and associated commercial uses would not be consistent with the planned future land use;
however, as discussed below, these uses would be consistent with the 2006 North End Master Plan.
As noted in Section 6.1.3, the city wants to redevelop surplus Navy properties with uses that are
compatible with surrounding land uses and meet the city’s economic and housing needs. As noted above
the proposed park and multi-family residential building would be compatible with surrounding land uses
in the study area but, based on the permitted land uses for medium- and high-density residential districts
included in the city’s zoning ordinance, the hotel would not be consistent. However, redevelopment of
the site with the mixture of commercial, residential, and recreational land uses would increase the city’s
tax base through increased property tax, hotel occupancy tax and, indirectly, through increases in sales tax
revenue. The commercial land uses proposed under Alternative 1 also would provide opportunities for
job creation. Through its potential to create tax revenue and jobs for the local community, Alternative 1
would be consistent with the economic goal of the comprehensive plan.
The City of Newport Comprehensive Land Use Plan notes a lack of affordable housing in the city: “[T]he
gap between the cost of housing and the income needed to purchase housing is greater in Newport than in
any other Rhode Island community except the east side of Providence” (City of Newport 2004).
Additionally, the number of Navy personnel and tourists or seasonal residents seeking rental housing in
the city contributes to high rental prices. The lack of available land for new residential construction
contributes to these issues. Alternative 1 would provide needed new housing. The city has implemented
various federal, state, and local programs to construct and maintain affordable housing. As of 2010, just
under 16 percent of the city’s housing stock was designated low and moderate income housing (City of
Newport Department of Planning and Development n.d.), which is higher than the state goal of 10 percent
laid out in the Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act (Rhode Island General Laws,
Section 45-53-3[4][i]). However, the AIRPA’s preferred redevelopment plan does not identify the
percentage of units in the proposed residential building, if any, that would be designated “affordable
housing” with appropriate price controls. Because the city currently exceeds the state goal for low- and
moderate-income housing, Alternative 1 would have no effect on the city’s affordable housing goals if the
residential units are priced at market rate. Including mixed-income housing in the residential building,
however, could provide additional support for these goals, as identified in the city’s comprehensive plan.
Because the Redevelopment Plan assumes the existing buildings and structures on the former Naval
Hospital property would be demolished under Alternative 1, this alternative would not be consistent with
the city’s goal, included in the comprehensive land use plan, of protecting Newport’s cultural resources.
Draft EIS

7-5

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Alternative 1 would have direct and indirect adverse effects on historic properties as discussed in Section
7.9.1.
The proposed redevelopment of the site under Alternative 1 would be consistent with the recommended
use of the site included in the city’s 2006 North End Master Plan. The master plan recommends
changing the zoning of the former Naval Hospital property to “Mixed-use District 2.” This proposed
district would allow land uses that include multi-family residential, transient guest facilities, private or
public marinas or yacht clubs, and parks. Alternative 1 would be consistent with the allowable uses in the
proposed zoning district. A development plan for the Innovation Hub area in the city’s North End is still
in progress. While the former Naval Hospital property is included in the Innovation Hub, potential
impacts on the city’s Innovation Hub concept as a result of implementation of Alternative 1 cannot be
determined at this time because specific development details and a timeline for development of the
Innovation Hub are not available.
Consistent with the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005), Alternative 1
would provide for economically beneficial, mixed-use redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital
property and public access to the shoreline on the property. While AIRPA’s preferred redevelopment
plan is not the “technology transfer center” proposed in the master plan, the preferred redevelopment plan
would support the goals of the master plan. And as noted above, Alternative 1 would be economically
beneficial, provide access to the waterfront, and provide facilities to support ferry or water shuttle service
at the property.
In summary, Alternative 1 would be consistent with the 2006 North End Master Plan and the Aquidneck
Island West Side Master Plan; it would not be consistent with the City of Newport Comprehensive Land
Use Plan, which does not provide for commercial uses of the land. Additionally, the proposed hotel and
commercial uses would not be consistent with the existing zoning. Some inconsistencies with local
planning would result, but mitigation in the form of rezoning by the City of Newport or obtaining a
variance by the development would reduce adverse impacts.
7.1.1.4
Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 1 is reasonably
likely to affect the use or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the property under
Alternative 1 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with
the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. However, redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital
property would not be a direct federal action and would, therefore, fall under the CRMC’s direct state
permitting authority under the Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal projects located within tidal waters,
on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area. Following disposal of the property, the
local entity implementing redevelopment would be responsible for completing the state permitting
process with the CRMC.
For purposes of analysis, consistency of the reuse of the former Naval Hospital property with the
applicable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP is summarized below. For
additional information see Appendix B.

The Navy informally consulted with the NMFS regarding designated EFH in
Narragansett Bay and has evaluated the effects of the proposed action on the 17 species
of EFH designated for the bay.
This evaluation has been completed in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act and, as a result of the evaluation the Navy has
determined environmental impacts from the proposed reconstruction of the piers will not
adversely affect designated EFH within Narragansett Bay. All impacts are expected to be
minor and short-term.
Thus, the redevelopment activities proposed for the former Naval Hospital property
would be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the abovementioned policies
of CRMP Section 200.4(C).
•

Section 210.1. Coastal Beach - Under the proposed action, there would be no permanent
impact on existing beach habitat at the former Naval Hospital property. Temporary
disturbance of beach habitat could occur during construction of the floating docks, but
any areas disturbed by equipment staging or other activities will be restored following
completion of construction. Use of the waterfront portion of the property— currently a
mixture of beach, open space, and the pier— would not change. Future use would be a
waterfront park with the same elements. Before initiating any redevelopment activities,
the developer(s)/property owner would coordinate with the CRMC as part of the state
permitting process to obtain the appropriate approvals and authorizations; this review
process will ensure that construction will meet all current and applicable policies. Thus,
the proposed action would be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with CRMP
Section 210.1.

•

Section 210.3 Coastal Wetlands - The former Naval Hospital property includes
approximately 0.3 acres of marine/estuarine wetland; this area, adjacent to Type 4 waters,
has not been designated for preservation. The only redevelopment feature proposed to be
located within this wetland under Alternative 1 is a portion of one of the floating docks,
which would impact approximately 0.04 acres. Conservative estimates show that this
floating dock would need a corresponding 0.04 acres of fill in the form of the pilings to
be used to anchor the floating dock in place; however, final design would determine the
actual location of the piling(s).
Filling a coastal wetland requires a permit from the CRMC and a permit from the
USACE under Section 404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the developer
will be required to coordinate wetland mitigation plans with the USACE and the CRMC.
For the CRMC, filling in a coastal wetland located in a Type 4 water is considered an
alteration of a coastal wetland under Section 300.12 of the CRMC regulations and
requires a Category A assent. Section 300.12(F), Coastal Wetland Mitigation, outlines the
mitigation requirements for alterations to coastal wetlands.
The loss of wetlands would be mitigated through the state and federal permitting
processes. Therefore, the proposed action is consistent with these policies to the
maximum extent practicable.

environmental requirements will be addressed. Therefore, the proposed action is
consistent with these policies to the maximum extent practicable.
Aquidneck Island SAMP

Draft EIS

•

Section 130.2 Coastal Greenway - Redevelopment under Alternative 1 at the former
Naval Hospital property would enhance public access to the shoreline and would likely
be considered municipal projects not subject to Section 130.2. Nevertheless,
redevelopment would include either the establishment and maintenance of a coastal
greenway or the standards for setbacks and buffers stipulated in Sections 140 and 150 of
the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as stipulated in 130.2(c) of the Aquidneck Island SAMP.
With adherence to one of the two options, the future developer/property owner would be
in compliance with this policy. As such, the proposed action would be fully consistent
with this policy.

•

Section 130.8 Open Space and Public Access - The former Naval Hospital property
would be consistent with Coastal Policy 130.8 by creating both open space and public
access as part of the proposed action. This previously federally held property along
Narragansett Bay would be opened to the public and would include waterfront uses along
Narragansett Bay. Therefore, the proposed action would be fully consistent with this
policy.

•

Section 130.9 Visual Elements - The proposed action is based upon the Redevelopment
Plan developed by AIRPA, which targets specific types of development on each property
based on each site’s physical and environmental setting and location. The Plan, in
summary, is consistent with Coastal Policy 130.9 because reuse and redevelopment at the
former Naval Hospital property will restore and enhance visual quality in visually
degraded areas. The visual quality of the former Naval Hospital property would be
enhanced due to the creation of a waterfront park and coastal greenway. As such, the
proposed action would be fully consistent with this policy.

•

Section 150.1 Standards Applicable to the Entire Development – The
developer/property owner will be responsible during redevelopment of the former Naval
Hospital property for providing separate and appropriate environmental documentation
and obtaining all the necessary permits from state and federal agencies that meet the
applicable standards addressing areas such as storm water management (i.e., Rhode
Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual and CRMP 300.6),
groundwater protection, infrastructure, vegetation cover (i.e., Section 150.1 Standards
Applicable to Entire Development), SAV, open space, public access (i.e., CRMP Section
335. Protection and Enhancement of Public Access to the Shore and Aquidneck Island
SAMP Section 150.5 Public Access Standards for all Coastal Greenways), construction
setback, and water quality associated with the proposed activity (i.e., Water Quality
Certificate from RIDEM and USACE permit, concurrent with their application to
CRMC). Therefore, the proposed action would be consistent with these standards to the
maximum extent practicable.

•

Section 170 Redevelopment Zone - The Aquidneck Island SAMP recognizes the
importance of the coastal zone for meeting several public needs, provides guidance for
striking a balance among the various uses that afford the public maximum benefit, seeks
harmony rather than conflict among these uses, and regulates the balance among the
competing uses of the state's coastal resources. Therefore, reuse and redevelopment of
the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1 will be required to provide public
access along the shoreline in accordance with Aquidneck Island SAMP Section 170.2.
7-8

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Pursuant to Section 170.3 Standards, applicants in the redevelopment zone may choose
between setback and buffer requirements set forth in CRMP Sections 140 and 150 or a
coastal greenway 50 feet wide that includes a public access path, as described in the
Aquidneck Island SAMP. Reuse and redevelopment also will be required to meet either
the optional development standards included in Section 170.3 of the SAMP or meet the
setback and buffer requirements in Rhode Island CRMP Sections 140 and 150, as
discussed above. The former Naval Hospital property would include a waterfront park
spanning the extent of the property along the Narragansett Bay, with a public pathway.
This waterfront park is assumed to meet the requirements of SAMP Sections 140 and
150. Therefore, the proposed action would be consistent with this policy to the maximum
extent practicable.
Official consultation with the Rhode Island CRMC was initiated on February 11, 2014 with a letter
outlining the Navy’s CCD. The CRMC concurred with the Navy’s determination that disposal of the
surplus property under Alternative 1 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the RI CRMP and that the developer of the former Naval Hospital property would
be required to comply with the applicable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP
(Willis 2014). A copy of the letter is included in Appendix B.

7.1.2

Alternative 2

7.1.2.1
On-Site Land Use
Alternative 2 plans for a higher density of mixed-use redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital
property (see Figure 7.1-2). A total of 4.8 acres (58 percent of the property) would be developed under
Alternative 2, which would be 4 percent larger than the area that would be developed under Alternative 1
and 6 percent larger than existing conditions. Under Alternative 2, a commercial use would replace the
residential use proposed under Alternative 1, and a conference center would be developed adjacent to the
proposed hotel. The commercial use would occupy the same 0.6-acre footprint that would be occupied by
the residential land use under Alternative 1. The conference center would be constructed on 0.2 acres
behind the hotel along Third Street. The same facilities at the waterfront park proposed under Alternative
1 would be developed under Alternative 2. Additional development at the waterfront park under
Alternative 2 would include a third concrete floating dock, which would be constructed at the end of the
existing pier, and a yacht club/office. The yacht club/office would be constructed next to the boat storage
facility within the footprint of the former chapel. Impacts on on-site land use under Alternative 2 would
be slightly greater, given the larger area that would be redeveloped and the higher density of
development. While implementation of Alternative 2 would result in additional open space on the
property, compared with existing conditions, less open space would be created under this alternative than
under Alternative 1.
Therefore, Alternative 2 would impact the existing land uses at the site. These impacts would result from
demolition of the existing buildings, replacement of the existing institutional land use with the mixture of
the new land uses identified above, and creation of additional open space; these impacts would be
considered moderate. Implementation of Alternative 2 also would result in opening public access to the
formerly restricted military property.
7.1.2.2
Surrounding Land Use
Like Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would introduce a new mixed-use area to the study area. The waterfront
park would be similar to and consistent with these surrounding land uses; however, redevelopment of a
portion of the property with a hotel and conference center and a commercial use would introduce new
types of land uses into the study area. The conference center and commercial use proposed under

Draft EIS

7-9

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Alternative 2 would increase the number of people who could potentially use the site, with associated
increases in traffic and parking needs, compared with Alternative 1. Because the proposed redevelopment
would be contained entirely within the site boundaries, there would be no direct impacts on surrounding
land uses. However, adjacent land uses may be indirectly impacted by increased traffic associated with
the change to mixed uses at property that had been vacant. Like Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would
require construction of new access points on Third Street, which would have a minor, long-term impact
on the adjacent land uses and roadways.
Similar to Alternative 1, the waterfront park proposed under Alternative 2 would be consistent with
surrounding land uses in the study area. As noted, the city’s zoning code does not allow hotels or
commercial uses in any high-density or medium-density residential districts. The hotel and conference
center and commercial use proposed under Alternative 2 would introduce larger-scale buildings and
additional people and vehicle traffic in the study area. Implementation of Alternative 2 could influence
the type and scale of redevelopment of vacant parcels in the study area, as discussed under Alternative 1.
Therefore, Alternative 2 also would have moderate, indirect impacts on land use. It is expected that the
final design of the redevelopment would include vegetation buffering and other measures to minimize
impacts from operation of the new buildings on adjacent properties. Alternative 2 may generate concerns
regarding traffic similar to those expressed at the public hearing for AIRPA’s Redevelopment Plan,
described in Section 7.1.1.2. Section 7.4 discusses indirect impacts on the surrounding transportation
network resulting from the proposed action.
7.1.2.3
Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
Under Alternative 2, the waterfront park would be consistent with the city’s Residential R-10 zoning
district. The proposed hotel and conference center and commercial use, however, would not be consistent
with the existing zoning of the site, which does not permit hotels or commercial uses, as noted in the
Redevelopment Plan. In order to redevelop the site as proposed under Alternative 2, the city would need
to change the site’s zoning designation, or developers proposing to construct nonconforming uses on the
site would need to obtain a use variance from the city’s zoning board of review, as noted under
Alternative 1. Adherence to the city’s process for amending the zoning ordinance or obtaining a variance
would ensure consistency with the zoning ordinance under Alternative 2.
The hotel and commercial uses proposed under Alternative 2 would not be consistent with the future
medium-density residential land use designation for the site, which reflects the existing residential land
uses around the site, included in the City of Newport Comprehensive Land Use Plan. As noted under
Alternative 1, the waterfront park would be consistent with the planned future land use. Alternative 2
would be consistent with the comprehensive land use plan’s goals for redevelopment of surplus Navy
properties with economically beneficial land uses. However, the proposed hotel and commercial uses
under Alternative 2 would not be compatible with surrounding land uses, based on the permitted land uses
in the city’s medium- and high-density residential districts. Alternative 2 would not provide any new
housing stock for the city. While Alternative 2 would have no effect on the creation or maintenance of
affordable housing in the city, the potential benefits of developing housing on the site would not be
realized. Similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would not be consistent with the comprehensive land use
plan goal of protecting Newport’s cultural resources because the Redevelopment Plan assumed the
existing historic buildings on the site would be demolished. Alternative 2 would have direct and indirect
adverse effects on historic properties as discussed in Section 7.9.2.
Alternative 2 would not be consistent with the recommended use of the former Naval Hospital property
included in the 2006 North End Master Plan. While Alternative 2 would increase the city’s tax base,
provide opportunities for job creation, and allow public access to the shoreline, this alternative would not
include the housing recommended in the master plan. However, Alternative 2 would be consistent with

the “Mixed-use District 2” zoning designation proposed for the site in the master plan. As noted, a
development plan for the Innovation Hub area in the city’s North End is still in progress, and potential
impacts on the Innovation Hub concept as a result of implementation of Alternative 2 cannot be
determined at this time.
Alternative 2 would be consistent with the applicable goals of the Aquidneck Island West Side Master
Plan for the same reasons noted under Alternative 1.
In summary, Alternative 2 would be consistent with the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan; it
would not be consistent with the City of Newport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, which does not provide
for commercial uses of the land or the 2006 North End Master Plan because it does not include housing
as recommended in that plan. Additionally, the proposed hotel and commercial uses would not be
consistent with the existing zoning. Some inconsistencies with local planning would result, but mitigation
in the form of rezoning by the City of Newport or obtaining a variance by the development would reduce
adverse impacts.
7.1.2.4
Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 2 is reasonably
likely to affect the uses or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the surplus
property under Alternative 2 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent
practicable with the enforceable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. However,
redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital under Alternative 2 would not be a direct federal action and
would, therefore, fall under the CRMC’s direct state permitting authority under the Rhode Island CRMP
for non-federal projects located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot
contiguous area.
If Alternative 2 is selected, the Navy would be required to prepare a coastal zone consistency
determination for the proposed disposal and reuse of the property under Alternative 2 and submit it to the
Rhode Island CRMC for concurrence.
The enforceable policies of the RI CRMP and applicable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck
Island SAMP are outlined in Section 6.1.4. Due to the similarities in land use types proposed, and the
same geographic area of the proposed action under Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 1, consistency
of the proposed action on the use and natural resources of the coastal zone under Alternative 2 would be
similar to those under Alternative 1.

7.1.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, the surplus property at the former Naval Hospital property would be
retained by the U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur, and the
15.2-acre property would remain vacant and closed to public access. Implementation of the No Action
alternative would have no direct or indirect impacts on surrounding land uses. City zoning regulations
would not be enforceable since the property would continue to be owned by the federal government and
would be outside the jurisdiction of the City of Newport. This alternative would not be consistent overall
with the City of Newport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, the 2006 North End Master Plan, or the
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. These plans recommend redevelopment of the site with a
mixture of land uses that would provide economic benefits while maintaining public access to the city’s
shoreline. Under the No Action alternative, none of the potential economic benefits associated with
redevelopment of the site would be realized. Under this alternative, the historic buildings on the site
would not be demolished. However, the Navy would need to implement a plan to preserve the properties
to be consistent with any cultural resources requirements.

Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

A detailed discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental justice consequences associated with the
redevelopment of all four surplus properties, including the former Naval Hospital property under
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative) can be found in Section 5.2.1.
In summary, implementation of Alternative 1 is anticipated to have a beneficial economic impact on the
regional economy, a minor impact on local population and demographic characteristics, a minor impact
on the local housing and commercial property market, and a minor positive fiscal impact on the City of
Newport. In addition no disproportionate impacts on minority, Hispanic/Latino, low-income populations
or children are expected to occur under this alternative.

7.2.2

Alternative 2

A detailed discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental justice consequences associated with the
redevelopment of all four surplus properties, including the former Naval Hospital property under
Alternative 2 can be found in Section 5.2.2.
In summary, implementation of Alternative 2 is expected to have a beneficial economic impact on the
regional economy, no noticeable impact on local population and demographic characteristics, a minor
impact on the local housing and commercial property market, and a minor positive fiscal impact on the
City of Newport. In addition no disproportionate impacts on minority, Hispanic/Latino, low-income, or
children are expected to occur under this alternative.

7.2.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, no redevelopment plan would be implemented and ownership of the
properties would be retained by the Navy. The properties would not be developed and would remain in
caretaker status. No new economic activity would be generated and no increased employment
opportunities would occur. Regional population and the regional housing market would not be impacted,
nor would the regional commercial property market be impacted. Local government tax receipts would
not increase because the properties would retain their current tax-exempt status.

population or employment resulting from this alternative. In addition, no new recreational facilities
would be built.

7.4

Transportation

This section summarizes the potential transportation impacts resulting from construction and
implementation of the Redevelopment Plan at the former Naval Hospital under Alternative 1, Alternative
2, and the No Action alternative. The evaluation of transportation impacts upon full build-out is based on
the analysis completed for the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the
Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). Roadways and intersections evaluated in the vicinity of
the former Naval Hospital property include:
•

Third Street

•

Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road

•

Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road and Third Street/Third Street Extension
Intersection

Locations of these roadways and intersection are shown on Figure 6.4-1.
Traffic generated from construction was not captured in the traffic impact analysis. An evaluation of the
impacts on existing traffic conditions from the construction traffic is based on the number of buildings to
be demolished, the volume of construction vehicles and duration of demolition/construction at the former
Naval Hospital property.

7.4.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The former Naval Hospital property would continue to be accessed from Third Street under Alternative 1.
Three new driveways proposed would be accessed from Third Street between Cypress Street and Dorsey
Road (see Figure 7.4-1). The northernmost driveway is expected to provide entry access only directly to
the proposed hotel. Exit from the hotel would be from the center driveway. The southernmost driveway
is expected to provide access to and from the proposed residential building. Improvements would be
required at each site entrance to accommodate the new site and the potential traffic. In addition to the
three driveways discussed above, Cypress Street could serve as an additional potential access point
to/from the redeveloped site. There is an existing but unused and barricaded driveway along Cypress
Street at the intersection with Riggs Road. This potential access point was not assessed as part of the
traffic impact analysis as it was not depicted in the figures within the Redevelopment Plan.
Approximately 160 parking spaces would be needed to accommodate the hotel, residential units, and
park.
Construction-related traffic would consist of delivery trucks, dump trucks, heavy equipment, and vehicles
driven by construction crews. Based on the square footage of the proposed demolition/new construction,
an estimated 30 vehicle trips would occur per day for worker commutes, an estimated nine daily trips
would occur for demolition removal, and 4 delivery truck trips would occur per day (see Appendix D for
the methodology). This could result in short-term impacts on traffic from additional truck trips and
slower-moving vehicles. However, the impacts would not be significant as the impacts would occur for
the duration of the new construction period only. The period of new construction is estimated to be
approximately one year. Impacts are therefore expected to be minor.
The evaluation of impacts during the full build-out of the former Naval Hospital property includes a
discussion of projected traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS) and
recommended mitigation measures.

Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of Alternative 1 is projected to add 1,248 daily trips to the surrounding road network (Pare
Corporation 2013). This would result in a total of 91 vehicles entering and exiting the property during the
peak morning hour and 98 vehicles during the peak evening hour. The majority of trips would be
generated by the hotel; the waterfront park is expected to generate only a small number of trips. Table
7.4-1 shows the morning and evening peak hour trips for each proposed land use at the former Naval

2 Vehicle trips projected for use of the waterfront park did not include trips associated with the boat storage
facility or the expanded use of the pier (i.e., the addition of the floating piers).

Over the full build-out period, traffic volume in the area is projected to increase, such that the total
morning peak hour volume at the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third Street is expected to
increase by 286 trips under Alternative 1, compared with existing conditions. The full build-out period
takes into account a 1 percent annual background growth that is expected to occur through the year 2032.
Background growth is the growth expected within the study area based on development projects not
specifically identified as well as annual population and traffic increases. The evening peak hour volume is
expected to increase by 314 trips over existing conditions. Table 7.4-2 compares existing peak hour traffic
volumes at the Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third Street intersection and the projected vehicle trips for
each of the three driveways.

Former Naval Hospital Property

As discussed in Section 6.4, accident data from the City of Newport indicates that the majority of reported
accidents were rear-end collisions, which are typical at signalized intersections in urban areas (Pare
Corporation 2013). The highest number of accidents in the City of Newport occurred at the Route 138
eastbound exit ramp intersection with Admiral Kalbfus Road. The RIDOT recently configured
approaches to the rotary at the intersection of J.T. Connell Highway and Admiral Kalbfus Road, and
future improvements are planned as part of the Pell Bridge interchange project (Pare Corporation 2013).
The intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and Training Station Road is already signalized, and increased
traffic is not expected to pose a significant safety concern (Pare Corporation 2013).
The projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network surrounding the former
Naval Hospital property would result in a significant and unavoidable impact under Alternative 1.
7.4.1.2
Projected Level of Service
LOS under Alternative 1 was determined for the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station
Road and Third Street as well as the three proposed driveways into the property.
The intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road and Third Street currently operates at an
LOS of B, with approximately 17.8 seconds of delay, during the morning peak hour, and an LOS B, with
10.4 seconds of delay, during the evening peak hour. Under Alternative 1, the intersection is expected to
operate at LOS D with 36.5 seconds of delay per vehicle for the morning peak hour, and LOS C with
delays of approximately 26.5 seconds per vehicle during the evening peak hour. Table 7.4-2 shows the
LOS for existing conditions and under Alternative 1.
During the morning and evening peak hour the approaches to the northernmost and central driveways are
expected to operate at LOS B or better, with delays less than 14 seconds per vehicle. The approaches to
the southern driveway for the proposed residential use is expected to operate at LOS B with between 11.8
to 13 seconds of delay for both morning and evening peak hours (see Table 7.4-2).
The projected increase in the number of trips on the roadway network surrounding the former Naval
Hospital property and the resulting changes to the LOS for Admiral Kalbfus Road/Training Station Road
and Third Street, specifically, would result in a significant and unavoidable impact under Alternative 1.
7.4.1.3
Summary
The projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network surrounding the former
Naval Hospital property and the resulting changes to the LOS for the intersections would result in a
significant and unavoidable impact under Alternative 1.
Public transportation routes located near the former Naval Hospital property would be used to access the
proposed residential area, hotel, and/or waterfront park and would also reduce the projected number of
vehicle trips.
Sight distances for the potential driveway locations were reviewed and generally were found to meet the
AASHTO requirements for the 85th percentile travel speeds along Third Street. These distances should
be reconfirmed once the final location of the driveways is determined. The driveways should also be
designed to maximize the visibility for motorists turning into and out of the property while providing
accurate information to the motorist to identify the site. Current on-street parking next to the former
Naval Hospital property should be reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for all users.
Other potential mitigation measures would depend on the final design of the site driveways and internal
site roadway network. Improvements along the roadway could include revised signs or striping, or

possibly geometric improvements. The implementation of these mitigation measures would be the
responsibility of the future developer and/or the City of Newport.

7.4.2

Alternative 2

Similar to Alternative 1, the former Naval Hospital property would be accessed from three driveways off
of Third Street. The northernmost and center driveway would provide entrance to and exit from the
hotel/conference center property. The southernmost driveway is expected to provide access to and from
the proposed commercial use. Additionally, as discussed under Alternative 1, the potential exists for the
use of Cypress Street for access to the redeveloped site. Approximately 204 parking spaces would be
needed for the hotel, commercial space, and park.
In addition, the proposed level of traffic associated with the construction of the hotel/conference center,
commercial space, and waterfront park under Alternative 2 would be similar to that discussed under
Alternative 1 and would result in minor impacts on local traffic during the construction period only; no
significant impacts would result.
The evaluation of impacts during the full build-out of the former Naval Hospital property under
Alternative 2 includes a discussion of projected traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road
network (LOS), and recommended mitigation measures.
7.4.2.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of Alternative 2 is projected to generate 1,576 daily weekday trips. This will result in a
total of 149 vehicles entering and exiting the property during the morning peak hour and 190 vehicles
entering and existing during the evening peak hour. As with Alternative 1, the hotel would generate the
most trips. Table 7.4-3 shows the morning and evening peak hour trips for each proposed land use.

Vehicle trips projected for use of the waterfront park did not include trips associated with the boat storage
facility or the expanded use of the pier (i.e., the addition of the floating piers).

Over the full build-out period, traffic volume in the area is projected to increase, such that the total
morning peak hour volume at the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third Street is expected to
increase to 300 trips compared with existing conditions. The full build-out period takes into account a 1
percent annual background growth that is expected to occur through the year 2032. The evening peak
hour volume is expected to increase by 356 trips. Table 7.4-4 compares existing peak hour traffic
volumes at the Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third Street intersection with the projected peak hour traffic
volume under Alternative 2).

Projected Level of Service
LOS under Alternative 2 was determined for the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus and Third Street and for
the three proposed access driveways. The LOS for the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third
Street is currently LOS B for both morning and evening peak hours. Under Alternative 2, the intersection
of Admiral Kalbfus and Third Street is expected to operate at LOS D during the morning peak hour, with
39 seconds of delay per vehicle. During the evening peak hour, the intersection is expected to operate at
LOS C, with delays of approximately 33 seconds per vehicle. Table 7.4-4 shows the LOS for existing
conditions and under Alternative 2.

During the morning and evening peak hour the approaches to the northernmost and central driveways are
expected to operate at LOS B or better, with delays less than 14 seconds per vehicle. The approaches to
the southern driveway for the proposed commercial use is expected to operate at LOS C or better with
delays of 15 seconds during morning peak hours and LOS B or better with delays of less than 14 seconds
during evening peak hours.
Similar to Alternative 1, the projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network
surrounding the former Naval Hospital property and the resulting changes to the LOS for Admiral
Kalbfus Road and Third Street, specifically, would result in a significant and unavoidable impact under
Alternative 2.

Similar to Alternative 1, the projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network
surrounding the former Naval Hospital property and the resulting changes to the LOS for Admiral
Kalbfus Road and Third Street, specifically, would result in a significant and unavoidable impact under
Alternative 2.
Mitigation of impacts due to the implementation of Alternative 2 would be the same as those discussed
for Alternative 1.

7.4.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Access to the property would continue to be through existing driveways

off of Third Street No reuse or redevelopment would occur at the property and therefore no significant
impacts on transportation would occur under this alternative.
7.4.3.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Under the No Action alternative, traffic volumes are projected to increase 1 percent annually through the
year 2032. Traffic volume increases are associated with development projects not specifically identified
as well as annual population and traffic increases. Table 7.4-5 compares existing peak hour traffic
volumes at the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus Road and Third Street with the projected peak hour traffic
volume under the No Action alternative. An additional 265 trips are expected during the evening peak
hours; an additional 242 trips are expected during the morning peak hours.
7.4.3.2
Projected Level of Service
Currently, the intersection of Admiral Kalbfus and Third Street operates at a LOS B during the morning
and evening peak hours. This is expected to change to LOS C for both peak hours under the No Action
alternative (see Table 7.4-5).

Environmental Management

This section describes the potential impacts on environmental management from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of the potential
impacts on the management of hazardous waste, hazardous materials, and ER Program sites associated
with disposal and reuse of the former Naval Hospital property.
As discussed in Section 3.5.1.5, real property transactions under BRAC require the preparation of an
FOSTs). The FOST summarizes how the applicable requirements and notifications for hazardous
materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials (such as ACM, LBP, PCBs, and pesticides)
have been satisfied and whether the property is environmentally suitable for transfer. The FOST for the
former Naval Hospital property will address any restrictions, notifications, or covenants in deeds related
to hazardous materials at the surplus properties.

7.5.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.5.1.1
Hazardous Waste
Some RCRA hazardous wastes would be generated during the demolition of existing facilities and
construction of the new hotel (with retail and restaurant uses), residential, and waterfront facilities
planned under Alternative 1. The operation of heavy equipment and machinery and demolition and
construction tasks would result in waste oils and oily wastes, chemicals, acids, paints, solvents,
degreasers, and PCB-containing light ballasts (from the removal of old fluorescent light fixtures), as well
as universal wastes such as batteries, mercury-filled switches in thermostats, and fluorescent light bulbs.
Demolition and construction contractors would be required under contract to manage hazardous waste in

Draft EIS

7-22

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

accordance with City of Newport and state and federal requirements. Operation of the new businesses
and daily residential living also would result in the routine generation of small quantities of similar
hazardous wastes as well as waste pesticides. The new commercial businesses, their management/service
contractors, and residents would be required to manage hazardous wastes in accordance with City of
Newport and state and federal requirements. There would be a minor short-term and long-term impact
from the generation and management of hazardous waste under Alternative 1. However, these impacts
would not be significant because hazardous wastes would be managed in accordance with City of
Newport and state and federal requirements.
7.5.1.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks and Oil/Water Separators
Under Alternative 1, the two closed steel ASTs located at the emergency generator building, Building
993, would be demolished, repurposed, or sold for scrap by the purchaser. The ASTs contain no
hazardous material. There are no USTs or OWSs associated with the former Naval Hospital property.
Any new fuel/oil tanks or OWSs that are installed as part of property redevelopment would have to
comply with applicable RIDEM regulations. There would be no significant impacts associated with
storage tanks and OWSs under Alternative 1.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
ACM and LBP would have to be removed or otherwise properly managed at the former Naval Hospital
buildings before they are demolished to allow for new development. ACM has been confirmed in all of
the structures at the former Naval Hospital property in a variety of building materials, including ceiling
tiles, floor tiles, pipe insulation, electrical insulation, wall plaster, roofing materials, and window caulk.
As summarized in Section 6.5.2.5, hundreds of thousands of square feet of building material have been
identified as containing ACM, and much of the ACM is damaged or in poor condition. Similarly, LBP
has been confirmed in all of the structures at the former Naval Hospital property with the exception of
Building 993. LBP has been identified throughout interior and exterior areas on walls, floors, ceilings,
window components, door components, pipes, radiators, staircases, and painted wood. Much of the paint
at Buildings 1, 7, and 45 has been reported to be peeling (YU & Associates 2103).
Specialized ACM and LBP removal contractors will have to be used to ensure that ACM and LBP are
managed safely and that human health and the environment are protected. ACM and LBP
removal/disposal would have to be conducted in accordance with federal and state requirements, which
are described in Section 3.5.1.2. Collectively, those regulations address ACM and LBP removal, ACM
and LBP disposal, worker safety, and air quality. For example, NESHAPS (40 CFR Part 61) requires that
each owner or operator of a demolition activity subject to NESHAPS remove regulated ACM from the
facility being demolished before any activity that would break up, dislodge, or disturb the materials.
Regulated ACM need not be removed before demolition if the ACM is considered non-friable (e.g., vinyl
asbestos floor tiles), is not in poor condition, and would not be rendered friable during the demolition
process. Contractual specifications for demolition involving ACM would be developed by an accredited
Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) professional to ensure the proper removal of
regulated ACM.
Lead from LBP above the RIDEM residential DEC for lead has been identified in discrete areas of soil
near Buildings 1, 7, and 45 and Quarters A and B, and most of those results were also above the
industrial/commercial DEC for lead (see Section 6.5.2.6). Under Alternative 1, soils in the affected areas
near those buildings could require investigation and potential remediation in accordance with the federal
and state requirements discussed in Section 3.5.1.2.

Draft EIS

7-23

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

In accordance with RCRA, demolition waste streams that might contain lead would be evaluated, either
by applying knowledge of the waste or by testing using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure
(TCLP), to determine whether hazardous waste disposal regulations are applicable. LBP- or leadcontaining wastes generated from demolition would be temporarily stored on-site, in compliance with
RCRA requirements, before being transported and disposed of off-site by an authorized contractor.
Alternative 1 would provide a long-term beneficial impact from the removal of ACM, LBP, and lead in
soil because such materials would be removed and would no longer be present in the built environment.
There would be a minor short-term impact from the human and environmental hazards of removing and
disposing of the ACM, LBP, and lead-containing soil. These impacts would not be significant and would
be mitigated by a future developer through the use of specialized and authorized removal contractors.
There would be no impacts associated with construction and future use of the property because asbestos
and LBP are no longer used in new building materials.
PCBs and Pesticides
NAVSTA Newport removed any PCB-containing transformers in the 1980s (see Section 6.5.2.7). Any
transformers that are handled or removed during demolition and redevelopment activities under
Alternative 1 should be inspected for “PCB-free” labels. If such labels are not found, the transformers
should be evaluated for PCBs. Small quantities of PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts would likely
be generated during the demolition and removal of the former hospital buildings and would be handled as
a hazardous waste (see Section 7.5.1.1). PCBs were not found in window caulking and glazing during a
recent evaluation conducted in April 2013 (YU & Associates 2013).
Pesticides are currently used at the former Naval Hospital property as needed and in accordance with the
NAVSTA Newport Integrated Pest Management Plan (see Section 3.5.1.2). It is expected that pesticides
would similarly be used responsibly and in accordance with any applicable local or state regulations in the
future for pest control by the commercial businesses, their management/service contractors, and residents
that would occupy the new developments proposed under Alternative 1. There would be no significant
impacts associated with PCB and pesticide management under Alternative 1.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Although there are no records of radioactive materials use or radioactive waste generation at the former
Naval Hospital buildings, it is considered possible that radioactive materials were used for diagnosis and
treatment (see Section 6.5.2.9). Therefore, the demolition contractor will need to watch for potential
sources of radioactive materials, and it is recommended that the demolition contract contain this caution.
If radioactive materials are found, the Navy should be notified so they can assist with the proper disposal
of the materials in accordance with the broad radioactive materials license that the Navy holds (see
Section 3.5.1.2). No radioactive materials would be expected to be used by the businesses planned to
occupy proposed redevelopment uses under Alternative 1.
Prior radon testing at Building 1, Quarters A and B, and throughout NAVSTA Newport indicates that
radon is not generally a concern. Of the more than 120 tests that have been conducted at Building 1 and
Quarters A and B, only five contained radon in excess of the EPA standard of 4 pCi/L and the highest of
those values was 8.6 pCi/L (Malcolm Pirnie 2005) (see Section 6.5.2.10). The vast majority of the more
than 2,500 radon results obtained to date for NAVSTA Newport have been below 4 pCi/L (see Section
3.5.1.2). Those same levels would be expected to be seen in any new construction because radon in
buildings comes primarily from underground sources. RIDOH regulates radon levels in public buildings,
schools, and child care centers (RIDOH 2007b), none of which are included in Alternative 1. RIDOH
recommends radon-resistant new construction and radon testing and mitigation for residential buildings
(RIDOH 2007b). There would be no significant impacts from radioactive materials and radon under
Alternative 1.
Draft EIS

7-24

7.5.1.3
Medical Waste
Although medical waste was generated in the past at Building 1, it is no longer generated and would not
be generated by any of the proposed uses planned for Alternative 1; therefore there would be no impact
associated with medical waste.
7.5.1.4
Environmental Restoration Program
There are no ER Program sites near the former Naval Hospital property. The closest sites are the
conjoined IRP Site 9, Old Fire Fighting Training Area, and IRP Site 20, Surface Warfare Officers School,
which are located on Coasters Harbor Island and are separated from the former Naval Hospital property
by Narragansett Bay (see Section 6.5.4). Therefore, there would be no impact associated with ER
Program sites under Alternative 1. Redevelopment would be compatible with the Navy’s program and
commitment to clean up hazardous waste sites.

7.5.2

Alternative 2

7.5.2.1
Hazardous Waste
As described under Alternative 1, additional hazardous wastes would be routinely generated from the
implementation of Alternative 2. There would be minor short-term and long-term impacts from the
generation and management of hazardous wastes under Alternative 2. However, these impacts would not
be significant because hazardous wastes would be managed in accordance with City of Newport and state
and federal requirements.
7.5.2.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks and Oil/Water Separators
There would be no significant impacts associated with storage tanks and OWSs under Alternative 2, as
described for Alternative 1.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
As discussed under Alternative 1, ACM and LBP would have to be removed from the former Naval
Hospital buildings before they are demolished to allow for new development, and lead-containing soil
would require investigation and potential remediation. There would be a beneficial long-term impact
from the removal of ACM, LBP, and lead in soil under Alternative 2 because such materials would be
removed and would no longer be present in the built environment. There would similarly be a minor
short-term impact from the human and environmental hazards of removing and disposing of the ACM,
LBP, and lead-containing soil. These impacts would not be significant and would be mitigated by the use
of specialized and authorized removal contractors. There would be no impacts associated with
construction and reuse of the property because asbestos and LBP are no longer used in new building
materials.
PCBs and Pesticides
Like Alternative 1, there would be no significant impacts associated with PCB and pesticide management
under Alternative 2.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
As described under Alternative 1, demolition contractors should be made aware of the past uses of the
former hospital buildings and the possibility that radioactive materials might inadvertently remain and
would require specialized handling and management, in consultation with the Navy.

Draft EIS

7-25

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Under Alternative 2, residential development would be replaced by additional commercial development.
Radon levels in any new construction on the former Naval Hospital property would be expected to be
low, based on the results of past radon testing, as noted under Alternative 1. RIDOH regulates radon
levels in public buildings, schools, and child care centers (RIDOH 2007b), none of which are included in
Alternative 2.
There would be no significant impacts from radioactive materials and radon from implementing
Alternative 2, as described for Alternative 1.
7.5.2.3
Medical Waste
Under Alternative 2, there would be no impact associated with medical waste, as described under
Alternative 1.
7.5.2.4
Environmental Restoration Program
There are no ER Program sites near the former Naval Hospital property. There would be no impact
associated with ER Program sites under Alternative 2, as described under Alternative 1. Redevelopment
would be compatible with the Navy’s program and commitment to clean up hazardous waste sites.

7.5.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, the former Naval Hospital would be maintained in a caretaker status
with no redevelopment.
7.5.3.1
Hazardous Waste
Hazardous wastes are not routinely generated at the former Naval Hospital property or Pier 71, with the
exception of small quantities of universal wastes such as spent batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, and
thermostats. The hospital buildings are vacant and unused. Therefore, there would be no impact on
hazardous waste management under the No Action alternative.
7.5.3.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks and Oil/Water Separators
The two steel ASTs located at the emergency generator building, Building 993, are already closed in
accordance with RIDEM regulations and there are no USTs or OWSs at the former Naval Hospital
property. Therefore, there would be no impacts from storage tanks and OWSs under the No Action
alternative.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
ACM has been confirmed in all of the structures at the property, comprising hundreds of thousands of
square feet of affected building materials, and much of the ACM is damaged or in poor condition. LBP
has been confirmed in all structures except Building 993, and much of the paint at Buildings 1, 7, and 45
is peeling. Lead in LBP above the RIDEM residential DEC has been identified in discrete areas of soil
near Buildings 1, 7, and 45 and Quarters A and B and most of those results were also above the
industrial/commercial DEC for lead. Under the No Action alternative, ACM, LBP, and lead in soil would
remain and would not be remediated unless they posed an immediate risk to human or environmental
health and safety. Therefore, under the No Action alternative, there would be a long-term impact from
ACM, LBP, and lead in soil that remain in the built environment at NAVSTA Newport. This impact is
minor and not significant because the ACM and LBP are in buildings that would remain unoccupied and
the lead in soil is associated with LBP that has peeled off and become embedded in discrete areas near the
buildings where it has collected via precipitation and dripping.

Draft EIS

7-26

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

PCBs and Pesticides
There are no longer any PCB-containing transformers at NAVSTA Newport, and window caulking and
glazing at the former Naval Hospital buildings have not been found to contain PCBs. Small quantities of
intact, PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts likely remain in light fixtures in the buildings on the
property. Under the No Action alternative, pesticides would continue to be applied at the former Naval
Hospital property as necessary to control pests and in accordance with the installation’s Integrated Pest
Management Plan. Therefore, there would be no impacts associated with PCB and pesticide management
under the No Action alternative.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Under the No Action alternative, the former Naval Hospital buildings would remain unoccupied. There
would be no exposure to any radioactive materials that might inadvertently remain and radon exposure
would be negligible. The majority of the areas tested for radon in Building 1 were below the EPA
standard of 4 pCi/L. Therefore, there would be no impacts from radioactive materials or radon under the
No Action alternative.
7.5.3.3
Medical Waste
Medical waste is not currently generated at the former Naval Hospital property; therefore, there would be
no impact on medical waste management under the No Action alternative.
7.5.3.4
Environmental Restoration Program
There are no ER Program sites near the former Naval Hospital property. As with Alternatives 1 and 2,
there would be no impact associated with ER Program sites under the No Action alternative.

7.6

Air Quality

This section provides a summary of the projected emissions associated with the disposal and reuse of the
former Naval Hospital property, including emissions from the operation of all new buildings and new
vehicle usage on local roadways after full build-out.
For purposes of analysis, construction emissions under both Alternatives 1 and 2 for the former Naval
Hospital property are assumed to be the same, primarily because the footprints for the proposed
redevelopment under both alternatives are similar. Construction emissions have been estimated based on
Alternative 2, which has a slightly larger footprint than Alternative 1.
An analysis of the impact of the proposed action on regional air quality is provided in Chapter 12, which
includes an evaluation of criteria pollutants, GHG and HAPs from continuing actions at all surplus
properties upon final build-out (see Chapter 12, Summary of Impacts for all Surplus Property, for a
discussion of the total impacts from this action in the Providence, Rhode Island air quality region). Both
construction and operation emissions have also been evaluated for the other individual surplus properties
(see Sections 5.6, 9.6, and 11.6).
Construction emissions are temporary and are not likely to occur within the same year at all locations or
at the same time as ongoing operational emissions, especially considering a 20-year build-out period for
the Redevelopment Plan. Detailed calculations that support the estimated construction emissions are
provided in Appendix D-1. (Section 3.6 discusses regional air quality, applicable regulations and
requirements, and methods used to assess the environmental consequences.)

7.6.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The proposed redevelopment at the former Naval Hospital property includes demolition of the six
existing, vacant buildings. New construction would include a three-story hotel (120 rooms) with
Draft EIS

7-27

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

additional space for retail and/or restaurants comprising approximately 1.3 acres at the northeastern
corner of the site; a three-story 36-unit residential building with a ground level footprint of approximately
0.60 acres over at-grade parking in the southeastern corner of the site; and a waterfront park of
approximately 2.4 acres that would include a pier with floating docks, pedestrian path, and boat storage
facility. Parking and access would comprise an additional 2.2 acres (see Chapter 2, Figure 2-2).
Construction-related emissions would be primarily exhaust emissions from demolition and construction
vehicles and equipment, demolition material removal, construction materials delivery, construction
employee commutes, and dust resulting from ground disturbance and road traffic. Construction emissions
resulting from this action at the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1 would be similar yet
slightly less than emissions estimated under Alternative 2, which are discussed below in Section 7.6.2.
These emissions would be short-term and localized, resulting in minor impacts on air quality.
Mitigation of construction emissions would be implemented with best management practices that could
include proper maintenance of equipment, idling reduction measures, and the use of newer, more efficient
equipment with diesel retrofits to control fine particulate matter(PM10). Particle emissions can also be
controlled through regular water applications on graded areas and cleaning streets after grading activities.
Operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic.
Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural gas, primarily for
heating, as well as the indirect use of electricity. Emissions from increased vehicle use were calculated
based on the new vehicle trips modeled for the proposed redevelopment at the former Naval Hospital
property in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station
Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). Total operational emissions after full build-out of the former Naval
Hospital property under Alternative 1 are provided in Table 7.6-1 (see Chapter 12 for the discussion of
regional air quality impacts). Operational emissions would result in minor impacts on air quality, but the
mitigation discussed below would reduce adverse impacts.

7.6.2

Alternative 2

Under Alternative 2, the residential use proposed under Alternative 1 would be replaced by commercial
use, and a conference center would be added to the proposed hotel. The commercial use would have the
same footprint as the residential use under Alternative 1 (0.6 acres). The 0.2-acre conference center would
be developed behind the hotel, along Third Avenue (see Chapter 2, Figure 2-5). The remainder of the site
would require demolition and be developed as described under Alternative 1. At 4.8 acres (58 percent) of
the land-based portion of the site, the development footprint is slightly higher than under Alternative
1.The intensity of use also is higher under Alternative 2.
Construction emissions resulting from the proposed redevelopment at the former Naval Hospital property
under Alternative 2 are provided in Table 7.6-2. These emissions would be temporary and would occur
only during the period of construction, which is conservatively assumed to be one year. Construction
emissions would therefore result in minor impacts on air quality. Measures to mitigate construction
emissions are the same as those discussed above under Alternative 1.

Operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic.
Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural gas, primarily for
heating, as well as the indirect use of electricity. As determined in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the
Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013), vehicle
traffic would increase due to the proposed redevelopment at the former Naval Hospital property, resulting
in new vehicle emissions. Operational emissions would result in minor impacts on air quality. Total
operational emissions after full build-out of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 2 are
provided in Table 7.6-3 (see Chapter 12 for the discussion of regional air quality impacts).

7.6.3

No Action Alternative

The site and existing buildings are currently unoccupied and would remain in this condition under the No
Action alternative. There would be no new stationary or mobile sources of criteria, HAPs, or GHG
emissions from the use of the property, and the No Action alternative would not impact air quality at the
former Naval Hospital property.

7.6.4

General Conformity Rule Applicability Determination

Since Rhode Island is in attainment for all NAAQS, the General Conformity Rule does not apply to this
action. While not applicable to the action, the de minimis thresholds under the General Conformity Rule
have been used to consider the potential level of significance of the air quality impacts under NEPA.

Draft EIS

7-29

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Emissions from construction and operation at the former Naval Hospital property under either alternative
would be below the General Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds. Thus, changes in air quality would
not be significant as a result of the proposed construction and mitigation would reduce adverse impacts.

Noise

This section includes an analysis of the potential noise impacts resulting from the proposed
redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1, Alternative 2 and the No
Action alternative. It includes an analysis of the potential impacts resulting from construction and future
operation of the proposed redevelopment plan for the former Naval Hospital property.

7.7.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.7.1.1
Construction
Proposed redevelopment at the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1 involves demolishing
the existing buildings, constructing a three-story hotel with additional space for retail and/or restaurants, a
three-story 36-unit residential building, and a waterfront park. Table 7.7-1 provides an estimate of the
number and types of construction equipment that would be needed and the associated sound pressure
level for each type of equipment at a distance of 50 feet from the source and at the nearest residence.
Figure 7.7-1 illustrates the locations of the noise receptors used for analysis. The nearest residence from
the center of the former Naval Hospital property has been determined to be a location along Third Street
at a distance of approximately 350 feet. The SPL at this location is estimated to range from 50 to 71
dBA. The nearest residence from Pier 71 is a location along Cypress Street at a distance of approximately
350 feet. The SPL at this location from the pilings/dock construction is estimated to be 71 dBA. The
composite sound level due to construction would be between 60 dB, the sound level of normal speech,
and 80 dB, the sound level of a garbage disposal (see Chapter 3, Table 3.7-1, Decibel Levels of Some
Common Sounds).
Construction noise impacts would be temporary and would occur only during the period of construction,
which is conservatively assumed to be one year. In addition, construction would take place between the
hours of 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., when the noise would be less disturbing and in accordance with the
zoning regulations of the City of Newport.

Temporary increases in construction-related vehicle noise would also be expected. Truck and
construction vehicle (e.g., dump trucks, material deliveries, debris removal, etc.) traffic within and near
the former Naval Hospital property would produce localized noise for brief periods, but this would not be
expected to create any long-term, adverse noise impacts on the neighboring community.

Draft EIS

Former Naval Hospital Property

Construction noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation
(conforming to zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
7.7.1.2
Operation
Operation of the mixed uses and waterfront park on the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative
1 would include noise sources such as traffic to and from the parking lots, children playing and other
recreational activities that would not be expected to result in a noise impact above ambient noise levels
during the daytime, when the property would have the greatest use.
To characterize the projected traffic noise near the former Naval Hospital property, the evening peak hour
traffic volume, vehicle speed, and vehicle mix data for the roadways in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the
Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013) were
modeled using TNM version 2.5 at the receptor locations shown in Table 7.7-2.
The predicted traffic noise levels for the Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1 are summarized
below in Table 7.7-2. Noise levels would range between 62.0 and 67.2 dBA, which differs from existing
conditions by 1 dBA or less. An increase in noise of 3 dBA is considered to be barely noticeable. As
shown in Table 7.7-2, projected traffic noise levels would slightly exceed FHWA guidance noise
abatement criteria thresholds for the land uses proposed under Alternative 1 but would not substantially
exceed (greater than 15 dBA) existing conditions. Land uses proposed under Alternative 1 would include
FHWA activity categories ‘B’ and ‘C.’ The traffic noise abatement criterion threshold for activity
Category B is 67 dBA and 72 dBA for Category C. (For more information on FHWA traffic noise
abatement criteria see Section 3.7.2).

construction noise levels would be similar to Alternative 1; however, the duration of construction may be
slightly longer.
Temporary increases in construction-related vehicle noise would, however, be expected. Truck and
construction vehicle (e.g., dump trucks, material deliveries, debris removal, etc.) traffic on and near the
former Naval Hospital property would produce localized noise for brief periods, but this would not be
expected to create any long-term, adverse noise impacts on the neighboring community. Construction
noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation (conforming to
zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
7.7.2.2
Operation
Implementation of Alternative 2 would not be expected to generate significant traffic-related noise
impacts within the study area. Traffic-related noise would occur in areas already experiencing such noise
and would not be expected to cause additional impacts. The predicted traffic noise levels for the former
Naval Hospital property under Alternative 2 are provided in Table 7.7-3. The largest estimated increase
in traffic noise would be 1.3 dBA. An increase in noise of 3 dBA is considered to be barely noticeable.
As shown in Table 7.7-3, projected traffic noise levels would slightly exceed FHWA guidance noise
abatement criteria thresholds for the land uses proposed under Alternative 2 but would not substantially
exceed (greater than 15 dBA) existing conditions. Land uses under Alternative 2 would include FHWA
activity categories ‘B’ and ‘C’. The traffic noise abatement criterion threshold for activity Category B is
67 dBA and 72 dBA for Category C. (For more information on FHWA traffic noise abatement criteria,
see Section 3.7.2.) Changes in the traffic-related noise levels would result in minor impacts on the
ambient noise environment; no mitigation measures are proposed.

Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the potential impacts on infrastructure and utilities from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of impacts on
water supply, wastewater, storm water, other utilities, and solid waste management from disposal and
reuse of the former Naval Hospital property.

7.8.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.8.1.1
Water Supply
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity to meet the future water demands
resulting from implementation of Alternative 1.
Water Demand
Full build-out of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1 would create a mix of uses and,
at full occupancy, water demand is estimated to be approximately 25,243 gpd. All buildings on the
property have been vacated and there is no current demand for water. Water demand was projected using
planning multipliers for the proposed land uses based on square footage (see Table 7.8-1) (Nelson 2004).
For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to estimate water demand, see Appendix
D.

Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
City of Newport’s water treatment and distribution system. The current average daily demand on the City
of Newport water supply is 5.59 mgd, including demand by users in the City of Newport and the Town of
Middletown, which are supplied through the City of Newport’s distribution system, and on NAVSTA
Newport and in the Portsmouth Water and Fire District, which are supplied water wholesale by the City
of Newport. Total average daily demand is projected to increase to between 7.50 and 7.96 mgd by 2033
(Pare Corporation 2014).
Replacement of one of the existing plants and upgrades to the other increased capacity to 16 mgd (Water
World 2012; City of Newport Department of Utilities 2014). The expected 25,243 gpd under Alternative
1 represents less than 1 percent of the average daily demand projected in 2033. Therefore, the increase in
projected water demand would represent a minor impact on the operation and maintenance of the City of
Newport’s water treatment plants and would be met with current capacity.

Draft EIS

7-36

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Distribution System
Existing water lines at the former Naval Hospital property are owned by NAVSTA Newport.
Redevelopment of the property would require installing a new distribution system for water supply, which
would be the responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate
impact on the existing distribution system. Ground disturbance would be associated with laying new
distribution lines, and the developer will be required to comply with local and state regulations to
minimize disturbance. All new distribution system(s) will be constructed to ensure that they are
adequately sized. In addition, the design and installation of any new water supply infrastructure will
require, if applicable, municipal review and approval and will have to comply with applicable local codes,
ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in an increase in water demand and a need for infrastructure. New
water distribution would be constructed to accommodate redevelopment.
7.8.1.2
Wastewater
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity for the collection and treatment of
wastewater associated with development of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 1.
Wastewater Volume
The former Naval Hospital property contains only vacant buildings and no wastewater is being produced.
Full build-out of Alternative 1 would create a mix of uses. At full occupancy, wastewater generation is
expected to be approximately 23,670 gpd of wastewater under Alternative 1 (see Table 7.8-2). The
largest quantity of wastewater would be produced from the residential units, which are expected to
generate 14,280 gpd. Table 7.8-2 shows the projected generation of wastewater for both alternatives by
land use. For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to project wastewater demand,
see Appendix D-3.

Operation and Management
The plant has a current capacity of 10.7 mgd and in 2012 processed 9.46 mgd. Wastewater flows
generated under Alternative 1 would represent less than 1 percent of the plant’s current processing total
(9.46 mgd). Therefore, the projected increase in wastewater demand would represent a minor impact on
operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s wastewater treatment and collection system.
Collection System
Wastewater from the Naval Hospital property formerly flowed through the NAVSTA sewer system
before reaching Pump Station 68 and being pumped to Newport’s wastewater treatment plant (RKG
Draft EIS

Former Naval Hospital Property

Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Under Alternative 1, future redevelopment is expected to access the City of
Newport’s sewer system (Carlson 2012). Redevelopment of the property would require installing a new
wastewater collection system, which would be the responsibility of the developer/future property owner
and would be considered a moderate impact on the existing collection system. Ground disturbance would
be associated with laying new distribution lines, and the developer will be required to comply with local
and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new collection system(s) will be constructed to ensure
that they are adequately sized. In addition, the design and installation of any new wastewater collection
infrastructure will require, if applicable, municipal review and approval and will have to comply with
applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
Flow through Newport’s collection system along Third Street and Cypress Street is handled by Pump
Station 68 (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). The pump station is currently in good overall condition.
No major upgrades have been identified as being needed (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in an increase in demand on wastewater capacity and a need for
new infrastructure. New wastewater distribution infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate
redevelopment.
7.8.1.3
Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 1 would increase the amount of impervious surface area on the property,
resulting in a greater volume of storm water runoff. Some of the existing impervious surface would be
replaced or expanded as a result of Alternative 1 in addition to new impervious surfaces. Full build-out
under Alternative 1 is estimated to result in a total of approximately 195,243 square feet of impervious
surface area, an increase of four percent above existing conditions. The hotel, parking and access
roadways are a large component of the total impervious surfaces under the proposed redevelopment.
Total impervious surface area is shown for both alternatives in Table 7.8-3. For more information on the
methodology and assumptions used to calculate existing and future impervious surface, see Appendix
D-4.

Former Naval Hospital Property

The City of Newport requires that a storm water management plan be prepared as part of the development
plan review stipulated in Chapter 17.88, Development Plan Review of Newport’s Code of Ordinances.
This development plan review is required for certain types of development, namely commercial and
multi-family dwelling units of a certain size, to ensure that they do not significantly impact the city’s
infrastructure and utilities. The required storm water management plan must conform to the current
edition of the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC
2010) and the minimum standards set forth in Chapter 17.88.030, Development Plan Controls (T).
A General Permit, Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity, would be necessary because redevelopment of the former Naval
Hospital property would disturb more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction General Permit, the
RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a discussion of erosion and
sediment controls. Through compliance with applicable state and local regulations, the addition of
impervious surface would not be considered a significant impact.
Additionally, as indicated in Section 3.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, Section 438 of the EISA requires
that any development or redevelopment project involving a federal facility with a footprint exceeding
5,000 square feet shall use site planning, design, construction, and maintenance strategies in order to
maintain or restore the pre-development hydrology of the property with regard to temperature, rate,
volume, and duration of flow. Compliance with this requirement can be met through the implementation
of LID technologies.
Section 438 applies to the “sponsor of any development or redevelopment project involving a federal
facility.” The act of transferring the installation will result in the property being no longer federally
owned; consequently, Section 438 would not apply to the redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital
property. However, as outlined in Rhode Island’s Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual,
use of LID techniques are required as a primary method of storm water control (RIDEM and CRMC
2010). Thus, although not required through federal ownership of the property, it is expected that the
redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would be consistent with the terms contained in
Section 438 of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system may require modifications, and new storm water infrastructure
may be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under this alternative.
Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure, and the developer will be required
to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion of the BRAC
disposal process, the future developer will be required to identify any infrastructure requirements that
may be needed.
Operation and Management
Under Alternative 1, the property would likely be transferred to a non-federal agency, and the
infrastructure would no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal
process, the future property owner or developer would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure
located on the property and for its service and maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a significant increase in impervious surface area, and new
storm water infrastructure would be required; however, mitigation will render the impact not significant.
Mitigation will include required compliance with state and local regulations and permit conditions
regarding storm water management.

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
Electricity at the property would continue to be supplied by National Grid. Upon full build-out of
Alternative 1, total electricity demand is estimated to be approximately 2,470,529 kWh (estimated using
U.S. averages for energy use per square foot for specific types of building uses [U.S. Department of
Energy EIA 2003; 2009]). These averages were used to estimate total energy use in the proposed new
building spaces. The same assumptions were applied in Section 7.6, Air Quality. The majority of
electricity usage, approximately 2.3 million kWh, would originate from the hotel. Residential units
would consume more than 162,000 kWh annually. Electricity demand for the proposed land uses is
shown in Table 7.8-4. The property is currently vacant and not consuming electricity; however, service is
available via overhead wires along Third Street.

As shown in Table 5.8-4 in Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, the City of Newport consumed more
than 285 million kWh of electricity in 2011. The 2011 electric consumption represented a decrease from
2010 but was still an increase over the levels used in 2009. According to the 2012 Regional System Plan
developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode Island’s overall electricity demand has been forecasted to
grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the next decade.
The annual electricity demand under Alternative 1 would represent less than 1 percent of 2011 energy
usage in Newport and less than a half percent of total annual energy usage for Newport, Middletown, and
Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012). Considering the 0.8 percent future annual growth
rate in electricity demand at the state level and that Aquidneck Island comprises approximately 5.5
percent of the state’s overall population, the annual growth rate for electricity demand would be expected
to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the demand for electricity from the redevelopment of the
former Naval Hospital under Alternative 1 would be expected to be supported by current electrical
capacity and would represent a negligible impact on regional demand. However, the future developer
would need to coordinate with the three local municipalities, and National Grid to identify an alternative
for electricity provision if, at the time of redevelopment, regional capacities are exceeded.
All electric connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and properly built electric
transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed during construction of new systems.
Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed by
the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the development
review process at the local level.

Natural Gas
Natural gas would continue to be supplied by National Grid. An estimated 8,335,116 cf of natural gas
would be needed each year under full build-out of Alternative 1. Similar to electricity usage, estimates of
future natural gas usage were calculated for full build-out as proposed under Alternative 1 using U.S.
averages for natural gas use per square foot, which were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s
EIA (2003; 2009) for specific types of building use. These averages were used to estimate total natural
gas use by the proposed new building spaces. The same assumptions were applied in Section 7.6, Air
Quality. As with electricity usage, the majority of natural gas would be consumed by the proposed hotel.
More than 8,300,000 cf of natural gas would be used by the hotel annually. The boat storage facility
would consume more than 30,000 cf. The proposed residential units would consume less than 1 percent
of the natural gas demand under Alternative 1. Table 7.8-5 compares natural gas usage for the two
alternatives. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would work with
National Grid to identify any infrastructure requirements that may be needed.

The natural gas usage for the City of Newport in 2011 was more than 105 billion cf (see Table 5.8-5 in
Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities). The quantity of natural gas needed under Alternative 1
represents less than one-one hundredth of a percent of the amount consumed in Newport in 2011 (Rhode
Island Energy 2012), and, therefore, is assumed would be accommodated with existing capacities
servicing existing demand. It would represent a negligible impact on regional demand. Redevelopment
under Alternative 1 is not anticipated to create a strain on natural gas resources.
All natural gas connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and properly built gas
transmission and conveyance system. Ground would be disturbed during construction of new systems,
and the developer will be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance.
Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed by
the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the development
review process at the local level.
7.8.1.5
Solid Waste
Large quantities of solid wastes would be generated from the implementation of Alternative 1. C&D
wastes would be generated from the demolition and construction activities that are planned for
redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property and would consist of wood, concrete, masonry,
metal, building materials, and mechanical components. Estimates of solid waste generated from
demolition and construction activities are included in Appendix D-2. Approximately 62,000 cy of C&D
waste would be generated from demolishing the former Naval Hospital buildings, and approximately
2,200 cy of C&D waste would be generated from constructing the commercial, residential, and
Draft EIS

7-41

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

recreational facilities planned for Alternative 1. Much of the C&D waste would be recyclable, and it is
expected that the demolition and construction contracts would contain traditional terms and conditions
requiring recycling C&D waste to the extent practicable, which reduces disposal costs and is also
protective of the environment. Solid wastes also would be routinely generated during the future operation
of the commercial businesses that are planned for the property and from residential living. Such solid
wastes would consist of mixed trash, food waste, and traditional recyclables such as paper, cardboard, and
containers. It is expected that non-C&D solid wastes would be managed by existing local solid waste
management services.
Implementation of Alternative 1 would have moderate short-term and minor long-term impacts on solid
waste management. The impacts would not be significant because of the relatively small scale of the
proposed reuse and redevelopment and the availability and capacity of existing solid waste management
programs in the City of Newport and Newport County.

7.8.2

Alternative 2

7.8.2.1
Water Supply
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity to meet the future water demands
resulting from implementation of Alternative 2.
Water Demand
Full build-out of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 2 would create a mix of uses and
would result in an estimated demand of approximately 23,400 gpd, slightly less than the projected water
demand under Alternative 1. The proposed retail/commercial uses would be the largest consumers of
water. Table 7.8-1 shows the projected water demand for Alternative 1 and Alternative 2. Demand was
projected using planning multipliers for proposed land uses based on square footage (Nelson 2004). For
more information on the methodology and assumptions used to project water demand, see Appendix D-3.
Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
City of Newport’s water treatment plant and distribution system. The current average daily demand on
the City of Newport water supply is 5.59 mgd, including demand by users in the City of Newport and the
Town of Middletown, which are supplied through the City of Newport’s distribution system, and on
NAVSTA Newport and in the Portsmouth Water and Fire District, which are supplied water wholesale by
the City of Newport. Total average daily demand is projected to increase to between 7.50 and 7.96 mgd
by 2033 (Pare Corporation 2014).
Replacement of one of the existing plants and upgrades to the other increased capacity to 16 mgd (Water
World 2012; City of Newport Department of Utilities 2014). The expected 23,400 gpd under Alternative
2 represents less than 1 percent of the average daily demand projected in 2033. Therefore, the increase in
projected water demand would represent a minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of
Newport’s water treatment plants and would be met with current capacity.
Distribution System
As indicated under Alternative 2, existing water lines at the former Naval Hospital property are owned by
NAVSTA Newport and would need to be cut and capped by the developer prior to redevelopment.
Installing a new distribution system for water supply would be required, which would be the
responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact. As
indicated under Alternative 1, ground would be disturbed when laying new distribution lines, and the
developer will be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new
distribution system(s) would be constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized. In addition, the
Draft EIS

7-42

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

design and installation of any new water supply infrastructure will require, if applicable, municipal review
and approval and will need to comply with applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would result in an increase in water demand and a
need for new infrastructure. New water distribution infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate
redevelopment.
7.8.2.2
Wastewater
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity for the collection and treatment of
wastewater associated with development of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 2.
Wastewater Volume
The former Naval Hospital property is currently vacant and so no wastewater is being produced at this
time. Based on standard multipliers for the proposed land uses under Alternative 2 (Nelson 2004), at full
occupancy, wastewater generation is expected to be approximately 22,253 gpd. Wastewater generation
by uses is similar to Alternative 1; however, residential generation would be replaced by a lower volume
of wastewater for the proposed conference center, commercial space, and yacht club/ office. Table 7.8-2
shows the projected generation of wastewater for the alternatives by land use.
Operation and Management
The City of Newport’s plant has a current capacity of 10.7 mgd and in 2012 processed 9.46 mgd.
Wastewater flows generated under Alternative 2 would represent less than 1 percent of the plant’s current
processing total (9.46 mgd). Therefore, the projected increase in wastewater demand would represent a
minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s wastewater treatment and collection
system.
Collection System
Similar to Alternative 1, wastewater from the former Naval Hospital property previously flowed through
the NAVSTA sewer system before reaching Pump Station 68 and being pumped to Newport’s wastewater
treatment plant (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Under Alternative 2, future development is expected
to access the City of Newport’s sewer system (Carlson 2012). Redevelopment of the property would
require installing a new wastewater collection system, which would be the responsibility of the
developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact. Ground would be
disturbed when laying new collection lines, and the developer will be required to comply with local and
state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new collection system(s) would be constructed to ensure
that they are adequately sized. In addition, the design and installation of any new wastewater collection
infrastructure will require, if applicable, municipal review and approval and will have to comply with
applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
Flow through Newport’s collection system along Third Street and Cypress Street is handled by Pump
Station 68 (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). The pump station is currently in good overall condition.
No major upgrades have been identified as being needed (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
In summary, similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would result in an increase in demand on wastewater
capacity and a need for new infrastructure. New wastewater distribution infrastructure would be
constructed to accommodate redevelopment.
7.8.2.3
Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 2 would increase the amount of impervious surface area on the property,
resulting in a greater volume of storm water runoff. Existing impervious areas from buildings would be

Draft EIS

7-43

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

replaced by new structures and parking and access roads would be expanded. Full build-out under
Alternative 2 is estimated to result in a total of approximately 210,410 square feet of impervious surface
area, an increase of 12 percent over existing conditions. Most of the impervious surfaces would be part of
the hotel and retail land uses. Parking and access roadways are also a large component of the total
amount of impervious surfaces under the proposed redevelopment. Impervious surfaces from commercial
space in Alternative 2 would replace impervious surfaces from residential uses in Alternative 1. Total
impervious surface area is shown for both alternatives in Table 7.8-3.
As discussed under Alternative 1, compliance with local and state storm water regulations would be
required. A storm water management plan would be required as part of the development plan review
specified in the City of Newport’s Code of Ordinances (Chapter 17.88). A General Permit, Rhode Island
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge Associated with Construction Activity,
would also be necessary because redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would disturb
more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction General Permit, the RIDEM requires submittal of an
NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a discussion of erosion and sediment controls. Lastly, as
discussed above under Alternative 1, Section 438 would not apply to the redevelopment of the former
Naval Hospital property. However, as outlined in Rhode Island’s Stormwater Design and Installation
Standards Manual, use of LID techniques are required as a primary method of storm water control
(RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Thus, although not required through federal ownership of the property, it is
expected that the redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would be consistent with the
terms of Section 438 of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system may require modifications and new storm water infrastructure
may be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under this alternative.
Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure, and the developer will be required
to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion of the BRAC
disposal process, the future developer would be required to identify any infrastructure that may be
needed.
Operation and Management
Under Alternative 2, the property would be transferred to a non-federal agency, and infrastructure would
no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC process, the future property owner
would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure located on the property and for its service and
maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 2 would result in a significant increase in impervious surface area, and new
storm water infrastructure would be needed; however, mitigation will render the impact not significant.
Mitigation will include required compliance with state and local regulations and permit conditions
regarding storm water management.
7.8.2.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
Electricity would continue to be supplied by National Grid. Upon full build-out of Alternative 2, it is
expected total electricity demand would be approximately 2,832,468 kWh. The majority of electricity
usage would originate from the hotel. A considerable increase in electricity consumption compared with
Alternative 1 would occur with the replacement of residential units with commercial space and the
addition of a conference center and yacht club/office. The property is currently vacant and no electricity
is used; however, service is available via overhead wires along Third Street.

Draft EIS

7-44

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

As discussed under Alternative 1, the City of Newport used more than 285 million kWh of electricity in
2011. According to the 2012 Regional System Plan developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode
Island’s overall electricity demand has been forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the
next decade. The annual electricity demand under Alternative 2 would represent just under 1 percent of
2011 energy usage in Newport and approximately 0.50 percent of total annual energy usage for Newport,
Middletown, and Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012). Considering the 0.8 percent future
annual growth rate in electricity demand at the state level and that Aquidneck Island comprises
approximately 5.5 percent of the state’s overall population, the annual growth rate for electricity demand
would be expected to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the electricity demand from the
redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital under Alternative 2 would be expected to be supported by
current electrical capacity and would represent a negligible impact on regional demand. However, the
future developer would need to coordinate with the three local municipalities and National Grid to
identify an alternative for electricity provision if, at the time of redevelopment, regional capacities are
exceeded.
Similar to Alternative 1, all electric connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and
properly built electric transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed during
construction of new systems, and the developer will be required to comply with local and state regulations
to minimize disturbance. Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully
funded and constructed by the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would
be part of the development review process at the local level.
Natural Gas
Natural gas to the property would continue to be supplied by National Grid. It is expected that a total of
approximately 9,594,120 cf of natural gas would be needed each year under full build-out of Alternative
2. Similar to electricity use, the largest consumers of natural gas include the proposed hotel, commercial
space, and conference center, respectively. Table 7.8-5 compares natural gas usage of the two
alternatives. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would work with
National Grid to identify any infrastructure requirements that may be needed.
The natural gas usage for the City of Newport in 2011 was more than 105 billion cf (see Table 5.8-5 in
Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities). The quantity of natural gas needed under Alternative 2
represents less than one-tenth of one percent of the amount used in Newport in 2011 (Rhode Island
Energy 2012) and therefore it is assumed that existing capacities servicing existing demand can
accommodate this small increase. Redevelopment under Alternative 2 is not expected to create a strain on
natural gas resources. It would represent a negligible impact on regional demand.
Similar to Alternative 1, all natural gas connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized
and properly built gas transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed during
construction of new systems and the developer will be required to comply with local and state regulations
to minimize disturbance. Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully
funded and constructed by the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would
be part of the development review process at the local level.
7.8.2.5
Solid Waste
Large quantities of solid wastes would be generated from the implementation of Alternative 2, similar to
Alternative 1. C&D wastes would be generated from the demolition and construction activities that are
planned for redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property and would consist of wood, concrete,
masonry, metal, building materials, and mechanical components. Approximately 62,000 cy of C&D
waste would be generated from demolishing the former Naval Hospital buildings, and approximately
Draft EIS

7-45

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

1,800 cy of C&D waste would be generated from constructing the commercial and recreational facilities
planned for Alternative 2 (see Appendix D-2). Like Alternative 1, much of the C&D waste would be
recyclable. Solid wastes would be routinely generated during the future operation of the commercial
businesses that are planned for the property, as described under Alternative 1.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have moderate short-term and minor long-term impacts on solid
waste management, as described under Alternative 1. The impacts would not be significant because of
the relatively small scale of the proposed reuse and redevelopment and the availability and capacity of
existing solid waste management programs in the City of Newport and Newport County.

7.8.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property there would be no
demand for water, electricity, or natural gas, nor would wastewater or solid waste be routinely generated.
Storm water runoff from the existing 187,310 square feet of impervious surface area would continue to be
managed in accordance with NAVSTA Newport’s Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
General Permit.

7.9

Cultural Resources

As discussed in Section 3.9, NEPA guidance requires the evaluation of impacts of a proposed action on
cultural resources, including archaeological resources and architectural or built resources (see Sections
7.9.1.1 and 7.9.1.2, respectively) as well as Native American resources (see Section 7.9.1.3). The Navy
has also evaluated the potential impacts of the proposed action in terms of their effects on cultural
resources that are historic properties, pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (see Section 7.9.1.4).

7.9.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.9.1.1
Archaeological Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have no direct impacts on archaeological resources because none are present within
the APE at the former Naval Hospital property. However, redevelopment implemented under Alternative
1 has the potential to result in indirect impacts on one archaeological resource, Site RI-2125 (the British
Transport Site), which is located outside of, but in the vicinity of, the APE at the former Naval Hospital
property. Site RI-2125 is considered historically important because it has been previously determined
NRHP-eligible. While this site is located outside of the APE for Alternative 1, the underwater setting of
this submerged archaeological site means that the site could be indirectly disturbed by activities within
the APE, such as on-site sediment disruption caused by the indirect actions of underwater waves or
currents or sediments that are dispersed through water from the APE. Impacts on this historically
important archaeological site are discussed in Section 7.9.1.4.
7.9.1.2
Architectural Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have direct impacts on architectural resources. Under Alternative 1, once the former
Naval Hospital property has been transferred out of Navy ownership, the majority of the existing
buildings and structures within the terrestrial portions of project area would be demolished except the pier
(Pier 71) and the retaining wall. Two of the six architectural resources that would be demolished
(Buildings 63 and 993) are not considered historically important because they are non-contributing
elements of the NRHP-eligible U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District, so demolition of these two
buildings would not require measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate these direct impacts. The retaining

Draft EIS

7-46

Former Naval Hospital Property

wall, which is also a non-contributing element of the historic district, would not be directly or indirectly
impacted by Alternative 1.
The four architectural resources that would be demolished (Buildings 1, 7, 45, and Quarters A and B) are
considered historically important because they are contributing elements of the NRHP-eligible U.S. Naval
Hospital Newport Historic District. The pier (Pier 71), which is also a historic resource because it is a
contributing element of the NRHP U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District, would not be
demolished but would be altered by the addition of concrete floating docks on the sides of the pier.
Impacts on historically important architectural resources are discussed in Section 7.9.1.4.
7.9.1.3
Native American Resources
As indicated in Section 6.9.3, the Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian tribes
regarding Native American resources within the APE at the former Naval Hospital property: the
Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head
(Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for copies of consultation letters). Consultation remains open.
7.9.1.4
NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties
Under Alternative 1, the transfer of the former Naval Hospital property out of federal ownership and the
subsequent redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property, particularly any in-water activities
associated with redevelopment such as the alteration of Pier 71, could result in adverse effects on the
NRHP-eligible 18th century shipwreck underwater archaeological site RI-2125 (the British Transport
Site). Site RI-2125 is located outside the APE for Alternative 1 and is not owned by the Navy or located
on Navy property. However, the underwater setting of this submerged archaeological site means that the
site could be indirectly affected by redevelopment activities within the APE, such as the in-water
construction or pile-driving that would result in on-site sediment disruption caused by underwater waves,
currents, or sediments dispersed through or carried by water (Kam 2015; Mueller 2015). The Navy is in
the process of consulting with the Rhode Island SHPO pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, including
consulting on the effects of the proposed action on historic properties within the APE (Preston 2013; Lin
2013; Sanderson 2013a, 2013b). As part of this ongoing consultation, the Rhode Island SHPO has
indicated that land off-shore of the former Naval Hospital property, which has not been surveyed as part
of this study, will need to be surveyed to determine if currently unknown significant sites are present.
Additionally, the Rhode Island SHPO has indicated that an evaluation of preservation or mitigation
options for the previously identified NRHP-eligible shipwreck site (RI-2125) must be conducted before
these offshore lands are disposed of by the Navy (Sanderson 2013b). The Navy has confirmed that the
Rhode Island SHPO should be consulted if any water-related construction is done in the future, although
the Navy does not own the shipwreck or any submerged land in the off-shore portions of the APE at the
former Naval Hospital property (Mueller 2015; Anderson 2015). The evaluation of the indirect impacts
and effects on this historic property will be updated upon completion of consultation with the Rhode
Island SHPO.
Under Alternative 1, the transfer of historic properties out of federal ownership or control, the subsequent
demolition of Buildings 1, 7, 45, and Quarters A and B, and the alteration of Pier 71, which are
contributing elements of the NRHP-eligible U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District, could be
considered an indirect adverse effect on historic properties without adequate and legally enforceable
restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property’s historic significance (ACHP
2004; 36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)(vii)). The Navy is in the process of consulting with the Rhode Island SHPO
pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, including consulting on the effects of the proposed action on
historic properties within the APE (Preston 2013; Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b). As part of this ongoing
consultation, the Rhode Island SHPO has acknowledged that once the Navy has disposed of the property,
subsequent redevelopment is outside of the Navy’s control and has indicated that a standard treatment to

Draft EIS

mitigate any indirect adverse effects of subsequent redevelopment on historic properties would be to
include a historic preservation provision in a deed of transfer (Sanderson 2013a). The evaluation of
impacts and effects on these historic properties will be updated upon completion of consultation with the
Rhode Island SHPO.

No Action Alternative

The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of the No Action alternative under NEPA and has
determined that the No Action alternative would have no impacts on archaeological resources because
none are present. The No Action alternative could result in direct impacts on architectural resources
resulting from continued deterioration of the buildings, particularly if routine maintenance activities
associated with the retention of the property by the U.S. government in caretaker status ceases or is
deferred.
The Navy has evaluated the Section 106 effects of the impacts of the No Action alternative and
determined that the No Action alternative could have an adverse effect on historic properties within the
APE at the former Naval Hospital property, including the NRHP-eligible U.S. Naval Hospital Newport
Historic District and Buildings 1, 7, and 45, Pier 71, and Quarters A and B, which are contributing
elements to the historic district. The No Action alternative could contribute to the historic district being
neglected in a manner that causes its deterioration (ACHP 2004; 36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)(vi)) or is otherwise
treated in a manner not consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing
Historic Buildings (Weeks and Grimmer 1995).

7.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the potential impacts on topography, geology, and soils resulting from the
implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative at the former Naval
Hospital property. This section also includes a discussion of the potential impacts on the bathymetry and
marine sediment present in Narragansett Bay off-shore of the former Naval Hospital property.

7.10.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The majority of proposed development would be located in areas that have been previously developed by
the Navy. (One building has been removed, the remaining buildings are vacant, and there are parking and
access areas on the property). Implementation of Alternative 1 (e.g., construction of new buildings,
parking lots, utilities) thus would be expected to result in minor impacts on topography and soils.
7.10.1.1 Topography
Under Alternative 1, development would largely occur in areas that have already been developed by the
Navy. These areas would have either been previously graded for development or are generally flat
(minimal topographic relief). Some alteration of existing topography would be expected as a result of
grading and associated cut-and–fill activities necessary to accommodate new building sites. The extent of
grading and cut-and-fill activities would be localized and would depend on the building design and
location. As a result of previous development associated with the site and preservation of open space
areas, impacts on topography would be minor, based on the size of the redevelopment project; no
significant impact would result.
7.10.1.2 Geology
Alternative 1 would not impact geologic resources at the former Naval Hospital property.
7.10.1.3 Soils
The majority of redevelopment proposed under Alternative 1 would be concentrated on approximately 4
acres of land in areas that have already been developed by the Navy. Since vacant buildings currently
exist on this property, it is assumed that urban/manmade soils located within these areas have been
modified from their original condition. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to
result in temporary and permanent minor impacts, based on the size of the redevelopment project, as new
structures and supporting infrastructure are constructed.
Erosion Potential
All soil types located at the former Naval Hospital property have the potential to be impacted by erosion
from wind, water, and construction activities. The soil erosion potential for the Newport-Urban land
complex is moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at a depth of 24” to 30,” which means the soils
are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff (USDA 2012; IWR 2002).
To varying degrees, all such soils may require specific measures to control soil erosion and limit runoff of
sediment during clearing and construction activities. In addition, construction activities (clearing, grading,
landscaping, and moving equipment, material, and vehicles) would expose soils to wind and storm water
erosion, compaction, and rutting.
Soils would be impacted during implementation of Alternative 1, but the impact would be mitigated by
using temporary erosion and sediment control measures during construction, permanent storm water
management measures, and appropriate building site location and design. Soils can be affected by
sedimentation when soils from exposed areas are deposited over undisturbed areas after water runoff.
Because existing vegetation is limited to maintained grass, with some trees, and the topography is flat,
there would be no need to stabilize the slopes following vegetation removal.
To mitigate these impacts, it is expected that the developer would implement appropriate erosion and
sediment control measures at construction and demolition sites in accordance with the Rhode Island Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (RIDEM et al. 1989) and other applicable state laws. The
handbook describes structural measures (e.g., grassed waterway, sediment basin, riprap, etc.) and nonstructural measures (e.g., mulching, topsoiling, silt curtains, etc.). RIDEM requires a General Permit,

Construction Activity, for projects that disturb more than 1 acre (RIDEM 2013c). Before approval of a
Construction General Permit, RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a
discussion of erosion and sediment controls. Additionally, the developer will be required to comply with
the provisions of City of Newport’s Code of Ordinances, Chapter 15.26, Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control.
Farmland
Soils located at the former Naval Hospital property are not rated for farmland.
Hydric Soils
The soils on the property are non-hydric and thus reuse of the existing structures at the former Naval
Hospital property would have no impact on hydric soils. However, non-hydric soils can contain hydric
inclusions and hydric soils can contain non-hydric soils. Therefore, new construction under Alternative 1
could impact hydric soils (if the non-hydric soils contained hydric inclusions). Hydric soils may be
associated with wetlands that are subject to regulation by federal and/or state regulation. Hydric soils also
may require special measures during construction or other uses to overcome limitations caused by
wetness. Limitations may include a high water table or low strength for supporting construction
equipment and structures. Hydric soils may also present limitations on development activities (e.g.,
excavation and movement of heavy equipment) due to wet conditions.
Constructability
Newport-Urban land complex soil at the former Naval Hospital property poses moderate constraints on
residential or commercial development that would use on-site septic tank systems; however, on-site septic
would not be used for redevelopment, as centralized sewer facilities are assumed to be part of the
redevelopment.
The more common sources of constructability limitations for the soils include shallow excavations (slight
limitations due to dense to very dense soils), moderate frost action, and a moderate slope. The moderate
frost action is unfavorable, but limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning or design.
These soils are dense to very dense, which makes excavation difficult, but there is a low shrink-swell
potential. However, because much of the area where these soils are located may be modified, it is not
possible to determine the magnitude or severity of the limitations based on available information. Before
construction, engineering evaluations will be completed and appropriate engineering techniques identified
to mitigate any soil limitations.
Organic Soils
None of the soils located at the former Naval Hospital property are listed as organic soils.
In summary, impacts on soils under Alternative 1 would be minor, and mitigation would reduce
temporary impacts. Mitigation will include implementation of appropriate erosion and sediment control
measures in accordance with local and state laws and the Construction General Permit, as discussed in
detail above.
7.10.1.4 Bathymetry
Under Alternative 1, installation of the piles associated with the floating docks would displace a volume
of sediment at least equal to the volume of pilings below the subsurface. The number of pilings needed
would be determined during the pier design stage; however, displacement of sediment in Narragansett
Bay associated with the pilings would result in a minor short-term impact on bathymetry due to the small
amount of bottom sediment to be removed.

Draft EIS

7-50

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

7.10.1.5 Marine Sediment
As indicated above, installation of the piles associated with the floating docks would displace a volume of
sediment at least equal to the volume of pilings below the subsurface. However, the impact on marine
sediments would be minor and short-term during the construction period and localized within the Bay and
is not expected to affect the overall marine sediment dynamics in the Bay.

7.10.2

Alternative 2

Similar to Alternative 1, the majority of proposed development would be in areas that have already been
developed by the Navy. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 (e.g., construction of new buildings,
parking lots, utilities) would be expected to result in minor impacts on topography and soils.
7.10.2.1 Topography
Impacts on topography under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed above for Alternative 1.
7.10.2.2 Geology
Alternative 2 would not impact the geologic resources at the former Naval Hospital property.
7.10.2.3 Soils
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have impacts on soils similar to those for
Alternative 1, including impacts associated with erosion potential, hydric soils, and constructability. As
with Alternative 1, the proposed redevelopment would be concentrated in areas that have been previously
developed by the Navy. Alternative 2 would result in approximately 5 acres of disturbance associated
with the redevelopment footprint, compared with 4 acres under Alternative 1, due to the addition of the
yacht club/office, greater site access, and decrease in the amount of open space. These would be minor
impacts and mitigation would reduce temporary impacts. The same mitigation measures discussed for
Alternative 1 will be implemented to minimize soil impacts.
7.10.2.4 Bathymetry
Impacts on bathymetry under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1.
7.10.2.5 Marine Sediment
Impacts on marine sediment under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1.

7.10.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at the former Naval Hospital property by
the U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur on the property. As a
result, the No Action alternative would be expected to have no direct or indirect impacts on topography,
geology, soils, bathymetry, or marine sediment.

7.11 Water Resources

This section summarizes the potential environmental impacts on water resources resulting from
implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative at the former Naval
Hospital property. It includes a discussion of surface water, water quality, groundwater, floodplains,
wetlands, and proposed mitigation measures.

Draft EIS

7-51

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

7.11.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.11.1.1 Surface Water
Redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would have direct impacts on surface water, by
disturbing the sediment and substrate of Narragansett Bay during pile installation. Installation of the
pilings to support the floating docks would also result in filling in the floodplain and coastal wetlands in
Narragansett Bay. These impacts are discussed under Sections 7.11.1.3 and 7.11.1.4, respectively.
Indirect impacts on Narragansett Bay are discussed below in Section 7.11.1.2.
To protect surface water, the future developer would be required to consult with the USACE, EPA, and
RIDEM, for any in-water work associated with the construction of the floating docks at the former Naval
Hospital property for potential impacts regulated under Sections 401 and 404 of the CWA (discussed in
Section 7.11.1.5) and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Given the BMPs developed
during future permitting of the redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any adverse impacts
associated with surface waters would be minor and the disposal and future reuse of the Naval Hospital
property would be in compliance with the CWA.
7.11.1.2 Water Quality
Redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property could have indirect impacts on Narragansett Bay.
Temporary indirect impacts on Narragansett Bay in the form of erosion or sedimentation could result
from construction activities, both land-based and in-water. All redevelopment will require compliance
with applicable local and state laws and regulations pertaining to storm water management. These include
the City of Newport Code of Ordinances Chapter 15.26, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control and Chapter
17.88, Development Plan Review, and the RIDEM Construction General Permit (see also Section 7.8.1.3,
Storm Water).
In accordance with these ordinances, before redevelopment, the developer would be required to receive a
permit from the City of Newport. Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented in accordance
with both Chapter 15.26 of the Code of Ordinances and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment
Control Handbook (as amended) (RIDEM et al. 1989). As part of the development plan review process
(Chapter 17.88 of the Code of Ordinances), a storm water management plan must be prepared.
Additionally, a Construction General Permit would be required from the RIDEM for disturbing land that
is larger than 1 acre. Compliance with these laws and regulations and implementation of BMPs would
decrease the magnitude of impacts on water quality from storm water runoff.
Redevelopment of the pier would require in-water work. After constructing two 8-foot by 90-foot
concrete floating docks, the docks would be anchored in place with pilings and cables. It is assumed that
the pilings would be square pre-stressed concrete piles measuring 1 foot by 1 foot. Installing the concrete
pilings would have a minor impact on surface water and water quality in Narragansett Bay from resuspension of sediments as the pilings are driven into the sediment and substrate. As shown on Figure
6.10-3, marine sediments in the vicinity of the pier are silty sand. At this time, it is expected that the
pilings would be constructed off-site, cured, and then driven into the substrate cured. During
construction, sediment would be displaced as the pilings are embedded in bottom sediments. This would
displace a volume of sediment at least equal to the volume of the pilings below the subsurface. The
displaced sediment and the turbidity would settle soon thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several
hours). Anchoring construction vessels may additionally scour the substrate of Narragansett Bay and
cause an increase in suspended sediment in the construction site area.
Once in place, concrete pilings would not impact surface water because concrete is an inert material and
not chemically coated. Thus, construction of the new concrete pilings and sediment re-suspension during

Draft EIS

7-52

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

construction activities would have only a minor, short-term impact on surface waters and water quality in
Narragansett Bay.
Construction vessel operation could also impact water quality through debris and trash losses, deck
drainage, wastewater discharges, bilge pumping, vessel transport, and anchoring. Debris and trash are
frequently associated with construction sites and may float, sink, or become suspended in the water
column. Debris and trash may contain plastics, petroleum, or other biohazards that can be transported
through currents to other areas.
Deck drainage is runoff that is introduced to the natural system during deck cleanings or as wash from
rainfall. Drop pan and work areas are other sources of deck drainage, which often includes petroleum.
Extra efforts will be made to avoid any and all oil spills. The potential for petroleum run-off, for
example, may be mitigated by installing gutters and filtration devices along the deck. In the event of an
accidental spill, the construction contractor would implement an emergency response plan.
Recreational vessel traffic would increase in Narragansett Bay offshore of the former Naval Hospital
property as a result of the implementation of Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1. However, as
Narragansett Bay is already used by boaters, impacts from the additional recreational vessel traffic (e.g.,
propeller wash and potential for spills) in the offshore area at the former Naval Hospital property would
be negligible.
Full build-out under Alternative 1 is projected to result in a total of 4.5 acres (195,243 square feet) of
impervious surface area, which would be composed mostly of building roofs and parking areas. This
would be a net increase of approximately 0.2 acres above existing conditions (4.3 acres) (see Section
7.8.1.3 for a complete listing of these impervious surfaces). The additional impervious surface area would
generate a long-term increase in precipitation runoff into the watershed and ultimately to waterbodies in
the area, including Narragansett Bay. (See Appendix D-4 for more information on the methodology,
assumptions, and calculations used to project the impervious surface area resulting from implementation
of Alternative 1.)
Erosion, sedimentation, resuspension, and storm water runoff could collectively impact the water quality
of Narragansett Bay. As described in Section 6.11, the section of the Newport Harbor/Coddington Cove
located north of the Training Station Road bridge in Newport does not support the fish and wildlife
habitat designated use because the sediments in that area require monitoring (RIDEM 2012a). This area is
approximately 0.6 miles north of the former Naval Hospital property and its offshore waters. Increased resuspension and sedimentation from construction activities are not anticipated to impact this already
impaired waterbody because of its distance from the site and because the existing impairment stems from
contaminated sediment.
Alternative 1 would result in minor impacts on water quality, and mitigation, as outlined above, would
reduce adverse impacts. The future developer would be required to consult with the USACE, EPA, and
RIDEM under the CWA to minimize any adverse impacts on water quality. Given the BMPs developed
during permitting of the future redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any adverse impacts on
water quality would be minor and the disposal and future reuse of the Naval Hospital property would be
in compliance with the CWA.
7.11.1.3 Groundwater
As described in Section 6.11.3, the water table is less than 6 feet from the surface of the primary soil type
at the former Naval Hospital property. Construction activities could extend below ground surface to a
depth that would directly impact the underlying water table. The developer/contractor would be required
to use standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion sediment control plans and BMPs that would

Former Naval Hospital Property

involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate discharge location, removing sediment from
collected water, and preserving downgradient natural resources. Potential spills of fuels or other
chemicals and hazardous materials could occur during construction activities. Impacts on groundwater
resources would be minimized through compliance with storm water permits and management plans and
implementation of BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards
Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on groundwater would result; mitigation will reduce
adverse construction impacts.
7.11.1.4 Floodplains
Under Alternative 1, approximately 1.6 acres of the 100-year floodplain would be permanently impacted
by the proposed redevelopment features. As shown in Figure 7.11-1, floodplains are located along Third
Street and along the shoreline. A portion of the redevelopment footprint (i.e., the hotel, residential units,
and paved access) along the eastern property boundary would be located within the 100-year floodplain.
The area slated for the proposed hotel and access ways is currently developed with buildings and
pavement and other impervious surfaces that do not provide flood storage capacity. Therefore,
redevelopment of this portion of the property would have a negligible effect on floodplain storage
capacity.
A portion of the path through the proposed waterfront park as well as the floating piers would also be
located within the 100-year floodplain of Narragansett Bay. Approximately 0.06 acres of the path would
be located within the floodplain. The floating docks would comprise an area of approximately 0.03 acres
and would be associated with an undetermined number of concrete pilings to anchor the docks into place.
Conservatively estimating, these floating docks could result in a corresponding 0.03 acres of fill in the
form of the pilings; however, the final design would determine the actual location of the pilings. In the
absence of hydraulic modeling, it is assumed that the approximately 0.09 acres of permanent floodplain
fill would not result in a loss of floodplain storage capacity or a rise in the 100-year floodplain for
Narragansett Bay.
The future developer of the former Naval Hospital property will be required to minimize or offset impacts
from redevelopment that could potentially degrade floodplain values13 and increase the flood risk to
upstream and downstream activities and will be subject to the permitting and regulatory requirements that
exist at the local, state, or federal level. The local building permit process in the City of Newport will
require that site plans be prepared showing flood hazard areas, floodways, and design flood elevations.
Additionally, the building permit application must include flood design data.
At the state level, the buildings proposed in the flood hazard zones (a portion of the hotel and a small
portion of residential use) will be required to meet the specific requirements for flood zone construction
included in the Rhode Island State Building Code (RISBC). Additionally, the CRMC requires all
applicants proposing construction within flood hazard areas to demonstrate that all portions of the RISBC
are to be met. Therefore, Alternative 1 would result in moderate impacts on floodplains.
7.11.1.5 Wetlands
The former Naval Hospital property has one linear estuarine and marine wetland located along the
shoreline. The only redevelopment feature within this wetland under Alternative 1 is a portion of one of
the floating docks, the construction of which would result in approximately 0.04 acre of impact (see
Figure 7.11-1). Conservatively estimating, this floating dock could result in a corresponding 0.04 acre of
13

Floodplains provide many natural values, including storing flood waters, stabilizing the shoreline in coastal
areas, providing habitat for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife, controlling erosion and sedimentation, and improving
water quality by filtering pollutants.

fill in the form of the pilings to be used to anchor the floating dock in place; however, final design would
determine the actual location of the piling(s).
Filling a coastal wetland requires a permit from the CRMC and a permit from the USACE under Section
404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the developer will be required to coordinate wetland
mitigation plans with the USACE and CRMC. For the CRMC, filling in a coastal wetland located in a
Type 4 water is considered an alteration of a coastal wetland under Section 300.12 of the CRMC
regulations, and requires a Category A assent. Section 300.12(F), Coastal Wetland Mitigation, outlines
the mitigation requirements for alterations to coastal wetlands. As indicated in the regulations, the
following requirements apply:
•

Replacement by a similar type of wetland, which provides an ecological value equal to or
greater than that of the altered wetland

•

A 2:1 mitigation ratio for the area of coastal wetland restored to the area permanently
altered or lost.

Section 404 of the CWA authorizes the USACE to issue permits regulating the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the U.S., including wetlands. The USACE and the EPA issued regulations
governing compensatory mitigation for authorized impacts on wetlands; these are codified in 40 CFR Part
230 as the Final Rule for Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources. Compensation
requirements typically vary based on the impacted wetland communities. Specific mitigation
requirements for future development projects would be determined in coordination with the USACE and
CRMC. Therefore, Alternative 1 may result in potential impacts on wetlands, but future development
conducted in compliance with existing CWA regulations would ensure that any impacts on wetlands
would be minor, as any permanent impacts would be mitigated through the USACE’s compensatory
mitigation process under Section 404 of the CWA.

7.11.2

Alternative 2

7.11.2.1 Surface Water
Impacts on surface water under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed under Alternative 1.
Direct impacts on surface waters would result due to pile driving. Indirect impacts, in the form of
sedimentation and turbidity would result, with the potential of being slightly greater than under
Alternative 1.
Similar to Alternative 1 to protect surface water, the future developer would be required to consult with
the USACE, EPA, and RIDEM, for any in-water work associated with the construction of the floating
docks at the former Naval Hospital property for potential impacts regulated under Sections 401 and 404
of the CWA (discussed in Section 7.11.1.5 above) and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of
1899. Given the BMPs developed during future permitting of the redevelopment, the Navy has
determined that any adverse impacts associated with surface waters would be minor and the disposal and
future reuse of the Naval Hospital property would be in compliance with the CWA.
7.11.2.2 Water Quality
Similar to Alternative 1, the redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property under Alternative 2
could have indirect impacts on Narragansett Bay. Indirect impacts on Narragansett Bay in the form of
erosion or sedimentation could temporarily result from construction activities, both land-based and inwater. These impacts could be potentially greater under Alternative 2 due to the increased area of
redevelopment and impervious surface, which would result in additional disturbance. All redevelopment
would require compliance with applicable local and state laws and regulations pertaining to storm water

management. These include the City of Newport Code of Ordinances Chapter 15.26, Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control; Chapter 17.88, Development Plan Review; and the RIDEM Construction General
Permit.
As under Alternative 1, construction vessel operation could also impact water quality through debris and
trash losses, deck drainage, wastewater discharges, bilge pumping, vessel travel, and anchoring.
Anchoring construction vessels may additionally scour the sediment bed and cause an increase in
suspended sediment in the construction site area. Extra efforts will be implemented to avoid any and all
oil spills. The potential for petroleum run-off, for example, may be mitigated by installing gutters and
filtration devices along the deck. In the event of an accidental spill, the construction contractor would
implement an emergency response plan.
Recreational vessel traffic would increase in Narragansett Bay offshore of the former Naval Hospital as a
result of the implementation of Alternative 2. However, as Narragansett Bay is already used by boaters,
impacts from the additional recreational vessel traffic associated with use of the offshore area at the
former Naval Hospital would be negligible.
Full build-out of Alternative 2 is projected to result in a total of 4.8 acres (210,410 square feet) of
impervious surface area, which would be composed mostly of building roofs and parking areas. This
would be a net increase of approximately 0.5 acres above existing conditions (4.3 acres) (see also Section
7.8.1.3). The additional impervious surface area would generate a long-term increase in precipitation
runoff into the watershed and, ultimately, to waterbodies in the area, including Narragansett Bay. For
more information on the methodology, assumptions, and calculations used to project the impervious
surface area resulting from implementation of Alternative 1, see Appendix D-4.
Similar to Alternative 1, construction and operations associated with redevelopment of the former Naval
Hospital property under Alternative 2 are not expected to impact the already impaired water quality of the
Newport Harbor/Coddington Cove, located approximated 0.6 miles to the north.
Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts on water quality, and mitigation, as outlined above, would
reduce adverse impacts. The future developer would be required to consult with the USACE, EPA, and
RIDEM under the CWA to minimize any adverse impacts on water quality. Given the BMPs developed
during permitting of the future redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any adverse impacts on
water quality would be minor and the disposal and future reuse of the Naval Hospital property would be
in compliance with the CWA.
7.11.2.3 Groundwater
Similar to Alternative 1, construction activities could extend below ground surface to a depth that would
directly impact the underlying water table. The developer/contractor would be required to use standard
dewatering techniques and follow erosion and sediment control plans and BMPs that would involve
preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate discharge location, removing sediment from collected water,
and preserving downgradient natural resources. Potential spills of fuels or other chemicals and hazardous
materials could occur during construction activities. Impacts on groundwater resources would be
minimized through compliance with storm water permits and management plans and implementation of
BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM
and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on groundwater would result; mitigation would reduce adverse
construction impacts.

7.11.2.4 Floodplains
Approximately 1.6 acres of 100-year floodplain would be permanently impacted by the proposed
redevelopment features of Alternative 2, the same acreage impacted as under Alternative 1. As shown in
Figure 7.11-2, floodplains are located along Third Street and along the shoreline. A portion of the
redevelopment footprint (i.e., the hotel, conference center, commercial use, and paved access) along the
eastern property boundary would be located within a 100-year floodplain. The area slated for the
proposed hotel and driveways is currently developed with buildings and pavement and other impervious
surfaces that do not provide flood storage capacity. Therefore, redevelopment of this portion of the
property would have a negligible effect on floodplain storage capacity.
Similar to Alternative 1, a portion of the path through the proposed waterfront park as well as the floating
piers would also be located within the 100-year floodplain of Narragansett Bay. Approximately 0.06 acres
of the path would be located within the floodplain. The floating docks would comprise an area of
approximately 0.03 acres and would be associated with an undetermined number of concrete pilings to
anchor the docks into place; the third floating dock at the end of the pier under Alternative 2 would not be
located within the 100-year floodplain, as indicated on Figure 7.11-2. Using the most conservative
estimate, these floating docks could result in a corresponding 0.03 acres of fill in the form of the pilings;
however, final design would determine the actual location of the pilings. In the absence of hydraulic
modeling, it is assumed that the approximately 0.09 acres of permanent floodplain fill would not result in
a loss of floodplain storage capacity nor a rise in the 100-year floodplain for the Narragansett Bay.
The future developer of the former Naval Hospital property will be required to minimize or offset impacts
from redevelopment that could potentially degrade floodplain values and increase the flood risk to
upstream and downstream activities and will be subject to the permitting and regulatory requirements that
exist at the local, state, or federal level. The local building permit process in the City of Newport will
require that site plans be prepared showing flood hazard areas, floodways, and design flood elevations.
Additionally, the building permit application must include flood design data.
At the state level, the buildings proposed to be constructed in the flood hazard zones (a portion of the
hotel and a small portion of commercial uses) will be required to meet the specific requirements for flood
zone construction included in the RISBC. Additionally, the CRMC requires all applicants proposing
construction within flood hazard areas to demonstrate that all portions of the RISBC are to be met.
Therefore, Alternative 2 would result in moderate impacts on floodplains.
7.11.2.5 Wetlands
The only redevelopment feature within the coastal wetland under Alternative 2 is a portion of one of the
floating docks, resulting in approximately 0.04 acre of impact (see Figure 7.11-2), the same size of impact
as discussed under Alternative 1 due to the similar sized floating docks. Using the most conservative
estimate, this floating dock could result in a corresponding 0.04 acres of fill in the form of the pilings to
be used to anchor the floating dock in place; however, final design would determine the actual location of
the piling(s).
Filling a coastal wetland requires a permit from the CRMC and a permit from the USACE under Section
404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the developer will be required to coordinate wetland
mitigation plans with the USACE and CRMC. Under the CRMC, Section 300.12(F), Coastal Wetland
Mitigation outlines the mitigation requirements for alterations to coastal wetlands. As indicated in the
regulations, the following requirements apply:
•

greater than that of the altered wetland

•

A 2:1 mitigation ratio for the area of coastal wetland restored to the area permanently
altered or lost.

Section 404 of the CWA authorizes the USACE to issue permits regulating the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Compensation requirements typically vary based
on the impacted wetland communities. Specific mitigation requirements for future development projects
would be determined in coordination with the USACE and CRMC. Therefore, Alternative 2 may result in
potential impacts on wetlands, but future development conducted in compliance with existing CWA
regulations would ensure that any impacts on wetlands would be minor, as any permanent impacts would
be mitigated through the USACE’s compensatory mitigation process under Section 404 of the CWA.

7.11.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property there would be no
impacts on water resources from redevelopment. Some storm water runoff would continue to occur from
the existing approximately 4.3 acres of impervious surface area.

7.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the potential impacts on biological resources at the former Naval Hospital
property from the implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It
includes an examination of impacts on vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, and
significant wildlife habitat from disposal and reuse of the former Naval Hospital property.
GIS analysis was used to determine potential impacts on vegetative communities and wildlife habitat
from implementation of the redevelopment alternatives.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, any future reuse of the
former Naval Hospital property would be required to comply with local, state, and federal laws and
regulations pertaining to biological resources. Specifically, consultation with the USFWS and NMFS for
any species protected under the ESA would be required for any activities proposed within habitat known
to support state-listed threatened or endangered species. The USFWS and RIDEM have indicated that no
federally or state-listed or candidate species are located on the former Naval Hospital property (Chapman
2013; Jordan 2013); however, the NMFS has indicated the potential presence of several marine mammals
and fish offshore of the former Naval Hospital property (Colligan 2013). Because of the length of time
assumed between consultation for this EIS and the actual redevelopment of this surplus property, future
consultation will be necessary. Additionally, in-water construction activities by a future developer would
likely require Section 10 and/or Section 404 permits from the USACE. As a federally permitted project,
USFWS and NMFS would be responsible for reviewing impacts on fish and wildlife pursuant to the Fish
and Wildlife Coordination Act and the ESA.

7.12.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

7.12.1.1 Vegetation
The majority of proposed development for Alternative 1 would be located in areas within the current
development footprint (i.e., buildings and pavement). As such, implementation of Alternative 1 would
result in minor long-term impacts on upland vegetation. Implementation of the Redevelopment Plan under
Alternative 1 would not change the current acreage of habitat cover at the former Naval Hospital
property. Previously developed areas would be used and new development would be sited within these
areas, with the exception of the approximately 0.10-acre path through the waterfront park and the boat
storage facility, which would be located within the footprint of the former chapel.

Former Naval Hospital Property

Approximately 1.8 acres of the site would be maintained as open space, in addition to the approximately 2
acres that would comprise the waterfront park. The area proposed for the waterfront park would largely
comprise the maintained grass and trees that currently exist. Temporary indirect impacts in this area in the
form of temporary disturbance could occur during construction because it is next to areas that would be
disturbed during construction. However, following redevelopment, any temporarily disturbed areas
designated as waterfront park will be restored to existing conditions.
Marine/Estuarine Wetland
Approximately 0.04 acres of marine/estuarine wetland along the shoreline would be impacted by the
concrete pilings associated with the floating docks under Alternative 1 (see Figure 7.12-1). These pilings
would be considered wetland fill. The total amount of wetland fill would be determined during the final
design of the pier redevelopment project because the proposed design is for analysis purposes and a final
design would be part of the actions taken after property transfer.
Beach
Under Alternative 1, there would be no permanent impact on existing beach habitat. Temporary
disturbance of beach habitat could occur during construction of the floating docks, but any areas disturbed
by equipment staging or other activities will be restored following completion of construction.
7.12.1.2

Wildlife

Terrestrial Mammals
As indicated above, the majority of the proposed redevelopment would take place within the existing
development footprint, and vegetation disturbance would be limited. Wildlife species may be temporarily
displaced in peripheral areas during construction, when noise and human activity levels increase. Species
that would be most affected include those with relatively small home ranges. During construction, shortterm impacts may include displacement of mobile species such as eastern gray squirrel, common raccoon,
Virginia opossum, white-footed mouse, woodchuck, and striped skunk. These species would avoid areas
of construction where equipment and human activities create disturbance. Minor impacts on terrestrial
mammals would result from the implementation of Alternative 1.
Marine Mammals
Construction under Alternative 1 at the former Naval Hospital property includes in-water work to build
two concrete floating docks along the existing pier. Once complete, each floating dock would measure 8
feet x 90 feet and would be anchored by pilings and cables. Construction of the floating docks would
disturb open water habitat (in the form of hydroacoustic noise) at the former Naval Hospital property as
well as the substrate.
While construction would occur in water, it is unlikely that the activity would result in a take of a marine
mammal. As discussed in Section 6.12.2, harbor seals are frequently found at Coddington Cove, north of
the former Naval Hospital complex. Additional marine mammals with the potential to be present offshore are discussed in Section 7.12.1.3 below. Marine mammals are likely to avoid the area during
construction activities. However, if a marine mammal such as a harbor seal or harbor porpoise were to
stray into the waters immediately adjacent to the former Naval Hospital property, potential short-term
negligible impacts would be related to noise generated during construction activities.
Activities assumed to have hydroacoustic noise impacts include the following: installing concrete piers
using a diesel impact hammer, dredging with a clamshell bucket, and possible piling removal. Pilings
would be removed by either direct-pull or vibratory extraction. New pilings would be installed using an
impact hammer, in addition to a barge with a crane. Other noise would also be generated by support
vessels, small boat traffic, and barge-mounted equipment; however, this other noise is likely consistent

with existing vessel traffic in the Bay and in the nearby NAVSTA Newport and East Passage Yachting
Center/Melville marinas.
The focus of this analysis is the hydroacoustic noise impacts of pile driving; non-hydroacoustic noise
impacts are discussed in Section 7.7. Other noise would also be generated by construction vessels and
barge-mounted equipment; however, these noises are not likely to create a short-term adverse effect on
marine mammals. Marine mammals in the area are already exposed to similar noise levels from existing
vessel traffic in the Bay and in the nearby NAVSTA Newport and the East Passage Yachting
Center/Melville marinas. Pile-driving associated with the proposed action would result in increased
underwater noise levels, potentially affecting marine mammals found in Narragansett Bay.
Three metrics are commonly used in evaluating hydroacoustic impacts on fish and marine mammals (ICF
Jones and Stokes 2009; Illingworth and Rodkin 2007):
•

Peak sound pressure level (LPeak) – The absolute value of the maximum variation from
neutral

•

Root mean square (RMS) – The square root of the sum of the squares of the pressure
contained within a defined period of time

•

Sound exposure level (SEL) – The constant sound level over 1 second.

Sound in the water has different properties than sound in the air. Sound moves 4.5 times faster in water
than it does in air, making it a very effective sensory mechanism for species that spend a large part, if not
all of their life, underwater. Similar to in-air sound, in-water sound uses the decibel (dB) scale for
measurement; however, the reference pressure in water is referenced at (re) 1 micro Pascal (μPa), whereas
in air it is re 20 μPa.
Potential impacts on marine mammals due to pile driving include auditory injury or permanent threshold
shift (PTS) in hearing, temporary threshold shift (TTS), and behavioral disturbance. PTS refers to
permanent hearing loss, whereas TTS refers to a temporary elevation in a hearing threshold. Marine
mammal behavioral responses to sound are highly variable and situation-specific (Bailey et al. 2010).
To address potential impacts of pile driving on fish and marine mammals, available research was
reviewed for similar pile types and sizes and the sound measured during pile driving. One of the primary
documents reviewed was the Compendium of Pile Driving Sound Data (Illingworth and Rodkin 2007).
This document provides information on sound pressures resulting from pile driving measured throughout
Northern California. The information presented in the compendium can be used to predict underwater
sound levels from marine pile-driving projects and determine the effectiveness of measures used to
control the noise (Illingworth and Rodkin 2007). This compendium includes information on major and
minor projects with a variety of different pile and hammer types that were completed.
Eight projects involving concrete piles, ranging from 16 to 24 inches, were reviewed for inclusion in the
compendium section on concrete piles. Based on these projects, average sound pressure for near-source
(10 meters or approximately 33 feet) unattenuated sound pressures for in-water pile driving using an
impact hammer for a 24-inch concrete pile were summarized and are provided in Table 7.12-1. (Note:
This pile size is larger than that to be used for the piles that are part of the proposed action; those piles are
12-inch concrete piles.) As indicated in Table 7.12-1, the peak average sound pressure was 185 dB re
1µPa. The findings in Table 7.12-1 are similar to typical sound levels associated with a 24-inch concrete
pile as reported in the Technical Guidance for Assessment and Mitigation of the Hydroacoustic Effects of
Pile Driving on Fish (ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin 2009), a document used in the
preparation of the Ocean SAMP.

Three of the eight projects included in the compendium are summarized below (Illingworth and Rodkin
2007).

Draft EIS

•

Pier project at Concord Naval Weapons Station, CA – This project involved pile driving
16-inch concrete piles to a depth of 10 meters (33 feet) by steam-powered drop hammer;
underwater sound measurements were taken at approximately 10 meters (33 feet) from
the piles. Measurements made during the driving of unattenuated piles in approximately 7
meters (24 feet) of water yielded peak pressure levels of 176 to 186 dB re 1µPa and RMS
sound pressure levels of 165 to 173 dB re 1µPa. An air bubble curtain system was used
for two of the seven piles to compare the effects of sound attenuation. The air bubble
curtain attenuated sound pressures by approximately 5 to 8 dB re 1µPa at one of the piles,
and 0 to 4 dB re 1µPa at the other due to the effects of the tidal current.

•

Pier project in Benicia, CA – This project involved 24-inch octagonal concrete piles.
Water depth at the piles was 3 to7 meters (10 to 23 feet) and water depth at measurement
locations ranged from 4 to 13 meters (13 to 43 feet). Piles were driven to a depth of
approximately 25 to 30 meters (82 to98 feet) below mud line using a diesel impact
hammer. An air bubble attenuation system was used and sound measurements were made
at 10 meters (33 feet) for all piles and at 20 meters (66 feet) for some. Peak sound
pressures for unattenuated piles were typically 180 to 183 dB re 1µPa. RMS levels for
unattenuated piles typically ranged from 168 to 172 dB re 1µPa. With sound attenuation,
in shallower waters, the attenuation system was found to reduce sound pressures by 15 to
20 dB re 1µPa.

•

Pier project as part of marina construction in San Francisco, CA – Eight square, 24-inch
piles were driven with a diesel impact hammer. Water depth ranged from 2.5 to 4 meters
(8 to 13 feet); sound measurements were taken at 10 meters (33 feet) from the piles. With
the hammer set on a higher fuel setting, average and maximum sound levels at 10 meters
(33 feet) were 185 and 190 dB re 1µPa peak and 172 and 177 dB re 1µPa RMS,
respectively. At 20 meters (66 feet), sound pressure levels were about 3 to 5 dB lower.
On the lowest fuel setting, average and maximum sound levels at 10 meters (33 feet)
were 175 and 178 dB re 1µPa peak and 162 and 165 dB re 1µPa RMS respectively. At 20
meters (66 feet), sound levels were about 10 dB re 1µPa lower.

NMFS-developed criteria for estimating the effects of noise on marine mammals. These criteria
indicate that underwater SPLs above 190 dB re 1µPa RMS could cause injury (Level A harassment) in
pinnipeds 14. SPLs above 180 dB re 1µPa RMS could cause injury (Level A harassment) in cetaceans 15
(Illingworth and Rodkin 2007) (see Table 7.12-2).

Noise on Marine Mammals

Level A Injury (Cetaceans)
Level B Harassment/Behavior

190 dB re 1µPa (impulse)
180 dB re 1µPa (impulse)
160 dB re 1µPa (impulse)

The MMPA prohibits the intentional harassment of marine mammals. NMFS defines harassment as “any
act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine
mammal stock in the wild (Level A harassment) or has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or
marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption to behavioral patterns, including, but not limited
to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering (Level B harassment).”
To determine potential effects of in-water sound on marine mammals it is important to understand both
the potential source level and how the sound will travel away from that source. As sound travels away
from a source it loses power with increasing distance. This is known as transmission loss (TL). How a
sound travels away from a source depends on a variety of factors, including the original source level, the
local salinity and water temperature, substrate composition, and water depth.
Considering these components can help to determine the path that the sound could travel through the
water column. However, because it is not always possible to obtain all this information to determine sitespecific TL, as with Alternative 1, the NMFS recognizes the practical spreading loss model as the best
method to generally determine how sound could travel away from a source if modeling the site-specific
TL is not possible.
As noted above, the source level information available is mostly for 24-inch diameter concrete piles in
various water depths. Using these source levels would likely overestimate the potential ensonified area
during pile driving because the proposed action would be associated with 12-inch diameter concrete piles.
Therefore, the most applicable source levels are those reported from the 16-inch diameter concrete pile
driven in approximately 7 meters (23 feet) of water. While the pile diameter is 4 inches larger than those
proposed for use in Alternative 1, this represents the best available information. To be conservative, the
source levels used for TL analysis were those indicated as the highest source levels within the range
recorded for the 16-inch diameter concrete piles (see Table 7.12-3). Also, as this set of source levels did
not report the SEL, the SEL from the previously reported 24-inch diameter concrete piles (see Table
7.12-1) is used. It can be assumed that this is also a conservative estimate, as the SEL from impact pile
driving a smaller concrete pile is expected to be less.
Using this information as a reference source level, the practical spreading loss model was used to
determine the distance from the source where each species hearing threshold would be reached (Table
7.12-4).

Notes:
N/A = Not applicable because the source level of the impact hammer (16-inch concrete pile: 169 dB re
1µPa RMS) is less than that of the injury threshold for cetaceans (180 dB re 1µPa RMS) and
pinnipeds (190 dB re 1µPa RMS)

A comparison of the NMFS criteria for estimating effects of noise on marine mammals with the estimated
TL ranges in Table 7.12-4 indicates there is no risk of injury to either cetaceans or pinnipeds as a result of
impact pile driving concrete piles. According to the reference source levels, impact pile driving of 16-inch
diameter concrete piles would produce SPLs of approximately 169 dB re 1µPa RMS at 33 feet from the
source (unattenuated). This source level is less than NMFS Level A threshold criteria for both pinnipeds
and cetaceans. Therefore, no marine mammals would be injured as a result of Alternative 1. Although
there is the potential for Level B behavioral harassment within 130 feet of active impact pile driving, it is
expected that the implementation of possible mitigation measures such as the use of a bubble curtain
would reduce the source level and, therefore, the distance to the threshold range for Level B harassment.
A bubble curtain is a type of sound attenuating measure that can have two effects on sound: 1) acting as a
barrier for the sound to pass through once the sound is radiated from the pile; and 2) reducing the
radiation of sound from the pile into the water through the presence of low-density bubbles very close to
the pile (ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin, Inc. 2009). As indicated in the example pile
driving projects previously discussed, the implementation of a bubble curtain can reduce sound pressures
by as little as 5 dB re 1µPa to as much as 15 to 20 dB re 1µPa in shallower waters.
To mitigate potential impacts on marine mammals, possible BMPs that could be used by the future
developer include the following:
•

Draft EIS

Monitor for the presence of marine mammals with a trained marine mammal/protected
species observer stationed at shore-side locations or from a boat in the harbor during all
pile-driving activities. Work would be stopped if marine mammals are spotted within a
minimum distance of 130 feet of active pile driving.

7-69

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

•

Install a bubble curtain to reduce in-water noise during pile driving.

•

Drive piles with a cushion made of wood to reduce pressure pulse (Miller et al. 2010).

Additional direct impacts include the potential for vessel strikes with marine mammals during
construction and operation. During construction, vessels such as tugs and barges would be present within
the waters to facilitate construction of the floating docks. The risk of vessel collisions during construction
would be low due to the slow movement of the construction vessels. Once construction is completed and
the enhanced public pier is used by local watercraft, including the potential use by the harbor shuttle, the
potential for vessel collisions also exists. However, any marine mammals that are present are likely to be
already habituated to the level of the existing vessel traffic occurring in the greater Narragansett Bay.
Indirect impacts on marine mammals include temporary displacement as they avoid areas of turbidity.
Turbidity could also affect foraging success and prey availability. Suspended sediment can irritate the
gills of fish that serve as prey, causing them to leave the area. Reduced visibility in turbid waters may also
decrease foraging success. However, these impacts would only be expected to be minor because the
increased turbidity levels would be temporary and localized, allowing marine mammals to forage in
nearby waters until the turbidity plume dissipates. Necessary precautions to avoid any contamination to
the water resulting from fuel spills would follow those oil and hazardous spill response procedures
identified in a spill prevention, control, and countermeasures (SPCC) plan.
Overall, direct impacts in the form of vessel strikes could occur; however, they would be expected to be
minor due to the abilities of the animals to avoid the vessels. Indirect impacts (reduced foraging success
and prey availability, and turbidity) would also be minor due to the abilities of the animals to avoid the
project area when necessary, availability of suitable habitat elsewhere throughout the coastal area, and
incorporation of BMPs to reduce impacts on the water column (see Section 7.11).
Measures to reduce impacts on marine mammals would be implemented by the developer through state
and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. This would result in
the future developer’s coordination with NMFS under the ESA and MMPA to minimize impacts on
regulated marine mammals. Pursuant to the MMPA, the Navy concluded the proposed action would be
unlikely to result in a take of a marine mammal. Therefore, the disposal and reuse of the former Naval
Hospital property under Alternative 1 would have minor impacts on marine mammals.
Other Marine Wildlife
In-water construction activities under Alternative 1 would generate minor, short-term effects on finfish,
shellfish, crustacean, and benthic resources in Narragansett Bay. Direct impacts would include
temporarily displacing fish by the operation of construction equipment and noise generated during pile
driving. Noise generated during pile driving would likely startle fish in the immediate vicinity, potentially
displacing them. Once construction noise has stopped, fish would likely move back into the area.
Potential physiological impacts on fish from underwater noise include impacts on the swim bladder as
well as on fish hearing. Bony fish maintain buoyancy through an internal air sac called a swim bladder
(ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin 2009). When a fish is exposed to a sound wave, gas in
the swim bladder expands more than surrounding tissue during periods of under pressure and contracts
more than surrounding tissue during periods of overpressure. This can cause the swim bladder to oscillate
and result in tissue damage, including rupture of the swim bladder (Popper and Hastings 2009).
Therefore, human-generated sources of noise can be fatal to fish.
Additionally, fish hearing can be impacted by noise such as that generated by pile driving. The primary
auditory structures in a fish’s inner ear are sensory hair cells and otoliths, which are dense, calcified

Draft EIS

structures that overlie a tissue layer containing numerous sensory hair cells (Georgia Institute of
Technology 2012). Exposure to higher levels of sound for shorter periods of time may result in damage to
the sensory hair cells of the ear or temporary hearing loss, also referred to as TTS in fish (Popper 2003;
ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin 2009).
The potential for injury to fish species from pile driving is based on dual criteria thresholds. These
thresholds were developed by the 2004 Fisheries Hydroacoustic Working Group (FHWG) composed of
the FHWA; departments of transportation in California, Oregon, and Washington; representatives from
NOAA Fisheries, the USFWS, and the USACE. These thresholds were developed to take into account the
three major effects associated with pile driving: non-auditory tissue damage, auditory tissue damage (hair
cell damage), and TTS (ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin 2009). NMFS recognizes these
thresholds as the accepted criteria to determine injury to fish species. To determine potential behavioral
effects on fish species of all sizes, NMFS uses 150 dB re 1µPa RMS SPL as the threshold criteria (see
Table 7.12-5).

To address potential impacts of pile driving on fish, the same literature discussed above under marine
mammals was also reviewed for fish. The practical spreading loss model was also used to estimate the
distance range from active impact pile driving that the threshold for potential behavioral impacts would
reach. The accumulated SEL was also calculated based on an average number of strikes it could take to
drive a concrete pile to depth. According to ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin (2009), a
24-inch concrete pile would take approximately 580 individual strikes for each pile to be driven to the
expected depth. (Because more project-specific information was not available, this pile strike average
was used for calculations and thus the accumulated SEL can be considered conservative.) Based on these
conservative calculations, it is expected that injury based on accumulated SEL could occur to fish greater
than 2 grams within 33 feet of impact pile driving and to fish less than 2 grams within 66 feet of impact
pile driving. Behavioral disturbance could occur to fish of all sizes within 83 feet of impact pile driving
(see Table 7.12-6). However, because the ensonified area is very small and possible mitigation measures
such as a bubble curtain will be put in place, it is expected that these areas would be reduced in size and
that impacts thus would be minor and temporary. Appropriate mitigation measures will be identified
through the developer’s consultation with NMFS as part of the Section 7/EFH process; this is discussed in
detail in Section 7.12.1.4.

In its response to the Navy’s informal consultation letter, NMFS indicated that it cannot concur with the
Navy’s determination that the project would have minimal impacts on EFH because specific project
details are lacking (i.e., specific project design and/or engineering plans that indicate the exact location of
proposed piers and in-water work, location and amount of material to be dredged, etc.). Additional
project-specific details would be made available prior to the construction of the in-water components of
the proposed action by the future developer(s). At such time, authorization from the USACE under
Section 404 of the CWA and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 would be required.
These USACE authorizations would be expected to trigger the requirement to consult with NMFS under
the ESA and MSFCMA. Effects on EFH would be re-evaluated at that time.
After the pile-driving stops, fish would likely return to the area. Popper and Hastings (2009) reported that
various fish species have been found to abandon areas when the sound from human activities surpasses
the local ambient noise levels, only to return after the sound source has been removed and ambient noise
levels return to normal. Therefore, it could be assumed that fish may alter their normal behavior,
including startle response and avoidance of the immediate construction area, but as pile driving and
dredging would be short-term, occurrence of these species near the construction areas would not change
significantly.
Mobile species of shellfish (e.g., lobster) would either be temporarily displaced or killed during
demolition or construction activities. Given the small size of the construction area, compared with the
available area for shellfish colonization in Narragansett Bay, this disturbance is expected to be minor and
to not have any adverse impacts on the larger shellfish population.
It is assumed that the pilings would be constructed off-site. During construction, sediment would be
displaced as the pilings are embedded in bottom sediments. This would displace a volume of sediment at
least equivalent to the volume of pilings below the subsurface. The displacement of this sediment volume
would increase suspended sediment and turbidity during the pile-driving operation but it would settle
soon thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several hours). Once in place, concrete pilings would not
impact surface waters because concrete is an inert material and not chemically coated and therefore does
not leach creosote, heavy metals, or other coating agents.
Resuspended bottom sediments may also contain contaminants formerly buried in the sediments.
Subsequent oxidation of sulfides, reduced iron, and organic matter associated with the suspended
sediments would consume some dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column. Overall, the impacts of

Draft EIS

Former Naval Hospital Property

sediment resuspension from these activities on DO concentrations would be minimal because of the small
area of disturbance, compared with the greater Narragansett Bay area, and the effects would be spatially
limited to the areas immediately surrounding the project sites. Furthermore, the suspended sediments
would settle soon thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several hours).
Increased suspended sediment concentrations generated by propeller wash from construction vessel traffic
and pile driving activities could result in reduced light transmittance and increased oxygen demand, the
latter leading to reduced DO concentrations. Increases in turbidity and decreases in DO concentrations
are known to be harmful to fisheries resources. Both finfish and shellfish would likely be temporarily
displaced or killed as a result of these impacts; however, these impacts would be short-term and limited to
the time of in-water construction. Minor long-term effects on finfish and shellfish resources could result
from increased boat traffic in Narragansett Bay as a result of the pier and floating docks following
completion of construction.
Fish and other marine wildlife are expected to move back into the vicinity of the pilings and pier
following completion of in-water construction activities. Overall, finfish and shellfish species occurring in
the area are already exposed to turbidity and to noise from existing vessel traffic in the Bay and the
nearby NAVSTA Newport marina. Therefore, impacts on fisheries resources from the proposed action are
expected to be minor and short-term. Fish should not be affected by the small loss of bottom habitat from
the installation of pilings for the floating docks. Increased vessel traffic associated with the operation of
the expanded pier would have negligible impacts on the fisheries populations due to the existing vessel
traffic in the area.
Under Alternative 1, the following BMPs would be implemented by the developer to minimize adverse
effects on fisheries resources:
•

An SPCC plan for the proposed action would be implemented, which would minimize the
adverse effects of any spill and provide procedures for clean-up efforts.

•

Bottom contours and shoreline areas in the vicinity of the construction activities would be
restored.

In summary, Alternative 1 would result in minor impacts on other marine life and fish, and BMPs and/or
protective measures implemented by the future developer following consultations with the USACE and
NMFS would ensure that no significant impacts occur to other marine wildlife.
Benthic Organisms
The primary direct impacts on benthic organisms include mortality during pile-driving and loss of habitat
due to the placement of piles associated with the floating docks. Indirect impacts would include turbidity
that could disturb the ability of certain organisms to feed, but this effect would be temporary and limited.
Increased turbidities would temporarily cause difficulty in locating prey for predatory taxa but would not
be expected to cause significant adverse effects on species in the area because they can easily migrate to
another area to feed. Benthic organisms, especially slow-moving, fixed, or sediment-dwelling organisms
(such as clams, small crustaceans, marine snails, sea cucumbers, worms, urchins, and sea stars) would be
most vulnerable to this impact. Larger or more mobile benthic species such as the crab, shrimp, or
groundfish would likely sense the construction activity and could move out of the area. Nevertheless, it is
possible that these species may not sense which direction to move to avoid dredging or become
disoriented and could be caught directly by the dredge. The amount of suspended sediments settling in
the surrounding area would not be significant enough to bury benthic species in the area. Within a few
hours of the dredging, mobile benthic scavenger species such as crab, shrimp, and sea stars would likely
migrate to the impact area to feed on benthic organisms that had been crushed or injured.

Draft EIS

7-73

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

The decrease in soft-bottom habitat (the footprint of the piles) and increase in hard substrate habitat would
result in a localized change in species composition over the long-term. Benthic species that burrow into a
substrate, such as clams and worms, thrive in particular types of materials. By replacing (very small)
portions of the seafloor with pilings, pre-construction benthic communities would be slightly altered by
the proposed action. The pilings would increase the available in-water surface area and create
colonization sites for hard-bottom species such as mussels (Mytilus spp.), barnacles (Balanus spp.), and
sea anemones (the fouling community, or the community of organisms found on artificial surfaces). The
new community also would support other species such as copepods, amphipods, annelids, gastropods, and
sea stars that would feed and take refuge in the newly created environment (Kozloff 1996).
Filter- and suspension-feeding invertebrates (e.g., bivalves, tunicates, crustaceans, and some polychaetes)
may close their shells, suspend feeding, or increase feeding rates in response to turbidity increases
(LaSalle et al. 1991; Cruz-Rodriguez and Chu 2002). However, because of the limited time pile-driving
and dredging would occur (i.e., minutes at a time for several days) along with the limited increase in
turbidity levels, there would not be a significant loss of benthic species in the vicinity of project areas.
Overall, the direct and indirect impacts under Alternative 1 would be considered minor impacts on the
regional benthic community because the regional benthic community can recolonize over time and
because impacts on the benthic organisms would be localized in relation to the larger regional benthic
community of the Narragansett Bay.
Herpetofauna
Due to the lack of preferred habitat for herpetofauna common to Rhode Island at the former Naval
Hospital property, Alternative 1 would not result in any impacts on herpetofauna.
Avian Species
Narragansett Bay is home to a variety of shorebirds and waterfowl, both breeding and migratory. Because
the former Naval Hospital property is in the Atlantic Flyway and within 2 miles of two designated IBAs,
the potential for birds to be on-site does exist. However, due to the developed nature of the site and lack
of nesting habitat along the beach at the former Naval Hospital property, breeding birds are not likely.
Waterfowl and waterbirds could forage in the project area and, as mobile species, would likely move to
adjacent foraging areas with suitable habitat during construction. Short-term impacts on avian species,
such as displacement, would result during construction under Alternative 1. In general, birds would avoid
areas of construction where equipment and human activities create disturbance. No long-term adverse
impacts on birds are anticipated. In May of 2015, the USFWS initiated a NEPA review of alternatives to
authorize take under the MBTA. At the time of the publication of this Draft EIS, it is uncertain if the
future implementation of the Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1 may require a take permit under
the MBTA. The future developer would be required to minimize impacts on migratory birds as required
under state and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. Pursuant
to the MBTA and BGEPA, the Navy has determined that implementation of Alternative 1 would have
minor impacts on avian species and the disposal and reuse of the former Naval Hospital property would
not result in significant impacts on, or harm of, migratory birds and bald and golden eagles.
7.12.1.3

Threatened and Endangered Species

7.12.1.3.1 Marine Species
As discussed in Section 6.12.1.3, NMFS Northeast Region has identified various listed species, including
whales, sea turtles, and Atlantic sturgeon, as well as two federal species of concern (alewife and blueback
herring) that have the potential to occur in the waters of Narragansett Bay because they are prevalent in
New England waters (Colligan 2013). The Navy has informally consulted with the NMFS under Section
Draft EIS

7-74

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

7 of the ESA concerning the effects of the proposed action on any federally listed threatened or
endangered species. The results of that informal consultation are summarized below.
Whales
The North Atlantic right, humpback, and fin whales occur along the U.S. Atlantic Coast at various times
of the year. None of these species are common in Narragansett Bay, although all have been documented
in stranding and live sighting data in Narragansett Bay or along the south shore of Rhode Island
(NBNERR 2009). These species are not likely to be present in Narragansett Bay near the former Naval
Hospital property. As such, disposal and reuse of the former Naval Hospital under Alternative 1 would
have no effect on these species. Pursuant to the ESA, the Navy has determined that the disposal and reuse
of the former Naval Hospital would have no effect on the federally endangered North Atlantic right,
humpback, or fin whale. NMFS concurred with the determination, based on the species preference for
deeper water depths and the near-shore location of the proposed action, such that these species were
deemed unlikely to exist in the vicinity of the project area (Colligan 2013). BMPs are included within
this Draft EIS, to minimize the potential for noise-related affects.
Sea Turtles
As discussed in Section 6.12.1.3, four listed species of sea turtles (loggerhead, green, Kemp’s ridley, and
leatherback) are seasonally present in New England from early summer through late fall. Although sea
turtle abundance at the project location in Narragansett Bay is unknown, sea turtles are regular summer
visitors to Rhode Island waters during their southern migration to wintering grounds (NBNERR 2009).
Both the loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley turtles have been documented within Narragansett Bay around
Aquidneck Island (NBNERR 2009). Despite a documented occurrence in 2007, due to its highly pelagic
nature, the leatherback does not usually make its way into Narragansett Bay north of the bay’s mouth
(NBNERR 2009). NMFS Northeast Region stated that the possibility may occur for the green sea turtle to
occur in New England waters, but that it is rare and sporadic (Colligan 2013).
Direct and indirect dredging impacts on sea turtles would be insignificant. Sea turtles are not known to be
vulnerable to capture in mechanical dredges. Additionally, even if a transient sea turtle were present, no
sea turtles are likely to be injured or killed as a result of dredging operations (Bullard 2014). The dredge
sites within the bay may provide suitable forage habitat for sea turtles; however, given the water depths in
those areas, it is unlikely that sea turtles would be present in the area. Opportunistic foraging may occur at
these sites and, thus, dredging could cause a short-term reduction in prey species through the alteration of
existing biotic assemblages and habitat. Any such reduction would be temporary and recolonization
would begin within two months (Bullard 2014). Sedimentation from dredging would be short-term, with
suspended sediment settling out of the water column within a few hours following dredging activities.
Therefore, any change in behavior due to the presence of suspended sediment is likely to be insignificant.
Similar to marine mammals and fish, in-water noise may also be audible to sea turtles within the vicinity
of the project area. Sea turtles are expected to avoid disturbing levels of sound originating from
impulsive sources (O’Hara & Wilcox 1990; McCauley et al. 2000). There are currently no official
threshold criteria for either potential injury or behavioral disturbance/harassment for sea turtles.
However, McCauley et al. (2000) reported that impulsive source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS were
required to induce a behavioral reaction in captive green and loggerhead sea turtle. Based on this
information, NMFS has determined that source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS or greater could cause
behavioral disturbance and/or other behavioral or physiological impacts (Lecky 2009).
Based on the threshold level used by NMFS, there is the potential for disturbing sea turtles if impact pile
driving occurs when sea turtles are present in Narragansett Bay (early summer through late fall). Based on
the Practical Spreading Loss model, it is expected that disturbance to sea turtles could occur within 50
feet (15 meters) of active pile driving. It is likely that sea turtles would avoid the areas where in-water
Draft EIS

7-75

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

construction was occurring. Therefore, it is expected that impacts on sea turtles would be temporary and
result in temporary displacement during pile driving and construction activities. However, large numbers
of sea turtles are not expected to be exposed to pile driving noise during the time frame of in-water work
due to the limited spatial scale of the construction and the low density of sea turtles within Narragansett
Bay and, in particular, the habitat characteristics of the project area in the vicinity of the former Naval
Hospital property. NMFS indicated that it is extremely unlikely that sea turtles would occur within 0 to
66 feet (0 to 20 meters) of the pile driving and therefore would not be exposed to underwater noise at or
above the 166 dB re 1µPa RMS (Bullard 2014).
The installation of the docks may create new shaded areas. However, because the area of the bay that
would be covered by the new docks is small, dissolved oxygen levels in the project area are not expected
to be impacted by the minor increase in shading. Additionally, the project area is not a known foraging
ground and it is likely not used as a major source of forage (Bullard 2014). Thus, alteration of habitat
through shading and pile installation is not expected to remove critical amounts of prey resources from
the project area for the sea turtle.
Pursuant to the ESA, the Navy has determined that the disposal and reuse of the former Naval Hospital
may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the loggerhead, green, Kemp’s ridley, or leatherback sea
turtles. NMFS concurred with the Navy’s determination (Bullard 2014). BMPs and protective measures
referenced by NMFS for sea turtles included implementing construction activities between November and
May (a period when listed species are not likely to be present) and the installation of piles for the pier
with an impact hammer (a technique that minimizes the generation of underwater noise).
Atlantic Sturgeon
The Atlantic sturgeon is distributed within estuarine and marine waters along the entire East Coast, and
potentially Narragansett Bay. Atlantic sturgeon travel wide ranges from their natal river. They spend
spring months spawning upriver where the salt front and fall line of large rivers meet and inhabit
estuarine and coastal waters when not spawning (NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources 2012).
Due to their broad distribution, any individuals from the threatened population of Atlantic sturgeon of the
Gulf of Maine DPS or the endangered populations from the New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South
Atlantic, and Carolina DPSs may occur in the waters of Narragansett Bay (Colligan 2013). Their reliance
on benthic organisms for food and their affinity for shallow nearshore areas may bring them to the waters
near the former Naval Hospital property. The potential occurrence of Atlantic sturgeon near the surplus
property would include the juvenile and adult life stages, since juvenile Atlantic sturgeon can spend
months to years in estuaries. However, only transient Atlantic sturgeon are likely to be in the project area
(Bullard 2014). It is expected that any adult Atlantic sturgeon potentially occurring in the vicinity of the
former Naval Hospital property during in-water construction would avoid the areas and therefore impacts
on the Atlantic sturgeon from operation of construction equipment, including a mechanical dredge and
pile driving equipment, and resulting increased turbidity levels would not be significant.
Direct and indirect impacts of dredging on sturgeon would be insignificant. It is likely that subadult or
adult Atlantic sturgeon would easily be able to avoid the dredge. Additionally, because no overwintering
sturgeon are likely to occur in the project area, there would be no increased risk of capture due to the lack
of overwintering areas in the project area (Bullard 2014). Similar to the discussion above about the sea
turtle, the dredge sites within the bay may provide suitable forage habitat for sturgeon. Opportunistic
foraging may occur at these sites and, thus, dredging could cause a short-term reduction in prey species
through the alteration of existing biotic assemblages and habitat. Any such reduction would be temporary
and recolonization would begin within two months (Bullard 2014). Sedimentation from dredging would
be short-term, with suspended sediment settling out of the water column within a few hours following
dredging activities.

Draft EIS

7-76

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Pile-driving activities associated with the proposed action under Alternative 1 would generate underwater
noise that the Atlantic sturgeon could be exposed to; however, no adverse effects on the sturgeon would
be expected. As stated above, Atlantic sturgeon would not be expected to come close to the former Naval
Hospital property during construction. Any Atlantic sturgeon present within the general vicinity would be
able to detect pile-driving noises which, as a result, may elicit an avoidance response to the waters around
the surplus property. If they were present, using the established injury thresholds for fish and comparing
them with the summary of pile driving sound levels (Table 7.12-3), the peak threshold for injury would
not be exceeded, as discussed above in Section 7.12.1.2. There is a potential for impact based on
accumulated SEL for a single pile within 33 feet of active impact pile driving and behavioral disturbance
with 83 feet of impact pile driving (Table 7.12-6).
As discussed above for the sea turtle, the installation of the docks may create new shaded areas. However,
because the area of the bay that would be covered by the new docks is small, dissolved oxygen levels in
the project area are not expected to be impacted by the minor amounts of increased shading and the
alteration of habitat through shading and pile installation is not expected to remove critical amounts of
prey resources from the project area for the sturgeon.
Pursuant to the ESA, the Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the former Naval Hospital
property may affect, but is not likely affect, the federally threatened Atlantic sturgeon. NMFS concurred
with this determination (Bullard 2014). BMPs and protective measures referenced by NMFS for Atlantic
sturgeon included implementing construction activities between November and May (a period when listed
species are not likely to be present) and the installation of piles for the pier with an impact hammer (a
technique that minimizes the generation of underwater noise).
Results of Informal Consultation with NMFS
In a letter dated May 5, 2014, NMFS concluded that, based on the analysis above, any effects on listed
species of sea turtles or the Atlantic sturgeon would be insignificant or discountable; therefore,
concurrence was provided with the Navy’s determination that the proposed action may affect, but is not
like to adversely affect any listed species of sea turtles or the Atlantic sturgeon, and consultation per
Section 7 of the ESA has been completed (Bullard 2014).
7.12.1.3.2 Non-Marine Species
Northern Long-Eared Bat
The Navy has documented the presence of the northern long-eared bat within approximately 1 mile of the
former Naval Hospital, as discussed below. Based on the results of passive acoustic monitoring, three
call sequences for the northern long-eared bat in 2013 at Bishops Rock, the closest monitoring location
(approximately 1 mile away) to the former Naval Hospital, were documented by the Navy. Of the 8,826
total call sequences reported at NAVSTA Newport from the passive acoustic monitoring conducted for
bats from 2009 to 2013, 73 calls were documented as non-specific Myotis species calls, and 1,397 were
documented as “unknown high-frequency” calls, which can be attributable to Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014c).
The potential effects of the proposed action include permanent loss of roosting habitat and potential
impacts on forage habitats and animal behavior in the project area. As discussed in Section 6.12.3.2, no
suitable habitat exists on or adjacent to the former Naval Hospital property.
Therefore, redevelopment of the former Naval Hospital property would have no effect on the northern
long-eared bat. The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding its concurrence on the potential effects of the
proposed action on the northern long-eared bat at the former Naval Hospital (Preston 2015). The

evaluation of impacts and potential for adverse effects to the northern long-eared bat will be updated upon
completion of consultation with the USFWS.
7.12.1.4

Significant Wildlife Habitat

Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
There is no SAV habitat at the former Naval Hospital property. Alternative 1 would not result in any
impacts on SAV at the former Naval Hospital property.
Wetlands
Construction of the two floating docks under Alternative 1 would impact approximately 0.04 acres of the
0.3 acres of marine/estuarine wetlands associated with the former Naval Hospital property. These
wetlands provide one of the few areas for potential cover, nesting, and feeding opportunities for wildlife
along the developed shoreline. The pilings needed to support the floating docks would be considered as
wetland fill. The total amount of wetland fill would be determined during the final design of the pier
redevelopment project, as the proposed design is for analysis purposes and a final design would be part of
the actions taken after property transfer (see Section 7.11 for a discussion of required wetland permit and
a discussion of wetland impact mitigation). The developer would be required to avoid, minimize, and
mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under state and federal permitting processed of the
CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at the former Naval Hospital property. Alternative 1 would not result in any
impact on vernal pools.
Essential Fish Habitat
As indicated in Section 6.12, there are 17 species of EFH off the coast of the former Naval Hospital. The
proposed action would not adversely affect EFH under Alternative 1. The Navy has consulted with the
NMFS, consistent with the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act for the effects
of the proposed action on EFH (2014).
As discussed in Section 7.12.1.2, Other Marine Wildlife, during construction a volume of sediment at
least equivalent to the volume of pilings below the subsurface would be displaced as the pilings are
embedded in the bottom sediments. The displacement of this sediment volume would increase suspended
sediment and turbidity within the water column habitat during the pile-driving operation, but it would be
localized in the project area and would settle soon thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several hours).
Water column habitat would be affected as would habitat serving as EFH for some species. The portions
of benthic communities within the footprint of the individual piles supporting the fishing pier and floating
piers, as well as in the proposed area for dredging, would likely be destroyed, resulting in a minor,
permanent loss of benthic substrate in the Narragansett Bay. Impacts on benthic habitat and species are
discussed in Section 7.12.1.2, Benthic Organisms.
Marine fish use aquatic vegetation habitat for foraging and refuge. One of the most important marine
vegetation types in the marine ecosystem is eelgrass. This environment offers habitat for various life
stages of many marine species, including shellfish such as crabs and bivalves. No eelgrass is present in
the vicinity of the former Naval Hospital property; therefore, there would be no impacts on summer
flounder EFH, which NMFS considers a HAPC.
Research has shown that light-blocking overwater structures can directly impact benthic productivity in
underlying substrates (Simenstad et al. 1999). The overwater floating docks at the former Naval Hospital
property would increase shading in the immediate area, more so than if they were fixed and elevated.
Draft EIS

7-78

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

However, no eelgrass beds or other marine vegetation are located near the Naval Hospital property; so
there would be no impact on these resources (see Appendix A and the informal consultation letter to
NMFS dated March 27, 2014 for additional background information regarding potential impacts of
shading).
Designated EFH within the vicinity of each project site would be affected as a result of temporary
disturbance and displacement of fish, temporary increase in sediment loads and turbidity in the water
column, and a minor but permanent disruption of benthic communities within the footprint of the
individual piles and dredged area. The effects would generally be minor and short term and would be
further offset by implementation of mitigation measures. No eelgrass beds would be directly impacted by
the proposed activity. In its response to the Navy’s informal consultation letter, NMFS indicated that it
cannot concur with the Navy’s determination that the project would have minimal impacts on EFH
because of the lack of specific project details (i.e., specific project design and/or engineering plans, which
indicate the exact location of proposed piers and in-water work, location and amount of material to be
dredged, etc.) (Bullard 2014). Additional project-specific details would be made available prior to the
construction of the in-water components of the proposed action by the future developer(s). At such time,
authorization from the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act of 1899 would be required. These USACE authorizations would be expected to trigger the
requirement to consult with NMFS under the MSFCMA, where any potential effects on EFH would be
minimized through the development of BMPs, to minimize adverse impacts on EFH. Pursuant to the
MSFCMA, the Navy has determined that the project would not adversely affect designated EFH in the
Narragansett Bay.

7.12.2

Alternative 2

7.12.2.1 Vegetation
Similar to Alternative 1, the majority of proposed development for Alternative 2 would be located in the
existing development footprint. As such, implementation of Alternative 2 is expected to result in minor
long-term impacts on upland vegetation.
7.12.2.2

Wildlife

Terrestrial Mammals
Impacts on terrestrial mammals under Alternative 2 are similar to those discussed under Alternative 1.
Marine Mammals
The impacts associated with the in-water construction of Alternative 1 also apply to Alternative 2, as
discussed in Section 7.2.1.2. Due to the addition of the third floating dock under Alternative 2, however,
the increase in in-water construction proposed would result in greater potential impacts on marine
mammals. The additional floating dock would measure 8 feet by 70 feet and would be constructed at the
end of the existing pier with mooring piles.
Measures to reduce impacts on marine mammals would be implemented by the developer through state
and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. This would result in
the future developer’s coordination with NMFS under the ESA and MMPA to minimize impacts on
regulated marine mammals. Pursuant to the MMPA, the Navy concluded the proposed action would be
unlikely to result in a take of a marine mammal. Therefore, the disposal and reuse of the former Naval
Hospital property under Alternative 2 would have minor impacts on marine mammals.

Draft EIS

7-79

March 2016

Former Naval Hospital Property

Other Marine Wildlife
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have minor short-term impacts on finfish, shellfish, crustacean,
and benthic resources in Narragansett Bay, similar to those discussed for Alternative 1. However, as the
extent of the proposed in-water construction is greater under Alternative 2 compared with Alternative 1,
due to the addition of a third floating dock, the potential impacts on these resources would be greater.
The additional floating dock would measure 8 feet by 70 feet and would be constructed at the end of the
existing pier with mooring piles. The impacts associated with the in-water construction of Alternative 1
also apply to Alternative 2, as discussed in Section 7.2.1.2. Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts
on other marine life and fish, and BMPs developed through the future developer’s consultations with the
USACE under the CWA and NMFS under the ESA and MMPA, will ensure that no significant impacts
occur to other marine wildlife.
Benthic Organisms
The impacts associated with the in-water construction of Alternative 1 also apply to Alternative 2 for
benthic organisms. Due to the addition of the third floating dock under Alternative 2, however, the
increase in in-water construction proposed would result in greater potential impacts on marine mammals.
The additional floating dock would measure 8 feet by 70 feet and would be constructed at the end of the
existing pier with mooring piles. Refer to the discussion under Alternative 1 above.
Herpetofauna
Due to the existing habitat at the former Naval Hospital, Alternative 2 would result in no impacts on
herpetofauna.
Avian Species
Impacts on avian species under Alternative 2 are similar to those discussed under Alternative 1.
7.12.2.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
Impacts on threatened and endangered species under Alternative 2 are similar to those discussed under
Alternative 1.
7.12.2.4

Significant Wildlife Habitat

Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
No impacts from Alternative 2 would occur to SAV at the former Naval Hospital site due the lack of this
habitat type.
Wetlands
Alternative 2 would impact approximately 0.03 acres of the existing 0.3 acres of marine/estuarine
wetlands associated with the former Naval Hospital from the construction of the two of the three floating
docks (see Figure 7.12-2). The impacts would result from the placement of pilings to support the floating
docks. These wetlands provide one of the few areas for potential cover, nesting, and feeding opportunities
for wildlife. For a discussion on minimization of impacts on wetlands during construction of Alternative
1, see Section 7.11.
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at the former Naval Hospital site. Alternative 2 would not have any impact on
vernal pools.

Former Naval Hospital Property

Essential Fish Habitat
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have short-term adverse impacts on EFH resources at the former
Naval Hospital, similar to those discussed for Alternative 1. However, the extent of the proposed in-water
construction and expansion of the existing pier (through the addition of a total of three floating docks)
would result in no significant long-term adverse impacts on fish or their respective EFH. There would be
slightly more minor and short-term impacts on EFH resources under Alternative 2 than Alternative 1.
The future developer’s consultation with the USACE under the CWA and NMFS under the MSFCMA
would ensure the development of BMPs to minimize any adverse effects to EFH. Pursuant to the
MSFCMA, the Navy has determined that the project would not adversely affect designated EFH in the
Narragansett Bay.

Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located at the northern end of NAVSTA Newport between the Melville fuelloading area (Melville Backyard) and the Navy’s Melville housing area. The tank farms are in the
southeastern part of the Town of Portsmouth. Tank Farm 1 occupies approximately 62 acres of land, and
Tank Farm 2 occupies approximately 74 acres of land. Tank Farm 1 is bounded by Melville Park to the
north, Tank Farm 2 to the south, open space and a recreational campground to the east, and the Melville
fuel-loading area and Stringham Road to the west (see Figure 8.1-1). Tank Farm 2 is bounded by Tank
Farm 1 to the north, Stringham Road to the south and west, and the Melville housing area to the east. An
existing COX Cable facility is located in the southeastern corner of Tank Farm 2. No existing easement is
associated with this facility.
As discussed in Section 1.3, Tank Farms 1 and 2 were used by the Navy from the 1940s to 1974 to store
various oils and fuels. In 1974, the Navy licensed both tank farms to the DESC to store and distribute
petroleum fuel. The DESC ceased operations at the tank farms in 1998, and the properties and facilities
were vacated.
Tank Farm 1 is developed with eight vacant operational structures (three pump houses, a valve house, an
ethyl blending plant, a transformer building, and two transformer vaults), and eight inactive
USTs/OWSs. A community center was demolished in 2011/2012, and two ASTs were demolished and
removed in 2012. In addition, a 1,000-gallon underground water reservoir is located beneath Building 30
(pump house) in the northern portion of the property. The surface of Tank Farm 1 in the areas overlying
the USTs is a mix of cover types: non-vegetated areas where active remediation is ongoing and low-lying
shrub-scrub and trees in other areas. Tank Farm 2 is developed with four small, vacant buildings (a
former fire station, an electrical substation, and two transformer buildings) and 11 USTs. Undeveloped
surface areas of both tank farms consist of open space (scrub land and wooded areas) (RKG Associates,
Inc. et al. 2011). Similar to Tank Farm 1, the surface of Tank Farm 2 in the areas overlying the USTs is a
mix of cover types: grassland, scrub-shrub and trees, and non-vegetated areas where active remediation is
ongoing.
The status of clean-up activities at Tank Farms 1 and 2 under the Navy’s ER Program is discussed in
Section 8.5. Land use controls have not yet been designated for the tank farms but may be a component
of the cleanup remedy selected for this area.

8.1.2

Surrounding Land Use

The study area for surrounding land uses includes the area within 0.25 miles of the boundaries of the tank
farms (see Figure 8.1-1). The study area is relatively sparsely developed with areas of open space
(Melville Ponds and scrub land and woodland) interspersed between the various land uses. A lowdensity, single-family residential neighborhood is located north of the tank farms. The Navy’s Melville
housing area with duplex housing units is located to the east (see Figure 8.1-1). Other land uses include
industrial and business properties south of the tank farms and the Melville Ponds Recreation Area and
Melville Elementary School to the east. As noted, the Navy’s Melville fuel-loading area is located west

of Tank Farm 1. Two marinas and additional commercial land uses also are located in this area on
Portsmouth’s shoreline along Narragansett Bay.

8.1.3

Land Use Plans and Zoning

The land surrounding Tank Farms 1 and 2 is in the jurisdiction of the Town of Portsmouth. Land use and
development in the town is regulated by the town’s zoning ordinance (Town of Portsmouth 2008a) and
guided by the town’s Comprehensive Community Plan (Town of Portsmouth 2002). The Town of
Portsmouth is developing a Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan (Town of Portsmouth 2008a) to
address redevelopment of Navy surplus property at the tank farms. The tank farms also are included in
the study area considered in the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan, prepared by The Cecil Group et
al. (2005).
Town of Portsmouth Zoning Ordinance. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located in a zoned Redevelopment
District, created to accommodate planned unit developments (PUDs) on larger parcels of land. The
Redevelopment District allows three types of PUDs: planned corporate development, planned marine
trade development, and planned retail/service development. The permitted uses and other regulations for
these types of PUDs are discussed below:

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Town of Portsmouth Comprehensive Community Plan. Portsmouth’s comprehensive plan was last
revised in 2002. The comprehensive plan identifies future land use for Tank Farms 1 and 2 as a
waterfront district, intended to include industrial and business land uses related to boat building and
servicing, marinas, and other marine trades (Town of Portsmouth 2002). The comprehensive plan’s
larger goals, objectives, and policies related to land use generally seek to balance the level of
development in the town to the capacity of public services and the ability of the town to pay for public
improvements. The comprehensive plan further notes that future development should not increase “urban
sprawl,” should maintain the town’s existing rural character, create job opportunities, and maintain the
town’s tax base (Town of Portsmouth 2002).
Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan. The Town of Portsmouth prepared a draft
redevelopment plan to coordinate land use planning and economic development on a total of
approximately 269 acres of Navy property in the town with the potential to be declared surplus property
in the foreseeable future, including Tank Farms 1 and 2 (Town of Portsmouth 2008a). This draft
redevelopment plan was used in the development of AIRPA’s Redevelopment Plan for Surplus Properties
at NAVSTA Newport (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011), but the town’s planning considerations regarding
redevelopment of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 are ongoing. The redevelopment plan is being prepared in
conjunction with the town’s Comprehensive Community Plan (see above) and the Aquidneck Island West
Side Master Plan. The redevelopment plan emphasizes the importance of non-residential development on
Tank Farms 1 and 2 that would generate additional economic activity in the town (Town of Portsmouth
2008a, 2009) The town’s overall goal for redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 is to promote mixed-use
redevelopment that supports similar nearby businesses (marine and marina-related, commercial, and light
industrial) along the Melville shoreline. This development should be situated within a publicly accessible
open space system that protects environmentally sensitive areas that are unsuitable for development (e.g.
steeply sloped land). Some residential development is included in the redevelopment plan on Tank Farm 2
in conjunction with the planned Weaver Cove Marina Village, which will be located on Weaver Cove
along Burma Road (Town of Portsmouth 2009).
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. The Aquidneck Island Planning Commission cites the need
to plan for the reuse of surplus Navy properties as one of the reasons for preparing the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located in the central part of the planning area. Because
of the large amount of surplus Navy property as well as other developable properties in this area, which
are generally located along the shoreline from Coddington Cove to Mt. Hope Bridge, the master plan
notes this area is likely to experience “substantial change” through development (The Cecil Group et al.
2005).
The primary land use goals laid out in the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan include minimizing
sprawl, planning for reuse of surplus Navy property, and diversifying land use. Accordingly, the overall
recommendation for future land uses in the west side planning area is for “targeted, mixed-use
redevelopment that supports existing land uses and provides public economic benefit, within an attractive
and accessible open space system” (The Cecil Group et al. 2005). Infill development or redevelopment
with commercial and compatible industrial land uses is emphasized. The master plan recommends that
Tank Farms 1 and 2 be reused to support marine- and marina-related businesses to promote additional
economic development. In addition to the marina-related development, the master plan recommends
mixed-use redevelopment of a portion of the tank farms with commercial uses, a mixture of resort and
affordable housing, light-industrial uses, research and development, and parking. Wooded slopes and
areas with unique or protected natural resources are recommended for preservation as open space (The
Cecil Group et al. 2005) (see Section 8.5 for a discussion of allowable uses for redevelopment due to the
previous industrial use of these sites).

Coastal Zone Management

Under the CZMA and the RI CRMP, the CRMC has review authority for all federal actions or activities
regardless of their location within a Rhode Island coastal community or state territorial waters. However,
only the disposal of the surplus property is a federal action; the subsequent redevelopment would be a
non-federal action. Although the CRMC has direct state-permitting authority for non-federal projects
located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, Tank Farms 1
and 2 are not located in any tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, so
state review of coastal resources is not applicable. However, the Coastal Development Policies of the
Aquidneck Island SAMP do apply to this property (see Table 8.1-1).

Standards
Entire

Policy

The primary goal/standard for any development project along the
shoreline must be a requirement to provide public access to and
along the shoreline within the project property boundary.
A) 25% Minimum Vegetation Requirement – Applicants must
include sustainably landscaped areas in their proposals to
achieve vegetative coverage of at least 25% of the surface area
over the entire development parcel.
B)

Storm Water Management – All new development and
redevelopment proposals shall meet the storm water
requirements of CRMP Section 300.6 and as specified in the
most recent edition of the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and
Installation Standards Manual to control peak flow rates and
volumes and improve water quality. Communities should be
implementing LID practices to meet the 2007 Cleaner
Narragansett Bay Act (R.I.G.L. § 45-61.2), which requires LID
as the primary means of managing and treating storm water.

C)

Open Space – There are three aspects to open space
designations of importance. First is the choice of the land that
should be set aside and what qualities that land possesses, and
second is the links between the open space parcels that allow
greenways throughout the area and improve the value of the
land and mobility for residents. The third aspect is the design of
the designated areas that will ensure their long-term value.

D) Public Access – When applicants choose the Coastal Greenway
option, the CRMC requires that shoreline and arterial public
access pathways be provided by the applicant within the
development site, as described in Aquidneck Island SAMP
Coastal Development Section 150.5.
E)

Draft EIS

Construction Setback – A construction setback of 25 feet is
required for all new and existing residential, commercial,
mixed-use, and other structures to provide for fire, safety, and
maintenance purposes. The setback is measured from the
inland edge of the Coastal Greenway or buffer.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Defense Highway/Burma Road. Defense Highway/Burma Road is a 4.4-mile north/south roadway,
connecting Stringham Road in Middletown with the Gate 17 access road to NAVSTA Newport in
Portsmouth. The roadway, which is classified as an urban collector, operates under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. Navy and is a major access point between the Navy operations and West Main Road. Defense
Highway/Burma Road is a two-lane roadway with a bicycle lane. The posted speed limit along the
roadway varies between 25 and 35 miles per hour in both directions.
Bradford Avenue. Bradford Avenue is a two-lane east/west roadway that connects West Main Road with
the waterfront area and marine uses in Portsmouth. It is a local side street, posted as a private way.
Bradford Avenue transitions into Chelsea Drive approximately 600 feet west of West Main Road. The
west portion of the roadway, accessing the tank farms and the waterfront, is gated and closed to vehicular
traffic. The posted speed limit is 15 miles per hour.
Alexander Road. Alexander Road, also known as East Passage, is a two-lane north/south roadway.
Alexander Road provides direct access from Stringham Road and Defense Highway to the East Passage
Yachting Center/Melville Marina along the Portsmouth coast. The posted speed limit along the roadway
is 15 miles per hour.
West Main Road (Route 114) and Bradford Avenue Intersection. The intersection of West Main Road
with Bradford Avenue forms a three-way unsignalized intersection. West Main Road runs in a
north/south direction and Bradford Avenue runs east/west. A stop sign on Bradford Avenue controls the
intersection. A Town of Portsmouth-owned parcel of land, the Melville School, which fronts on West
Main Road, is located on the south side of Bradford Avenue; this parcel encumbers a portion of Bradford
Avenue. A Navy-owned parcel exists on the opposite (north) side of Bradford Avenue; this parcel is the
Rainbow Heights housing development. The deed and recorded plan for the town-owned parcel indicates
that there is a perpetual easement and right-of-way on Bradford Avenue in the vicinity of the Melville
School for the Navy to use to access West Main Road from the Tank Farms (Crosby 2013). Due to the
proximity of the school driveway, both the Navy’s easement and the town’s encumbrance apply to the
same portion of Bradford Avenue.
West Main Road (Route 114) and Stringham Road Intersection. The intersection of West Main Road
with Stringham Road forms a four-way signalized intersection. West Main Road runs in a north/south
direction and Stringham Road runs in an east/west direction. The westbound approach to the intersection
is formed by the driveway for Dunkin Donuts. Left-turn lanes are in all directions.
Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road Intersection. The intersection of Defense
Highway/Burma Road with Stringham Road forms a skewed three-way unsignalized intersection. A stop
sign exists at the Defense Highway/Burma Road intersection with Stringham Road. Stringham Road and
Defense Highway/Burma Road intersect at a sharp angle (i.e., a hairpin turn) and require drivers on
Stringham Road northbound to turn almost 180 degrees to travel southbound on Burma Road.

8.4.2

Existing Traffic Volume

Traffic volumes were collected in October 2012 at three intersections and four points near Tank Farms 1
and 2 (see Figure 8.4-1). Table 8.4-1 shows the morning and evening peak hour volume for the
intersections of West Main Road and Stringham Road, West Main Road and Bradford Road, and Defense
Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road. Existing traffic volumes at the intersection of Defense
Highway and Stringham Road were the lowest. Traffic volumes were similar where West Main Road
intersects Stringham Road and where it intersects Bradford Avenue. The morning peak hour traffic
occurred between 7:15 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., while evening peak hour traffic occurred between 3:15 p.m.
and 5:45 p.m. Intersections were slightly busier during the evening peak hour. Average daily traffic

Draft EIS

8-13

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

volumes for West Main Road, Stringham Road, Bradford Avenue, and Alexander Road are also shown in
Table 8.4-1. West Main Road was significantly busier than the other roadways, with more than 22,000
daily vehicles. Bradford Avenue, which is gated at Tank Farm 2, carries fewer than 200 vehicles per day.

Roadway Intersection Level of Service

A capacity analysis was conducted to characterize the LOS at intersections near the former Tank Farms 1
and 2. LOS is a qualitative measure that describes general operating conditions based on factors such as
speed, travel times, and length of delays. LOS is reported on a scale of ‘A’ to ‘F’. ‘A’ represents the best
operating conditions with free-flowing traffic and ‘F’ represents the worst operating conditions with
significant delays. The traffic study looked at three intersections near Tank Farms 1 and 2 (see Table
8.4-2).

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The signalized intersection of West Main Road and Stringham Road currently operates at LOS B during
the morning peak hours and a LOS C at the evening peak hours. The West Main Road and Bradford
Avenue intersection is currently not signalized; Bradford Avenue operates under stop-sign control at this
intersection. During the morning peak hours, the northbound movements at this intersection operate at
LOS C or better, and the eastbound approach operates at LOS F. During the evening peak hours, the
northbound movements at this intersection operate at LOS A, and the eastbound operates at LOS F.
Similarly, the intersection of Defense Highway and Stringham Road is not signalized, with Defense
Highway operating under stop-sign control. The northbound approach to the intersection of Defense
Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road operates at LOS A during the morning peak hours, and the
northeast approach operates at LOS F. During the evening peak hour, the northbound approach to the
intersection operates at LOS A, while the northeast approach operates at LOS D.

8.4.4

Safety Conditions

Accident data from January 2010 to October 2012 were reviewed for the following road segments near
Tank Farms 1 and 2:
•

West Main Road between Stringham Road and Bradford Avenue

•

Bradford Avenue/ Chelsea Drive between West Main Road and East Passage

•

Stringham Road between West Main Road and Defense Highway/ Burma Road

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road between East Passage and the Middletown town line.

During this period, 122 accidents were recorded: 63 rear-end collisions, 23 angle crashes, 17 sideswipes,
10 vehicle collisions with an object, 4 involving a motorist loss of control, 4 collisions with an animal,
and 1 head-on collision (Pare Corporation 2013). Of the intersections studied near Tank Farms 1 and 2,
the majority of accidents were reported at the intersection of West Main Road and Stringham Road.
Fifty-seven accidents were reported at this intersection, 38 of which were rear-end collisions. The
intersection of West Main Road and Mill Lane had 23 reported accidents, the majority of which were also
rear-end collisions (Pare Corporation 2013).
A speed study was conducted on Stringham Rd west of Sullivan Drive. Stringham Road has a posted
speed of 30 miles per hour, and 78 percent of vehicles travel above the speed limit. The average speed of
vehicles on this roadway was 33 mph (Pare Corporation January 2013).

8.4.5

Public Transportation

RIPTA’s Route 60 bus service is the closest to Tank Farms 1 and 2. The route runs between Newport and
Providence via Middletown and Portsmouth. It originates at the Gateway Center in Newport and travels
along West and East Main Roads but does not provide direct access to the tank farms (RIPTA 2013b).

8.5

Environmental Management

This section summarizes the existing conditions regarding hazardous waste, hazardous materials, medical
waste, and the Environmental Restoration Program for the former Tank Farms 1 and 2.

8.5.1

Hazardous Waste

Hazardous waste is not routinely generated at Tank Farms 1 and 2. Small quantities of hazardous waste
could be generated in connection with ongoing IRP and RIDEM UST closure activities at the tank farms
(see Section 8.5.4 below), such as waste oil, oil filters, or oily wastes from the use of heavy equipment.
Suspected mercury-containing tank fluid-level indicators were observed during a 2010 infrastructure
inspection of the ethyl blending plant at Tank Farm 1. Potential mercury-containing wastes and materials
Draft EIS

8-15

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

are being addressed by the ongoing IRP activities at the tank farms (see Section 8.5.4) (Shaw
Environmental 2010).
Hazardous waste generated at NAVSTA Newport is collected in one of two satellite accumulation areas
(Building 23 at NHCNE or Building 1166, the HazMin Center) and then consolidated in a single 90-day
accumulation area (Building 15, hazardous waste drum storage). Hazardous waste is transported off-site
for disposal by a contractor in compliance with federal and state regulations (see Section 3.5.1.1). Used
oil and oily wastes, which the RIDEM considers to be hazardous wastes, are accumulated in seven “nonregulated” waste storage areas at NAVSTA Newport (Michael Baker Jr. Inc. 2011).

8.5.2

Hazardous Materials

8.5.2.1
Hazardous Material Control
The Tier II Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory report for 2011 does not list hazardous
materials at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (NAVSTA Newport 2012d). The tanks at Tank Farms 1 and 2 have been
cleaned and/or removed (see Section 8.5.4 below). Most of the underground fuel distribution piping also
has been cleaned (see Figures 8.5-1 and 8.5-2). Tanks 9 and 10 at Tank Farm 1 are in use as gross OWSs
(see Section 8.5.4); therefore, their contents contain some hazardous material.
Some residual fuel (product) might remain in lines and equipment at the tank farm, as evidenced by the
NAVSTA Newport spill log. According to the installation spill log for 2002 through 2011, 20 gallons of
fuel oil were spilled from a pipe leak at Tank Farm 1 in 2002. The spill was cleaned up and reported to
the National Response Center and RIDEM (NAVSTA Newport 2012e).
8.5.2.2
Underground Storage Tanks
Six inactive USTS are located at Tank Farm 1, and 11 inactive USTs are located at Tank Farm 2 (see
Figures 8.5-1 and 8.5-2). The tanks were formerly used to store fuel and are being addressed by the
ongoing IRP and UST closure activities at the tank farms. Tanks 9 and 10 at Tank Farm 1 are partially
buried USTs that formerly stored fuel and now are used as gross OWSs (see Section 8.5.4).
Under a separate project (unrelated to this EIS), the Navy plans to demolish the USTs/OWSs at Tank
Farm 1 along with associated components. This project is scheduled to be completed in 2016 and before
transfer of the property. It will include the demolition of six USTs and two USTs/OWSs at Tank Farm 1
and the demolition of the concrete utility trenches and the associated fuel distribution piping, bottom
sediment water piping, and steam distribution piping in trenches within the tank farm (NAVSTA Newport
2015). (Note: This project is separate from the actions addressed in this EIS, and the impacts associated
with the demolition and removal activities would be addressed in a separate NEPA document.)
The Navy similarly intends to demolish 11 USTs and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2, although the
schedule for this demolition has not been established. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis, the
USTs and associated facilities at Tank Farm 2 are assumed to be transferred in place as part of the
property transfer for this proposed action.
A 1,000-gallon fuel-oil UST previously located southeast of Building 48 at Tank Farm 2 was removed in
2009 (see Figure 8.5-2) (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
8.5.2.3
Aboveground Storage Tanks
Two ASTs (Tanks 11 and 12) previously located at Tank Farm 1 and used for fuel storage (see Figure
8.5-1) were removed in 2012 in connection with ongoing UST closure activities at the tank farms (see
Section 8.5.4). There are no ASTs at Tank Farm 2.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Tanks 11 and 12, along with the valve houses located adjacent to Tanks 11 and 12 (Tank 11 valve house
and Tank 12 valve house), Pump House 63, the junction valve house, and above-grade piping were
demolished and removed in March 2012 (Shaw Environmental 2013). The valve houses associated with
Tanks 11 and 12 and the junction valve house were demolished to the foundations. Hazardous material
abatement for ACM, PCBs, and LBP was completed for these structures prior to demolition (Shaw
Environmental 2013).
8.5.2.4
Oil/Water Separators
Tanks 9 and 10 at Tank Farm 1 are used as gross OWSs to store underground ring drainage and storm
water from Tank Farms 1 and 2 (see Figure 8.5-1 and Section 8.5.4.1). There are two inactive,
underground OWSs at Tank Farm 1, which are further discussed in Section 8.5.4. There are no OWSs at
Tank Farm 2.
8.5.2.5
Asbestos-Containing Materials
The underground fuel lines, steam lines, and condensate lines that were constructed throughout Tank
Farms 1 and 2 potentially contain asbestos-containing pipe insulation, especially the steam and
condensate lines (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009; Greenhorne & O’Mara 2011). Asbestos abatement
of the steam line associated with four concrete piping chambers (two at Tank Farm 1 and two at Tank
Farm 2) was performed in 2000 in preparation for closeout and removal of the chambers (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009; Tetra Tech EC, Inc. 2008a). In conjunction with the cleaning of the
underground fuel lines at Tank Farm 2 in 1996/1997, asbestos abatement was reportedly performed for
encountered sections of piping with asbestos-containing insulation (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b). With the
exception of those removals, asbestos-insulated piping remains at Tank Farms 1 and 2. A pre-demolition
hazardous materials survey performed in 2010 of selected areas of Melville North, including Tank Farm
1, included a survey of pipes in various tank vaults, trenches, and tunnels. Extensive asbestos insulation,
much of it in deteriorated condition, was reported for the steam and condensate piping that was surveyed
(Greenhorne & O’Mara 2011).
Due to their age, the buildings at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are generally suspected to contain ACM (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009). Two surveys of the buildings at Tank Farms 1 and 2 have been
conducted. The 2010 pre-demolition hazardous materials survey (Greenhorne & O’Mara 2011) included
an asbestos survey of some of the buildings at Tank Farm 1. A focused asbestos survey was conducted in
April 2013 to provide information for this EIS and to update and fill in gaps from the previous survey.
The executive summary of the report documenting the April 2013 survey (YU & Associates 2013) is
provided in Appendix E. Table 8.5-1 summarizes the results of both surveys, which show some limited
quantities of asbestos in the buildings that were assessed.

In the April 2013 survey, ACM was identified based on a combination of analytical results, visual survey and observations,
and professional judgment.

8.5.2.6
Lead-Based Paint/Lead
Due to their age, the buildings at Tank Farms 1 and 2 that are painted are generally suspected to contain
LBP (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). The 2010 pre-demolition hazardous materials survey
(Greenhorne & O’Mara 2011) included an LBP survey of some of the buildings. A focused LBP survey
was conducted in April 2013 to provide information for this EIS and to update and fill in gaps from the
previous survey. The executive summary of the report documenting the April 2013 survey (YU &
Associates 2013) is provided in Appendix E. Table 8.5-2 summarizes the results of both surveys, which

In the April 2013 survey, LBP was identified based on a combination of screening and analytical results, visual survey and
observations, and professional judgment. XRF measurements were used as a screening and measurement method, with
follow-up chip or bulk sampling in cases where XRF readings were inconclusive.
The report for the April 2013 survey identifies specific material types positive for LBP for each building, e.g., concrete floors
vs. wood floors.
Soil sampling was performed at facility drip lines where potential LBP was observed to be peeling or chipping.

Draft EIS

8-23

The April 2013 survey also included an evaluation of lead in the soil outside of Building 48 at Tank Farm
2. One composite soil sample was collected at facility drip lines where potential LBP was observed to be
peeling or chipping. The result (2,200 mg/kg) exceeded the RIDEM residential direct exposure criterion
(DEC) for lead of 150 mg/kg and the RIDEM industrial/commercial DEC for lead of 500 mg/kg. LBP
was not evaluated in the environment around other buildings at the tank farms either because there is no
exterior paint on those buildings or because of a lack of accessible soil.
A former buoy storage area at Tank Farm 2 is being assessed as an AOC under the IRP because the buoys
likely were painted with LBP. The investigation of that AOC is addressed in Section 8.5.4.
8.5.2.7
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
Transformers at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are mounted on poles and in transformer buildings and electrical
substations. PCB-containing transformers were removed or replaced at NAVSTA Newport in the 1980s
(U.S. Department of the Navy 2009), and the Navy is not otherwise aware of any PCB-containing
transformers at the installation (CNIC n.d.[d]). In 2009, several used transformers were observed on
wooden pallets at Building 199, electrical substation 15, at Tank Farm 1 (see Figure 8.5-1). “PCB-free”
stickers were observed on some of the transformers (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). One composite
window caulking sample from Building 48 at Tank Farm 2 was evaluated for PCBs in April 2013 to
provide information for this EIS. The executive summary of the report documenting the April 2013
evaluation (YU & Associates 2013) is provided in Appendix E. The composite window caulking sample
from Building 48 did not contain PCBs.
PCBs have been assessed in groundwater at Tank Farm 1 and in soil at Tank Farms 1 and 2 as part of
ongoing IRP and UST closure activities (see Section 8.5.4). PCBs have not been detected in groundwater
at Tank Farm 1. PCBs have been reported in soil near transformer vault 2 at Tank Farm 1 and near
Building 219 at Tank Farm 2 at levels exceeding RIDEM standards and are being addressed under the
IRP.
8.5.2.8
Pesticides
Pesticides are not known to have been stored, nor are they currently stored, at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009). Pesticides likely have been and continue to be applied at the tank farms
as necessary in accordance with the NAVSTA Newport Integrated Pest Management Plan (Geo-Marine
2009 [see Section 3.5.1.2]).
8.5.2.9
Radioactive Materials
There are no reports of the use of radioactive materials at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (U.S. Department of the
Navy 2009).
8.5.2.10 Radon
Radon surveys have not been conducted at any of the current or former buildings located within Tank
Farms 1 and 2 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). Radon levels in general are low throughout
NAVSTA Newport (see Section 3.5.1.2).

Environmental Restoration Program

Tank Farm 1 is IRP Study Area 7, and Tank Farm 2 is IRP Study Area 10. Both sites are currently being
investigated under the IRP, as noted in Section 3.5.1.4. The current status of both sites is described in
more detail below.
8.5.4.1
IRP Study Area 7, Tank Farm 1
Tank Farm 1, consisting of 62 acres, was used by the Navy from the 1940s to 1974 to store diesel oil, fuel
oil, jet fuel (JP-4, JP-5, or JP-8), gasoline, and aviation fuel. Tank Farm 1 was leased to the DESC from
1974 to 1998 for petroleum fuel storage and distribution. (During this time, Tank Farms 1 and 2 were
referred to as Defense Fuel Support Point [DFSP] Melville.)
The features of Tank Farm 1 are listed in Table 8.5-3 and shown on Figure 8.5-1. These features are the
six steel USTs (Tanks 13 through 18), two former steel ASTs (Tanks 11 and 12), two partially buried
concrete USTs (Tanks 9 and 10) that were originally used to store fuel and were later used to store storm
water and water collected from the ring drains and other sources. Tanks 9 and 10 currently function as
OWSs, which discharge to another OWS located near the fuel loading area west of Tank Farm 1 (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009; Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a).
Underground petroleum distribution piping surrounds and connects the tanks and facilities and leads to
the fuel-loading area west of Tank Farm 1. A storm water system composed of ring drains runs beneath
Tank Farms 1 and 2 (AH/BH 2011). Each UST has a ring drain, and ring drain water and storm water are
directed to Tanks 9 and 10 on Tank Farm 1 (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). Tanks 9 and 10 are partially
underground and can contain up to 2.56 million gallons of water collected from the ring drains around the
tanks in Tank Farm 2 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009; AH/BC 2011). At one time this ring drain
system had pumps that pumped groundwater through a trench system to eventually reach Tanks 9 and 10.
However, in 2002, power was disconnected to the pumps and no flow has been pumped through this
drainage system since that time (AH/BC 2011).

The USTs, associated piping, and buildings/facilities at Tank Farm 1 are scheduled for demolition in 2016 under a separate
project. These include Tanks 9 and 10, 13 through 18, associated piping, Buildings 30, 49, 1158, B60, and Electric vaults 2
and 3 (NAVSTA Newport 2015).

Approximately 6,000 gallons of tank bottom sludges from periodic cleanings that took place from the
1940s to 1974 were disposed of in on-site pits (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b). The six USTs (Tanks 13 through
18) were cleaned between 1996 and 1997, at which time numerous leaks were observed. The tanks were
repaired and then ballasted in 2001. The fuel distribution piping for the majority of the tanks was cleaned
and pressure-tested in 1996/1997 and subsequently decommissioned (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). Tanks 9
and 10 and their associated piping have not been cleaned or structurally assessed and contain stored water
(Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). Tanks 11 and 12, which were steel ASTs, were cleaned, inspected, and
ballasted with water in the late 1990s and demolished in 2012.
Various environmental investigations have been conducted at Tank Farm 1 starting in 1983, when the
Navy performed an installation-wide Initial Assessment Study. Tank Farm 1 was identified as IRP Study
Area 7 in the 1992 Federal Facility Agreement entered into by the Navy, EPA Region I, and the State of
Rhode Island under CERCLA §120 (U.S. EPA 1992). Areas of Tank Farm 1 associated with the tanks
and potential petroleum releases are being investigated by the DESC under RIDEM’s UST program (see
Section 3.5.1.2). This includes the tanks, fuel piping, underground ring drain system, underground
OWSs, former sludge pits, fuel unloading area, and drainage features. RIDEM also has requested that
transformer areas be investigated (Shaw Environmental 2010). Areas associated with potential
CERCLA-regulated releases are being investigated by the Navy under the CERCLA IRP. The
environmental studies conducted since 1983 have been completed by the DESC to address petroleumrelated contamination (e.g., total petroleum hydrocarbons [TPHs], metals) prior to returning the property
back to the Navy. The Navy is using applicable results to inform their IRP strategy for Tank Farm 1
(Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). DESC studies to date have included soil, groundwater, surface water, soil-gas,
and test pit sampling, as well as aquifer pumping tests, passive free-product removal, and light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) gauging (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009; Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a).
The DESC installed more than 50 monitoring wells in the 1990s.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The areas at Tank Farm 1 that have been identified as CERCLA IRP-regulated consist of the ethyl
blending plant and transformer vaults 2 and 3 and their immediate environs. The three areas are
considered Category 1 areas under CERCLA because they are associated with the potential for historic
releases—lead and gasoline blending constituents from activities at the ethyl blending plant and PCBs
from transformers at vaults 2 and 3. Areas of potential fuel and petroleum releases are considered
Category 2 areas that are being assessed under the RIDEM UST regulations. Category 3 areas are those
for which the scope of the investigation or the regulatory pathway has not yet been defined. These areas,
if identified, could include non-petroleum-based or CERCLA-defined hazardous contaminants such as
asbestos, mercury switches, LBP, and PCB-containing caulking (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a).
Key results from the various environmental investigations conducted from 1983 to date are summarized
in Table 8.5-4. In general, TPHs, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), lead, metals, and some other
constituents have been found in groundwater in some of the monitoring wells, but few constituents have
been found in groundwater at levels exceeding either RIDEM standards or CERCLA standards such as
EPA screening criteria. Soil in various areas of the site contains varying levels of petroleum-related
constituents such as TPHs, VOCs, and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), including polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and naphthalene. Some of the testing results show levels of these
constituents that exceed RIDEM or EPA standards. Arsenic also has been found in soil in several areas.
PCBs have been found in soil near transformer vault 2 at levels exceeding RIDEM standards and continue
to be assessed across the site in areas near transformers.

Free-phase product was detected downgradient of Tanks 16 and 17 in the early 1990s. The product was
determined to be immobile and not recoverable. Passive product-recovery canisters were installed in
five monitoring wells in 1996. Sampling from 1997 to 2010 did not detect any free-phase product.
Groundwater sampled from various monitoring wells has been analyzed for constituents such as TPHs,
VOCs, SVOCs, lead, metals, PCBs, pesticides, gasoline, gasoline range organics (GRO), and diesel
range organics (DRO). Not all wells have been sampled for the same constituents.
Benzene exceeded RIDEM standards near Tank 15, Tank 17, and the fuel unloading area in the early
1990s. Benzene results from more recent sampling did not exceed any standards.
TPHs, VOCs, lead, metals, and some other constituents have been found in groundwater at levels below
RIDEM or EPA standards.
Soil

Soil has been tested at many locations throughout Tank Farm 1 for constituents such as VOCs; benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX); SVOCs; PCBs; lead; metals; TPH; and oil and grease. Not
all locations have been sampled for the same constituents.

The Navy and DESC are actively working at Tank Farm 1. IRP and UST closure work is primarily in the
remedial investigation phase, with discrete removal actions being performed concurrently as feasible
(e.g., the 2012 removal of Tanks 11 and 12). Investigation of the ethyl blending plant and transformer
vaults 2 and 3 is the focus of the next IRP phase of study and will include more sample locations, media,
and constituents in support of the IRP, such as VOCs, SVOCs (PAHs), PCBs, and metals. In support of
the RIDEM UST program, soil samples also will be analyzed for TPH (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). The
ROD is scheduled to be developed by May 2016 (Ward 2015). Various remedial alternatives will be
evaluated, and the remedial action or actions eventually selected may include land use controls.
As discussed above in Section 8.5.2.2, a project to demolish eight USTs along with associated fuel
distribution piping, ring drain piping, and other components at Tank Farm 1 is in place and scheduled for
2016 and would be completed prior to transfer. In addition, a proposed project to demolish 11 USTs at
Tank Farm 2 along with associated fuel distribution piping, ring drain piping, and other components is in
the preliminary planning stage. If implemented, this removal action would be conducted in compliance
with the RIDEM UST closure process.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The IRP site closest to Tank Farm 1 is Tank Farm 2, which is contiguous to Tank Farm 1 and is addressed
in Section 8.5.4.2. Three non-Navy CERCLA sites are located in the vicinity of Tank Farm 1 (see
Section 3, Figure 3.5-1). Melville North Landfill (identifier RID981064421), located approximately 0.5
miles southwest of Tank Farm 1, was remediated in 2000 under Rhode Island authority, and the property
was acquired by a private business for redevelopment (Restoration Advisory Board [RAB] for Naval
Station Newport 2002). The STP Sludge Drying Bed site (identifier RID981064306) and Structure 214
site (identifier RID981064249), both located near the Melville North Landfill, are listed as active sites in
EPA’s Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System
(CERCLIS) database, although no recent activities are reported. None of these three sites is on the NPL.
8.5.4.2
IRP Study Area 10, Tank Farm 2
The Tank Farm 2 site, consisting of 74 acres, has a history similar to that of Tank Farm 1. Tank Farm 2
was operated by the Navy from the 1940s to 1974 to store fuel oil, distillate fuel, and marine diesel fuel.
Tank Farm 2 was leased to the DESC from 1974 to 1998 for petroleum fuel storage and distribution
(DFSP Melville).
The features of Tank Farm 2 are 11 concrete USTs (Tanks 19 through 29) and associated support areas
and buildings (see Table 8.5-5 and Figure 8.5-2). Underground petroleum distribution piping surrounds
and connects the tanks and facilities and leads to the fuel-loading area west of the tank farm.
Underground ring drains surround each of the USTs and function as a groundwater drainage system to
prevent excessive hydrostatic uplift on the bottoms of the tanks. The ring drains are connected to
drainage pipes that discharge to Tanks 9 and 10 at Tank Farm 1 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009;
AH/BC 2011).

Approximately 100,000 to 175,000 gallons of tank bottom sludges were disposed of on the ground
surface and in pits from periodic cleanings that took place from the 1940s to 1974 (Tetra Tech NUS
2009). In areas near Tanks 19 and 21, it appears that the sludge also might have been burned (Tetra Tech,
Inc. 2012b). The USTs were cleaned between 1996 and 1997, at which time numerous leaks were
observed. The tanks were repaired and then ballasted in 2001. The fuel distribution piping was cleaned
and pressure-tested in 1996/1997 and subsequently decommissioned (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b). A 1,000gallon UST located southeast of Building 48 was used to contain fuel oil to heat the building. The UST
was removed in 2009 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
Various environmental investigations have been conducted at Tank Farm 2 starting in 1983, when the
Navy performed an installation-wide Initial Assessment Study. Tank Farm 2 was identified as IRP Study
Area 10 in the 1992 Federal Facility Agreement entered into by the Navy, EPA Region I, and the State of
Rhode Island under CERCLA §120 (U.S. EPA 1992). Areas of Tank Farm 2 associated with the tanks
and potential petroleum releases are being investigated by the DESC under RIDEM’s UST program (see
Section 3.5.1.2). This includes the tanks, fuel piping, ring drain system, former sludge pits, and drainage
features. RIDEM also has requested that transformer areas be investigated (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b).
Areas associated with potential CERCLA-regulated releases are being investigated by the Navy under the
CERCLA IRP. The environmental studies conducted since 1983 have been completed by the DESC to
address petroleum-related contamination (e.g., TPHs, metals) before returning the property back to the
Navy. The Navy is using applicable results to inform their IRP strategy for Tank Farm 2 (Tetra Tech
2012b). DESC studies to date have included soil, groundwater, soil-gas, and test pit sampling, as well as
aquifer pumping tests, passive free-product removal, and LNAPL gauging (U.S. Department of the Navy
2009; Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b). The DESC installed 28 monitoring wells in the 1990s.
The areas at Tank Farm 2 that have been identified as CERCLA IRP-regulated consist of four AOCs near
Tanks 19 and 21, where it is suspected that sludge was deposited on the ground and burned; Building 219,
a transformer building; and a former JP-5 soil pile and buoy storage area. The areas are considered
Category 1 areas under CERCLA because they are associated with the potential for historic releases—
toxic constituents from burning petroleum sludge (e.g., dioxins and furans), PCBs from transformers, and
lead from LBP on buoys stored on-site. Areas of potential fuel and petroleum releases are considered
Category 2 areas that are being assessed under the RIDEM UST regulations. Category 3 areas are those
for which the scope of the investigation or the regulatory pathway has not yet been defined. These areas,
if identified, could include non-petroleum-based or CERCLA-defined hazardous contaminants such as
asbestos, mercury switches, LBP, and PCB-containing caulking (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b).
Key results from the various environmental investigations conducted from 1983 to date are summarized
in Table 8.5-6. In general, TPHs, VOCs, SVOCs, lead, DRO, and some other constituents have been
found in groundwater in some of the monitoring wells at levels below RIDEM standards. LNAPL has
been observed in monitoring wells near Tanks 20 and 26, and petroleum product has been observed in
groundwater near Tank 29. Soil in various areas of the site contains varying levels of petroleum-related
constituents such as TPHs, SVOCs, and DRO, typically at levels below RIDEM standards. PCBs have
been found in soil near Building 219 at levels exceeding RIDEM standards and continue to be assessed

across the site in areas near transformers. Remedial excavations were performed in 2005 for three areas
of the site based on TPH results obtained from test pit excavation and sampling: more than 2,000 cubic
yards of soil were removed from an area near Tank 25 when a release was discovered, and soil also was
removed from two AOCs known as AOCs 28 and 37. The soil in the area of the former UST near
Building 48 was shown to contain TPH at levels below RIDEM standards.

The Navy is actively working at Tank Farm 2. IRP and UST closure work are primarily in the remedial
investigation phase, with discrete removal actions being performed concurrently as feasible, such as the
soil removals conducted in 2005. Investigation of the IRP-regulated areas in the next IRP phase of study
will include more sample locations, media, and constituents such as VOCs, SVOCs (PAHs), PCBs, lead,
metals, dioxins, and furans (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b). The ROD is scheduled to be developed by
November 2017 (Ward 2015). The remedial design is scheduled to include land use controls.
As discussed above in Section 8.5.2.2, a project to demolish eight USTs along with associated fuel
distribution piping, ring drain piping, and other components at Tank Farm 1 is in place and scheduled for
2016 and would be completed prior to transfer. In addition, a project proposed to demolish 11 USTs at
Tank Farm 2 along with associated fuel distribution piping, ring drain piping, and other components is in

with the RIDEM UST closure process.
The closest IRP site to Tank Farm 2 is Tank Farm 1, which is contiguous with Tank Farm 2 and is
addressed in Section 8.5.4.1. IRP Site 21, the former Melville water tower, is about 0.5 miles east of

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Tank Farm 2 (see Section 3, Figure 3.5-1). The water tower was installed in the late 1930s to service
fueling piers and fuel storage facilities at a training station. LBP was applied and removed from the water
tower from the 1940s to the 1990s. The water tower was dismantled and removed in 2006. Following
site investigations that showed LBP chips, lead, and paint constituents in site soils, the Navy conducted a
soil removal action in 2007, which met the cleanup goals for the site. No further action has been
determined to be necessary for IRP Site 21 (NAVFAC 2013b).
The three non-Navy CERCLA sites addressed in Section 8.5.4.1 are located about 0.25 miles southwest
of Tank Farm 2 (see Section 3, Figure 3.5-1).

8.6.1

Air Quality
Existing Air Quality

Section 3.6 discusses the regional air quality and applicable regulations and requirements. The CAA is
the primary federal statute governing the control of air quality. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located in the
Town of Portsmouth, Newport County, RI. This location is in the Providence, RI air quality region,
which encompasses all of Rhode Island and is currently in attainment for all NAAQS. The state is under
the jurisdiction of RIDEM for air quality.

8.6.2

Existing Emissions

Operations at Tank Farms 1 and 2 ceased in 1998. While operating petroleum fuel tanks (USTs and
ASTs) can be significant sources of emissions and are therefore subject to permitting requirements, the
tanks at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are no longer in use and are therefore not an existing source of emissions.
Emissions from maintenance of the properties would be minimal. Therefore, there are no quantified
existing stationary or mobile sources of criteria, HAPs, or GHG emissions from the current use of the
properties.

8.7

Noise

Ambient sound levels are a function of a variety of sources: local traffic, barking dogs, birds, insects,
lawnmowers, children playing, the interaction of the wind with groundcover, buildings, trees, shrubs,
power lines, etc. Sound levels vary with time of day, wind speed and direction, and the level of human
activity. The acoustic environment around Tank Farms 1 and 2 is mainly characterized by traffic noise
during daytime hours.
Table 8.7-1 presents the minimum and maximum hourly average Leq sound levels measured in 2010 at the
monitoring station nearest to the tank farms (LT-1) (Tech Environmental 2011) (see Figure 3.7-1 in
Section 3.7).

Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the existing infrastructure, utilities, and solid waste management at Tank Farms
1 and 2.

8.8.1

Water Supply

Water is supplied to Tank Farms 1 and 2 by NAVSTA Newport via two water mains along Defense
Highway. Lines from these mains to Tank Farms 1 and 2 have been cut and capped with the closure of
these properties (Carlson 2012).
NAVSTA Newport and the Town of Portsmouth purchase water wholesale from the City of Newport, and
distribute the water through water distribution networks owned and maintained by the station and the city,
within their respective jurisdictions. Generally, the Navy owns the water distribution system west of
West Main Road, and the Portsmouth Water and Fire District owns the water distribution east of West
Main Road. However, the portion of the Town of Portsmouth where Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located (i.e.,
the Melville Area) is serviced by the Navy’s system, with water provided by the City of Newport. The
City of Newport is the main supplier; however, emergency water is available through the Portsmouth
Water and Fire District.
The City of Newport has two water treatment plants with a current combined capacity of 16 mgd. The
Town of Portsmouth receives its water from the City of Newport’s Lawton Valley WTP, which is located
in the Town of Portsmouth. The Town of Portsmouth has a current demand of 1.3 mgd (see more
discussion of the City of Newport water supply in Section 6.8.1).

8.8.2

Wastewater

Tank Farms 1 and 2 were not connected to a wastewater collection system, and no wastewater collection
lines are located on either of the properties. A force main associated with NAVSTA Newport’s
wastewater collection system is located along Defense Highway and passes near the sites but does not
connect to any lines on either site.
Currently, the Town of Portsmouth has no centralized wastewater collection or treatment infrastructure.
Portions of the town manage wastewater through individual septic systems. The Melville area of
Portsmouth is serviced by the City of Newport’s wastewater collection and treatment system (Woodard &
Curran 2009).
The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant is located on J.T. Connell Highway, and its licensed
capacity is 10.7 mgd. The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant treats wastewater from the City
of Newport, the Town of Middletown, the Melville area of Portsmouth, and NAVSTA Newport. In 2012,
the plant treated 9.46 mgd of wastewater (City of Newport Department of Finance 2012a). However,
there is no additional capacity with the existing allocations; if all existing allotments were fully utilized,
Pump Station 988 in Melville would be above capacity.

8.8.3

Storm Water

Storm water is managed through a combination of surface flow through culverts, in trench systems
located in the old steam pipe trenches, and secondary containment. Most of the roadways in the tank

Draft EIS

8-33

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

farms have culverts to remove surface water from the roadway with discharge overland (AH/BC 2011).
Secondary containment structures in the form of berms exist near former Tanks 11 and 12 in Tank Farm
1. Storm water collected in these containment berms is managed through open manual valves, which
convey flows directly to the OWS via gravity feed (AH/BC 2011). Prior to heading to the oil/water
separator, these flows combine with flows from Tanks 9 and 10, which are currently being used as storm
water/groundwater detention basins (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). A storm water system composed of ring
drains runs beneath Tank Farms 1 and 2 (AH/BH 2011). Each UST has a ring drain, and ring drain water
along with storm water is directed to Tanks 9 and 10 (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a on Tank Farm 1. Tanks 9
and 10 are partially underground and can contain up to 2.56 million gallons of water collected from the
ring drains around the tanks in Tank Farm 2 (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009; AH/BC 2011). At one
time this ring drain system had pumps that pumped groundwater through a trench system to eventually
reach Tanks 9 and 10. However, in 2002, power was disconnected to the pumps and no flow has been
pumped through this drainage system since that time (AH/BC 2011).
The Tank Farm 2 storm water system discharges to the system located in Tank Farm 1 and eventually
discharges to Narragansett Bay through Outfall 008, located at the marina (U.S Department of the Navy
November 2009; AH/BC 2011). The flow to the outfall is primarily via a gravity connection from Tank
Farm 1 downslope and under Defense Highway and the railroad tracks and through two abandoned
oil/water separators (AH/BC 2011).
The properties operate under the Navy’s general storm water permit (RIR800126). The Tank Farms 1
and 2 ring drains operate under an additional RIPDES storm water permit (RI0020150) (U.S. Department
of the Navy 2009).

8.8.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
National Grid is the primary electrical utility providing connection and distribution services on
Aquidneck Island. This is a user-supported utility service, and the customers pay for the service and
electricity supplied.
Table 4.8-1 in Section 4.8 shows the electrical usage for the City of Newport, Town of Middletown, and
Town of Portsmouth between 2009 through 2011. As shown in Table 4.8-1, the Town of Portsmouth
consumed more than 111 million kWh in 2011 (Rhode Island Energy 2012). The 2011 electric
consumption represented a decrease from 2010 but was still an increase over the levels used in 2009.
According to the 2012 Regional System Plan developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode Island’s
overall electricity demand has been forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the next
decade.
Natural Gas
Aquidneck Island and the surrounding region are serviced by National Grid. This is a user-supported
utility service, and the customers pay for service and natural gas supplied.
Table 4.8-2 in Section 4.8 shows the natural gas usage for the City of Newport, Town of Middletown, and
Town of Portsmouth in 2010 and 2011. As shown in Table 4.8-2, the Town of Portsmouth consumed
more than 210 billion cf in 2011 (Rhode Island Energy 2012).

8.8.5

Solid Waste

Solid wastes are generated at Tank Farms 1 and 2 in connection with ongoing IRP and UST closure
activities. Such wastes consist of paper, plastic sheeting, and general trash. Specific activities such as the

Draft EIS

Tank Farms 1 and 2

recent demolition of Tanks 11 and 12 also generated C&D wastes consisting of concrete, metal, building
materials, and mechanical components.
Since 1995, solid waste generated at NAVSTA Newport has been collected, disposed, and recycled offsite by a contractor (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). C&D waste also is collected, disposed, and
recycled off-site by a contractor.

8.9

Cultural Resources

This section describes the existing cultural resources and historic properties that are located within the
APE for the proposed action at Tank Farms 1 and 2. The boundary of the APE is the same as the
boundary of the property that will be disposed. Cultural resources within the APE would consist of
archaeological sites, archaeologically sensitive areas, and architectural resources. Archaeological and
architectural resources are discussed in greater detail in Sections 8.9.1 and 8.9.2, respectively. Native
American resources are discussed in detail in Section 8.9.3. Cultural resources that were determined
historic properties are discussed in greater detail in Section 8.9.4.
In general, the APE was considered sensitive for cultural resources that were associated with a variety of
cultural periods of human occupation. Previously recorded archaeological sites or archaeologically
sensitive areas were identified in the vicinity of the APE and indicate prehistoric and historic settlement
and/or use of the general project area. Extant buildings and structures within the APE document more
recent occupation and use of the area from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, including the
construction of Tank Farms 1 and 2 during the World War II period.

8.9.1

Archaeological Resources

The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation conducted within the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2 consisted
of the excavation of a total of 122 shovel tests. Shovel tests were primarily placed along the margins of
the tank farms in an attempt to avoid the extensive disturbance associated with construction of the
underground tanks, although some of the shovel tests were oriented towards sources of fresh water that
lay outside the project area to the north of Tank Farm 1 and to the east of Tank Farm 2. One of the 122
shovel tests contained a single historic artifact (a glass bottle stopper), which is considered an isolated
find; none of the other 121 shovel tests contained any artifacts. Generally, shovel test profiles at both
tank farms revealed significant subsurface disturbance from previous cutting and filling during the
construction of the tank farms. Although some of the shovel tests revealed intact or partially truncated
plowzone horizons, these areas were small (typically less than 100 feet [30 meters] in extent) and no
artifacts were recovered from these areas. Based on these results, no archaeological sites were identified
within the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2 and no further archaeological investigations of the APE at Tank
Farms 1 and 2 were recommended (Gould and LeeDecker 2014). The Navy consulted with the Rhode
Island SHPO on the lack of archaeological sensitivity of the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Rhode
Island SHPO concurred that no further archaeological investigations of this area were required (Lin 2013;
Sanderson 2013b).

8.9.2

Architectural Resources

The 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update conducted for the proposed action reassessed the
NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District, as depicted in Figure 8.9-1. The historic district was
previously determined NRHP-eligible in 1998 under Criteria A and C as a relatively intact representation
of the Navy’s continuous presence in Newport, associated with themes of naval operations, and
architecture and engineering of twentieth-century buildings and structures with a period of significance of
1900 to 1945 (Louis Berger & Associates, Inc. 1998).

Draft EIS

8-35

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

As a result of the 2013 update, the boundaries of the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District have
been expanded to include all property currently owned by the Navy in the Melville North area, including
the remaining portion of Tank Farm 1 and all of Tank Farm 2, as contributing elements to the historic
district. With this expansion, the period of significance for the historic district has been revised to extend
from 1910, when Tank 1 was constructed, through to 1973, when the Navy’s Shore Base Realignment
Program relocated the Atlantic Fleet from Newport and the fuel depot no longer made a significant
contribution to the mission of the installation or the Atlantic Fleet (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014).
In their entirety, Tank Farms 1 and 2 are representative of the build-up of Navy support facilities just
prior to and during the early years of World War II. The majority of tanks and support structures on these
tank farms have retained sufficient integrity to convey a sense of the tank farms as they were during
World War II and the Cold War. The importance of the buildings and structures of Tank Farms 1 and 2 is
their connection to the fuel depot as a whole, rather than individually. Tank Farms 1 and 2 were essential
elements of the fuel depot, and were a critical component of the fueling function. As such, they are
NRHP-eligible under Criterion A for their association with the conduct of World War II (1941-1945) and
their continuing role in providing fuel to the Atlantic Fleet through 1973. The construction and design of
the tank farms incorporated the use of pre-stressed concrete, which is illustrative of what was then a novel
means of construction and, later, an accepted method. As such, the tank farms are NRHP-eligible under
Criterion C as early examples of what became a standard technique of postwar building construction
(Groesbeck and Bedford 2014).
With the results of the 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update, a total of 55 structures or
buildings would comprise the Melville Naval Historic District: 47 contributing elements and eight noncontributing elements (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014). Of these 55 structures or buildings, 26 are extant
structures or buildings within the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2—13 at Tank Farm 1 and 13 at Tank Farm
2. All of these 26 extant structures or buildings have been identified as contributing elements of the
expanded NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District (see Table 8.9-1 and Figure 8.9-1). The Navy
consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the evaluation of the buildings and structures within the APE
at the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property for NRHP-eligibility, and the Rhode Island SHPO concurred that
these buildings and structures were NRHP-eligible (Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b).
In July 2015, the Navy determined that it must demolish abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 to comply
with Rule 13 of the Rhode Island Rules and Regulations for Underground Storage Tank (UST) Facilities
used for Petroleum Products and Hazardous Materials. As part of the proposed demolition of abandoned
facilities at Tank Farm 1 to comply with Rule 13, the following buildings or structures at Tank Farm 1 are
scheduled to be demolished: Tanks 9 and 10 and 13 through 18; Buildings 49, B60, and P30; underground
direct piping (including steam lines, berm drain lines, fuel lines, bottom sludge and waste lines, and foam
lines) and concrete utility tunnels and pipe chambers (Structures S133, S140, S267, S268, U238; all
remaining separators tanks, chambers, and valve chamber pits; and two transformers vaults [S359,
S360]). Additionally, Building 30 (an underground reservoir that is located outside the currently drawn
boundaries of Tank Farms 1 and 2 but is associated with the fueling operation of the Tank Farm) is part of
the same demolition action at Tank Farm 1 (Dorocz 2015a; NAVSTA Newport 2015). Collectively, these
buildings and structures would represent all of the architectural resources within Tank Farm 1, such that
following demolition, there would be no remaining architectural resources within Tank Farm 1.

8.9.3

Native American Resources

The Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian tribes regarding Native American
resources within the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2: the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee
Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for copies of
consultation letters). Consultation remains open.

NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties

The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation and the 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update
conducted for the proposed action confirmed that the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2 overlaps a portion of
the previously identified NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District and resulted in the identification
of additional architectural resources (structures and buildings) that have been included as contributing
elements of the historic district. Based on these results, Navy determined that the previously identified
Melville Naval Historic District remains NRHP-eligible under Criteria A and C, expanded the boundaries
of the district to include all Navy-owned property in the Melville North area, including the remaining
portion of Tank Farm 1 and all of Tank Farm 2, and revised the period of significance to between 1910
and 1973. As discussed in Section 8.9.2 and summarized in Table 8.9-1, 26 extant structures or buildings
that are contributing elements of the historic district (Tanks 9 and 10 and 13 through 18, and Buildings
49, 199, B60, P-30, and T-588 at Tank Farm 1; Tanks 19 through 24 and 26 through 29 and Buildings
218, 219, 220, and A-105 at Tank Farm 2) are located within the APE for the proposed action at Tank
Farms 1 and 2. With these changes, the historic district would comprise 47 contributing elements and 8
non-contributing elements.
The Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the identification of historic properties within the
APE for the proposed action at the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property (Lin 2013). The Rhode Island SHPO
concurred with the identification of historic properties within the APE for the proposed action at the Tank
Farms 1 and 2 property (Sanderson 2013b).
Separately, as part of the proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 to comply with
Rule 13, the Navy evaluated the effects of the demolition of the abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 and
determined that the demolition project would have an adverse effect on Tank Farm 1, which is eligible for
listing in the NRHP (Dorocz 2015a). Tank Farm 1 is considered NRHP-eligible because its facilities are
contributing resources to the Melville Naval Historic District (originally called “Melville Fuel Depot and
Naval Net Depot Historic District”) (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014; Sanderson 2013b). The Rhode Island
SHPO concurred with the Navy’s determination that the proposed demolition of the abandoned facilities
at Tank Farm 1 would have an adverse effect on historic properties because Tank Farm 1 is located within
the Melville Naval Historic District (Sanderson 2015).

Tank Farms 1 and 2

8.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the existing topography, geology, and soil conditions at the Tank Farms 1 and 2
properties.

8.10.1

Topography

The topography of Tank Farms 1 and 2 generally shows increases in elevation from west to east as the
property extends farther inland from Narragansett Bay. Tank Farm 1 elevations range from
approximately 30 feet amsl at the western boundary approximately 1,000 feet inland of the shoreline to
approximately 150 feet amsl at the eastern boundary. Tank Farm 2 elevations range from approximately
90 feet amsl at the western land boundary to approximately 150 amsl at the eastern land boundary. The
nearest body of water is the Melville Ponds, which is located less than 100 feet north of Tank Farm 1 and
approximately 1,600 feet northwest of Tank Farm 2.

8.10.2

Geology

Tank Farms 1 and 2 lie within the New England Physiographic Province (USGS 2002). The site is
located on the Rhode Island Formation of the stratified Narragansett Bay Group of the Pennsylvanian
period (323 to 290 million years ago). The Narragansett Bay Group rocks are part of the Esmond-Dedham
subterrane of the Southeastern New England Avalon zone. The Esmond-Dedham Subterrane Narragansett
Bay Group is deposited upon older rocks of both West Bay and East Bay parts of the Esmond-Dedham
subterrane. The Narragansett Bay Group – Rhode Island Formation consists of meta-sandstone, metaconglomerate, schist, carbonaceous schist, and graphite. Plant fossils are common (USGS 2013).
According to the USGS, only one earthquake has ever been recorded as possibly being centered in the
State of Rhode Island. This earthquake was recorded on February 27, 1883 (USGS 2009). No other
earthquakes have been recorded in the state. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located in an earthquake zone
(although not near any known fault locations [USGS 2005]) where, in a 50-year period, there is only a 2
percent chance of an earthquake occurring with a peak acceleration (ground movement) of 8 percent to 10
percent acceleration due to gravity (%g). It takes a peak acceleration of 10%g to cause damage to
buildings; therefore, there is minimal risk of an earthquake that would cause damage to a building on
Tank Farms 1 and 2 (USGS 2009).

8.10.3

Soils

8.10.3.1 Soil Types
The soil types present on Tank Farms 1 and 2 are the Udorthents-Urban land complex, the Newport silt
loam 8 percent to 15 percent slopes, and the Newport-Urban land complex. The majority of the soils on
both Tank Farms 1 and 2 are the Udorthents-Urban land complex. Soil types are listed in Table 8.10-1
and illustrated on Figure 8.10-1.
Udorthents-Urban Land Complex (UD)
The Udorthents-Urban land complex consists of moderately well-drained to excessively drained soils that
have been disturbed by cutting or filling and includes areas that are covered by buildings and pavement.
The Udorthents-Urban land complex has 0 to 1 percent of surface area covered by bedrock and/or shallow
to bedrock soil. The parent material in which the soil was formed is commonly referred to as fill—
human-altered/transported material that includes a variety of soil and geologic material deposited by
human activity (USDA 2012).
Newport Silt Loam, 8% to 15% slopes (NeC)
The permeability of this soil is moderate or moderately rapid in the surface layer and subsoil and slow or
very slow in the substratum. The soil is suitable for community development but is limited by the slow or

very slow permeability in the substratum and by the steep slopes. Roads need careful design to prevent
frost heaving (USDA 1981).

Newport-Urban Land Complex (NP)
Newport-Urban land complex consists of well-drained Newport soils and areas of urban land. The main
limitation of Newport soils for development is the slow or very slow permeability in the substratum.
Roads and streets require special design to prevent frost heaving (USDA 1981).
8.10.3.2 Soil Characteristics and Limitations
As indicated in Section 3.10, the USDA rates soils according to characteristics that could limit
development. These characteristics include:
•

Draft EIS

Erosion Potential. The soil erosion potential for the Newport silt loam, 8 to 15% slopes
and Newport-Urban land complex is moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at a
depth of 24" to 30", which means the soils are moderately susceptible to detachment and
they produce moderate runoff (USDA 2012; IWR 2002). No erosion potential was listed
for Udorthents-Urban land complex (USDA 2012).
−

Hydric Soils. The Udorthents-Urban land complex, Newport silt loam, 8 to 15%
slopes, and the Newport-Urban land complex soils are listed as dominantly nonhydric, although non-hydric soil can contain hydric inclusions (USDA 2012).

−

Constructability. There are moderate constraints to development with NewportUrban land complex soil. The more common sources of constructability limitations
for the soils include shallow excavations (slight limitations due to dense to very
dense soils), moderate frost action, and a moderate slope. Although these soils are
dense, they have a low shrink-swell potential (USDA 2012; USDA 1981).

−

Udorthents-Urban land complex soils have a few restrictions on development if onsite septic tanks are to be used. These soils have been used as fill material to build up
recreational areas and highways (USDA 1981; USDA 2012).

−

Newport silt loam, 8% to 15% slopes, has a low shrink-swell potential (USDA 1981;
USDA 2012). The severe slope could lead to a major increase in construction effort,
special design, or intensive maintenance. The soils have a seasonal high water table
(from 3.5 to 1.5 feet), which also restricts or constrains residential or commercial
development (USDA 2012).

−

Organic Soils. Soils of the Tank Farm 1 and 2 were not listed as organic soils
(USDA 1981; 2012).

8.10.3.3 Farmland Soils
The Udorthents-Urban land complex and Newport-Urban land complex soils located at Tank Farms 1 and
2 are not rated for farmland. The Newport silt loam with 8% to 15% slope is designated as farmland of
statewide importance (USDA 2012) (see Section 3.10 for a description of farmland of statewide
importance).

8.11 Water Resources

The following sections summarize the existing conditions and physical characteristics of water resources
found in the vicinity of Tank Farms 1 and 2.

8.11.1

Surface Water

The tank farms are located in the Upper East Passage sub-watershed (HUC 010900040907) of the
Narragansett Bay watershed. The Upper East Passage sub-watershed includes a small portion of
Middletown and a larger portion of Portsmouth and drains 14.58 square miles. It comprises primarily
forested and residential areas (University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center 2013c).
There are no surface water resources at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (see Figure 8.11-1). The closest off-site
surface waters are the Melville Ponds and an unnamed stream less than 100 feet to the north of Tank
Farm 1. The regulated riverbank wetland associated with the unnamed stream is discussed below in
Section 8.11.5. Because of the topography of the area, Tank Farms 1 and 2 drain to the southwest toward
Narragansett Bay. Narragansett Bay is located approximately 1,000 feet to the west of Tank Farm 1.

8.11.2

Water Quality

Both the Melville Ponds and the unnamed stream are considered Class A waters by RIDEM (see Table
3.11-1 in Section 3.11). Melville Ponds is classified by RIDEM in the State of Rhode Island 2012 303(d)
List – List of Impaired Waters as impaired for non-attainment of the following designated uses: fish and
wildlife habitat (RIDEM 2012a). Fish and wildlife habitat is indicated as impaired because phosphorus
(total) exceeds the state standard (RIDEM 2012a).
The most recent water quality monitoring for Tank Farms 1 and 2 is summarized here; for additional
details regarding historical sampling and monitoring results, refer to Section 8.5.
Tank Farm 1
As discussed in Section 8.5.4.1, surface water and groundwater samples have been collected as part of the
IRP/CERCLA investigations. Groundwater samples were analyzed for GRO, DRO, VOCs, SVOCs,
total/dissolved lead, and TPH. Laboratory analysis of groundwater samples indicates concentrations
below the applicable GB Groundwater Objectives, but a few constituents have been found at levels
exceeding either RIDEM or CERCLA standards (Shaw Environmental 2010; Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a).
The 2010 sampling did not have any exceedances of applicable standards in groundwater (Tetra Tech,
Inc. 2012a).
Additional groundwater monitoring wells have been installed and sampling is ongoing for analysis for
VOCs, SVOCs, and metals (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). These samples will be used to establish the extent of
contamination, specifically near the ethyl blending plant.
All surface water sampling was conducted off-site at the adjacent Melville Ponds and Melville Brook. No
samples were collected from the on-site manmade pond. Historical sampling completed in 1995 of the
Melville Ponds and Melville Brook did not show any exceedances of standards for surface water quality.
Surface water samples were analyzed in 2010 for TPH and gasoline and were below detection limits

Draft EIS

8-45

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

(Shaw Environmental 2010). Therefore, no further testing of surface water has been or will be done (Tetra
Tech, Inc. 2012a).
Tank Farm 2
No surface water sampling has been conducted at Tank Farm 2. Previous groundwater investigations have
led to the installation of 28 monitoring wells (see Section 8.5.4.2 and Table 8.5-6 for summary
information regarding these previous investigations). The most recent groundwater investigations were
conducted in 2009; 15 site wells were sampled and the samples collected were analyzed for VOCs,
SVOCs, and total dissolved lead. Additionally, five selected wells were sampled for TPH (Tetra Tech,
Inc. 2012b). No further action was indicated as a result of the previously conducted sampling, with the
exception of periodic gauging and bailing of LNAPL (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b). No specific groundwater
quality standards exist for GB groundwater, such as that classified at Tank Farms 1 and 2. However, most
of the parameters sampled were non-detect in the samples that were tested. The only four parameters that
were detected were lead – both total and dissolved, DRO, and GRO. Dissolved lead was detected in only
two samples, one at 2.5 ppm and one at 3.2 ppm. Total lead was detected in four samples and ranged from
1.5 to 1.9 ppm. DRO was detected in only two samples at levels of 0.12 and 0.16 mg/L. GRO was
detected in only one sample with a level of 0.01 mg/L (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b).

8.11.3

Groundwater

Groundwater at Tank Farm 1 is generally encountered approximately 2 to 20 feet below ground surface
(Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). Groundwater at Tank Farm 2 is approximately 5 to 30 feet below ground surface
and the water table is usually within the bedrock (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012b).
Groundwater in the vicinity of the tank farms is classified by the RIDEM as GB (RIDEM 2010d). As
described in Section 3.11, GB groundwater resources may not be suitable for public or private drinking
water use without treatment due to known or presumed degradation. No wellhead protection areas are
near Tank Farms 1 and 2; the closest wellhead protection area is located approximately 1.25 miles to the
northwest on Prudence Island (RIDEM 2010d).

8.11.4

Floodplains

No FEMA-delineated floodplains are on Tank Farms 1 and 2. The closest floodplains are located
approximately 250 feet to the west and are associated with the coastline of Narragansett Bay (see Figure
8.11-1).

8.11.5

Wetlands

Three small potential wetlands were identified on Tank Farm 1 during wetland ground-truthing surveys
conducted in 2013; these wetlands total approximately 0.26 acres (see Figure 8.11-2). Two of these
wetlands are in the area of the former tank beds and have been most likely caused by impounding water
above the impermeable layer that underlies the tank beds (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). Vegetation in these
two potential wetland areas is characterized by sedges (Carex spp.), rushes (Juncus spp.), goldenrods
(Solidago spp.), cattail (Typha latifolia), and willow (Salix spp.) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). The third
potential wetland is approximately 16-feet by 20-feet, adjacent to a 12-inch diameter pipe where it
transitions from aboveground to below ground. (This wetland is represented by point data on Figure
8.11-2). Wetland vegetation includes sedges, rushes, and flatsedge (Cyperus spp.) (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014a). Each of these potential wetland areas is associated with a perimeter wetland (defined as the
upland area 50 feet from the wetland edge); however, a perimeter wetland has not been identified for the
third wetland due to only point data associated with this feature and the lack of approximate wetland
boundaries in the form of a wetland polygon (see Figure 8.11-2).

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The perimeter wetland for the adjacent Melville Ponds also extends onto Tank Farm 1. The Melville
Ponds wetland complex is located north–northeast of Tank Farm 1 and northeast and east of Tank Farm 2.
This complex is a mix of palustrine emergent and palustrine forested scrub/shrub wetlands, and ultimately
discharges to Narragansett Bay north of Tank Farm 1. The unnamed tributary associated with the Melville
Ponds has a regulated riverbank wetland, defined in Section 3.11.1 as the land area within 100 feet of the
edge of any flowing water body with a width of less than 10 feet during normal flow. This regulated
riverbank wetland does not extend within the boundary of Tank Farm 1 (see Figure 8.11-2).
No wetlands exist on Tank Farm 2, as verified by the 2013 surveys.

8.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the existing vegetation and wildlife, including threatened and endangered
species and significant wildlife habitat, at Tank Farms 1 and 2.

8.12.1

Vegetation

Vegetation communities at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are based on a combination of the 2006 RINHS survey,
coupled with a more recent field survey completed in 2013 (see Section 3.12.1.1 for additional
information regarding these surveys) and include mixed oak/white pine forest, old field, and ruderal
forest. These communities cover approximately 121.7 acres, or 89 percent of Tank Farms 1 and 2. The
remainder of the tank farms, approximately 14.5 acres, is developed land. Habitat cover types and their
respective acreages at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 8.12-1 and summarized in Table 8.12-1.

Notes:
1
The vegetation community data obtained from the 2014 INRMP do not include the approximate wetland locations discussed
in Section 8.11.5.

Mixed Oak/White Pine Forest
This vegetation community comprises approximately 5.5 acres (4 percent) in the southeastern corner of
Tank Farm 2. This community comprises approximately 40 percent to 50 percent white pine (Pinus
strobus) in the overstory, along with a variety of deciduous trees, including several oak species (Quercus
spp.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and others (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014a). The understory in this community is sparse because of the closed canopy, and the herbaceous
layer is absent.
Old Field
The old field community is the most prevalent community within Tank Farms 1 and 2, comprising
approximately 74.7 acres (55 percent) of the site. Dominant species in this community include sweet
vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), pathrush (Juncus tenuis),
goldenrods, clover (Trifolium spp.), butter ‘n’ eggs (Linaria vulgaris), knapweed (Centaurea
biebersteinii), and pokeweed (Phytolacca Americana) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). Wines and woody
vegetation within the old field community can includes species like Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera

japonica), Allegheny blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), apple
(Malus spp.), and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.).
Ruderal Forest
Ruderal forest accounts for approximately 41.5 acres or 30 percent of the property at Tank Farms 1 and 2.
These forests are characterized by a combination of early-successional trees that cannot be considered a
natural ecosystem. At NAVSTA Newport, these forests are composed of red maple (Acer rubrum), white
pine, red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), European larch (Larix decidua), and gray birch (Betula
populifolia), with black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), apple, black cherry, and walnut (Juglans nigra) at
lesser numbers (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).

8.12.2

Wildlife

Wildlife present at Tank Farms 1 and 2 is more diversified than at the other surplus properties due to the
variation in land cover combined with the proximity to the coast. The data presented below are based on
surveys conducted in 2013, as reported in the 2014 INRMP (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Terrestrial Mammals
Mammals at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are typical of suburban environments in the northeast and include such
species as the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), common raccoon (Procyon lotor), Virginia
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and coyote (Canis latrans). The woodland cover of the forested areas at
the property also provide habitat for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianaus) (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).
Herpetofauna
Section 3.12.1.2 provides a discussion of herpetofauna likely to occur at the surplus properties, including
Tank Farms 1 and 2.
Avian Species
Many species of birds likely use the ecological resources at Tank Farms 1 and 2 because of its proximity
to the water of Narragansett Bay. The tree stands within the coniferous and deciduous upland forest types
provide harbor to many species of birds, especially with the open land of the mapped agriculture to the
south of the property fragmenting the habitat. Woodpeckers (Picidae), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus),
and woodcock (Scolopax sp.) are all bird species attracted to the woodland habitat at Tank Farms 1 and 2.
Two documented osprey nests have been mapped within 1,000 feet of Tank Farms 1 and 2 (see Figure
8.12-2) (NOAA 2011). A more comprehensive discussion of avian species common to the areas around
the surplus properties, including Tank Farms 1 and 2, and respective nearby IBAs is provided in Section
3.12.1.2.

8.12.3

Threatened and Endangered Species

Agency-review letters were sent to the USFWS, NMFS, and the RIDEM in order to obtain updated
information regarding listed species for all surplus properties. A response from the USFWS was received
on February 13, 2013, which confirmed that no federally listed or proposed threatened or endangered
species or critical habitat are known to occur at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (Chapman 2013). A response from
the RIDEM was received on February 12, 2013, indicating that no state-listed or candidate rare,
threatened, or endangered species are located at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (Jordan 2013). Because the property
is inland, the response from the NMFS is not relevant for inclusion here.
Following Navy’s initial informal consultation with the USFWS in 2013, the northern long-eared bat was
listed as a threatened species, as discussed in Section 3.12.1.3.

NAVSTA Newport, Rhode Island

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The northern long-eared bat has been observed at NAVSTA Newport. During the spring, summer, and
fall months, the northern long-eared bat is likely to use forested edge habitat; spaces under tree bark, in
cavities, or in crevices of both live and dead trees; coastlines; and/or abandoned buildings within
NAVSTA Newport for roost sites, foraging, and/or travel. Suitable roost trees are defined as those that
have a DBH greater than 3 inches. They are also known to roost in structures such as barns and sheds
when suitable roost trees are not available. Summer foraging habitat consists of a variety of forested
habitats, including both dense forests and loose aggregates of trees. In addition, bats may forage in
adjoining lands such as wetlands, old fields, and agricultural lands (USFWS 2013a).
The Navy conducted various passive acoustic monitoring surveys for bats between 2009 and 2013 at
NAVSTA Newport in support of a proposed 20 MW wind energy facility within the NAVSTA Newport
installation, as discussed in Section 6.12.3.2. The 2009 and 2010 surveys did not report results for
northern long-eared bats, which was not a named species for those surveys. During a survey conducted in
the spring and late summer of 2011, northern long-eared bats were detected at two of the three locations
monitored: the coastal met tower and a 1.5-meter-high stake at Tank Farm 4. The third survey location
used in 2011 consisted of a met tower at Tank Farm 4, at which the northern long-eared bat was not
detected (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2011c). Fifteen northern long-eared bat calls were reported for the 2013
survey: three calls at Bishop Rock peninsula, two calls at a stake location at Tank Farm 4, five calls at a
stream location at Tank Farm 4, and five calls at a wetland location at Tank Farm 5 (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014b, 2014c). Tank Farm 4 is the closest monitoring location to the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property,
located approximately 1 mile to the southwest. No monitoring was conducted in 2012 (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014b).
Active acoustic monitoring for bats was conducted in summer 2013 along transects in the same general
areas of the station—coastal areas at the southern end of the station and Tank Farms 4 and 5. Northern
long-eared bat calls were not specifically reported as a result of the active acoustic monitoring. The Navy
conducted mist netting for bats over seven nights in July 2013 at various locations; however, the closest
location to the Tank Farms 1 and 2 was more than 1.3 miles to the southwest, within Tank Farm 4.
Because few bats were caught, and none were northern long-eared bats, radiotelemetry for northern longeared bats has not been performed. Echolocation bat passes that were documented in conjunction with
the mist-netting survey did not attribute any of the passes to the genus Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014b).
Based on the results of passive acoustic monitoring, the Navy documented one call sequence for the
northern long-eared bat at Tank Farm 4, the closest monitoring site to Tank Farms 1 and 2, in 2011 and
seven call sequences in 2013. Of the 8,826 total call sequences reported at NAVSTA Newport from the
passive acoustic monitoring conducted for bats from 2009 to 2013, 73 calls were documented as nonspecific Myotis species calls, and 1,397 were documented as “unknown high-frequency” calls, which can
be attributable to Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014c). Northern long-eared bats were neither detected during
active acoustic monitoring conducted in 2013 at Tank Farm 4 nor captured during mist netting conducted
at Tank Farm 4 in 2013.
A field survey in December 2014 to determine the suitability of summer roosting habitat for the northern
long-eared bat, identified approximately 30 acres of suitable or potentially suitable summer roosting
habitat at Tank Farm 4. Suitable summer roosting habitat was considered to be trees with one or more of
the following characteristics:

The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding the potential presence of the northern long-eared bat at the
surplus properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston 2015a). The Navy received a response from the USFWS via
electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal consultation and provide additional information
about the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015).
The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). To date,
USFWS has not provided a response, and informal consultation with the USFWS on the potential effects
of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat is ongoing.

8.12.4

Significant Habitats

Based on a review of the Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program database, RIDEM’s Division of
Planning and Development has indicated that no unique natural communities or other significant wildlife
communities exist at or near the surplus property (Jordan 2013). However, the following aquatic
communities have been documented.
Eelgrass
Although there is no eelgrass habitat at Tank Farms 1 and 2, an area of eelgrass habitat consisting of
about 9.5 acres is approximately 1,000 feet from the property.
Wetlands
As indicated in Section 8.12.1, three potential wetlands are located within the property boundaries of
Tank Farm 1. These wetlands are discussed in detail in Section 8.11.5. Additionally, there are wetlands
just outside of the property boundary. These palustrine emergent and forested/shrub wetlands comprise
four wetland systems located just outside the property boundaries (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
One of the NWI wetlands mapped outside of the property is part of the Melville Ponds chain, which
discharges to Narragansett Bay to the north of the property and provides habitat for a more diverse array
of fauna than found on Tank Farms 1 and 2.
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at Tank Farms 1 and 2.

9 Tank Farms 1 and 2 Environmental Consequences
9.1

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section describes the potential land use impacts resulting from disposal and reuse of Tank Farms 1
and 2 under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of
site-specific land use impacts, direct and indirect 16 impacts on surrounding existing land uses, consistency
with local zoning and land use plans, and consistency with the enforceable policies of the RI CRMP. The
study area includes Tank Farms 1 and 2 and the surrounding land within 0.25 miles in the Town of
Portsmouth.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, Tank Farms 1 and 2
would be under the jurisdiction of the Town of Portsmouth. The use of the land and the development of
new buildings or structures on the site would be regulated by the Town of Portsmouth’s zoning code and
other applicable plans and regulations.

9.1.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.1.1.1
On-Site Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would change the use of Tank Farms 1 and 2 from vacant, industrial, and
open space uses to mixed use development, including office, light industrial, marina-related (boat
storage), multi-modal parking, and possibly a solar array. Figure 9.1-1 shows the proposed redevelopment
footprint. Redevelopment would occur primarily in the southern and eastern portions of Tank Farm 1 and
the southern portion of Tank Farm 2.
The total land area of Tank Farms 1 and 2 is 136 acres. Approximately 2.5 acres of combined property
would be redeveloped with office uses, 4.4 acres with light industrial or marina-related uses, 4 acres
adjacent to the railroad with multi-mode parking, and 3.6 acres with the proposed solar array. An
additional 14.4 acres of the combined property would be redeveloped with other parking facilities, and 2.2
acres would be redeveloped as access roads, for a total of 20.6 acres of parking and access roads. A total
of 31.1 acres (23 percent) of the site would be redeveloped; 104.9 acres (77 percent) would remain as
open space. Under existing conditions, approximately 5.1 acres are characterized as developed land, or
approximately 3.7 percent of the total acreage. Portions of the site above and within 300 feet of the USTs
are assumed to be not suitable for redevelopment or reuse because of the potential structural instability of
the USTs and surrounding soils (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). 17
Remediation of documented ER Program sites on Tank Farms 1 and 2 is ongoing. The tank farms will
likely be cleaned up to industrial standards. Upon completion of remediation, it is anticipated that land
use controls, which may include restrictions on the type of development or permitted uses or activities, or
site access will be developed based on state standards for former industrial sites (see Section 9.5 for
additional discussion).

16
17

Indirect impacts on surrounding land uses are based on the potential for the proposed action to generate changes
in the land use type, pattern, or density.
As previously discussed in the EIS, a project to demolish and remove the USTs and associated piping is in the
preliminary planning stage. However, the Redevelopment Plan, which is part of the proposed action evaluated in
this EIS, is based on the assumption that the USTs would remain in place.

Draft EIS

9-1

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Therefore, Alternative 1 would impact the existing land use conditions at the site. These impacts would
result from demolishing some of the existing structures and replacing the existing institutional land use
with the mixture of the new land uses identified above; these impacts would be considered moderate.
Implementation of Alternative 1 also would result in the public having access to the formerly restricted
military property, except in any areas where access is restricted as indicated in the deed transfer
documents.
9.1.1.2
Surrounding Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would introduce a new mixed-use area to the study area; at full build-out,
this area would be developed to a greater intensity than the residential and recreational areas to the north,
east, and south of the tank farms. The density of development would be similar to the marina-related and
commercial land uses located east of the tank farms on the Melville shoreline and business uses located
south of the tank farms just outside of the study area. The types of development proposed under
Alternative 1 generally would be consistent with surrounding land uses, provided that they comply with
the regulations for nuisances and hazards, such as emissions of noise, light, dust, or smoke, in the town’s
zoning ordinance. The proposed redevelopment under Alternative 1 would be contained entirely within
the site boundaries and would have no direct impacts on surrounding land uses. Access to the site would
be from Defense Highway, Stringham Road, and Bradford Avenue. Any consideration of other access
points has not been included in the analysis. Redevelopment of the site would require creating new access
points and thus would be associated with a moderate and long-term impact on surrounding roadways.
Indirect impacts on the surrounding transportation network are discussed in Section 9.4.
Mixed-use redevelopment of 31.1 acres of Tank Farms 1 and 2 could result in growth-induced changes in
land use on other properties in the vicinity of the properties, but these growth-induced impacts are likely
to be limited, based on current economic conditions. The Redevelopment Plan includes an analysis of
local market conditions and concludes that only a limited potential for expansion of office and industrial
development exists in Portsmouth. Although there has been a trend toward conversion of industrial
properties to accommodate other service, office, and non-industrial uses, Portsmouth competes with
office markets in Middletown and Newport, and most growth in demand for office space on Aquidneck
Island has been from smaller companies that need smaller spaces (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
While marine and marina-related businesses, representing a relatively small but locally important
industry, are expected to grow, this growth is expected to be limited because of economic conditions and
a shortage of skilled employees. Development of approximately 15 acres of formerly Navy-owned land
in the Melville Backyard with marina-related industrial and office uses and boat storage is ongoing (RKG
Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). This development will accommodate expansion of existing businesses in the
Melville area and is expected to be sufficient to meet the space needs of these businesses for the
foreseeable future (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
Development under Alternative 1 could result in growth-induced changes in land use if additional land is
made available for development or redevelopment in the Melville area and economic conditions support
additional development. Alternative 1 and any subsequent development in the Melville area could draw
businesses from other areas on Aquidneck Island, leading to local conversion or vacancy of existing
industrial and office properties. Any indirect impacts on land use would be expected to occur over
multiple years, which would mitigate any negative impacts. Thus, Alternative 1 would have a moderate
indirect impact on surrounding land use.
9.1.1.3
Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located in a zoned redevelopment district that allows three types of PUDs:
Planned Corporate Development, Planned Marine Trade Development, and Planned Retail/Service

Development. The proposed land uses under Alternative 1 generally are consistent with the uses
permitted in the redevelopment district. Solar arrays or, more generally, utilities, are not included as a
permitted use in the redevelopment district, and any developer proposing to construct a solar array on the
site would be required to apply for a use variance from the requirements of the zoning ordinance.
Adherence to the town’s requirements for applying for a variance and with the terms of the variance
would ensure consistency with the zoning ordinance.
The Town of Portsmouth Comprehensive Community Plan (Town of Portsmouth 1992 [as revised 2002])
designates Tank Farms 1 and 2 as a future waterfront district, intended to include industrial and business
land uses related to marine and marina-related industries. The land uses proposed under Alternative 1
would be consistent with the town’s goals for future land use in this area. Redevelopment of the site
would provide the town with the opportunity to create jobs and increase its tax base while conserving
undeveloped land and dedicated open space through reuse of the tank farms. Redevelopment of Tank
Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 would locate a mixture of compatible land uses near the existing
marina-related and commercial land uses along the Melville shoreline, which would not contribute
significantly to urban sprawl. The planned redevelopment would take advantage of multi-modal
transportation opportunities presented by the railroad adjacent to Tank Farm 1. Development of
residential land uses near the tank farms, as indicated in the town’s future land use plans for the area and
the draft Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan (Town of Portsmouth 2008b), could provide people
the opportunity to live near their workplaces and may contribute to a reduction in automobile use.
Alternative 1 would require expanding utilities, public improvements (primarily transportation-related),
and public services. The cost of these would be balanced by the increase in tax revenue resulting from the
proposed redevelopment (see Section 9.2 for additional discussion).
Alternative 1 would be consistent with the goals for redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 presented in
the draft Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan. Redevelopment of the site with the proposed
mixture of land uses would be compatible with existing businesses in the Melville shoreline and provide
opportunities for job creation and expansion of the town’s tax base. As noted, land above the remaining
USTs is assumed to be undevelopable and would be left as open space. Open space on the property
would be publicly accessible, unless land use controls put in place upon completion of remediation
prohibit public access. The draft Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan includes residential
development in conjunction with the planned Weaver Cove Marina Village. No residential development
is included as part of the proposed redevelopment under Alternative 1; however, Alternative 1 would
support the town’s overall goal for redevelopment of the site with non-residential land uses that would
generate economic activity.
Redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 would be consistent with the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan’s recommendation for mixed-use redevelopment of a portion of the tank farms
with land uses such as commercial, a mixture of resort and affordable housing, light-industrial, research
and development, and parking. Alternative 1 would follow this recommendation while taking into
account which land uses are allowable, based on the previous use of these sites (see Section 8.5). As
noted, the land uses proposed under Alternative 1 would be consistent with and support existing land uses
in the Melville area and would provide the town an opportunity for economic development. Thus,
Alternative 1 would be consistent with the master plan.
In summary, Alternative 1 would be primarily consistent with local planning; however, the solar array
would not be consistent with existing zoning. The developer would be required to obtain a use variance
for development of a solar array in the zoned development district. The variance would not result in a
significant impact on surrounding land uses.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

9.1.1.4
Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 1 is not
reasonably likely to affect the use or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone.
Disposal of the surplus property under Alternative 1 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to
the maximum extent practicable with the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. However,
redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would not be a direct federal action and would, therefore, fall
under the CRMC’s direct state permitting authority under the Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal
projects.
As noted in Section 8.1.4, the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property is not located in any tidal waters, on a
shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, so state review of coastal resources under the
CRMP is not applicable at this site. Redevelopment would be required to comply with the applicable
policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as outlined in Section 8.1.4. For purposes of this analysis, a
summary of consistency is provided below.
•

Section 130.8, Open Space and Public Access – Although Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not
located along the shoreline, redevelopment of this property would include the creation of
open space within the property boundaries. Therefore, the proposed action would be fully
consistent with this policy.

•

Section 150.1, Standards Applicable to Entire Development - The developer/owner of
Tank Farms 1 and 2 will be responsible for providing separate and appropriate
environmental documentation and obtaining all the necessary permits from state and
federal agencies that meet the applicable standards, addressing areas such as storm water
management (i.e., Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual
and CRMP 300.6), groundwater protection, infrastructure, vegetative cover (i.e., Section
150.1, Standards Applicable to Entire Development), SAV, open space, and construction
setback and water quality associated with the proposed activity (i.e., Water Quality
Certificate from RIDEM and USACE permit, concurrent with their application to
CRMC). Therefore, the proposed action would be consistent with these standards to the
maximum extent practicable.

•

Section 170, Redevelopment Zone – Although Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located within the
Melville/Weaver Cove redevelopment area they do not include shoreline property and
would not therefore provide access to the shoreline. Therefore, the proposed action would
be fully consistent with this policy.

Official consultation with the Rhode Island CRMC was initiated on February 11, 2014, with a letter
outlining the Navy’s CCD. The CRMC concurred with the Navy’s determination that disposal of the
surplus properties under the preferred alternative would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the
maximum extent practicable with the RI CRMP and that the developer of the Tank Farms 1 and 2
properties would be required to comply with the applicable policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP
(Willis 2014). A copy of the letter is included in Appendix B.

9.1.2

Alternative 2

9.1.2.1
On-Site Land Use
Under Alternative 2, Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped with the same mix of uses as under
Alternative 1. Figure 9.1-2 shows the proposed redevelopment layout under Alternative 2.
Redevelopment would occur in the same areas that would be redeveloped under Alternative 1. Under
Alternative 2, a total of approximately 3.2 acres would be redeveloped with office uses, 4.7 acres with
light industrial or marina-related uses, 4 acres with multi-modal parking, and 3.6 acres—the same as
under Alternative 1—with the proposed solar array. An additional 16 acres would be redeveloped with
other parking facilities, and 2.5 acres would be redeveloped as access roads, for a total of 22.5 acres of
parking and access roads. A total of 34 acres (25 percent) of the site would be redeveloped; 102 acres (75
percent) would remain as open space. Underground and aboveground storage tanks on Tank Farm 2
would be demolished. Land use controls that may be developed depending on the results of on-going
remediation at the tank farms are expected to be the same under Alternative 2 as under Alternative 1 (see
Section 9.5). The redeveloped area under Alternative 2 would be 9 percent greater than the redeveloped
area under Alternative 1. Land above the USTs would not be redeveloped or reused for the same reason
described under Alternative 1. Impacts on on-site land use under Alternative 2 would be the same as
those identified under Alternative 1 but would be slightly greater, given the larger area that would be
redeveloped.
9.1.2.2
Surrounding Land Use
Under Alternative 2, a slightly larger area of the site would be redeveloped. The types of land uses under
Alternative 2 would be the same as the land uses proposed under Alternative 1, and the proposed
redevelopment would be contained entirely within the site boundaries. Similar to Alternative 1,
redevelopment of the site would require creating new access points, which would be associated with a
moderate and long-term impact on surrounding roadways. Indirect impacts on the surrounding
transportation network are discussed in Section 9.4.
The intensity of redevelopment would be similar under Alternative 2 to proposed redevelopment under
Alternative 1; therefore, growth-induced indirect impacts on land use would be expected to be essentially
the same as those described under Alternative 1. The potential for more people to be present on the site at
full build-out would not be expected to have a notable effect on surrounding land use, based on the lack of
available land and existing economic conditions.
9.1.2.3
Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
Redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2 would be consistent with the Town of
Portsmouth’s zoning ordinance and the other local land use controls discussed in Sections 8.1.3 and 9.1.1.
Redevelopment would occur in the same locations as proposed under Alternative 1. The greater acreage
that would be redeveloped and amount of floor space that would be created under Alternative 2 would not
affect this alternative’s consistency with local land use controls. The types of land uses proposed under
Alternative 2 would be consistent with or support the goals of local land use plans for the same reasons
described under Alternative 1.
In summary, similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would be primarily consistent with local planning;
however, the solar array would not be consistent with existing zoning. The developer would be required
to obtain a use variance for development of a solar array in the zoned development district. The variance
would not result in a significant impact on surrounding land uses.

9.1.2.4
Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 2 is not
reasonably likely to affect the use or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the
surplus property under Alternative 2 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the RI CRMP. However, redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative
2 would not be a direct federal action and would, therefore, fall under the CRMC’s direct state permitting
authority under the Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal projects.
If Alternative 2 is selected, the Navy would be required to prepare a coastal zone consistency
determination for the proposed disposal and reuse of the property under Alternative 2 and submit it to the
Rhode Island CRMC for concurrence. Because Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not located in any tidal waters,
on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area, state review of coastal resources under the
CRMP is not applicable at this site. Redevelopment would be required to comply with the applicable
policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP, as outlined in Section 8.1.4.
Due to the similarities in land use types proposed, and the same geographic area of the proposed action
under Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 1, impacts of the proposed action on the use and natural
resources of the coastal zone under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1.

9.1.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, the surplus property at Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be retained by the
U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur, and the 136 acres included
in the site would remain vacant and closed to public access. Implementation of the No Action alternative
would have no direct or indirect impacts on surrounding land uses. Town zoning regulations would not
be enforceable since the tank farms would continue to be owned by the federal government and would be
outside of the jurisdiction of the Town of Portsmouth. This alternative would not be consistent with the
Town of Portsmouth’s comprehensive plan, the draft Portsmouth Tank Farm Redevelopment Plan, or the
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. These plans recommend redevelopment of the site with land
uses that would support the marina-related and commercial land uses in the Melville area and that would
generate additional economic activity in the Town of Portsmouth. Under the No Action alternative, none
of the potential economic benefits associated with redevelopment of the site would be realized.

9.2
9.2.1

Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

A detailed discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental justice consequences associated with the
redevelopment of all four surplus properties, including Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 (Preferred
Alternative) can be found in Section 5.2.1.
In summary, implementation of Alternative 1 is anticipated to have a beneficial economic impact on the
regional economy, no noticeable impact on local population and demographic characteristics, no
noticeable impact on the local housing market, a minor impact on the local commercial property market,
and a minor positive fiscal impact on the Town of Portsmouth. In addition no disproportionate impacts
on minority, Hispanic/Latino, low-income, or children are anticipated to occur under this alternative.

9.2.2

Alternative 2

A detailed discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental justice consequences associated with the
redevelopment of all four surplus properties, including Tank Farms 1 and 2 properties under Alternative
2, can be found in Section 5.2.2. The summary of impacts described above for Alternative 1 would also
apply to Alternative 2.

9.2.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, no redevelopment plan would be implemented and ownership of the
properties would be retained by the Navy. The properties would not be developed and would remain in a
caretaker status. No new economic activity would be generated and no increased employment
opportunities would occur. Regional population and the regional housing market would not be impacted,
nor would there be any impact on the regional commercial property market. Local government tax
receipts would not increase as the properties would retain their current tax-exempt status.

Community Facilities and Services
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

A discussion of the expected impacts on community facilities and services in the City of Newport and the
towns of Middletown and Portsmouth associated with the redevelopment of all four surplus properties,
including Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative), can be found in Section 5.3.1.

9.3.2

Alternative 2

A discussion of the expected impacts on community facilities and services in the City of Newport and the
towns of Middletown and Portsmouth associated with the redevelopment of all four surplus properties,
including Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2, can be found in Section 5.3.2.

9.3.3

No Action Alternative

There would be no impact on community facilities and services resulting from the No Action alternative.
The properties would be held in caretaker status by the Navy. There would be no change in population or
employment resulting from this alternative. In addition, no new recreational facilities would be built
under the No Action alternative.

9.4

Transportation

This section summarizes the potential transportation impacts resulting from construction and
implementation of the Redevelopment Plan at Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and
the No Action alternative. The evaluation of transportation impacts upon full build-out is based on the
analysis completed for the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the
Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). Roadways and intersections in the vicinity of Tank
Farms 1 and 2 include the following:
•

Stringham Road

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road

•

Bradford Avenue

•

Alexander Road

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Bradford Road Intersection

•

West Main Road (Route 114) and Stringham Road Intersection

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road Intersection.

The locations of these roadways and intersections are shown on Figure 9.4-1.
Traffic generated from construction was not captured in the traffic impact analysis. Therefore, the
evaluation of the impacts on existing traffic conditions from the construction traffic discussed herein is
Draft EIS

9-11

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

based on the number of buildings to be demolished, the volume of construction vehicles, and duration of
demolition/construction at Tank Farms 1 and 2.

9.4.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be accessed through two points on Stringham Road and one point on Bradford
Avenue (see Figure 9.4-1). Any consideration of other access points has not been included in the analysis.
As indicated in Section 8.4.1, an easement along Bradford Avenue allows access to/from the Tank Farms
from West Main Road. This intersection was modeled as a potential access point; however, if Bradford
Avenue is ultimately to be used as an access point, recommendations to reduce risk to the school children
in the area would need to be developed. For example, the easement would need to be limited to only
emergency vehicles, or a traffic light could be installed. The Stringham Road access point between
Sullivan Drive and Defense Highway is expected to provide access to office space and some of the light
industrial uses. The second Stringham Road access point is located west of Defense Highway and also
would provide access to some of the light industrial uses. The Bradford Avenue access point would
provide access to the majority of the light industrial uses, the boat storage yard, and the solar array. The
final layout may allow access to all uses from each access point. A total of 2,900 parking spaces would be
located near the various businesses and recreational areas.
Construction-related traffic would consist of delivery trucks, dump trucks, heavy equipment, and vehicles
driven by construction crews. Based on the square footage of the proposed demolition/new construction,
workers would make an estimated 60 daily trips for commutes, two daily trips would occur for demolition
removal, and five delivery trucks would occur per day (see Appendix D for the methodology). This could
result in short-term impacts on traffic from additional truck trips and slower-moving vehicles. However,
the impacts would not be significant because they would occur only for the duration of the new
construction period. In addition, redevelopment of the tank farms is not anticipated to occur
simultaneously over the course of the 20-year build-out. Impacts are therefore expected to be minor.
The evaluation of impacts during the full build-out of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 includes a
discussion of projected traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS), and
recommended mitigation measures.
9.4.1.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of Alternative 1 is projected to add 2,762 daily trips to the road network surrounding the
tank farms (Pare Corporation 2013). The full build-out period takes into account a 1 percent annual
background growth that is expected to occur through the year 2032. Background growth is the growth
expected within the study area based on development projects not specifically identified as well as annual
population and traffic increases. Office space is expected to generate 1,425 daily trips and would be the
largest trip generator. The light industrial uses would generate 1,033 trips, and light industrial/boat
storage would generate the fewest with 304 daily trips. The solar array is not expected to generate daily
traffic. During morning and evening peak hours, a total of 377 and 387 vehicles are expected to enter and
exit the property, respectively. Table 9.4-1 shows the morning and evening peak hour trips for each
proposed use.
Over the full build-out period, traffic volume in the area is projected to increase, such that the total
morning and evening peak hour volume at the intersections analyzed is similarly projected to increase.
Table 9.4-2 compares existing peak hour traffic volumes with those projected under Alternative 1 for
intersections and access points near Tank Farms 1 and 2.

The intersection of West Main Road and Stringham Road is currently signalized and increases in traffic
are not expected to result in a significant impact on safety (Pare Corporation 2013). The intersections of
West Main Road and Bradford Avenue and Defense Highway and Stringham Road are currently not
signalized. Any increase in traffic could pose safety concerns at these intersections. As noted in Section
8.4, crash data for roadways in the vicinity of the tank farms shows that the greatest number of crashes in
the study area occurred at the intersection of West Main Road and Stringham Road, where 57 crashes
were reported over almost four years of data (Pare Corporation 2013).
9.4.1.2
Projected Level of Service
LOS under Alternative 1 was determined for the three intersections analyzed as well as the three proposed
driveways into the property.
The signalized intersection of West Main Road with Stringham Road currently operates at LOS B with
approximately 18 seconds of delay per vehicle during the morning peak hour. Under Alternative 1 the
LOS at this intersection is expected to decrease to LOS C with approximately 28 seconds of delay.
During the evening peak hour, the intersection currently operates at LOS C with approximately 26
seconds of delay and is expected to drop to LOS D with 40 seconds of delay.
During morning and evening peak hours, the northbound approach to West Main Road and Bradford
Avenue operates at LOS C in the morning and LOS A in the evening, with less than one second of delay
per vehicle. Under Alternative 1, this approach would drop to LOS D in the morning and drop to LOS B
in the evening peak hour. The eastbound approach currently operates at LOS F with 62.8 seconds of
delay in the morning peak hours and 156 seconds of delay in the evening peak hours and is expected to
remain at LOS F under Alternative 1 during morning and evening peak hours. As indicated in Section
9.4.1, an easement along Bradford Avenue allows access to and from the Tank Farms from West Main
Road. This intersection was modeled as a potential access point; however, if Bradford Avenue is
ultimately to be used as an access point, recommendations to reduce risk to the school children in the area
would need to be developed. For example, the easement would need to be limited to only emergency
vehicles, or a traffic light could be installed.
The intersection of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road currently operates at LOS A with
7.1 seconds of delay for the northbound approach and LOS F with 123.2 seconds of delay for the
northeast approach during morning peak hours. The northbound approach operates at LOS A with 6.7
seconds of delay and the northeast bound approach operates at LOS D with 29.7 seconds of delay during
evening peak hours. Under Alternative 1, northbound and northeast bound approaches would continue to
operate at LOS A and F respectively during morning peak hours. The northbound approach would
continue to operate at LOS A during evening peak hours and the northeast approach would drop to LOS F
during evening peak hours. Table 9.4-2 shows the level of service for the surrounding intersections under
Alternative 1.

The southbound approach of the Defense Highway and Greene Lane intersection operates at a current
LOS of A during both morning and evening peak hours. Under Alternative 1, LOS A would remain, with
0.2 seconds of delay per vehicle during morning peak hours and 2.3 seconds of delay during evening peak
hours. The westbound approach, operating with a stop sign control, currently operates at LOS C with 24
seconds of delay during morning peak hours and 18.6 seconds of delay during evening peak hours. Under
Alternative 1, LOS would drop to LOS F with 63.1 seconds of delay during morning peak hours and LOS
D with 30.4 seconds of delay during evening peak hours.

Summary
The projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network surrounding Tank Farms 1
and 2 and the resulting increases in peak hour volume at the intersections of West Main Road with
Stringham Road, West Main Road and Bradford Avenue, Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham
Road, and Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane and the corresponding decrease in LOS
would result in a significant and unavoidable impact under Alternative 1.
The need for new traffic signals or signs at West Main Road and Bradford, Defense Highway and
Stringham Road, and West Main Road and Stringham Road intersections should be reviewed to ensure
that safety is not impacted. For example, if Bradford Avenue is used to provide access to the tank farms,
improvements to the roadway and upgrades to the intersection will be necessary (Pare Corporation 2013).
Additionally, if Bradford Avenue is to be used as an access point, recommendations to reduce risk to the

school children in the area would need to be developed. For example, the easement would need to be
limited to only emergency vehicles or a traffic light could be installed. Similarly, a signal may need to be
installed at the intersection of Defense Highway and Stringham Road.
Sight distances for the potential driveway locations were reviewed and generally found to meet the
AASHTO requirements for the 85th percentile travel speeds along Stringham Road and Bradford Avenue.
These distances should be reconfirmed once the final locations of the driveways are determined. The
driveways should also be designed to maximize the visibility for motorists turning into and out of the
property while providing clear identification of the site.
Other potential mitigation measures would depend on the final design of the site driveways and internal
site roadway network. Improvements along the roadway could include revising signs, striping the
pavement, or redesigning the flow of traffic. The implementation of these mitigation measures would be
the responsibility of the future developer and/or the Town of Portsmouth.

9.4.2

Alternative 2

Access to Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be through the same two access points on Stringham Road and one
access point on Bradford Avenue as described for Alternative 1. Similar to Alternative 1, any
consideration of other access points has not been included in the analysis. As discussed in Alternative 1,
the final layout may allow access to all uses from each access point. Under Alternative 2, a total of 3,196
parking spaces would be located near the various redevelopment sites.
The proposed level of traffic associated with the construction of the office and light industrial uses under
Alternative 2 would be similar to that discussed under Alternative 1 and would result in minor impacts on
local traffic during the construction period only; no significant impacts would result.
The evaluation of impacts during the full build-out of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2 includes a
discussion of projected traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS), and
recommended mitigation measures.
9.4.2.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of Alternative 2 is projected to add 3,151 daily trips to the road network surrounding the
tank farms. The full build-out period takes into account a 1 percent annual background growth that is
expected to occur through the year 2032. Office space would generate 1,723 daily trips and would be the
largest trip generator. The light industrial uses would generate 1,124 trips; light industrial/boat storage
uses would generate the fewest, with 304 daily trips. The solar array is not expected to generate daily
traffic. During morning and evening peak hours a total of 433 and 434 vehicles, respectively, are
expected to enter and exit the property (see Table 9.4-3).

9.4.2.2
Projected Level of Service
Under Alternative 2, the intersection of West Main Road with Stringham Road is expected to decrease
from LOS B, with approximately 18 seconds of delay per vehicle, to LOS C with 29.1 seconds of delay
per vehicle during morning peak hours. During the evening peak hour, the intersection currently operates
at LOS C with approximately 32 seconds of delay; this is expected to drop to LOS D with of 78.4 seconds
of delay under Alternative 2.
Under Alternative 2, the northbound (through) approach to West Main Road and Bradford Avenue is
expected to operate at LOS D during morning peak hours and LOS B during evening peak hours, a drop
in LOS in both instances. The eastbound approach would continue to operate at LOS F during morning
and evening peak hours under Alternative 2.
The northbound approach of the intersection of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road
would continue to operate at LOS A, with 7.2 to 7.4 seconds of delay per vehicle during morning and
evening peak hours. The northeast approach would operate at LOS F under Alternative 2 (see Table 9.4-4
above).
The proposed driveway for Tank Farm 2 would operate at an LOS of C during morning and evening peak
hours for southbound traffic and would operate at an LOS of A during morning and evening peak hours
for eastbound traffic. The proposed driveway for Tank Farm 1 would operate at an LOS of B during both
morning and evening peak hours for westbound traffic.

Summary
The projected increase in the number of traffic trips on the roadway network surrounding Tank Farms 1
and 2 and the resulting increases in peak hour volume at the intersections of West Main Road with
Stringham Road, West Main Road and Bradford Avenue, Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham
Road, and Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane and the corresponding decrease in LOS
would result in a significant and unavoidable impact under Alternative 2.
The mitigation of impacts from the implementation of Alternative 2 would be the same as those discussed
for Alternative 1.

9.4.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Access to the property would continue to be through existing driveways
off of Stringham Road and Bradford Avenue. No reuse or redevelopment would occur at the property and
therefore no significant impacts on transportation would occur under this alternative.
The evaluation of impacts under the No Action alternative includes a discussion of projected traffic
volumes and LOS, the projected impacts on the road network, and recommended mitigation measures.
9.4.3.1
Projected Traffic Volumes
Under the No Action alternative, traffic volumes are projected to increase 1 percent annually through the
year 2032. Traffic volume increases are associated with development projects not specifically identified
as well as annual population and traffic increases. Table 9.4-5 compares existing peak hour traffic
volumes with those projected under the No Action alternative for intersections near Tank Farms 1 and 2.

Projected Level of Service
Under the No Action alternative, the LOS will drop at several intersections compared with existing
conditions. As shown in Table 9.4-5, LOS will decrease for the morning and evening peak hours at the
intersection of West Main Road and Stringham Road; for northbound traffic during the evening peak
hours at the intersection of West Main Road and Bradford Avenue; for northeast-bound traffic during the
evening peak hours at the intersection of Defense Highway and Stringham Road; and for westbound
traffic during morning and evening peak hours at the intersection of Defense Highway and Greene Lane.

Environmental Management

This section describes the potential impacts on environmental management from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, or the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of the potential
impacts on the management of hazardous waste, hazardous materials, and ER Program sites associated
with disposal and reuse of Tank Farms 1 and 2.
As discussed in Section 3.5.1.5, real property transactions under BRAC require the preparation of a
FOST. The FOST summarizes how the applicable requirements and notifications for hazardous
materials, petroleum products, and other regulated materials (such as ACM, LBP, PCBs, and pesticides)
have been satisfied and whether the property is environmentally suitable for transfer. The FOST for the
Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties will address any restrictions, notifications, or covenants-in-deed related to
hazardous materials at the surplus properties.

9.5.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.5.1.1
Hazardous Waste
The tank farms will have received closure under RIDEM’s UST regulations before the properties are
redeveloped, so the tanks and associated equipment, buildings, and features such as vaults, chambers,
pump houses, and underground fuel piping would be removed and nearby soils would no longer contain
petroleum-related constituents above RIDEM standards or would have land use controls to restrict
unacceptable exposure to any such constituents remaining on-site. As indicated in Section 8.5, a separate
project is being evaluated for the demolition of USTs and removal of associated underground piping and
other components at Tank Farm 1 to be conducted in 2016 before transfer. However, the proposed
schedule for Tank Farm 2 demolition has not been established and, for the purposes of this analysis, USTs
have been assumed to remain in place when the property is disposed, as presented in the Redevelopment
Plan. Before transfer, the tank farms will also have been remediated under CERCLA before
redevelopment and would not contain constituents requiring management as a hazardous waste, e.g.,
PCBs and mercury-containing equipment, although land use controls may exist for any such constituents
left in place at levels not appropriate for unrestricted use and unlimited exposure (also see Section
9.5.1.4).
Some RCRA hazardous wastes would be generated during the demolition of existing tanks and structures
and construction of the new industrial and commercial facilities proposed for Alternative 1. The
operation of heavy equipment and machinery and demolition and construction tasks would result in
wastes such as waste oils and oily wastes, chemicals, acids, paints, solvents, and degreasers as well as
universal wastes such as batteries and fluorescent light bulbs. Demolition and construction contractors
would be required under contract to manage hazardous waste in accordance with Town of Portsmouth and
state and federal requirements. The new businesses—light industry, offices, and boat storage—also
would routinely generate hazardous wastes generally similar to those generated by demolition and
construction activities. The new businesses would be required to manage hazardous wastes in accordance
with Town of Portsmouth and state and federal requirements.

Draft EIS

9-20

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Active UST and CERCLA IRP investigations are ongoing at Tank Farms 1 and 2, and only small
quantities of hazardous wastes are generated from those activities (see Section 8.5.1). It is anticipated
that more hazardous waste would be generated by near-term and long-term activities under Alternative 1
than is currently generated at Tank Farms 1 and 2. There would therefore be a minor short-term and longterm impact on the management of hazardous waste under Alternative 1. However, these impacts would
not be significant because hazardous wastes would be managed in accordance with Town of Portsmouth
and state and federal requirements.
9.5.1.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks, Fuel Piping, and Oil/Water Separators
As indicated in Section 8.5, a separate project is being evaluated for the demolition of six USTs (Tanks 13
through 18), two USTs/OWSs (Tanks 9 and 10), and removal of associated underground piping and other
components at Tank Farm 1 to be conducted in 2016, before transfer. However, the proposed schedule
for demolition of 11 USTs (Tanks 19 through 29) at Tank Farm 2 has not been established and, for the
purposes of this analysis, USTs have been assumed to remain in place when the property is disposed, as
presented in the Redevelopment Plan.
Therefore, under Alternative 1, the tanks at Tank Farm 1 will be demolished by the Navy before transfer.
Components directly associated with Tanks 9 and 10, such as tank access chambers, underground piping
in the immediate vicinity, and the OWS/separation pit, also would be removed under the separate project.
Despite the planned demolition of features at Tank Farm 1, the features at Tank Farm 2 are assumed to be
transferred in-place. However, redevelopment is not planned for areas directly on top of the tanks or
OWS, with the exception of the planned solar array (see Figure 9.5-1). As indicated in Section 2.2.1, the
proposed redevelopment at the tank farms has been based on a 300-foot setback from the existing tank
locations that would remain in place when the property is transferred, which is specified in the
Redevelopment Plan (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). There are no ASTs at either tank farm and there
are no OWSs at Tank Farm 2. Any new fuel/oil tanks or OWSs that are installed as part of property
redevelopment would have to comply with applicable RIDEM regulations.
Because the tanks, underground piping, and OWSs will have been cleaned under the RIDEM UST
program and remediated under CERCLA before redevelopment (or demolished), there would be no
known hazard from petroleum, oil, and lubricants or CERCLA-regulated constituents in those
components. There might be unknown residual constituents in underground components that were not
able to be fully accessed when the tanks and piping were cleaned. There would be no significant impacts
on the management of storage tanks, fuel piping, and OWSs under Alternative 1. Impacts would be
further mitigated through appropriate notifications and restrictions in property transfer documents.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
The underground fuel lines, steam lines, and condensate lines that are located throughout Tank Farms 1
and 2 could contain asbestos-containing pipe insulation, especially the steam and condensate lines (see
Section 8.5.2.5). Under Alternative 1, Tanks 9 and 10 and underground piping in the southern portion of
Tank Farm 1 will have been removed before transfer under a separate project (see Figure 9.5-1). Under
this separate NEPA action, it is assumed that approximately 10 cubic yards of asbestos-containing pipe
wrap would require removal when the underground steam lines near Tanks 9 and 10 are removed (see
Appendix D). The other USTs at Tank Farm 1 and their associated underground piping would also be
removed; however, the tanks and associated underground piping at Tank Farm 2 are assumed to remain in
place at transfer. Approximately 130 cubic yards of asbestos-containing pipe wrap would be removed
from underground steam lines at Tank Farm 1, while approximately 75 cubic yards would remain on the
steam lines at Tank Farm 2 (see Appendix D-2). Those amounts would be commensurately greater if the
remaining condensate lines and fuel lines also are similarly asbestos-wrapped.
Draft EIS

9-21

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The ACM and LBP reported to be present in Buildings 30, 49, B60 and other structures proposed for
demolition at Tank Farm 1 would require careful removal when those buildings are demolished to
accommodate property redevelopment (see Figure 9.5-1). The remaining buildings at Tank Farm 2 do not
overlap with the site plan for Alternative 1, and it is not known whether they would be demolished. If
they were, there is ACM and LBP in most of the other tank farm buildings (see Section 8.5.2) that would
require careful removal. Other buildings and structures at Tank Farm 1 (e.g., vaults and chambers) and
Tank Farm 2 (e.g., Building 218, Building 220, and vaults and chambers) have not been evaluated for
ACM or LBP; therefore, demolition of those structures would need to proceed with caution due to the age
of the tank farms.
Specialized ACM and LBP removal contractors will need to be used to ensure that any ACM and LBP
removal is performed safely and in a manner protective of human health and the environment. ACM and
LBP removal would need to be conducted in accordance with federal and state requirements, which are
described in Section 3.5.1.2. Collectively, those regulations address ACM and LBP removal, ACM and
LBP disposal, worker safety, and air quality. For example, the National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants (40 CFR Part 61) require that each owner or operator of a demolition activity
subject to NESHAPs remove regulated ACM from the facility being demolished prior to any activity that
would break up, dislodge, or disturb the materials. Regulated ACM need not be removed before
demolition if the ACM is considered non-friable (e.g., vinyl asbestos floor tiles), is not in poor condition,
and would not be rendered friable during the demolition process. Contractual specifications for
demolition involving ACM would be developed by an accredited Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response
Act (AHERA) professional to ensure the proper removal of regulated ACM.
Lead from LBP has been measured in soil near Building 48 at Tank Farm 2 at a level (2,200 mg/kg) that
is above both the RIDEM residential DEC for lead of 150 mg/kg and the industrial/commercial DEC for
lead of 500 mg/kg. Lead has not been evaluated in soil around other buildings at Tank Farms 1 and 2
because most of the building exteriors have not been painted or there is a lack of accessible soil near the
buildings. Under Alternative 1, soils in the affected areas near those buildings would require
investigation and potential remediation in accordance with the federal and state requirements discussed in
Section 3.5.1.2.
In accordance with RCRA, demolition waste streams that might contain lead would be evaluated, either
by using knowledge of the waste or by testing using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)
to determine whether hazardous waste disposal regulations are applicable. LBP- or lead-containing
wastes generated from demolition would be temporarily stored on-site in compliance with RCRA
requirements before being transported and disposed of off-site by an authorized contractor.
Any LBP or lead identified in the former buoy storage area at Tank Farm 2 (see Section 8.5.2.6) will have
been cleaned up under CERCLA prior to property redevelopment (see Section 9.5.1.4).
Therefore, under Alternative 1, removal of some ACM, LBP, and lead-containing soil from the built
environment would be a minor beneficial long-term impact. The human and environmental hazards of
removing and disposing of the ACM, LBP, and lead-containing soil would be a minor short-term impact.
There would be a minor long-term impact from the ACM and LBP that remain on the properties on
underground surfaces or in buildings that would be unoccupied. These impacts would not be significant
and management of intact ACM and LBP on buildings and structures will be the responsibility of the
future property owner. There would be no impacts associated with construction activities and future use
of the buildings on the tank farm properties under the Redevelopment Plan because asbestos and LBP are
no longer used in new building materials. There could be a minor impact if older boats containing LBP
are stored in the new boat storage area. However, that impact would not be significant.

Alternative 1 – Preferred
Redevelopment Overlaid on Tank Farm
1 and 2 Features
NAVSTA Newport, Rhode Island

This page intentionally left blank.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

PCBs and Pesticides
NAVSTA Newport removed any PCB-containing transformers in the 1980s (see Section 8.5.2.7). Any
transformers that are handled or removed during demolition and redevelopment activities under
Alternative 1 should be inspected for “PCB-free” labels. If such labels are not found, the transformers
should be evaluated for PCBs. Residual PCBs that have been identified at Tank Farms 1 and 2 near
transformer vaults and transformer buildings (see Section 8.5.2.7) will have been cleaned up under
CERCLA before the properties are redeveloped (see Section 9.5.1.4). PCBs were not found in window
caulking during a recent evaluation conducted in April 2013 (YU & Associates 2013).
Pesticides are currently used at NAVSTA Newport properties as needed and in accordance with the
Integrated Pest Management Plan. It is expected that pesticides would similarly be used responsibly and
in accordance with any applicable local or state regulations in the future by the businesses or their
management/service contractors that would occupy the new developments proposed under Alternative 1.
There would be no impacts associated with PCB and pesticide management under Alternative 1.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Radioactive materials would not be expected to be used during demolition and construction activities at
Tank Farms 1 and 2 nor during the industrial and office uses planned under Alternative 1.
Although radon surveys have not been conducted at the buildings located within Tank Farms 1 and 2,
base-wide radon surveys indicate that radon is not generally a concern in the NAVSTA Newport area (see
Section 3.5.1.2). Similarly low levels would be expected to be seen in any new construction. RIDOH
regulates radon levels in public buildings, schools, and child care centers (RIDOH 2007b), none of which
are included in Alternative 1.
There would be no significant impacts from radioactive materials and radon under Alternative 1.
9.5.1.3
Medical Waste
Medical wastes are not currently and have not been generated in the past at Tank Farms 1 and 2. There
would be no medical waste associated with the industrial and office uses planned under Alternative 1 and,
therefore, no impact.
9.5.1.4
Environmental Restoration Program
Tank Farm 1 is IRP Study Area 7 and Tank Farm 2 is IRP Study Area 10. Both sites are currently being
investigated under the IRP, which is the primary program category of the ER Program (see Section
3.5.1.4). The history and current status of investigations and conditions at Tank Farms 1 and 2 under the
IRP are discussed in Section 8.5.4. Table 9.5-1 presents the IRP status and milestones for both tank
farms.
At the time of transfer, the tanks, underground piping, and aboveground support buildings (such as pump
houses, vaults, and access chambers) at Tank Farm 1 will have been demolished under a separate project;
however, tanks, underground piping, and aboveground support buildings (such as pump houses, vaults,
and access chambers) would be present on Tank Farm 2. For Alternative 1, the Redevelopment Plan for
Surplus Properties at NAVSTA Newport assumes that Tank Farms 1 and 2 will have been
“environmentally remediated to enable the proposed uses” (RKG Associates et al. 2011). The Navy will
complete the CERCLA and RIDEM UST remediation prior to property redevelopment. As discussed in
Section 3.5.1.4, the Navy will follow the provisions of CERCLA Section 120(h) such that the deed
transferring the property will contain a covenant requiring that “all remedial action necessary to protect
human health and the environment with respect to any such substance remaining on the property has been
taken before the date of such transfer” or, alternatively, the Navy will follow the CERCLA early transfer

process. The other provisions of CERCLA Section 120(h) as discussed in Section 3.5.1.4 also will apply.
The remedial designs for Tank Farms 1 and 2 are expected to contain land use controls that would
accommodate conditions at the tank farms following the final CERCLA remedies.

The redevelopment plan specifies 300-foot setbacks from the USTs that remain in place at the time of
transfer. Under Alternative 1, redevelopment is not planned for areas directly on top of the USTs, with
the exception of the planned solar array (see Figure 9.5-1). The types of businesses and land uses that are
planned for Alternative 1 (light industrial, office space, boat storage, and solar array) would likely be
consistent with any land use controls that accompany the final remedies. Alternative 1 would be
compatible with the ER Program.
The other IRP or MRP site closest to the tank farms is IRP Site 21, the former Melville water tower,
approximately 0.5 miles east of Tank Farm 2 (see Section 8.5.4). No further action has been determined
to be necessary for the site (see Table 3.5-1). The three non-Navy CERCLA sites located just southwest
of Tank Farms 1 and 2 are non-NPL sites that reportedly have either been cleaned up (Melville North
Landfill) or are sites of little CERCLA activity (see Section 8.5.4).

9.5.2

Alternative 2

9.5.2.1
Hazardous Waste
Similar to Alternative 1, hazardous wastes would be generated during demolition and construction
activities and by operation of the businesses planned for the tank farm properties. It is anticipated that
more hazardous waste would be generated by near-term and long-term activities under Alternative 2 than
is currently generated at Tank Farms 1 and 2. There would therefore be a minor short-term and long-term
impact on the management of hazardous waste under Alternative 2. These impacts would not be
significant because hazardous wastes would be managed in accordance with Town of Portsmouth and
state and federal requirements.
9.5.2.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks, Fuel Piping, and Oil/Water Separators
The same storage tanks, OWSs, and underground piping would be affected under Alternative 2 as under
Alternative 1. The additional light industrial uses and office space planned for Alternative 2 also would
affect the same general areas of the tank farms as Alternative 1 (see Figure 9.5-2).

Tank Farms 1 and 2

The tanks, underground piping, and OWSs will have been cleaned under the RIDEM UST program and
remediated as necessary under CERCLA prior to property redevelopment. Features/structures at Tank
Farm 1 will have been demolished under a separate project, while structures at Tank Farm 2 are assumed
to remain in place. There would be no known hazard from petroleum, oil, and lubricants or CERCLAregulated constituents in those components. There might be unknown residual constituents in
underground components that were not able to be fully accessed when the tanks and piping were cleaned.
There would be no significant impacts on the management of storage tanks, fuel piping, and OWSs under
Alternative 2, the same as for Alternative 1. Impacts will be further mitigated through appropriate
notifications and restrictions in property transfer documents.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
As part of demolition, ACM would have to be removed from the same underground piping and ACM and
LBP would have to be removed from the same buildings described for Alternative 1 (see Figure 9.5-2),
and lead-containing soil would require investigation and potential remediation. Therefore, under
Alternative 2, there would be a minor beneficial long-term impact from the removal of some ACM, LBP,
and lead-containing soil from the built environment. There would be a minor short-term impact from the
human and environmental hazards of removing and disposing of the ACM, LBP, and lead-containing soil.
There would be a minor long-term impact from the ACM and LBP that remain on the properties, on
underground surfaces, or in buildings that would be unoccupied. These impacts would not be significant.
There would be no impacts associated with construction activities and future use of the buildings on the
tank farm properties under the redevelopment plan because asbestos and LBP are no longer used in new
building materials. There could be a minor impact if older boats containing LBP are stored in the new
boat storage area. That impact would not be significant.
PCBs and Pesticides
There would be no impacts associated with PCB and pesticide management under Alternative 2, the same
as described for Alternative 1.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
There would be no impacts from radioactive materials and radon under Alternative 2, the same as
described for Alternative 1.
9.5.2.3
Medical Waste
There would be no medical waste associated with the future industrial and office uses planned under
Alternative 2 and therefore no impact.
9.5.2.4
Environmental Restoration Program
The status of Tank Farm 1 and Tank Farm 2 and other sites under the Navy ER Program would be the
same for Alternative 2 as for Alternative 1, and the Navy would follow the same CERCLA transfer
process.
The Redevelopment Plan incorporates 300-foot setbacks from the USTs that remain in place. Under
Alternative 2, redevelopment is not planned for areas directly on top of the USTs, with the exception of
the planned solar array (see Figure 9.5-2). The types of businesses and land uses that are planned for
Alternative 2 (light industrial, office space, boat storage, and solar array) would likely be consistent with
any land use controls that accompany the final remedies. Alternative 2 would be compatible with the ER
Program.
The nearby non-Navy CERCLA sites are the same for Alternative 2 as described for Alternative 1.

9.5.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, Tank Farms 1 and 2 would continue to be remediated under the
CERCLA IRP and RIDEM UST closure programs, after which the property would be maintained in a
caretaker status with no redevelopment.
9.5.3.1
Hazardous Waste
Small quantities of hazardous waste would continue to be generated from ongoing CERCLA IRP and
RIDEM UST closure activities and would cease once Tank Farms 1 and 2 are closed, demolished, and/or
remediated. There would be a minor short-term impact on the management of hazardous waste under the
No Action alternative. This impact would not be significant.
9.5.3.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks, Fuel Piping, and Oil/Water Separators
Tanks 13 through 18 at Tank Farm 1 and Tanks 19 through 29 at Tank Farm 2, as well as their associated
underground fuel piping, have already been cleaned. They contain no hazardous material except for
possible residual material that remains from areas that could not be accessed during cleaning. Structures
at Tank Farm 1 will be demolished under a separate project. Under the No Action alternative, there
would be a minor short-term impact on the management of those components that are being cleaned up
under the RIDEM UST program. This impact would not be significant.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
ACM has been identified on underground pipes, and ACM and LBP have been identified in many of the
buildings and structures at Tank Farms 1 and 2. Some of the ACM is in poor condition. Lead from LBP
has been measured in the soil around Building 48 at a level above the industrial/commercial DEC for
lead. Under the No Action alternative, ACM, LBP, and lead in soil would remain and would not be
remediated unless they posed an immediate risk to human or environmental health and safety. There
would be a minor long-term impact from ACM, LBP, and lead in soil that remain on the properties
underground or in buildings that would be unoccupied. These impacts would not be significant. There
would be no impacts from any LBP or lead identified for the former buoy storage area at Tank Farm 2
because the area will be addressed under the CERCLA IRP investigation.
PCBs and Pesticides
There are no longer any PCB-containing transformers at NAVSTA Newport (see Section 3.5.1.2).
Residual PCBs that have been identified at Tank Farms 1 and 2 near transformer vaults and transformer
buildings (see Section 8.5.2.7) will be cleaned up under the ongoing CERCLA investigation (see Section
8.5.4). Under the No Action alternative, pesticides would continue to be applied at the tank farms as
necessary in accordance with the installation’s Integrated Pest Management Plan. There would be no
impacts associated with PCB and pesticide management under the No Action alternative.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Radioactive materials are not used at the tank farms. There would be no known radon hazard because
radon levels are low for NAVSTA Newport as a whole and the buildings at the tank farms are
unoccupied. Therefore, there would be no impacts from radioactive materials or radon under the No
Action alternative.
9.5.3.3
Medical Waste
Medical waste is not generated at the tank farms; therefore, there would be no impact on medical waste
management.

Environmental Restoration Program
Under the No Action alternative, investigative and cleanup activities will continue at Tank Farms 1 and 2

9.6

Air Quality

This section provides a summary of the projected emissions associated with the disposal and reuse of
Tank Farms 1 and 2, including emissions from the construction and operation of all new buildings and
additional vehicle uses on roadways after full build-out.
An analysis of the impact of the proposed action on regional air quality in Chapter 12 includes an
evaluation of criteria pollutants, GHG, and HAPs from continuing actions at all surplus properties upon
final build-out (see Chapter 12, Summary of Impacts for all Surplus Property, for a discussion of the total
impacts from this action in the Providence, Rhode Island air quality region). Construction and operation
emissions from each of the other individual surplus properties are described in Sections 5.6, 7.6, and
11.6).
Construction emissions have been evaluated individually for each surplus property, based on the
assumption that construction emissions are temporary and are not likely to occur within the same year at
all locations or at the same time as ongoing operational emissions, especially considering a 20-year buildout period for the Redevelopment Plan.
Detailed calculations conducted to support the estimated construction and operation emissions are
provided in Appendix D-1. (Section 3.6 discusses regional air quality, applicable regulations and
requirements, and methods used to assess the environmental consequences.)

9.6.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

Under Alternative 1, demolition of existing structures at Tank Farm 1 would occur before implementing
this action. The site would be redeveloped for mixed uses, including office space, light industrial, boat
storage, and multi-modal parking uses and, possibly, a solar array (see Chapter 2, Figure 2-3). A total of
approximately 2.5 acres of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be redeveloped with office uses, 4.4 acres with
light industrial or marina-related uses, and 3.6 acres with the proposed solar array. An additional 20.6
acres of the site would be redeveloped with other parking facilities and access roads4. A total of 31.1
acres (23 percent) of the site would be redeveloped; 104.9 acres (77 percent) would remain as open space.
Construction-related emissions would be primarily exhaust emissions from construction vehicles and
equipment, construction materials delivery, construction employee commutes, and dust resulting from
ground disturbance and road traffic. Construction emissions resulting from redevelopment of Tank Farms
1 and 2 under Alternative 1 would be similar yet slightly less than emissions estimated under Alternative
2 (see Section 9.6.2). These emissions would be short-term and localized and would result in minor
impacts on air quality.
Mitigation of construction emissions would be implemented with best management practices such as
proper maintenance of equipment, idling-reduction measures, and the use of newer, more efficient
equipment with diesel retrofits to control fine particulate matter (PM10). Particle emissions can also be
controlled by regularly watering graded areas and cleaning streets after grading activities.
Operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic.
Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural gas, primarily for
heating, as well as from the indirect use of electricity. Emissions from increased vehicle use were

calculated based on the new vehicle trips modeled for the proposed redevelopment at Tank Farms 1 and 2
in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport
(Pare Corporation 2013) Total operational emissions after full build-out of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under
Alternative 1 are provided in Table 9.6-1. Operational emissions would result in minor impacts on air
quality, and the mitigation discussed below would reduce adverse impacts. To mitigate operational
emissions, buildings can be designed to meet stringent energy-efficiency standards. Implementing trafficeasing roadway designs to lower vehicle speed and reduce congestion, in addition to expanding public
transportation and carpooling programs, would reduce vehicle emissions.

Alternative 2

Redevelopment would occur in the same areas that would be redeveloped under Alternative 1. Under
Alternative 2, a total of approximately 3.2 acres would be redeveloped with office uses, 4.7 acres with
light industrial or marina-related uses, 4 acres with multi-mode parking, and 3.6 acres—the same as under
Alternative 1—with the proposed solar array. A total of 24 acres would be redeveloped with parking
facilities and access roads under Alternative 2.
Construction emissions resulting from the proposed redevelopment at Tank Farms 1 and 2 under
Alternative 2 are provided in Table 9.6-2. These emissions would be temporary and would occur only
during the period of construction, which is conservatively assumed to be one year. Construction
emissions would therefore result in minor impacts on air quality. Measures to mitigate construction
emissions are the same as those discussed above under Alternative 1.
Operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic.
Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural gas, primarily for
heating, as well as the indirect use of electricity. As determined in the Traffic Impact Analysis for the
Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013), vehicle
traffic would increase due to the proposed redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2, resulting in additional
vehicle emissions. Total operational emissions after full build-out of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under
Alternative 2 are provided in Table 9.6-3. Operational emissions would result in minor impacts on air
quality (see Chapter 12 for the discussion of regional air quality impacts).

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, there would be no new stationary or mobile sources of criteria, HAP, or
GHG emissions from the use of the Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties. Therefore, the No Action alternative
would not impact air quality at Tank Farms 1 and 2.

9.6.4

General Conformity Rule Applicability

Since Rhode Island is in attainment for all NAAQS, the General Conformity Rule does not apply to this
action While not applicable to the action, the de minimis thresholds under the General Conformity Rule
have been used to consider the potential level of significance of the air quality impacts under NEPA.
Emissions from construction at Tank Farms 1 and 2 under either alternative would be below General
Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds. Thus, changes in air quality would not be significant as a result
of this construction and mitigation would reduce adverse impacts. The evaluation of all other surplus
properties and the total impacts of this action are discussed in Chapter 12.

Noise

This section includes an analysis of the potential noise impacts resulting from the proposed
redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, and the No Action
alternative. It includes an analysis of the potential impacts resulting from construction and operation of
the proposed redevelopment plan for Tank Farms 1 and 2.

9.7.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.7.1.1
Construction
The proposed redevelopment at Tank Farms 1 and 2 involves the construction of light industrial facilities,
boat storage, multi-modal parking uses, and possibly a solar array. Table 9.7-1 provides an estimate of the
number and type of construction equipment that would be required and the associated SPL for each type
of equipment at a distance of 50 feet from the source and at the nearest residence. The nearest residence
has been determined to be a location on Warley Street at a distance of 900 feet from the center of the
combined property. Figure 9.7-1 illustrates the locations of the noise receptors used for analysis. The
SPL at this location is estimated to range from 48 to 61 dBA. As indicated in Section 3.7.1.1, normal
speech has a sound level of 60 dB and a garbage disposal has a sound level of 80 dB. The composite
sound level due to construction at this residence would be close to the sound level of normal speech.
Construction noise impacts would be temporary and would occur only during the period of construction,
which is conservatively assumed to be one year. Although the Town of Portsmouth does not currently
have a noise ordinance, most construction activities would be expected to take place between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., when the noise would be less disturbing to area residents.
Temporary increases in construction-related vehicle noise would, however, be expected. Truck and
construction vehicle (e.g., dump trucks, material deliveries, debris removal, etc.) traffic within and near
the tank farm properties would produce localized noise for brief periods, but this would not be expected to
create any long-term, adverse noise impacts on the neighboring community.
Construction noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation
(conforming to zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
9.7.1.2
Operation
Uses proposed at Tanks Farms 1 and 2 under the Redevelopment Plan, such as light industrial uses, could
potentially result in noise emissions above ambient sound levels. However, these light industrial uses
would be located on the Tank Farm 1 property, not close to residential areas. In addition, as discussed in
Section 9.1, land uses proposed for Tank Farms 1 and 2 are generally consistent with the current zoning
for the site and with surrounding land uses. Solar arrays or, more generally, utilities, are not included as a
permitted use in the redevelopment district, and any developer proposing to construct a solar array on the
site would be required to apply for a use variance from the requirements of the zoning ordinance.
Typically, before a solar array is constructed, a noise assessment would be conducted. The project design
would need to include any necessary noise controls identified in the assessment to reduce noise impacts
on the community.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would not be expected to generate significant traffic-related noise
impacts within the study area. Traffic-related noise would occur in areas already experiencing such noise
and would not be expected to cause additional impacts. To characterize the projected traffic noise near
Tank Farms 1 and 2, the evening peak hour traffic volume, vehicle speed, and vehicle mix data for the

The predicted traffic noise levels at receptor locations near Tank Farms 1 and 2 are summarized below in
Table 9.7-2. Noise levels ranged from 49.5 to 70.3 dBA, which differs from existing conditions by 0.7 to
6.4 dBA. An increase in noise of 6.4 dBA is considered to be noticeable. As shown in Table 9.7-2,
projected traffic noise levels would slightly exceed FHWA guidance noise abatement criteria thresholds
at some receptors for land uses proposed under Alternative 1 but would not substantially exceed (defined
as greater than 15 dBA) existing conditions. Land uses proposed under Alternative 1 would include
FHWA activity categories ‘B’ and ‘C.’ Traffic noise abatement criteria threshold for activity Category B
is 67 dBA and 72 dBA for Category C. (For more information on FHWA traffic noise abatement criteria
see Section 3.7.2.)

9.7.2.1
Construction
Although the redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2 would have increased office
space, increased light industrial uses along the rail line, and additional parking space, the estimated
construction noise levels would be similar to Alternative 1; however, the duration of construction may be
slightly longer.
Temporary increases in construction-related vehicle noise would be expected. Truck and construction
vehicle (e.g., dump trucks, material deliveries, debris removal, etc.) traffic in and near the Tank Farm 1
and 2 properties would produce localized noise for brief periods, but this would not be expected to create
any long-term, adverse noise impacts on the neighboring community. Construction noise would result in
minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation (conforming to zoning regulations)
would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
9.7.2.2
Operation
Although redevelopment under Alternative 2 would have increased office space, increased light industrial
uses along the rail line, and additional parking space, the impacts on the ambient noise environment
would be similar to those described under Alternative 1. However, under Alternative 2, more traffic is
projected to be associated with the proposed redevelopment.
The predicted traffic noise levels for the Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties redevelopment under Alternative 2
are summarized below in Table 9.7-3. The largest estimated increase in traffic noise would be 5.1 dBA.
An increase in noise of 5.1 dBA is considered to be noticeable. As shown in Table 9.7-3, projected traffic
noise levels would exceed the FHWA guidance noise abatement criteria thresholds at some nearby
receptors for land uses proposed under Alternative 2 but would not substantially exceed (greater than 15
dBA) existing conditions. Adjacent land uses proposed under Alternative 2 would include FHWA activity
categories ‘B’ and ‘C.’ Traffic noise abatement criteria threshold for activity category B is 67 dBA and 72
dBA for category C. (For more information on FHWA traffic noise abatement criteria see Section 3.7.2.)
Operational noise stemming from traffic would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise
environment; no mitigation measures are proposed.

Under this alternative, all excess property would be retained by the U.S. government in caretaker status.
No reuse or redevelopment would occur at Tank Farms 1 and 2 and as a result there would be no
additional noise generated.

Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the potential impacts on infrastructure and utilities from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of impacts on
water supply, wastewater, storm water, other utilities, and solid waste management from disposal and
reuse of Tank Farms 1 and 2.

9.8.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.8.1.1
Water Supply
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity to meet future water demands
resulting from implementation of Alternative 1.
Water Demand
Water demand was projected using planning multipliers for the proposed land uses based on square
footage and number of employees. Full build-out of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 is projected
to result in a demand of approximately 18,000 gpd from the mix of light industrial and office uses (see
Table 9.8.1). Due to the estimated number of employees, the proposed office use would have a higher
rate of water consumption than the proposed industrial uses. No water demand is associated with the
solar array. (For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to project water demand,
see Appendix D-3.)
Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
Portsmouth Water and Fire District, which receives its water supply from the City of Newport; thus minor
impacts are anticipated on the City of Newport’s water treatment and distribution system. The current
average daily demand on the City of Newport water supply is approximately 5.59 mgd including the City
of Newport and the Town of Middletown through the City of Newport’s distribution system and also
wholesale water supply to NAVSTA Newport and the Portsmouth Water and Fire District. Total average
daily demand is projected to increase to between 7.50 and 7.96 mgd by 2033 (Pare Corporation 2014).
Replacement of one of the existing plants and upgrades to the other increased capacity to 16 mgd (Water
World 2012; City of Newport Department of Utilities 2014). The expected 18,000 gpd under Alternative
1 represents less than 1 percent of the average daily demand projected in 2033 (see Table 9.8-1).
Therefore, the increase in projected water demand would represent a minor impact on operation and
maintenance of the City of Newport’s water treatment plants and would be met with current capacity.

Distribution System
Water lines owned by NAVSTA Newport at the tank farms have been cut and capped. Redevelopment of
the property would require installing a new distribution system for water supply, which would be the
responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact.
Ground would be disturbed when laying new distribution lines, and the developer would be required to
comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new distribution system(s) would be
constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized. Tank Farms 1 and 2 are located within the Navy’s
current utility jurisdiction; however, at the time of development, another utility provider will be
identified. The current boundaries of the Portsmouth Water and Fire District do not include the tank farm
properties and may require negotiations at the state assembly level to revise the boundaries, if the District
were to be identified as the future utility provider (Carlson 2012). Easements may be necessary in the
future, in order to provide water to the Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties.
In addition, the design and installation of any new water supply infrastructure would require, if
applicable, municipal review and approval and would need to comply with applicable local codes,
ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in an increase in water demand and a need for infrastructure. New
water distribution infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate redevelopment.
9.8.1.2
Wastewater
Implementation of Alternative 1 would have an adverse impact on any existing wastewater system
because of the need to integrate a currently unserviced area in the Town of Portsmouth. Portsmouth
currently has no infrastructure to treat additional wastewater generated by redevelopment under
Alternative 1.
Wastewater Volume
Full build-out of Alternative 1 would result in 17,170 gpd of wastewater flow from the proposed light
industrial and office uses, with office uses expected to generate most of the increased wastewater.
Projections were based on standard multipliers for the proposed land uses and are shown in Table 9.8-2.
(For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to project wastewater demand, see
Appendix D-3.)

Portsmouth is serviced by the City of Newport’s wastewater collection and treatment system. The
developer would have to design and permit an on-site wastewater treatment system, or possibly connect to
the City of Newport’s wastewater collection and treatment system. The City of Newport treatment plant
has a current capacity of 10.7 mgd and processes 9.46 mgd; therefore, the city may have some capacity to
accommodate the proposed redevelopment at Tank Farms 1 and 2. However, there have been no
discussions at the town level regarding the use of the City of Newport’s system for future development.
The Town of Portsmouth currently has no plans to construct a new treatment plant because of the costs
for local taxpayers. The town council has rejected several plans for future wastewater infrastructure
prepared in recent years (Clark 2013; Faerber 2013).
Collection System
New wastewater infrastructure for Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be needed under Alternative 1. Current soil
conditions on the properties would make on-site sewage disposal systems an unlikely solution. Installing
sewers to carry wastewater to either the City of Newport treatment plant or a future treatment plant in
Portsmouth would likely be the responsibility of the Town of Portsmouth in concert with the future
developer. Construction of a new collection system to service the Tank Farms would be the responsibility
of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact. Ground would be
disturbed when laying new collection lines, and the developer would be required to comply with local and
state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new collection systems would be constructed to ensure that
they are adequately sized.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a potentially significant impact on wastewater collection and
treatment capacity.
9.8.1.3
Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 1 would increase the amount of impervious surface area on the property,
resulting in a greater volume of storm water runoff. Much of the existing impervious surface area from
aboveground tanks would be replaced with new structures for light industrial and office uses, the solar
array, and parking and access roadways. Full build-out under Alternative 1 is estimated to result in a total
of approximately 1,352,300 square feet of impervious surface area, an increase of 130 percent over the
current impervious surface area. Total impervious surface area is provided for both alternatives in Table
9.8-3. (For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to calculate existing and future
impervious surface, see Appendix D-4.)

Under the Town of Portsmouth’s Storm Water Discharge Control Ordinance, the town regulates any
storm water discharge associated with construction activities covered under the RIPDES general permit
and also requires that BMPs be implemented to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollution. A
General Permit Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System for Storm Water Discharges
Associated with Construction Activity would be necessary because redevelopment of the Tank Farm 1
and 2 properties would disturb more than 1 acre. Before approving a Construction General Permit,
Draft EIS

9-41

Tank Farms 1 and 2

RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a discussion of erosion and
sediment controls. Through compliance with applicable state and local regulations, the addition of
impervious surface would not be considered a significant impact.
Additionally, as indicated in Section 3.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, Section 438 of the EISA of 2007
requires that any development or redevelopment project involving a federal facility with a footprint
exceeding 5,000 square feet shall use site planning, design, construction, and maintenance strategies in
order to maintain or restore the pre-development hydrology of the property with regard to temperature,
rate, volume, and duration of flow. Compliance with this requirement can be met through the
implementation of LID technologies. Section 438 applies to the “sponsor of any development or
redevelopment project involving a federal facility.” The act of transferring the tank farms will result in
the property being no longer federally owned; consequently, Section 438 would not apply to the
redevelopment of the installation. However, as outlined in Rhode Island Stormwater Design and
Installation Standards Manual, using LID techniques is required as a primary method of storm water
control (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Thus, although not required through federal ownership of the
property, it is expected that the redevelopment of the tank farms would be consistent with the terms
contained in Section 438 of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system would require modifications, and new storm water
infrastructure would be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under
this alternative. Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure, and the developer
would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion
of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would be required to identify any infrastructure
requirements that may be necessary.
Operation and Management
Under Alternative 1, the property would likely be transferred to a non-federal agency and infrastructure
would no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future
property owner or developer would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure located on the
property and for its service and maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a significant increase in impervious surface area and new storm
water infrastructure would be required; however, mitigation will render the impact not significant.
Mitigation will include required compliance with state and local regulations and permit conditions
regarding storm water management.
9.8.1.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
Electricity would be supplied by National Grid. Upon full build-out of Alternative 1, it is expected that
total electricity demand—including accounting for electricity generated by the proposed solar array—
would be approximately 2,012,362 kWh, using U.S. averages for energy use per square foot, obtained
from the EIA for specific types of building use (U.S. Department of Energy 2003, 2009). These averages
were used to estimate total energy use by the proposed new building spaces. Office space is expected to
have the largest demand for electricity and consume 1.9 million kWh annually. Light industrial uses
would require approximately 1 million kWh, and the light industrial/boat storage uses would require an
additional 321,492 kWh. It is expected that 1.2 million kWh would be generated by the solar array.
Table 9.8-4 shows the projected electricity demand for the proposed uses under each alternative.

As shown in Table 5.8-4 in Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, the Town of Portsmouth consumed
more than 111 million kWh of electricity in 2011. The 2011 electric consumption represented a decrease
from 2010 but was still an increase over the levels used in 2009. According to the 2012 Regional System
Plan developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode Island’s overall electricity demand has been
forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the next decade.
The annual electricity demand under Alternative 1 would represent less than 1.8 percent of 2011 energy
usage in Portsmouth and less than a half percent of total annual energy usage for Newport, Middletown
and Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012). Considering the 0.8 percent future annual
growth rate in electricity demand at the state level, and the fact that Aquidneck Island is home to
approximately 5.5 percent of the state’s overall population, the annual growth rate for electricity demand
would be expected to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the electricity demand of the redevelopment
of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 would be expected to be supported by current electrical
capacity and would represent a negligible impact on regional demand. However, the future developer
would need to coordinate with the three local municipalities and National Grid to identify an alternative
for electricity provision if, at the time of redevelopment, regional capacities are exceeded.
All electric connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and properly built electric
transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed during construction of new systems.
Further, implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed by
the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the development
review process at the local level.
Natural Gas
Natural gas would continue to be supplied by National Grid. It is expected that a total of 7,944,000 cf of
natural gas would be needed annually under full build-out of Alternative 1. Similar to electricity usage,
estimates of future natural gas usage were calculated for full build-out as proposed under Alternative 1
using U.S. averages for natural gas use per square foot, which were obtained from the U.S. Department of
Energy (2003, 2009) for specific types of building use. These averages were used to estimate total natural
gas use by the proposed new building spaces. Light industrial uses and office space would consume
similar amounts of natural gas at 3,393,000 cf and 3,498,000 cf, respectively. Light industrial/boat
storage uses would use approximately 1 million cf of natural gas annually. Table 9.8-5 compares natural
gas usage for the two alternatives. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer
would work with National Grid to identify any infrastructure requirements that may be necessary.
The natural gas usage for the Town of Portsmouth in 2011 was more than 210 billion cf (see Table 5.8-5
in Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities). The quantity of natural gas needed under Alternative 1
represents less than one one-hundredth of a percent of the amount consumed in Portsmouth in 2011
(Rhode Island Energy 2012a) and therefore is assumed to be accommodated within existing capacities
servicing existing demand. It would represent a negligible impact on regional demand. Redevelopment
under Alternative 1 is not anticipated to create a strain on natural gas resources.

the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the development
review process at the local level.
9.8.1.5
Solid Waste
C&D wastes would be generated primarily from construction activities that are planned for
redevelopment of the tank farm properties. The structures at Tank Farm 1 would be demolished under a
separate project and are not considered in this analysis; no structures would be demolished at Tank Farm
2.
Appendix D-2 contains C&D waste estimates for structures/features at Tank Farm 2 if they are removed
in the future as part of redevelopment (see Figure 9.5-1). About 2,600 cubic yards of C&D waste would
be generated from constructing the industrial and commercial facilities planned for Alternative 1. Much
of the C&D waste would be recyclable and it is anticipated that the demolition and construction contracts
would contain traditional terms and conditions requiring recycling of C&D waste to the extent
practicable, which reduces disposal costs and is also protective of the environment. Solid wastes also
would be routinely generated during the future operation of the industrial and commercial enterprises that
are planned for the tank farm properties. Such solid wastes would consist of mixed trash, food waste, and
traditional recyclables such as paper, cardboard, and containers. It is expected that non-C&D solid wastes
would be accommodated by existing local solid waste management services.
Solid waste is currently occasionally generated at Tank Farms 1 and 2 in connection with investigative
activities. Implementation of Alternative 1 would have minor short-term and long-term impacts on the
generation and management of solid waste. The impacts would not be significant because of the relatively
small scale of the proposed reuse and redevelopment and the availability and capacity of existing solid
waste management programs in the Town of Portsmouth and Newport County.

9.8.2.1

Water Supply

Water Demand
Water demand was projected using planning multipliers for the proposed land uses based on square
footage and number of employees. Full build-out of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2 would result
in a demand of approximately 22,150 gpd from a mix of light industrial and office uses. Because of the
estimated number of employees, the proposed office use would have a higher rate of water consumption
than the proposed industrial uses. No water demand is associated with the solar array. (For more
information on the methodology and assumptions used to project water demand, see Appendix D-3.)

Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have a minor impact on the future capacity of the
Portsmouth Water and Fire District, which receives its water supply from the City of Newport; thus minor
impacts are anticipated on the City of Newport’s water treatment and distribution system. The current
average daily demand on the City of Newport water supply is approximately 5.59 mgd, including the City
of Newport and the Town of Middletown, through the City of Newport’s distribution system and also
wholesale water supply to NAVSTA Newport and the Portsmouth Water and Fire District. Total average
daily demand is projected to increase to 7.50 to 7.96 mgd by 2033 (Pare Corporation 2014).
Replacement of one of the existing plants and upgrades to the other increased capacity to 16 mgd (Water
World 2012; City of Newport Department of Utilities 2014). The expected 22,150 gpd under Alternative
2 represents less than 1 percent of the average daily demand projected for 2033. Therefore, the increase in
projected water demand would represent a minor impact on operation and maintenance of the City of
Newport’s water treatment plants and would be met with current capacity.
Distribution System
As noted earlier, water lines owned by NAVSTA Newport at the tank farms have been cut and capped.
Redevelopment of the property would require installing a new distribution system for water supply, which
would be the responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate
impact. Similar to Alternative 1, ground would be disturbed when laying new distribution lines, and the
developer would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new
distribution systems would be constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized. Tank Farms 1 and 2
are located within the Navy’s current utility jurisdiction; however, at the time of development, another
utility provider will be identified. The current boundaries of the Portsmouth Water and Fire District do
not include the tank farm properties and may require negotiations at the state assembly level to revise the
boundaries, if the District were to be identified as the future utility provider (Carlson 2012). Easements
may be necessary in the future in order to provide water to the surplus property.
In addition, the design and installation of any new water supply infrastructure would require, if
applicable, municipal review and approval and would need to comply with applicable local codes,
ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, similar to Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would result in an increase in water demand and a
need for infrastructure. New water distribution infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate
redevelopment, and this would be the responsibility of the new property owner/developer.
9.8.2.2
Wastewater
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have an adverse impact on any existing wastewater system
because of the need to integrate a currently unserviced area in the Town of Portsmouth. As discussed in
Alternative 1, Portsmouth has no infrastructure to treat additional wastewater.
Wastewater Volume
Full build-out of Alternative 2 would generate an estimated 21,126 gpd from the proposed light industrial
and office space uses. Office uses are expected to generate the most of the wastewater under this
alternative. Projections were based on standard multipliers for the proposed land uses and are shown in
Table 9.8-2. (For more information on the methodology, assumptions, and assumptions used to project
wastewater demand, see Appendix D-3.)

City of Newport treatment plant has a current capacity of 10.7 mgd and processes 9.46 mgd; therefore, the

However, there have been no discussions at the town level regarding the use of the City of Newport’s

would likely be the responsibility of the Town of Portsmouth. A new collection system to service the
Tank Farms would be the responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered
a moderate impact. Ground would be disturbed when laying new collection lines, and the developer
would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new collection
system(s) would be constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized.
In summary, Alternative 2 would result in a potentially significant impact on wastewater collection and
treatment capacity.
9.8.2.3
Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 2 would increase the amount of impervious surface area on the property,
producing a greater volume of storm water runoff. Full build-out under Alternative 2 is expected to result
in a total of approximately 1,478,800 square feet of impervious surface area, an increase of 151 percent in
impervious surface area. Total impervious surface area is provided for both alternatives in Table 9.8-3.
Similar to Alternative 1, compliance with local and state regulations regarding storm water management
would be necessary. A General Permit, Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm
Water Discharge Associated with Construction Activity, would also be necessary because redevelopment
of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would disturb more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction General
Permit, the RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a discussion of
erosion and sediment controls. Through compliance with applicable state and local regulations, the
addition of impervious surface would not be considered a significant impact.
Storm Water System
Similar to Alternative 1, the existing storm water collection system would require modifications, and new
storm water infrastructure would be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with
redevelopment.
Operation and Management
Under Alternative 2, the property would be transferred to a non-federal agency and infrastructure would
no longer be managed by the Navy. Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure,
and the developer would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future property owner would be responsible for the
storm water infrastructure located on the property and for its service and maintenance.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

In summary, Alternative 2 would result in a significant increase in impervious surface area and new storm
water infrastructure would be required; however, mitigation will render the impact not significant.
Mitigation will include required compliance with state and local regulations and permit conditions
regarding storm water management.
9.8.2.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
Electricity to the property would be supplied by National Grid. Under full build-out of Alternative 2, it is
expected that total electricity demand—including accounting for the 1.2 kWh generated by the proposed
solar array—would be approximately 2,590,198 kWh. Office use is expected to have the largest demand
for electricity and is projected to use approximately 2.4 million kWh annually. Light industrial uses
would need 1,136,725 kWh and light industrial/boat storage an additional 321,492 kWh. Table 9.8-4
shows the projected electricity demand for the proposed uses under each alternative. Upon completion of
the BRAC disposal process, the developer would work with National Grid to identify any infrastructure
requirements that may be necessary.
As discussed under Alternative 1, the Town of Portsmouth consumed more than 111 million kWh of
electricity in 2011. According to the 2012 Regional System Plan developed by ISO New England (2012),
Rhode Island’s overall electricity demand has been forecast to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over
the next decade. The annual electricity demand under Alternative 2 would represent 2.3 percent of 2011
energy usage in the Town of Portsmouth and approximately one-half percent of total annual energy usage
for Newport, Middletown and Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012). Considering the 0.8
percent future annual growth rate in electricity demand at the state level, and the fact that Aquidneck
Island contains approximately 5.5 percent of the state’s overall population, the annual growth rate for
electricity demand would be expected to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the electricity demand of
the redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2 would be expected to be supported by
current electrical capacity and would represent a negligible impact on regional demand. However, the
future developer would need to coordinate with the three local municipalities and with National Grid to
identify an alternative for electricity provision if, at the time of redevelopment, regional capacities are
exceeded.
Similar to Alternative 1, all electric connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and
properly built electric transmission and conveyance system. Construction of new systems would disturb
the ground. Implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed
by the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part of the
development review process at the local level.
Natural Gas
Natural gas would continue to be supplied by National Grid. It is expected that a total of 9,151,853 cf of
natural gas would be needed annually under full build-out of Alternative 2. Light industrial uses would
require approximately 3,723,173 cf, and office uses would require 4,375,680 cf. The light industrial/ boat
storage would use approximately 1 million cf of natural gas annually. Table 9.8-5 above shows natural
gas usage for both alternatives. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the developer would
work with National Grid to identify any infrastructure requirements that may be necessary.
The natural gas usage for the Town of Portsmouth in 2011 was more than 210 billion cf (see Table 5.8-5
in Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities). The quantity of natural gas needed under Alternative 2
represents less than one one-hundredth of a percent of the amount consumed in Portsmouth in 2011

Draft EIS

9-47

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

(Rhode Island Energy 2012), and therefore it is assumed that existing capacity would be sufficient for
Alternative 2. Redevelopment under Alternative 2 is not anticipated to create a strain on natural gas
resources. It would represent a negligible impact on regional demand.
Similar to Alternative 1, all natural gas connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized
and properly built gas transmission and conveyance system; ground would be disturbed when
constructing new systems. Implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded
and constructed by the future developer or owner of the property, and plans regarding such would be part
of the development review process at the local level.
9.8.2.5
Solid Waste
C&D wastes would be generated primarily from construction activities that are planned for
redevelopment of the tank farm properties. The structures at Tank Farm 1 would be demolished under a
separate project and are not considered in this analysis; no structures would be demolished at Tank Farm
2.
Appendix D-2 contains C&D waste estimates for structures/features at Tank Farm 2 if they are removed
in the future as part of redevelopment (see Figure 9.5-2). Approximately 3,000 cubic yards of C&D
waste would be generated from constructing the industrial and commercial facilities planned for
Alternative 2. Much of the C&D waste would be recyclable, as described for Alternative 1. Solid wastes
would be routinely generated during the future operation of the industrial and commercial enterprises that
are planned for the tank farm properties, as described for Alternative 1.
Solid waste is currently occasionally generated at Tank Farms 1 and 2 in connection with investigative
activities. Implementation of Alternative 2 would have minor short-term and long-term impacts on the
generation and management of solid waste, the same as described for Alternative 1. The impacts would
not be significant because of the relatively small scale of the proposed reuse and redevelopment and the
availability and capacity of existing solid waste management programs in the Town of Portsmouth and
Newport County.

9.8.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property there would be no
demand for water, electricity, or natural gas, nor would wastewater be generated. Some storm water
runoff from the existing 588,000 square feet of impervious surface area would continue.
Solid waste would continue to be generated from ongoing CERCLA IRP and RIDEM UST closure
activities and would cease once Tank Farms 1 and 2 are closed and remediated. The Navy would
continue with their demolition of structures at Tank Farm 1 under a separate project, and no demolition of
structures at Tank Farm 2 would be planned, so no large quantities of C&D waste are expected to be
generated in the future. Therefore, there would be a minor impact on solid waste management under the
No Action alternative.

9.9

Cultural Resources

As discussed in Section 3.9, NEPA guidance requires the evaluation of impacts of a proposed action on
cultural resources, including archaeological resources and architectural or built resources (see Sections
9.9.1.1 and 9.9.1.2, respectively) and Native American resources (see Section 9.9.1.3). The Navy has also
evaluated the potential impacts of the proposed action in terms of their effects on cultural resources that
are historic properties, pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (see Section 9.9.1.4).

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.9.1.1
Archaeological Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and has determined that
Alternative 1 would have no impacts on archaeological resources because none are present within the
APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2.
9.9.1.2
Architectural Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have no direct physical impacts on architectural resources. Under Alternative 1, the
Navy has assumed that all of the structures and buildings at Tank Farm 1 would be removed as part of a
separate action to demolish abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 (see Sections 8.9.2 and 13.3.6) and all of
the extant structures and buildings at Tank Farm 2 would remain in place (i.e., will not be demolished)
and would not be directly physically impacted by redevelopment under Alternative 1.
9.9.1.3
Native American Resources
As indicated in Section 8.9.1.3, the Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian
tribes regarding Native American resources within the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2: the Narragansett
Indian Tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) (see
Appendix A for copies of consultation letters). Consultation remains open.
9.9.1.4
NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties
Under Alternative 1, the transfer of historic properties out of federal ownership or control could be
considered an indirect adverse effect on historic properties without adequate and legally enforceable
restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property’s historic significance (ACHP
2004; 36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)(vii)). Under Alternative 1, it is assumed that all the buildings and structures at
Tank Farm 1, which are contributing resources to the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District and
considered historic properties, would be removed as part of a separate action to demolish abandoned
facilities at Tank Farm 1 (see Sections 8.9.4 and 13.3.6) but that all of the extant buildings and structures
at Tank Farm 2, which are also contributing resources to the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic
District and are considered historic properties, would remain in place (i.e., will not be demolished) and
would not be directly or indirectly affected by redevelopment under Alternative 1. Additionally under
Alternative 1, the transfer of the Tank Farm 1 and 2 property out of federal ownership or control,
considered in conjunction with the separate action for the removal of all buildings and structures at Tank
Farm, has the potential to result in an adverse cumulative effect on historic properties, by affecting the
resources that contribute to the overall significance of the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District,
as discussed in Section 13.3.6.
The Navy is in the process of consulting with the Rhode Island SHPO pursuant to Section 106 of the
NHPA, including consulting on the effects of the proposed action on historic properties within the APE

(Preston 2013; Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b). 18 As part of this ongoing consultation, the Rhode Island
SHPO has acknowledged that once the Navy has disposed of the property, subsequent redevelopment is
outside of the Navy’s control and has indicated that a standard treatment to mitigate any indirect adverse
effects of subsequent redevelopment on historic properties would be to include historic preservation
provisions, such as a historic preservation easement, in a deed of transfer (Sanderson 2013a). The
evaluation of impacts and effects on historic properties will be updated upon completion of consultation

No Action Alternative

The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of the No Action alternative under NEPA and determined
that the No Action alternative would have no impacts on archaeological resources because none are
present and no impacts on architectural resources because there would be no redevelopment of the
property. The Navy has evaluated the Section 106 effects of the No Action alternative and determined
that the No Action alternative could have an adverse effect on NRHP-eligible properties within the APE
at Tank Farms 1 and 2. The No Action alternative could contribute to the historic district being neglected
in a manner that causes its deterioration (ACHP 2004; 36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)(vi)) or otherwise treated in a
manner not consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic
Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic
Buildings (Weeks and Grimmer 1995). However, the Navy is consulting with the Rhode Island SHPO
pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA regarding the potential adverse effects on historic properties and
18

Separately, as part of the proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 to comply with Rule 13,
the Navy evaluated the effects of the demolition of the abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 and determined that
the demolition project would have an adverse effect on Tank Farm 1, which is eligible for listing on the NRHP
(Dorocz 2015a). Tank Farm 1 is considered NRHP-eligible because its facilities are contributing resources to the
Melville Naval Historic District (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014; Sanderson 2013b). The Rhode Island SHPO
concurred with the Navy’s determination that the proposed demolition of the abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1
would have an adverse effect on historic properties because Tank Farm 1 is located within the Melville Naval
Historic District and indicated that a memorandum of agreement (MOA) for the mitigation of the adverse effect
should be prepared by the Navy (Sanderson 2015). The analysis of the impacts and effects of the proposed
demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 is presented in the discussion of cumulative impacts on
cultural resources and historic properties in Section 13.3.6.

9.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the potential impacts on topography, geology, and soil resources resulting from
the implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative at Tank Farms 1 and 2.

9.10.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

As the majority of proposed development would be located in areas that have been previously disturbed
or developed by the Navy, implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to result in minor
temporary impacts on topography and soils due to redevelopment of the property (e.g., construction of
new buildings, parking lots, utilities, development on wooded areas).
9.10.1.1 Topography
Under Alternative 1, development would largely occur in areas that have been previously disturbed or
developed by the Navy for either above- or belowground structures (i.e., tanks). These areas would have
been previously graded for development. However, some of the proposed development would be located
in undeveloped wooded areas on the property. Some alteration of existing topography would be expected
as a result of grading and associated cut-and-fill activities necessary to accommodate new building sites.
The extent of grading and cut-and-fill activities would be localized and would depend on the building
design and location. As a result of previous development associated with Tank Farms 1 and 2, and
preservation of open space areas, impacts on topography would be minor; no significant impact would
result.
9.10.1.2 Geology
Alternative 1 would not impact geologic resources at the Tank Farms 1 and 2.
9.10.1.3 Soils
The redevelopment proposed under Alternative 1 would be concentrated on approximately 31.1 acres in
areas that predominantly have been previously developed by the Navy. Since a variety of buildings and
structures previously existed (or currently exist) on this property, it is assumed that urban/manmade soils
located in these areas have been modified from their original condition. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 1 would be expected to result in temporary and permanent minor impacts over time as full
build-out continues.
Erosion Potential
All soil types located at Tank Farms 1 and 2 have the potential to be impacted by development, including
erosion from wind and water and construction activities. Two soil types would be impacted by the
redevelopment footprint: Udorthents-Urban land complex and Newport silt loam, 8% to 15% slope. The
soil erosion potential for the Newport silt loam, 8% to 15% slopes and Newport-Urban land complex is
moderate. The soil erodibility factor for the Newport silt loam, 8% to 15%, is 0.24 at a depth of 24 inches
to 30 inches, which means the soils are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate
runoff (USDA 2012; IWR 2002). No erosion potential was listed for Udorthents-Urban land complex
(USDA 2012). To varying degrees, all such soils may require specific measures to control soil erosion
and limit runoff of sediment during clearing and construction activities. In addition, construction activities
(clearing, grading, landscaping, and movement of equipment, material, and vehicles) would expose soils
to wind and storm water erosion, compaction, and rutting. Soils that are heavily modified may suffer
losses in fertility and productivity.

Draft EIS

9-51

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Soils would be impacted during implementation of Alternative 1, but the impact would be mitigated by
implementing temporary erosion and sediment control measures during construction, permanent storm
water management measures, and appropriate building site location and design. Project construction
would result in the removal of existing vegetation in some areas, requiring slopes created by cutting and
filling to be stabilized and possible reestablishment of vegetation.
If slope stabilization and vegetation are not properly implemented and maintained, soil erosion and
sedimentation could result. Soils can be affected by sedimentation when soils from exposed areas are
deposited over undisturbed areas by runoff.
To mitigate these impacts, it is expected that the developer would implement appropriate erosion and
sediment control measures at construction and demolition sites in accordance with Rhode Island’s Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (RIDEM et al. 1989) and other applicable state laws. The
handbook provides descriptions of structural measures (e.g., grassed waterway, sediment basin, riprap,
etc.) and non-structural measures (e.g., mulching, topsoiling, silt curtains, etc.). The RIDEM requires a
General Permit, the Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity, for projects that disturb more than 1 acre (RIDEM 2013c). Prior
to approval of a Construction General Permit, the RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP,
which must include a discussion of erosion and sediment controls. This permit is discussed further in
Section 9.11.
Farmland
The Udorthents-Urban land complex soils located at Tank Farms 1 and 2 are not rated for farmland. The
Newport silt loam, 8% to 15% slopes, is designated as farmland of statewide importance (USDA 2012).
As indicated in Section 8.10.3.1, approximately 20.21 acres of Newport silt loam, slopes 8% to 15%, exist
on Tank Farms 1 and 2 (see also Figure 8.10-1). Under Alternative 1, approximately 4.1 acres of this soil
designated as farmland of statewide importance would be impacted. However, no significant impact
would be expected because the majority of this area has been impacted by the Navy’s previous operation
of the tank farms.
The Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) requires that federal agencies identify and consider the
adverse effects of the proposed actions on protected farmland. Projects are subject to FPPA requirements
if they may irreversibly convert farmland (directly or indirectly) to nonagricultural use and are completed
by a federal agency or with assistance from a federal agency. Assistance from a federal agency includes
the following:
•

Acquiring or disposing of land

•

Providing financing or loans

•

Managing property

•

Providing technical assistance.

None of the installation, including Tank Farms 1 and 2, is currently used or has been recently used for
farming. For the purposes of farmland protection, the farmland of statewide importance has essentially
been converted to urban uses as part of the former use of Tank Farms 1 and 2. The NRCS Farmland
Protection Policy Act Manual (USDA n.d.) provides a list of lands not covered by the act. One such
category of lands are “lands identified as ‘urbanized areas’ on U.S. Census Bureau maps.” According to
the U.S. Census Bureau maps, the majority of Aquidneck Island has been classified as an urban area (U.S.
Census Bureau 2011). Therefore, Alternative 1 would have no impact on farmland of statewide
importance.

Draft EIS

9-52

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Hydric Soils
Two soil types on the tank farm properties that would be impacted by redevelopment are non-hydric soils;
however, non-hydric soils can contain hydric inclusions and vice-versa. New construction under
Alternative 1 could impact hydric soils (if the non-hydric soils contained hydric inclusions). Hydric soils
may require special measures during construction or for other uses to overcome limitations caused by
wetness. Limitations may include a high water table or low strength for supporting construction
equipment and structures. Hydric soils may also limit other development activities such as excavation and
movement of heavy equipment) because of wet conditions.
Constructability
There are some restrictions for commercial development on Udorthents-Urban land complex soil if onsite septic tanks are used; however, on-site septic is not anticipated to be used for redevelopment. The
more common sources of constructability limitations for the soils include shallow excavations (slight
limitations due to dense to very dense soils), moderate frost action, and a moderate slope. Newport silt
loam, 8% to 15% slopes have a severe slope and a low shrink-swell potential (USDA 1981, 2012).
However, because much of the area where those soils are located may be modified, it is not possible to
determine the magnitude or severity of the limitations, based on available information. Prior to
construction, engineering evaluations will be completed and appropriate engineering techniques identified
to mitigate any soil limitations.
Organic Soils
None of the soils located at Tank Farms 1 and 2 were listed as organic soils.
In summary, there would be minor impacts on soils under Alternative 1, and mitigation would reduce
temporary impacts. Mitigation would include implementation of appropriate erosion and sediment control
measures in accordance with local and state laws and the Construction General Permit, as discussed in
detail above.

9.10.2

Alternative 2

Similar to Alternative 1, the majority of the proposed development would be located in areas that have
already been developed by the Navy. Redevelopment would cover a total of approximately 34 acres of
the overall site under Alternative 2 (31.1 acres in Alternative 1). Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 2 would be expected to result in minor temporary impacts on topography and soils due to
redevelopment of the property (e.g., construction of new buildings, parking lots, utilities).
9.10.2.1 Topography
Impacts on topography under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed above for Alternative 1.
9.10.2.2 Geology
Alternative 2 would not impact the geologic resources at Tank Farms 1 and 2.
9.10.2.3 Soils
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have similar impacts on soils as described for
Alternative 1, including impacts associated with erosion potential, farmland, hydric soils, and
constructability. As with Alternative 1, the proposed redevelopment would be concentrated in areas that
have already been developed by the Navy or would be located in undeveloped wooded areas on the
property. The same mitigation measures discussed for Alternative 1 will be implemented to minimize soil
impacts under Alternative 2.

Draft EIS

9-53

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Under Alternative 2, approximately 5.8 acres of soils designated as farmland of statewide importance
would be impacted. However, no impact would occur for the reasons discussed above under Alternative
1. There would be minor impacts on soils, and mitigation would reduce any temporary impacts.

9.10.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at Tank Farms 1 and 2 by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur on either property. As a result,
the No Action alternative would be expected to have no direct or indirect impacts on topography,
geology, or soils.

9.11 Water Resources

This section summarizes the potential environmental impacts on water resources resulting from
implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, or the No Action alternative at Tank Farms 1 and 2. It
includes a discussion of surface water, water quality, groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, and proposed
mitigation measures.

9.11.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.11.1.1 Surface Water
Redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would have no significant adverse direct impacts on surface water
because no surface waters are present on the site. The proposed redevelopment includes approximately
0.48 acres of wetland impacts located on site (Figure 9.11-1). Based on the requirement to avoid,
minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under state and federal permitting processes of
the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA, no significant impacts on surface waters would be
expected under Alternative 1.
Indirect impacts on surface waters near the Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties (i.e., Melville Ponds) in the
form of erosion and sedimentation could temporarily result from construction activities. The Melville
Ponds and an unnamed stream less than 100 feet to the north of the property are the nearest waterbodies.
Because the site drains from east to west and the closest redevelopment proposed (light industrial uses
and boat storage) is approximately 250 feet from one of the Melville Ponds and because redevelopment
would require compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to storm water
management and implementation of BMPs, indirect impacts on adjacent waterbodies would be
anticipated to be negligible. Indirect impacts on water quality are discussed below in Section 9.11.1.2.
9.11.1.2 Water Quality
As indicated in Section 8.11.2, the Melville Ponds are classified by RIDEM in the State of Rhode Island
2012 303(d) List – List of Impaired Waters (RIDEM 2012a) as impaired. However, as discussed above,
this complex is north of Tank Farm 1 and the property drains to the west, towards Narragansett Bay.
Therefore, redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 1 is not expected to impact Melville
Ponds or contribute to any further degradation of water quality. Any impacts on water quality in
association with wetland fill activities on other portions of the site are expected to be minimized and
mitigated under the developer’s future state and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and
Section 404 of the CWA.
Full build-out of Alternative 1 is projected to result in a total of 31.0 acres of impervious surface area,
which would predominantly comprise building roofs and parking areas. This would be a net increase of
approximately 17.5 acres above existing conditions (13.5 acres). The additional impervious surface area
would generate a long-term increase in precipitation runoff into the watershed and ultimately to
waterbodies in the area, including Narragansett Bay. Full build-out could have a long-term impact as
Draft EIS

9-54

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

storm water is currently managed through a combination of surface flow through culverts in trench
systems located within the old steam pipe trenches and secondary containment. All storm water from
Tank Farms 1 and 2 eventually discharges to Narragansett Bay through Outfall 008, located at the marina
(U.S. Department of the Navy 2009; AH/BC 2011). Redevelopment would be associated with a new onsite system for storm water management (see Section 9.8.1.3 for further discussion).
The Town of Portsmouth has a Storm Water Discharge Control Ordinance and a Storm Water and
Sediment Control Ordinance (Town of Portsmouth 2008c and 2010, respectively). In accordance with
these ordinances, prior to construction, the developer would be required to receive a permit from the
Town of Portsmouth. The developer would also be required to develop an Erosion and Sediment Control
Plan and a Storm Water Pollution and Prevention Plan to submit to the town for review. Under the Town
of Portsmouth’s Storm Water Discharge Control Ordinance, the town regulates any storm water discharge
from construction activity covered under the RIPDES general permit and also requires that BMPs be
implemented to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollution. Other guidelines would be storm
water management controls that are consistent with the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation
Standards Manual (as amended) (RIDEM and CRMC 2010) and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook (as amended) (RIDEM et al. 1989).
A General Permit, Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity, would also be necessary because redevelopment of the Tank Farm
1 and 2 properties would disturb more than 1 acre. Before approval of a Construction General Permit,
RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP that must include a discussion of erosion and
sediment controls. Compliance with these laws and regulations and implementation of BMPs would
decrease the magnitude of impacts on water quality from storm water runoff (see also Section 9.8.1.3,
Storm Water). Therefore, Alternative 1 would result in minor impacts on water quality.
9.11.1.3 Groundwater
As discussed in Section 8.11.3, groundwater at Tank Farm 1 is generally encountered approximately 2 to
20 feet below ground surface (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2012a). Groundwater at Tank Farm 2 is found at
approximately 5 to 30 feet below ground surface and the water table is usually within the bedrock (Tetra
Tech, Inc. 2012b). Construction activities could extend below ground surface to a depth that would
directly impact the underlying water table. The developer/contractor would be required to use standard
dewatering techniques and follow erosion and sediment control plans and BMPs that would involve
preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate discharge location, removing sediment from collected water,
and preserving downgradient natural resources. Potential spills of fuels or other chemicals and hazardous
materials could occur during construction activities. Impacts on groundwater resources would be
minimized through compliance with storm water permits and management plans and implementation of
BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM
and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on groundwater would result, and mitigation would reduce any adverse
impacts of construction.
9.11.1.4 Floodplains
No FEMA-delineated floodplains are located on Tank Farm 1 or 2 and implementation of Alternative 1
would have no impact on floodplains.
9.11.1.5 Wetlands
Three potential wetlands are present within the boundaries of the Tank Farm 1 property. A portion of one
of the potential wetlands would be permanently impacted as a result of the construction of the light
industrial use proposed for the property (see Figure 9.11-1). A total of approximately 0.08 acre of
permanent wetland fill would result from the building footprint. No direct impacts on the other two

Tank Farms 1 and 2

potential wetlands would result. Additionally, the perimeter wetlands associated with two of the potential
wetlands would be directly impacted by the project footprint (see Figure 9.11-1). Approximately 0.4 acres
of perimeter wetland would be impacted due to the light industrial boat storage footprint. As discussed in
Section 8.11.1.5, the perimeter wetland associated with the adjacent Melville Ponds extends onto Tank
Farm 1.
Filling a freshwater wetland requires a permit from RIDEM and a permit from the USACE under Section
404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the developer will be required to coordinate wetland
mitigation plans with the USACE and RIDEM. Under Rule 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing
the Administration and Enforcement of the Freshwater Wetlands Act, a permit to alter a wetland must be
obtained from RIDEM. The permit must also address impacts on the perimeter wetlands, as those areas
are included in the definition of a “freshwater wetland” as per Rule 4 of the Rules and Regulation
Governing the Administration and Enforcement of the Freshwater Wetlands Act.
Section 404 of the CWA authorizes the USACE to issue permits regulating the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the U.S., including wetlands. In 2008, the USACE and the EPA issued
regulations governing compensatory mitigation for authorized impacts on wetlands; these are codified in
40 CFR Part 230 as the Final Rule for Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources.
Compensation requirements typically vary based on the impacted wetland communities. Specific
mitigation requirements for future development projects would be determined in coordination with the
USACE and RIDEM.
Based on the requirement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under federal
and state permit programs, no significant impacts on wetlands would be expected under Alternative 1.
The developer would be required to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under
state and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.
No wetlands are found on Tank Farm 2. As indicated above in Section 8.11.5, the Melville Ponds
wetland complex is located north-northeast of Tank Farm 1 and northeast and east of Tank Farm 2. These
wetlands are a mix of palustrine emergent and palustrine forested scrub/shrub wetlands. This complex
ultimately discharges to Narragansett Bay. As discussed above in Section 9.11.1.1, because the site drains
from east to west, there is no redevelopment proposed near the boundary of Tank Farms 1 and 2, and
redevelopment would require compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations
pertaining to storm water management and implementation of BMPs, indirect impacts on these adjacent
wetlands would be anticipated to be negligible. Therefore, Alternative 1 would not result in a significant
impact on wetlands.

9.11.2

Alternative 2

9.11.2.1 Surface Water
As discussed under Alternative 1, redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would have no significant
adverse direct impacts on surface water because no surface waters are present. Any disturbance to
surface waters in association with wetland fill would be done in accordance with existing regulatory
BMPs in place by the future developers.
Indirect impacts on surface waters near the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property (i.e., Melville Ponds), in the
form of erosion and sedimentation, would be the same as Alternative 1.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

9.11.2.2 Water Quality
Like Alternative 1, redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2 is not expected to impact
Melville Ponds or contribute to any further degradation of water quality. Any disturbance to water
quality in association with wetland fill would be done in accordance with existing regulatory BMPs in
place by the future developers.
Full build-out of Alternative 2 is projected to result in a total of 33.9 acres of impervious surface area,
which would comprise mostly building roofs and parking areas. This would be a net increase of
approximately 20.4 acres above existing conditions (13.5 acres). The additional impervious surface area
would generate a long-term increase in precipitation runoff into the watershed and ultimately to
waterbodies in the area, including Narragansett Bay. As discussed under Alternative 1, redevelopment
would be associated with a new on-site system for storm water management. Additionally, the developer
would be required to follow all applicable state and local laws in order to decrease impacts on water
quality from storm water runoff; these laws would include the Town of Portsmouth Storm Water
Discharge Control Ordinance, the Portsmouth Storm Water and Sediment Control Ordinance, and state
requirements under the RIPDES permitting program. Compliance with these laws and regulations and
implementation of BMPs would decrease the magnitude of impacts on water quality from storm water
runoff.
Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts on water quality, and mitigation, as outlined above, would
reduce adverse impacts.
9.11.2.3 Groundwater
Similar to Alternative 1, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in construction activities that could
extend below ground surface to a depth that would directly impact the underlying water table. The
developer/contractor would be required to use standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion
sediment control plans and BMPs that would involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate
discharge location, removing sediment from collected water, and preserving downgradient natural
resources. Potential spills of fuels or other chemicals and hazardous materials could occur during
construction activities. Impacts on groundwater resources would be minimized through compliance with
storm water permits and management plans and implementation of BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island
Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on
groundwater would result; mitigation would reduce adverse construction impacts.
9.11.2.4 Floodplains
No FEMA-delineated floodplains are found on Tank Farm 1 or 2; implementation of Alternative 2 would
have no impact on floodplains.
9.11.2.5 Wetlands
Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in permanent fill of approximately 0.09 acres of the same
potential wetland discussed under Alternative 1 (see Figure 9.11-2). That wetland would be permanently
impacted by construction of the light industrial uses proposed for the property (see Figure 9.11-2). The
developer would be required to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under state
and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.
Additionally, the perimeter wetlands associated with two of the potential wetlands would be directly
impacted by the project footprint (see Figure 9.11-2). Approximately 0.5 acres of perimeter wetland
would be impacted by the light industrial/boat storage and driveway/parking area proposed uses. Filling a
freshwater wetland requires a permit from RIDEM and a permit from the USACE under Section 404 of
the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the developer will be required to coordinate wetland
Draft EIS

9-59

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

mitigation plans with RIDEM and the USACE. Therefore, Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts as
measures to reduce impacts on wetlands would be implemented by the developer through state and
federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of CWA.

9.11.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property there would be no
impacts on water resources from redevelopment. Some storm water runoff from the existing
approximately 13.5 acre of impervious surface area would occur.

9.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the potential impacts on biological resources from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of impacts on
vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, and significant wildlife habitat from disposal and
future reuse of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 properties.
GIS analysis was used to determine the extent of potential impacts on vegetation communities and
wildlife habitat from implementation of the redevelopment alternatives (see also Section 2.2,
Identification of Alternatives).
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, any future developer of
Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be required to comply with local, state, and federal laws and regulations
pertaining to biological resources. Specifically, consultation with RIDEM under the Rhode Island
endangered species act (Title 20 of the General Laws of the State of Rhode Island) would be required for
any activities proposed within habitat known to support state-listed threatened or endangered species.
However, the USFWS and RIDEM have indicated that no federally or state-listed or candidate species are
located on Tank Farms 1 and 2 (Chapman 2013; Jordan 2013). Because of the length of time between
informal consultation for this EIS and the actual redevelopment of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 properties,
future consultation will be necessary.

9.12.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

9.12.1.1 Vegetation
Implementation of Alternative 1 would necessitate permanent removal of vegetation to accommodate new
facilities and supporting infrastructure. Redevelopment under Alternative 1 would result in the
redevelopment of approximately 31.1 acres, of which 26.4 acres is vegetated, of the 136-acre site. Table
9.12-1 identifies the types of habitat cover impacted by proposed redevelopment of Alternative 1; these
are illustrated in Figure 9.12-1. These habitat impact acreages are areas where the development footprint
overlaps these habitat types.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Approximately 104.9 acres of land at this site would be maintained as open space. Temporary indirect
impacts in the form of temporary disturbance could occur during construction because it is located next to
areas that would be disturbed during construction. However, any temporarily disturbed areas designated
as open space following redevelopment will be restored to the current existing conditions.
Approximately 4.8 acres of currently developed land would also be overlain by the redevelopment
footprint; therefore, that area is not considered an impact.
Mixed Oak/White Pine Forest
Under Alternative 1, approximately 2.7 acres of mixed oak/white pine forest would be removed during
the proposed redevelopment (see Table 9.12-1 and Figure 9.12-1). The proposed redevelopment on
forestland under Alternative 1 includes parking/access and office space. This land cover would no longer
be available to terrestrial wildlife and could potentially lead to habitat fragmentation. Species potentially
occurring in this habitat cover would be impacted by a reduction in potential habitat. However,
approximately 2.8 acres of mixed oak/white pine forest habitat would remain on-site and there are
additional undeveloped areas to the north, south, and east of the property. Additionally, the forest habitat
has not been designated as significant or unique habitat. Therefore, the loss of 2.8 acres of mixed
oak/white pine forest would not be considered a significant impact on Aquidneck Island.
Old Field
The development of Alternative 1 would result in the permanent loss of approximately 9.2 acres of old
field habitat at Tank Farms 1 and 2 (see Table 9.12-1 and Figure 9.12-1). The majority of this conversion
would be for the potential solar array and for parking/access. This land cover conversion would result in
the removal of herbaceous vegetation, potentially leading to habitat fragmentation. However, none of the
old field habitat that would be impacted under Alternative 1 is designated as significant or unique wildlife
habitat. Additionally, approximately 65.5 acres of old field habitat would remain on-site, and there are
additional undeveloped areas to the north, south, and east of the property. Therefore, the loss of 9.2 acres
of old field habitat would not be considered a significant impact on Aquidneck Island.
Ruderal Forest
Under Alternative 1, approximately 14.5 acres of ruderal forest would be permanently impacted through
development. Ruderal forest can provide foraging and resting sites for such species as deer and birds, as
well as rabbits, mice, and other small terrestrial mammals. Conversion of this habitat cover type from
natural to developed land would result in a permanent loss of these areas; however, it is not considered a
permanent impact for reasons similar to those cited above for mixed oak/white pine forest and old field
habitats.
9.12.1.2 Wildlife
Implementation of Alternative 1 would cause both short- and long-term impacts on resident wildlife.
Long-term impacts could be species mortality, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation. Mortality of lessmobile species such as small mammals and reptiles would be possible during construction; however,
overall impacts on species diversity and abundance on the property from construction activities would be
minor since the majority of wildlife would avoid the construction areas. No significant impacts on
wildlife would result.
Terrestrial Mammals
Terrestrial wildlife species are closely associated with vegetative communities. For this reason, the loss
of vegetation and modifications of land uses, as discussed in Section 9.12.1.1, would also affect the
wildlife communities at Tank Farms 1 and 2. Potential impacts on wildlife would be primarily from loss
of habitat due to clearing and grading during construction as well as the development footprint itself.
While permanent removal of habitat would directly affect wildlife communities on the site, these species
Draft EIS

9-65

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

would likely re-colonize the undisturbed or undeveloped portions of the site following redevelopment.
Overall impacts on terrestrial mammals would be minor.
As noted above, approximately 26.4 acres of vegetation or 28 percent of the overall vegetated area at
Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be removed by implementing Alternative 1. Wildlife that use these habitats
would be forced to migrate to other areas with suitable habitat. Small mammals and reptiles would be
most affected and some individuals of these species may be impacted if unoccupied habitat of equal
quality is not available in the immediate vicinity. Upon completion of construction, recolonization by
species of small mammals, reptiles, and birds adapted to urban conditions would be expected in these
areas.
In addition to habitat loss, wildlife species may be temporarily displaced in peripheral areas during
construction, when noise and human activity levels increase. Species that would be most affected include
those with relatively small home ranges. During construction, short-term impacts may include
displacement of mobile species such as eastern gray squirrel, common raccoon, and Virginia opossum.
Long-term impacts may be related to species mortality, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation. Overall
impacts on species diversity and abundance on the property from construction activities would be minor
since the majority of these species would avoid areas of construction where equipment and human
activities create disturbance.
Herpetofauna
Loss of the forested cover (approximately 17.2 acres) at the surplus property would reduce the amount of
habitat likely to harbor herpetofauna such as the black rat snake and common garter snake. During
construction, these species would likely avoid areas impacted by noise and human activity.
Avian Species
As discussed in Section 3.12.1.2, a number of migratory bird species occur at NAVSTA Newport. These
include various species of passerines, waterfowl, and waterbirds. Short-term impacts on avifauna, e.g.,
displacement, may result during implementation of Alternative 1. Breeding birds would avoid areas of
construction where equipment and human activities create disturbance. The potential exists for a limited
number of species to be directly impacted through loss or mortality of young if construction activities take
place in the breeding season. The loss of habitat on the property under Alternative 1, primarily upland
forest and old field, would result in the loss of potential nesting areas for breeding birds and stopover
areas for migrating bird species.
In May of 2015, the USFWS initiated a NEPA review of alternatives to authorize take under the MBTA.
At the time of the publication of this Draft EIS, it is uncertain if the future implementation of the
Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1 may require a take permit under the MBTA. The future
developer would be required to minimize impacts on migratory birds as required under state and federal
permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. Pursuant to the MBTA and
BGEPA, the Navy has determined that implementation of Alternative 1 would have minor impacts on
avian species and the disposal and reuse of the former Tank Farms 1 and 2 property would not result in
significant impacts on, or harm of, migratory birds and bald and golden eagles.
Marine Mammals and Other Marine Wildlife
Because Tank Farms 1 and 2 are inland, Alternative 1 would not have any impacts on marine mammals,
finfish, shellfish, crustacea, or benthic organisms.
9.12.1.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
The Navy has documented the presence of the northern long-eared bat within approximately one mile of
Tank Farms 1 and 2, as discussed below.
Draft EIS

9-66

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

During 2013 acoustic surveys, two calls at a stake location at Tank Farm 4, five calls at a stream location
at Tank Farm 4, and five calls at a wetland location at Tank Farm 5 were recorded (Tetra Tech, Inc.
2014b, 2014c). Tank Farm 4 is the closest monitoring location to the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property,
located approximately 1 mile to the southwest. Based on a field survey conducted in December 2014 to
determine the suitability of summer roosting habitat for the northern long-eared bat, approximately 30
acres of suitable or potentially suitable summer roosting habitat has been designated within portions of
the ruderal forest and old field habitats on Tank Farm 4.
Although the acoustic detections were made at Tank Farm 4, located approximately 1 mile southwest of
Tank Farms 1 and 2, no mist-net capture or roost tree data are available for Tank Farms 1 and 2. As
discussed in Section 9.12.1.1, approximately 14.5 of the total 41.5 acres of ruderal forest on Tank Farms 1
and 2 would be removed. It is unknown if any potential maternal roost trees exist on Tank Farms 1 and 2
and no known hibernacula are located within 0.25-mile of Tank Farms 1 and 2.
Therefore, the potential effects of the proposed action include permanent loss of potential roosting habitat
and potential impacts on foraging habitats According to the USFWS Final 4(d) rule, tree clearing within
150-feet of a known maternal roost is limited to those months outside the pup period (June 1 – July 31)
and no tree clearing is allowed within a 0.25-mile of a hibernacula (USFWS 2016).
During the initial informal consultation process, prior to the issuance of the final 4(d) rule, the Navy has
proposed measures to protect the northern long-eared bat’s most vulnerable life stages and ensure that
reuse of the property does not result in the direct take of northern long-eared bats. These include certain
conservation measures or BMPs as recommended deed restrictions for the future developer(s)/property
owners of Tank Farm 2 These recommended measures would be the responsibility of the
developer(s)/property owners to implement as part of development and construction:
•

Project activities must occur more than 0.25 miles from known, occupied hibernacula.

•

All clearing of trees and vegetation on-site shall take place between October 1st and April
15th (Chapman 2015).

The removal of 14.5 total acres of assumed potential roosting habitat for this analysis at Tank Farms 1
and 2 would represent far less than 0.10 percent of the total forest cover in the state, and there are
additional forested areas adjacent to Tank Farms 1 and 2 to the north and northeast. Based on the small
area of roosting habitat proposed for removal, and the implementation of the BMPs identified above, the
Navy has determined that the implementation of the proposed action may affect, but is not likely to
adversely affect, the northern long-eared bat. The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding its concurrence
on the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat at Tank Farms 1 and 2
(Preston 2015b). To date, USFWS has not provided a response, and informal consultation with the
USFWS on the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat is ongoing. The
Navy contacted the USFWS regarding the potential presence of the northern long-eared bat at the surplus
properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston 2015a). The Navy received a response from the USFWS via
electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal consultation and provide additional information
about the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015).
The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). To date,
USFWS has not provided a response, and further informal consultation with the USFWS on the potential
effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat is ongoing. ESA consultation for northern
long-eared bat is ongoing. As part of any future state and federal CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 CWA
permitting processes, the developer will implement measures to protect northern long-eared bat as needed
to ensure the development is conducted in compliance with the ESA. Pursuant to ESA, the Navy has

Draft EIS

9-67

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

determined that the proposed action may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the northern longeared bat under Alternative 1 at the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property. The evaluation of impacts and
potential for adverse effects to the northern long-eared bat will be updated upon completion of
consultation with the USFWS; the ESA consultation is ongoing.
9.12.1.4

Significant Wildlife Habitat

Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
There is no SAV habitat at Tank Farms 1 and 2. Alternative 1 would not result in any impacts on SAV at
the former Tank Farms 1 and 2 property.
Wetlands
Alternative 1 would result in approximately 0.48 acres of impacts on wetlands as a result of the
construction of the light industrial use proposed for the property. The developer would be required to
avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under state and federal permitting
processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.
Vernal Pools
Alternative 1 would not have any impact on vernal pools. The site does not contain any vernal pools.
Essential Fish Habitat
Alternative 1 would not have any impact on EFH. The site does not contain any EFH.

9.12.2

Alternative 2

9.12.2.1 Vegetation
Implementation of Alternative 2 at Tank Farms 1 and 2 would redevelop approximately 34 acres of the
136-acre site. Table 9.12-2 identifies the types of habitat cover that would be impacted by the proposed
redevelopment of Tank Farms 1 and 2 under Alternative 2. Under Alternative 2, approximately 28.3
acres of vegetation would be permanently impacted to accommodate new facilities and supporting
infrastructure (see Figure 9.12-2).

Alternative 2 would result in approximately 2.7 acres of disturbance of mixed oak/white pine forest,

significant impact because of the remaining mixed oak/white pine forest habitat on-site and the
undeveloped areas around the tank farms.
Old Field
The development of Alternative 2 would result in the permanent loss of approximately 9.2 acres of old
field habitat, the same amount as under Alternative 1 (see Table 9.12-2). Conversion of old field would
result in the same degree of impact for Alternatives 1 and 2.

Tank Farms 1 and 2

Ruderal Forest
Under Alternative 2, approximately 16.4 acres of ruderal forest would be permanently impacted through
development. Impacts from permanent vegetation conversion resulting from Alternative 2 are similar to
those discussed for Alternative 1.
9.12.2.2 Wildlife
Impacts on wildlife under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed above for Alternative 1.
Terrestrial Mammals
Potential impacts on terrestrial mammals would be similar to those discussed for Alternative 1; however,
none of these impacts are expected to be significant or adverse over either the short- or long-term (see
Alternative 1 above); impacts would be minor.
Herpetofauna
As discussed under Alternative 1, loss of the forested habitat cover at Tank Farms 1 and 2 would reduce
the amount of habitat likely providing harbor to herpetofauna such as the black rat snake and common
garter snake. The loss of ruderal forested habitat is the same under both alternatives. Overall, however,
impacts on herpetofauna would be minor.
Marine Mammals and Other Marine Wildlife
As noted under Alternative 1, no marine mammals and other marine wildlife such as finfish, shellfish,
crustacea, or benthos would be impacted by Alternative 2 because there is no open water habitat at this
surplus property.
Avian Species
Like the impacts discussed for Alternative 1, construction of Alternative 2 would result in short-term
impacts, e.g., displacement, on avian species. Breeding birds would avoid areas of construction where
equipment and human activities create disturbance. The future developer would be required to minimize
impacts on migratory birds as required under state and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP
and Section 404 of the CWA. Pursuant to the MBTA and BGEPA, the Navy has determined that
implementation of Alternative 1 would have minor impacts on avian species and the disposal and reuse of
the former Tank Farms 1 and 2 property would not result in significant impacts on, or harm of, migratory
birds and bald and golden eagles.
9.12.2.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
Impacts on threatened and endangered species under Alternative 2 are similar to those discussed under
Alternative 1.
9.12.2.4 Significant Wildlife Habitat
Impacts on significant wildlife habitat are the same as those discussed for Alternative 1.

9.12.3

No Action Alternative

9.12.3.1 Vegetation
Under the No Action alternative, Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be retained by the U.S. government in
caretaker status; no redevelopment would occur. The vegetation at the tank farms would be left in a
natural state, with minimal management, and the various habitat types would not be anticipated to change
in habitat quality.

Draft EIS

9-71

March 2016

Tank Farms 1 and 2

9.12.3.2 Wildlife
Under the No Action alternative, the property would be retained by the U.S. government in caretaker
status. Overall wildlife abundance would likely increase as a result of continued lack of human activity.
Diversity would likely remain constant, as the variety of habitats at the property would be maintained.
9.12.3.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
Under the No Action alternative, the property would be retained by the U.S. government in caretaker
status. The potential for the federally listed endangered northern long-eared bat to be present on the site
along with other federal or state-listed species would continue to exist at Tank Farms 1 and 2.
9.12.3.4 Significant Wildlife Habitat
No significant wildlife habitat currently exists at the Tank Farms 1 and 2 and it is not likely that over
time, with continued lack of use of the property, significant wildlife habitat would occur in the future.

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

10 Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property: Existing Conditions
10.1 Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section summarizes existing land uses in the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. A discussion of
the land use and zoning districts surrounding the property and the plans and regulations that guide or
direct the development of this land also is provided.

10.1.1

On-Site Land Use

The approximately 10.7-acre Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is located along the northwestern
portion of NAVSTA Newport on the western shoreline of Aquidneck Island. The property parallels the
Defense Highway, which is one of three major north-south roadways on Aquidneck Island (RKG
Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property primarily consists of open space. The former Midway Fueling
Pier, an unused stone and concrete pier is located on the bay shoreline near the Defense Highway’s
intersection with Greene Lane. The stone and concrete are the remains of the apron to an earlier existing
much larger wooden “t” pier. The area around Midway Fueling Pier is developed with a small utility
structure and a gravel parking lot. Several Navy buildings were located at this site but have been
demolished (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). These demolished buildings include Building 70, the
Midway Booster Pump House; Building 71, Boiler House No. 3; and Building 111 whose purpose was
not known. Building 71 was demolished in 1995 and Buildings 70 and 111 in 1999. Navy-owned utility
lines, including a fuel line and steam line, run along the Defense Highway and cross several of the
adjoining parcels of land (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).

10.1.2

Surrounding Land Use

The study area for surrounding land uses includes the area within 0.25 miles of the boundaries of the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The property is bordered to the north, south, and east by Navyowned property, including the Greene Lane housing area and undeveloped property along the Defense
Highway, and to the west by Narragansett Bay (see Figure 10.1-1). An operational rail line used for
tourist-oriented train service nearly bisects the entire Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, north to south.
Land uses within the study area beyond the adjacent land uses consist primarily of Navy-owned property,
including Tank Farm 5 and the Navy Fire Fighting Training Area. Low-density residential development
in the Town of Portsmouth and a property developed with an institutional land use in the Town of
Middletown also are located within 0.25 miles of the site.

10.1.3

Land Use Plans and Zoning

While, land surrounding the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is under the jurisdiction of the Towns of
Middletown and Portsmouth, the proposed action would not be expected to have notable impacts on
surrounding land uses; therefore, only the Town of Middletown’s land use plans and zoning, which would
apply directly to the property, are discussed in this section. Land use and development in the town is
regulated by its zoning regulations and comprehensive plan. Additionally, part of the corridor is included
in the study areas for the Town of Middletown’s Shoreline Park Master Plan (Matrix Design Group
2014), the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005), and the Aquidneck
Island Transportation Study (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin 2011).
Town of Middletown Zoning Code. The portion of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is in the
public zoning district, which is designated for land owned by the federal or state government or the Town

Draft EIS

10-1

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

of Middletown. Government land uses are the only uses permitted in the public zoning district. If a
property in a public zoning district is transferred to a private owner, the town requires the property to be
rezoned before it is used for a non-governmental purpose (Middletown Code of Ordinances Chapter 152
§2600 – 2601).
Town of Middletown, RI, Comprehensive Community Plan. The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
in Middletown is located in an area designated for conservation, recreation, and open space uses in the
Town of Middletown, RI, Comprehensive Community Plan Update (Town of Middletown Planning
Department 2015). This future land use designation is intended to conserve existing recreation land and
open space through conservation or development easements. The comprehensive plan recommends that
land included in this use designation be protected from any development. Other plan recommendations
specific to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property include the following:
•

Protecting and enhancing scenic vistas along Defense Highway in accordance with the
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan.

•

Providing new public spaces and facilities on Narragansett Bay, including the proposed
Greene Lane Park (Town of Middletown Planning Department 2008).

The 2014 comprehensive plan update also carries forward the town’s plans for the Greene Lane Park,
which would provide the town’s only direct public access to Narragansett Bay (Town of Middletown
Planning Department 2015).
Shoreline Park Master Plan. This plan develops a conceptual plan for reuse of the surplus Navy
property in the Town of Middletown and updates previous land use plans that address this property,
including the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan discussed below. The planning area includes the
entire extent of the previously designated Defense Highway/Stringham Road Corridor. The town
reassessed the reuse plan for the property through a process that included reviewing existing plans and the
property’s zoning and future land use designations, evaluating the existing condition of the property, and
obtaining public input during two workshops held in February and March 2013. The preferred conceptual
plan for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property that developed from this process is similar to the reuse
plan presented in this Draft EIS as Alternative 1 but includes additional development. The primary
differences include development of a train depot and visitor’s center with restrooms (approximately 2,000
square feet) and an outdoor concessions plaza (approximately 6,000 square feet). In addition, the
preferred conceptual plan differs from the original reuse plan in that Midway Pier would be replaced on
its existing foundations and extended farther into the bay (Matrix Design Group 2014).
Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. The Aquidneck Island Planning Commission cites the need
to plan for the reuse of surplus Navy properties as one of the reasons for preparing the Aquidneck Island
West Side Master Plan. The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is located in the central part of the
planning area. The master plan notes that Defense Highway currently is under-used, and increasing use
of this roadway would address local transportation needs without requiring new road construction. The
master plan recommends renaming the road “Shoreline Drive” and completing various improvements,
including realigning and improving the intersection with Stringham Road, to facilitate diverting
commuter and tourist traffic to the road from West Main Road. This would alleviate traffic congestion on
West Main Road (The Cecil Group et al. 2005). The master plan recommends considering expansion of
Shoreline Drive to a four-lane parkway as a potential future project, depending on the long-term needs of
the community. Since the completion of the Aquidneck Island Transportation Study, the Navy has
decided to retain the Defense Highway and Stringham Road due to lack of interest from the Town of

Portsmouth in taking these roadways. Recommendations specific to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property include developing a scenic overlook, park, and fishing pier at the Midway Pier area; and
creating a bike path parallel to but separated from Shoreline Drive (The Cecil Group et al. 2005).
Aquidneck Island Transportation Study. Two scenarios were developed as part of the ongoing
Aquidneck Island Transportation Study. Scenario 1 is the preferred reuse plan including the use of
Defense Highway —a two-lane roadway with the addition of a multi-use pathway and open space
ribbons. Scenario 2 was a four-lane roadway with the same multi-purpose path. Because of roadway
width constraints, the road portion of the previously designated Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor cannot be widened to allow additional lanes. Therefore, Scenario 1 was selected as the preferred
reuse plan for this site and was ultimately incorporated into the Redevelopment Plan. Since the
completion of the Aquidneck Island Transportation Study, the Navy has decided to retain the Defense
Highway and Stringham Road due to lack of interest from the Town of Portsmouth in taking these
roadways. Thus, a modified version of Scenario 1 is included in this Draft EIS.

10.1.4

Coastal Zone Management

Under the CZMA and the RI CRMP, CRMC has review authority for all federal actions or activities
regardless of their location within a Rhode Island coastal community or state territorial waters. However,
only the disposal of the surplus property is a federal action; the subsequent redevelopment would be a
non-federal action and would fall under CRMC’s direct state permitting authority for non-federal projects
located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area.
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is located in the 200-foot contiguous area of Narragansett Bay,
which the RI CRMP categorizes as a Type 4 Water: Multipurpose Waters. As discussed in Section
3.1.1, under the RI CRMP tidal waters, shoreline features, and contiguous areas are regulated by the state.
As indicated in Figure 10.1-2, in addition to the presence of the offshore water portion of the site as a
Type 4 Water, there are also three shoreline features within or directly adjacent to the site boundary: a
beach, coastal wetlands, and eelgrass beds. The presence of these shoreline features is associated with
additional policies; the policies applicable to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are outlined in Table
10.1-1 below.

keeping with the principle that the [CRMC] shall work to preserve
and restore ecological systems.
2. The [CRMC] recognizes that large portions of Type 4 waters include
important fishing grounds and fishery habitats, and shall protect such
areas from alterations and activities that threaten the vitality of Rhode
Island fisheries.

Policy

Policy 4 - Coastal wetlands designated for preservation adjacent to Type
3, 4, 5, and 6 waters are identified on maps available for inspection at the
Council's offices and at the town halls of coastal cities and towns.
Dredging and filling in these designated coastal wetlands are prohibited.
The maps of designated coastal wetlands serve to identify individual
wetlands; in all cases precise boundaries shall be determined through a
field inspection when proposals that could impact these features are being
considered. In support of this goal, the Council supports a policy of "no
net loss" of coastal wetland acreage and functions as a result of coastal
development.
Policy 7 - All alterations to coastal wetlands shall be carried out in
accordance with Section 300.12 Coastal Wetland Mitigation.
Under the Rhode Island CRMP, any alteration or activity proposed within
tidal waters, shoreline features, and contiguous areas is regulated and an
assent is required from the Council. The requirements for a Category B
Assent from CRMC are provided in Section 300.1 of the Rhode Island
CRMP and include demonstrating the need for the proposed activity,
demonstrating that the activity would not result in significant impacts on
erosion and/or deposition processes along the shore and in tidal waters,
and demonstrating that there would be no significant deterioration in
water quality, as well as other requirements.
Maintenance dredging within tidal waters of Type 4 Waters will require a
Category A Assent. By definition, “maintenance dredging includes
projects whose purpose is to restore channels and basins to dimensions
that support and maintain existing levels of use.” In addition, according to
CRMP Section 300.9, the following prerequisites are required:
1. All materials to be dredged for either open water disposal or upland
disposal must be classified by the Department of Environmental
Management (DEM) based upon an approved analysis process prior to
the Council acting on an application of either dredging or dredged
materials disposal.
2. Any application for open water disposal of dredged materials shall
obtain a suitability determination from the Army Corps of Engineers.
3. All applicable requirements of the Freshwater Wetlands Act have or
will have been met.
4. Upland disposal of dredged materials must comply with all applicable
local zoning ordinances.
5. When disposal is proposed for approved upland facilities, the
applicant shall provide a letter of acceptance from that facility, unless
the disposal is approved for the central landfill.
6. For dredge volumes greater than 10,000 cubic yards, a pre-application
meeting is required.

Policy

Policy 1 - The Council's goal is to preserve, protect and where possible,
restore SAV habitat. In cases where the Council determines that SAV may
be altered or grants a special exception to a prohibition listed in Section
300.18D, the Council shall require the mitigation of all impacts [on] SAV.
Such activities requiring mitigation include, but are not limited to, marina
expansions, dredging, filling in tidal waters, construction of commercial
docks and/or structures and any other activity determined by CRMC that
has not significantly or appropriately avoided impacts on SAV.
Permanently lost or significantly altered SAV shall be replaced through
the restoration of an historical SAV habitat or the creation of a new SAV
habitat at a site approved by the Council. The ratio of restoration to loss
shall be 2:1.
Policy 2 - Activities under CRMC jurisdiction, including Residential,
Commercial, Industrial, and Public Recreational Structures (Section
300.3), Recreational Boating Facilities (Section 300.4), Sewage Treatment
and Stormwater (Section 300.6), Dredging and Dredged Materials
Disposal (Section 300.9), Filling in Tidal Waters (Section 300.10),
Aquaculture (Section 300.11), and activities undertaken in accordance
with municipal harbor regulations (Section 300.15), shall avoid and
minimize impacts on SAV habitat.
Policy 3 - The Council supports cooperative efforts to determine the
current status and identify trends in the health and abundance of SAV
species in Rhode Island using the best information as it becomes
available.
Policy 4 - The Council shall assess the potential impacts [on] SAV and its
habitat from proposed activities on a case-by-case basis. Such impacts
may include, but shall not be limited to the introduction of excess
nutrients, sedimentation, shading, and/or disruption of SAV and SAV
habitats.
Policy 5 - All impacts [on] SAV and SAV habitat shall be avoided where
possible and minimized to the extent practicable. Where the impacts are
substantial or cannot be avoided or minimized, the Council may deny the
application. The Council may exercise greater discretion if the proposed
site is adjacent to or includes a restoration site and/or the site includes the
sole source of SAV habitat.

Policy

Policy 6 - SAV habitats designated for preservation within the boundaries
of the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (NBNERR)
are identified on the SAV Habitats Designated for Preservation in
Narragansett Bay maps (January 13, 2000), available for inspection at the
Council's offices. The Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research
Reserve includes waters extending to the 18-foot depth contour around
Patience Island, the northern half of Prudence Island, portions of the
southern half of Prudence Island, and Hope Island. In areas within the
NBNERR which are designated for preservation on the above maps,
alterations and activities which impact the health and abundance of the
SAV habitat are prohibited. These maps serve to identify individual SAV
habitats, and are for general reference only; in all cases precise boundaries
shall be determined through a proper survey conducted in accordance with
these guidelines when proposals that could impact these features are being
considered.
Policy 7 - In tidal waters where applicants propose activities under
Sections 300.3, 300.4, 300.6, 300.9, 300.10, 300.11, and 300.15, and the
Council’s staff determines that SAV habitat is not present, an SAV survey
will not be required. When such activities are proposed in areas of current
or historic SAV habitat, an SAV survey shall be required.
Policy 8 - It is the policy of the Council that SAV surveys shall be
completed during peak biomass. SAV surveys shall be completed in
Narragansett Bay between July 1 and September 15. SAV surveys shall be
completed in the south shore coastal ponds and other shallow water
embayments between July 1 and August 15. SAV must be avoided where
possible by utilizing any available location and orientation which does not
require crossing the bed with the dock. In evaluating applications for dock
construction, and/or modifications to existing docks, in areas of known
SAV habitat, the Council will consider dock design features including, but
not limited to, the height and width of the dock structure, the orientation
of the dock structure, the availability of sunlight to the eelgrass habitat,
the cumulative impacts of multiple docks in the area, the disruption
caused by construction and the disruption caused by normal use and
maintenance of the dock structure. In determining the permissible design
of a facility in an SAV habitat, the Council will rely on the latest available
research such as the research findings developed by Burdick and Short
(1995) and designs appropriate for the area.

The site also is located in the Aquidneck Island SAMP area encompassing the western side of Aquidneck
Island and adjacent water. The Coastal Development Policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP apply to
the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. Table 10.1-2 provides a summary of the applicable policies of the
Aquidneck Island SAMP.

Area

Policy

Coastal greenways are intended to be vegetated with native plant
communities and provide an undeveloped transition zone between the
shoreline and adjacent upland development within the 200-foot contiguous
area of a coastal feature. Coastal greenway requirements do not apply to
municipal projects undertaken to provide public access to the shoreline and
other public amenities such as ball fields, parks, playgrounds, public boat
ramps, public fishing piers, or boating facilities.
The primary goal/standard for any development project along the shoreline
must be a requirement to provide public access to and along the shoreline
within the project property boundary.
The scenic and visual qualities of the West Side of Aquidneck Island coastal
area shall be considered and protected as a resource of public priority.
Development should be sited and designed to protect views to and along
coastal areas, minimize the alteration of natural land forms, be visually
compatible with the character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible,
restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas in accordance
with Rhode Island CRMP Section 330.
A) 25% Minimum Vegetation Requirement – Applicants must include
sustainably landscaped areas in their proposals to achieve vegetative
coverage of at least 25% of the surface area over the entire development
parcel.
B) Storm Water Management – All new development and redevelopment
proposals shall meet the storm water requirements of CRMP Section
300.6 and as specified in the most recent edition of the Rhode Island
Stormwater Manual to control peak flow rates and volumes and improve
water quality. Communities should be implementing LID practices to
meet the 2007 Cleaner Narragansett Bay Act (R.I.G.L. § 45-61.2), which
requires LID as the primary means of managing and treating storm
water.
C) Open Space – There are three aspects to open space designations of
importance. First is the choice of the land that should be set aside and
what qualities that land possesses, and second is the links between the
open space parcels that allow greenways throughout the area and
improve the value of the land and mobility for residents. The third aspect
is the design of the designated areas that will ensure their long-term
value.
D) Public Access – When applicants choose the Coastal Greenway option,
the CRMC requires that shoreline and arterial public access pathways be
provided by the applicant within the development site, as described in
Aquidneck Island SAMP Coastal Development Section 150.5.
E) Construction Setback – A construction setback of 25 feet is required for
all new and existing residential, commercial, mixed-use, and other
structures to provide for fire, safety, and maintenance purposes. The
setback is measured from the inland edge of the Coastal Greenway or
buffer.

A description of the surrounding roads and intersections is provided below.
Defense Highway/Burma Road. Defense Highway/Burma Road is a 4.4-mile north-south roadway,
connecting Stringham Road in Middletown with the Gate 17 access road to NAVSTA Newport in
Portsmouth. The roadway, which is classified as an urban collector, operates under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. Navy and is a major access point between the Navy operations and West Main Road. The road is
two lanes and “Share the Road” signs are posted, notifying motorists of the presence of bicyclists. The
speed limit along the highway varies from 25 to 35 mph.
Stringham Road. Stringham Road is a two-lane, east/west roadway connecting West Main Road to the
east, with Defense Highway/Burma Road to the west. Stringham Road is an urban collector, operating
under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Navy. The posted speed limit along the roadway is 30 miles per hour.
Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road Intersection. The intersection of Defense
Highway/Burma Road with Stringham Road forms a skewed three-way unsignalized intersection. A stop
sign is at the Defense Highway/Burma Road intersection with Stringham Road. Stringham Road and
Defense Highway/Burma Road intersect at a sharp angle (i.e., a hairpin turn), that requires drivers on
Stringham Road northbound to turn almost 180 degrees to travel southbound on Burma Road.
Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane Intersection. The intersection of Defense Highway
with Greene Lane forms a three-way unsignalized intersection. Defense Highway runs in a north/south
direction, while Greene Lane runs in an east/west direction. Greene Lane operates under stop sign control
at the intersection, while Defense Highway operates uncontrolled.

Existing Traffic Volume

Traffic volumes were collected in October 2012 during peak hours at the intersections of Defense
Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road and Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane. In
addition, total average daily traffic counts were conducted on Defense Highway near its intersection with
Greene Lane and with Stringham Road (see Figure 10.4-1). Peak hour traffic volumes for the morning
and evening are shown in Table 10.4-1, in addition to the total average daily traffic counts on Defense
Highway and Stringham Road. The morning peak traffic occurred between 7:15 a.m. and 8:15 a.m.,
while evening peak traffic occurred between 3:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Intersections were slightly busier
during the evening peak hour than the morning peak hour. As indicated in Table 10.4-1, Defense
Highway carries a an average daily traffic count of 5,406 vehicles north of Greene Lane, and Stringham
Road carries an average daily traffic count of 6,246 vehicles west of West Main Street.

Roadway Intersection Level of Service

A capacity analysis was conducted to characterize the LOS at intersections evaluated along the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, and an additional length of Defense Highway north of the surplus property.
LOS is a qualitative measure that describes general operating conditions based on factors such as speed,
travel times, and delays. LOS is reported on a scale of ‘A’ to ‘F.’ ‘A’ represents the best operating
conditions with free-flowing traffic and ‘F’ represents the worst operating conditions with significant
delays.
The traffic study looked at two intersections along Defense Highway (see Table 10.4-2). The Defense
Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane intersection is currently not signalized. Greene Lane operates
under stop-sign control at this intersection. During both morning and evening peak hours, this
intersection operates at LOS C. Similarly, the intersection of Defense Highway and Stringham Road is
not signalized, with Defense Highway operating under stop-sign control. The northbound approach to the
intersection currently operates at LOS A during both morning and evening peak hours. The northeast
approach (the right turn from Defense Highway/Burma Road to Stringham Road), currently operates at
LOS F during morning peak hours, and LOS D during evening peak hours.

Safety Conditions

Accident data from January 2010 to October 2012 were reviewed for the Defense Highway/Burma Road
segment between East Passage and the Middletown town line. During this period, a total of 16 accidents
were recorded at the intersection of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road. Five of the
accidents were collisions with objects, four were rear-end collisions, three involved collisions with an
animal, 2 involved the loss of control of the vehicle, one was an angle crash, and one involved
sideswiping (Pare Corporation 2013).
A speed study was conducted on Defense Highway north of Greene Lane. Defense Highway has a posted
speed of 35 mph at this location and 90 percent of vehicles traveled above the posted speed limit. The
average speed of vehicles on this roadway was 41 mph (Pare Corporation 2013).

10.4.5

Public Transportation

The RIPTA provides fixed-route bus service throughout Rhode Island, including Aquidneck Island. Bus
routes near the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are described below (RIPTA 2013a).
•

Route 60 - This route provides service between Newport and Providence via Middletown
and Portsmouth. The route originates at the Gateway Center in Newport and travels
along West and East Main Roads parallel to Defense Highway but does not provide direct
access to the corridor (RIPTA 2013b).

•

Route 64 – This route connects Newport with the University of Rhode Island in
Kingston. The route begins at Gateway Center and travels north to Third Street, where it
passes in front of the former Naval Hospital property and provides service to the Naval
Undersea Warfare Center via Gate 17 near Defense Highway but does not provide direct
access to the corridor (RIPTA 2013d).

10.5 Environmental Management

This section summarizes the existing conditions regarding hazardous waste, hazardous materials, and the
ER Program for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

10.5.1

Hazardous Waste

No hazardous waste is known to be generated at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009).

Draft EIS

10-18

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

10.5.2

Hazardous Materials

10.5.2.1 Hazardous Material Control
Hazardous materials are not known to be used at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, and the Tier II
Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory report for 2011 does not list hazardous materials for the
property. Diesel fuel is listed as being used for an emergency generator at Building 694, which is close to
the property but outside of the surplus property boundary, in the general Midway Pier area (see Figure
10.5-1) (NAVSTA Newport 2012d). The fuel pipeline that runs along Defense Highway was cleaned in
2000 (see Section 10.5.2.2) and contains no material.
The installation spill log for 2002 through 2011 lists occasional small spills of vehicle-related substances
such as motor oil, hydraulic fluid, and antifreeze along Defense Highway The exact locations of those
spills were not listed and the spills did not meet the criteria for reporting to the National Response Center
and RIDEM. A spill of aviation fuel in excess of 5 gallons occurred along Defense Highway in 2008
from a Defense Fuel Support Point fuel line. The spill was cleaned up and reported to the National
Response Center and RIDEM (NAVSTA Newport 2012e).
10.5.2.2 Underground Storage Tanks
There are no active USTs directly associated with the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009). An active 1,000-gallon UST used for diesel fuel is associated with
Building 694 (Aerostar 2012) in the general Midway Pier area (see Figure 10.5-1) and just outside of the
boundary of the property to be disposed.
Two former USTs were associated with former Building 71, which is one of three fuel-operations
buildings located in an area near Midway Pier that was investigated and remediated between 1995 and
2008. Building 70 was the Midway Booster Pump House, Building 71 was Boiler House No. 3, and
Building 111’s purpose is not known (Tetra Tech EC, Inc. 2008b; see Figure 10.5-1). The USTs
associated with Building 71 consisted of a 75,000-gallon UST used for fuel oil and a 5,000-gallon UST
used for diesel fuel. Building 71 and the two USTs were removed in 1995. At the time of removal, the
75,000-gallon UST was determined to have leaked, and subsequent soil investigations and removals were
conducted between 2005 and 2008 to remove the contaminated soil. Additional areas of contaminated
soil associated with former Building 70 (demolished in 1999 along with Building 111) and Building 71
also were investigated and removed between 2005 and 2008. Confirmatory sampling gauged the progress
of the removals. Subsequent additional remedial work addressed elevated levels of TPH that remained in
the area of the 75,000-gallon UST following the initial removal of contaminated soil. The additional
work consisted of in situ chemical oxidation to treat and reduce TPHs in soil and the installing and
sampling of monitoring wells to assess groundwater for TPH and monitor remedial progress (Tetra Tech
EC, Inc. 2008c). During removal of contaminated soil in the area of former Building 70 in 2011, the
Navy and RIDEM discovered a pipe containing petroleum product. The removal and disposal of
contaminated soils was completed and the pipe was capped; however, additional groundwater monitoring
was suspended until further investigations of the pipe and nearby fuel pipeline, discussed below, can be
completed (Dorocz 2013).
A 6-mile length of underground fuel pipeline runs along Defense Highway, from the intersection of
Defense Highway and Stringham Road to Pier 1, south of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (see
Figure 10.5-1). The pipeline transferred various fuels from tanks at Tank Farms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to shipfueling stations at the naval piers along the shoreline. The pipeline was cleaned, pressure-tested, and
abandoned in place in 2000. In conjunction with that effort, the 50 concrete piping chambers located
along the 6-mile span of pipeline also were cleaned and demolished. The chambers provided access to
valves, expansion joints, and reducers associated with the fuel pipeline. After the chambers were

Draft EIS

10-19

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

demolished, soil near the pipeline penetrations in the areas of the demolished chambers was sampled and
tested for petroleum-related constituents. Soil exceeding RIDEM standards was excavated and removed
in 2008 (Tetra Tech EC, Inc. 2008a). Subsequent investigation of the fuel pipeline chambers identified
other petroleum contamination along various portions of Defense Highway, including oil that was found
across Defense Highway from the former Midway Pier. The oil will require cleanup before groundwater
monitoring and remediation in the general area can be completed (Dorocz 2013).
Also in 2000, the Midway Fuel Pier approach pipe (which linked earlier fueling operations at Midway
Pier with the main fuel pipeline along Defense Highway) was cleaned and removed. As part of removal
activities at Midway Pier, petroleum-contaminated soil at the west end of the pier was removed (Tetra
Tech EC, Inc. 2008b).
10.5.2.3 Aboveground Storage Tanks
There are no current or former ASTs associated with the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009).
10.5.2.4 Oil/Water Separators
A former OWS associated with Building 70 was removed when the building was demolished in 1999 (see
Figure 10.5-1). At the time of removal, soils were tested near the OWS discharge line and petroleumcontaminated soils were identified. The discharge line and contaminated soils were removed in 2006
(U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). There are no other OWSs associated with the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property.
10.5.2.5 Asbestos-Containing Materials
A steam line runs parallel to the underground fuel pipeline along Defense Highway (see Figure 10.5-1).
When the fuel pipeline was cleaned in 2000 and the 50 concrete piping chambers were evaluated for
demolition, asbestos pipe insulation was observed on the steam lines in the piping chambers. Before
demolishing the piping chambers, the asbestos was removed from the steam lines in the chambers. It can
be assumed that the inaccessible lengths of underground steam line that run along Defense Highway
similarly contain asbestos pipe wrap (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). There is no known ACM
associated with the former Midway Pier.
10.5.2.6 Lead-Based Paint/Lead
There is no known LBP or lead at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, although the pier has not been
assessed for it.
10.5.2.7 Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)
There are no known sources of PCBs at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. There are no
transformers associated with the portion of the Navy electrical line that extends along Defense Highway
near the property (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009).
10.5.2.8 Pesticides
Pesticides likely have been applied in the past at selected portions of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property as necessary for nuisance pest and vegetation control. Pesticides are applied at NAVSTA
Newport in accordance with the Integrated Pest Management Plan (Geo-Marine 2009 [see Section
3.5.1.2]).

10.5.2.9 Radioactive Materials
There are no radioactive materials associated with the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009).
10.5.2.10 Radon
Radon surveys have not been conducted in the area of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009). Radon levels in general are low throughout NAVSTA Newport (see
Section 3.5.1.2).

10.5.3

Medical Waste

Medical wastes are not generated anywhere at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

10.5.4

Environmental Restoration Program

There is one ER Program site located near the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, IRP Site 13. Tank
Farm 5 is located along the eastern side of Defense Highway and just south of Greene Lane. It is not
immediately adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property but is separated from the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property by Defense Highway (see Figure 10.5-1). Tank Farm 5, consisting of 85
acres, was operated by the Navy from the 1940s to 1974 to store fuel. It consisted of eleven 2.5-milliongallon USTs and other structures and areas. Tank Farm 5 was leased to the DESC from 1974 to 1998 for
petroleum fuel storage and distribution. The tanks were cleaned and ballasted between 1994 and 1997
and subsequently demolished in place between 1998 and 1999. Large quantities of tank bottom sludges
were disposed of on-site and some were burned on-site. Various environmental investigations have been
conducted since 1983 and the tank farm is currently being addressed under both the CERCLA IRP and
RIDEM UST programs. TPHs and lead have been found in certain soils at the site. A former OWS has
been demolished and some AOCs of contaminated soil have been excavated (Tetra Tech NUS 2009).
The ROD was finalized in 2013 and the remaining remedial activities are scheduled to be completed by
2016. Long-term groundwater monitoring will continue into the foreseeable future after the remaining
contaminated soil is remediated.

10.6 Air Quality
10.6.1

Existing Air Quality

Section 3.6 discusses regional air quality and applicable regulations and requirements. The CAA is the
primary federal statute governing the control of air quality. The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is in
the Town of Middletown, Newport County, RI. This location is within the Providence, RI air quality
region, which encompasses all of Rhode Island and is currently in attainment for all NAAQS. The state is
under the jurisdiction of RIDEM for air quality.

10.6.2

Existing Emissions

As discussed in Section 10.4, a traffic count of 5,406 vehicles was recorded on the segment of Defense
Highway/Burma Road north of Greene Lane, and a traffic count of 6,246 vehicles was recorded on
Stringham Road west of West Main Road in 2012. Annual criteria pollutant emissions from traffic along
the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property were estimated based on the average daily traffic counts on these
two roadway segments and the vehicle miles traveled along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property over a
year (see Table 10.6-1). Emissions of HAPs and GHG would be minimal. These emissions represent nonstationary sources; no stationary sources are located along the corridor.
According to data collected for the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels
at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013), Defense Highway receives much less traffic than

Draft EIS

10-23

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

West Main Road, which runs parallel to Defense Highway to the east—average daily traffic counts at two
locations on West Main Road were 26,366 vehicles and 22,136 vehicles, respectively. It is therefore
assumed that Defense Highway and Stringham Road are not frequently travelled compared with other
roadways and is not a significant source of emissions in the region.

10.7 Noise

Ambient sound levels are a function of a variety of sources: local traffic, barking dogs, birds, insects,
lawnmowers, children playing, and the interaction of the wind with groundcover, buildings, trees, shrubs,
power lines, etc. Sound levels vary with time of day, wind speed and direction, and the level of human
activity. The acoustic environment around the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is mainly characterized
by traffic noise during daytime hours.
Table 10.7-1 presents the minimum and maximum hourly average Leq sound levels measured in 2010 at
the nearest monitoring stations. Monitoring station LT-1 is the measurement location closest to the
northern portion of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, and LT-2 is the monitoring location closest to
the southern portion of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. See Figure 3.7-1 in Section 3.7 for
measurement locations.

10.8 Infrastructure and Utilities

This section summarizes the existing infrastructure, utilities, and solid waste management for the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property.

10.8.1

Water Supply

NAVSTA Newport owns and maintains a 10-inch and a 12-inch water main along the length of Defense
Highway (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
The City of Newport owns and maintains the water distribution system in Middletown and the Melville
area of Portsmouth that does not service NAVSTA Newport. (See further discussion of the City of
Newport water supply in Section 6.8.1.)

10.8.2

Wastewater

Wastewater is collected from the Melville area of Portsmouth, the Town of Middletown and NAVSTA
Newport for treatment in the City of Newport wastewater treatment plant through a force main and series
of pump stations located along Defense Highway. This force main and an abandoned force main are
owned and maintained by NAVSTA Newport (Carlson 2012).
NAVSTA Newport and the Town of Middletown own and maintain sanitary sewer lines within their
respective jurisdictions. Currently, the Town of Portsmouth has no centralized wastewater collection or
treatment infrastructure. Portions of the town manage wastewater through individual septic systems. The
Melville area of Portsmouth is serviced by the City of Newport’s wastewater collection and treatment
system.
The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant is located on J.T. Connell Highway and its licensed
capacity is 10.7 mgd. The City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plant treats wastewater from the City
of Newport, the Town of Middletown, the Melville area of Portsmouth, and NAVSTA Newport. In 2012,
the plant treated 9.46 mgd of wastewater (City of Newport Department of Finance 2012e).

10.8.3

Storm Water

The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property varies in elevation from 30 feet amsl at its northern land and
eastern land boundary, to sea level at its southern and western land boundaries. The slope of the corridor
property is from east to west toward Narragansett Bay (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Storm water
runoff from Defense Highway sheet flows to a series of roadside swales and a drainage collection system
and intermediate culverts located along the highway, which convey the storm water towards Narragansett
Bay (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. August 2011).

10.8.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
National Grid is the primary electrical utility providing connection and distribution services on
Aquidneck Island. This is a user-supported utility service, and the customers pay for the service and
electricity supplied. An overhead electrical line runs along the Defense Highway (RKG Associates, Inc.
et al. 2011).
Table 4.8-1 in Section 4.8 provides the electrical usage for the City of Newport, Town of Middletown and
Town of Portsmouth between 2009 through 2011.

Draft EIS

10-25

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Natural Gas
The City of Newport and the surrounding region is serviced by National Grid. This is a user-supported
utility service, and the customers pay for service and natural gas supplied. There are currently no gas lines
to the property (RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011).
Table 4.8-2 in Section 4.8 provides the natural gas usage for the City of Newport, Town of Middletown
and Town of Portsmouth in 2010 and 2011.

10.8.5

Solid Waste

Solid wastes are not routinely generated at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The former Midway
Pier is not in use and, except for litter, solid waste is not generated on Defense Highway .

10.9 Cultural Resources

This section describes the existing cultural resources and historic properties that are located within the
APE for the proposed action along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The boundary of the APE is
the same as the boundary of the property that will be disposed. Cultural resources within the APE would
consist of archaeological sites and archaeologically sensitive areas, and architectural resources.
Archaeological and architectural resources are discussed in greater detail in Sections 10.9.1 and 10.9.2,
respectively. Native American resources are discussed in Section 10.9.3. Those resources that were
determined historic properties are discussed in greater detail in Section 10.9.4.
In general, the APE was considered sensitive for cultural resources that were associated with a variety of
cultural periods of human occupation. Previously recorded archaeological sites or archaeologically
sensitive areas were identified in the vicinity of the APE and indicate prehistoric and historic settlement
and/or use of the general project area. Extant buildings and structures in the vicinity of the APE
document more recent occupation and use of the area from the mid-nineteenth century to the present,
including the mid-nineteenth century construction of the Old Colony and Newport Railroad that parallels
the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

10.9.1

Archaeological Resources

The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation conducted within the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property consisted of the excavation of a total of 22 shovel tests, as well as an intensive pedestrian survey
in the vicinity of the location of the previously reported Site RI-942.1. Because of the presence of road
shoulders, ditches, overhead and underground utility lines and the rail line of the former Old Colony and
Newport Railroad located along much of the Defense Highway, shovel tests were confined to areas where
adjacent land extended away from the disturbed road shoulders, rail line and utility corridors, and were
designed primarily to retrieve baseline soil data and determine if intact soils might be present. None of
the shovel tests contained artifacts (Gould and LeeDecker 2014).
Generally, the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property showed evidence of disturbance by
previous cutting and filling activities, and the generally flat nature of the areas investigated appeared to
have been artificially created by grading. No intact soil profiles were identified in any of the shovel tests
although a few of the test locations could not be excavated by shovels or with augers to subsoil because of
rock-laden fill. Based on these results, the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property appears to
have been extensively disturbed by the previous construction of the roadway, the overhead and
underground utility lines, the railway, demolition of shoreside structures, and other development by the
Navy in parcels adjacent to, but outside the APE. No archaeological sites were identified within the APE
at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and no further archaeological investigations of the APE at the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property were recommended (Gould and LeeDecker 2014). The Navy
consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the lack of archaeological sensitivity of the Midway

Pier/Greene Lane property and the Rhode Island SHPO concurred that no further archaeological
investigations of this area were required (Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b).

10.9.2

Architectural Resources

The 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update conducted within the APE at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property concluded that the Midway Pier and Greene Lane were not eligible for the
NRHP (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014). Although the pier was associated with the build-up of Newport by
the Navy during World War II and was important in providing a second fueling station for ships at the
Naval Operating Base, the majority of the pier is no longer extant and only the earth and stone fill remain.
Furthermore, the pier lacks context, since all other associated buildings and structures have been
demolished. Greene Lane is considered part of a larger network of roads in the vicinity of the APE and
does not have significant associations to render this resource NRHP-eligible (Groesbeck and Bedford
2014). The Navy consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO on the evaluation of the Midway Pier and
Greene Lane structures for NRHP-eligibility and the Rhode Island SHPO concurred that neither of these
structures were NRHP-eligible (Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b).

10.9.3

Native American Resources

The Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian tribes regarding Native American
resources within the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property: the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the
Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for
copies of consultation letters). Consultation remains open.

10.9.4

NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties

The 2013 Phase I archaeological investigation and the 2013 architectural survey and evaluation update
conducted for the proposed action resulted in determination that no historic properties are present within
the APE (Gould and LeeDecker 2014, Groesbeck and Bedford 2014). The Navy consulted with the
Rhode Island SHPO on this determination of and the Rhode Island SHPO concurred that no historic
properties were present within the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (Lin 2013; Sanderson
2013b).

10.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the existing topography, geology, and soils along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. This section also includes a discussion of existing conditions for bathymetry and marine
sediment present in the Narragansett Bay off-shore of the former Midway Pier.

10.10.1 Topography
The topography of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property generally decreases from north to south.
Elevations range from approximately 30 feet amsl at its northern land boundary and eastern land
boundary, to sea level at its southern and western land boundaries. The nearest body of water other than
Narragansett Bay is the Lawton Valley reservoir, which is located approximately 3,200 feet east from the
northern end of the corridor and east of Main Street.

10.10.2 Geology
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property lies within the New England Physiographic Province (USGS
2002). It is located on the Rhode Island Formation of the stratified Narragansett Bay Group of the
Pennsylvanian period (323 to 290 million years ago). The Narragansett Bay Group rocks are part of the
Esmond-Dedham subterrane of the Southeastern New England Avalon zone. The Esmond-Dedham
Subterrane Narragansett Bay Group is deposited upon older rocks of both West Bay and East Bay parts of
the Esmond-Dedham subterrane. The Narragansett Bay Group – Rhode Island Formation consists of

meta-sandstone, meta-conglomerate, schist, carbonaceous schist, and graphite. Plant fossils are common
(USGS 2013).
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is not near any known fault locations (USGS 2005). According
to the USGS, only one earthquake has ever been recorded as possibly being centered within the State of
Rhode Island. This earthquake was recorded on February 27, 1883 (USGS 2009). No other earthquakes
have been recorded within the State of Rhode Island. The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is located
within an earthquake zone where, in a 50-year period, there is only a 2 percent chance of an earthquake
occurring with peak acceleration (ground movement) of 8 percent to 10 percent acceleration due to
gravity (%g). It takes a peak acceleration of 10%g to cause damage to buildings; therefore, there is
minimal risk of an earthquake that would cause damage to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (USGS
2009).

10.10.3 Soils
10.10.3.1 Soil Types
The soil types present on the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are listed in Table 10.10-1 and

Newport Silt Loam, 3 to 8% Slopes (NeB)
Newport silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes, is suitable for community development but is limited by the slow or
very slow permeability of the substratum. Roads and streets need careful design to prevent frost-heaving
(USDA 1981). The soils are well-drained and potential highly erodible. Excavation is difficult and there
is a high probability of hydraulically restrictive lower layers (USDA 2012).
Pittstown Silt Loam, 0 to 3% Slopes (PmA)
Pittstown silt loam, 0 to 3% slopes, is suitable for community development but is limited by the high
water table and the slow permeability of the substratum. Roads and streets need careful design to prevent
frost-heaving (USDA 1981).
Pittstown Silt Loam, 3 to 8% Slopes (PmB)
Pittstown silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes, is suitable for community development but is limited by the seasonal
high water table and the slow permeability of the substratum. Roads and streets need careful design to
prevent frost-heaving (USDA 1981). The soils are moderately well-drained and potentially highly
erodible. Excavation is difficult and there is a high probability of hydraulically restrictive lower layers
(USDA 2012).
10.10.3.2 Soil Characteristics and Limitations
As indicated in Section 3.10, the USDA rates soils according to characteristics that could limit
development (see Table 10.10-2). These characteristics include the following:

Erosion Potential
The soil erosion potential for Newport silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes and Newport silt loam, 8 to 15% slopes is
moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at a depth of 24 inches to 30 inches, which means the soils
are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff.
The soil erosion potential for Pittstown silt loam, 0 to 3% slopes and Pittstown silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes is
moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.28 at a depth of 24 inches to 30 inches, which means they are
moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff.
Hydric Soils
None of the soils listed in Table 10.10-1 are hydric. The following soils were listed as dominantly nonhydric, although non-hydric soil can contain hydric inclusions:
•

Newport silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes

•

Pittstown silt loam, 0 to 3 % slopes

•

Pittstown silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes.

For instance, Pittstown silt loam, 0 to 3% slopes and Pittstown silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes are listed as
partially hydric (USDA 2012).
Constructability
In general, the severe restrictions included in Table 10.10-2 could represent a major increase in
construction effort and special design; or intensive maintenance could be required. In general, the
moderate restrictions included in Table 10.10-2 are unfavorable, but these limitations can be overcome or
minimized by special planning or design.

10.10.4 Bathymetry
The bathymetric contours for the Narragansett Bay offshore of the former Midway Pier along the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property range from 0 to 20 feet to 20 to 40 feet (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.10-2). The
area around the former Midway Pier is within a 0- to 20-foot bathymetric contour.

10.10.5 Marine Sediment
Eleven sediment types have been identified in Narragansett Bay, ranging from clayey silt to coarse gravel
(NBNERR 2009 [see Chapter 6, Figure 6.10-3]). The distribution of these sediment types depends on two
key factors: currents and circulation patterns. These factors generally result in finer grained materials,
such as sand-silt-clay and clayey silt, being located in the middle and upper portions of the Bay and in
protected coves and harbors (Raposa n.d.). Coarser sediments, mostly sandy, are found in the lower
reaches of the Bay and in constricted areas where current velocities are greater. The most prevalent
sediment types found in Narragansett Bay are clay-silt and sand-silt-clay sediments (Raposa n.d.).
Offshore of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, within approximately 0.1 miles of the shoreline,
marine sediment types are largely unsampled (see Chapter 6, Figure 6.10-3). Farther out, the dominant
sediment type is clay-silt, with a larger area of sand located between the former Midway Pier and Weaver
Cove.

10.11 Water Resources

The following sections provide a summary of the existing conditions and physical characteristics of water
resources found in the vicinity of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

10.11.1 Surface Water
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is located in the Upper East Passage and Lower East Passage
subwatersheds (HUC 010900040907 and 010900040909, respectively) of the Narragansett Bay
watershed. The Upper East Passage subwatershed includes a small portion of Middletown and a larger
portion of Portsmouth and drains 14.58 square miles. It consists mostly of forested and residential areas
(University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center 2013c). The Lower East Passage subwatershed
includes the southwestern portion of the island and drains approximately 11.02 square miles. The
majority of the watershed consists of residential areas (University of Rhode Island Environmental Data
Center 2013b).
No surface water resources are found at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property; however, two surface
waters are adjacent to the property: Narragansett Bay and Gomes Brook (see Figure 10.11-1. Because of
the topography of the area, the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property drains to the southwest.
Portions of the surplus property directly abut Narragansett Bay, specifically along the seaward portion of
the property, from the town line south to Gomes Brook (see Figure 10.11-1).

10.11.2 Water Quality
Gomes Brook is classified as a Class A water (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014) and a Type 4 multipurpose water.
Class A waters are designated for primary and secondary contact recreational activities and for fish and
wildlife habitat and have excellent aesthetic value. It was not included on the State of Rode Island 2012
303(d) List – List of Impaired Waters Final as being impaired (RIDEM 2012a).
For Narragansett Bay in general, due to the densely populated areas in the upper Narragansett Bay and its
major rivers, a general water quality gradient has been created along the Bay’s north-south axis

(Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009). Sources of pollution are largely concentrated in the Bay’s
upper reaches and range from public wastewater treatment facility discharges, storm water and CSO
outlets, and urban runoff from densely populated areas (Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009).
Pollution typically decreases toward the mouth of the estuary due to dilution from seawater coupled with
fewer point sources of pollution.
Wastewater treatment facilities are a major source of nitrogen in Narragansett Bay, and those facilities
that treat CSOs are also major sources of pathogens and other contaminants during periods of heavy rains,
resulting in discharges to the Bay and its tributaries (Narragansett Bay Estuary Program 2009).

10.11.3 Groundwater
Groundwater in the east bay section of Rhode Island is generally provided by aquifers in till and bedrock.
Depth to the water table varies along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property from 1.5 to 3 feet in areas
underlain by Pittstown soils, to less than 6 feet in areas underlain by Newport loams (University of Rhode
Island Cooperative Extension and Rhode Island Health Source Water Assessment Program 2003).
Groundwater in the vicinity of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is classified by RIDEM as GA
(RIDEM 2010d). As described in Section 3.11, GA groundwater resources are designated as suitable for
public or private drinking water use without treatment and are not described under GAA groundwater
resources. No wellhead protection areas exist around the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property; the closest
wellhead protection area is located approximately 3.0 miles to the southeast (RIDEM 2010d).
Because of the former fueling operations at the former Midway Pier, groundwater quality in this portion
of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property has been documented as containing levels of total petroleum
hydrocarbons (TPH) above the RIDEM reporting limits (Tetra Tech EC, Inc. 2008c). Between October
2007 and March 2008, five groundwater monitoring wells were installed to determine the impacts on
groundwater as a result of the former 75,000-gallon UST located at the former Building 70 near the pier
(Tetra Tech EC, Inc. 2008c). Additional groundwater monitoring will be conducted following
investigation and contaminated soil removal along various portions of Defense Highway (Dorocz 2013
[see Section 10.5 for additional discussion]).

10.11.4 Floodplains
FEMA-delineated 100-year floodplains exist within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and are
associated with the Gomes Brook as well as small areas associated with Narragansett Bay (see Figure
10.11-1). Approximately 0.7 acres of 100-year floodplains exist within the property boundaries. The
Defense Highway near the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be slightly inundated during a 100year flood event, and coastal flooding with wave action hazard would be anticipated along the coastline of
Narragansett Bay (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).

10.11.5 Wetlands
Approximately 0.35 acres of estuarine and marine wetlands exist along the shoreline (see Figure 10.11-2).
These wetlands are discussed further in Section 10.12.4. Other estuarine and marine wetlands are located
immediately adjacent to the corridor, along the coast.

10.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the existing vegetation and wildlife, including threatened and endangered
species and significant wildlife habitat, along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

10.12.1 Vegetation
Habitat cover along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property comprises a range of cover types (see Figure
10.12-1). At approximately 5.2 acres (49 percent), developed land covers almost half of the most area. At
approximately 5.5 acres (51 percent), old field habitat covers the remaining half of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property (see Table 10.12-1).

Old Field
This community was represented by various stages of succession following disturbance. While it is
unknown how mature the old field community is at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, it can be
assumed that it would include herbaceous species like sweet vernal grass, orchard grass, pathrush,
goldenrods, clover, and knapweed. Vines and woody vegetation likely includes some of the following:
Japanese honeysuckle, Allegheny blackberry, eastern red cedar, apple, and hawthorne.

10.12.2 Wildlife
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property spans approximately 0.8 miles along the coast, thus providing
ample opportunity for a variety of terrestrial mammals, birds, and aquatic wildlife.
Terrestrial Mammals
Mammals occurring along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are limited to those species adapted to
urban/suburban conditions, such as the eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), common raccoon
(Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Small
mammals such as the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), meadow vole (Microtus
pennsylvanicus), and woodchuck (Marmota monax) are also likely present along the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property.
Marine Mammals
Harbor seals have been frequently documented in Coddington Cove and could potentially visit other areas
of the installation. No other marine mammal species have been documented as occurring in the Bay near
the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009). Additional discussion on
marine mammals occurring in Narragansett Bay is included in Section 3.12.1.2.
Herpetofauna
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property provides wetlands and forest habitat for herpetofauna. Species of
herpetofauna common to the state of Rhode Island and the islands of Narragansett Bay include the dusky
salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), Fowler’s toad (Bufo fowleri), green frog (Rana clamitans), black rat
snake (Elaphe obsoleta) and the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) (NBNERR 2009; RIDEM
2005). Characteristic habitats for herpetofauna species are ponds, forested and shrubland wetlands, and
woodland pools.
Benthos
The presence of benthic species is likely within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property because it
supports aquatic eelgrass beds and is close to the Bay. Common benthic species in Narragansett Bay
include annelids (Phylum Annelida), nematodes (Phylum Nematoda), gastropods (Class Gastropoda),
bivalves (Class Bivalvia), and mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) (Frithsen 1989). Benthic fauna may be found
in the tidal flats and intertidal zones sediments.

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Avian Species
A discussion of avian species common to the areas around the surplus properties, including the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, and nearby IBAs is provided in Section 3.12.1.2.
Finfish
A discussion of finfish common to the areas around the surplus properties, including the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, is provided in Section 6.12.2.
Shellfish and Crustacea
As indicated in Section 3.12.1.2, species typical of Narragansett Bay include quahog, soft-shelled clam,
mussel, American lobster, and squid. All of these species are harvested from the bay. These species may
potentially occur off the shore of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic 2001).
A 20-acre aquaculture venture, Salt Water Farms, is located approximately 400 feet from the shoreline
near Vigilant Street at its closest point, approximately 350 feet northwest of the former Midway Fueling
Pier (Beutel 2013). Salt Water Farms is the largest producer of oysters in the state of Rhode Island and
currently holds a 10-year aquaculture limited lease. The farm harvests primarily oysters (around 90
percent of their crop), along with some mussels and sugar kelp seaweed. Suspended long lines are
submerged at 6 feet below the water surface and distanced 40 feet apart. The lines are also marked at the
water surface with yellow and black buoys for navigational purposes. There is no limitation to
recreational boating or recreational or commercial fishing in the area of the suspended long lines.

10.12.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
As indicated in Section 3.12.2, agency-review letters were sent to the USFWS and NMFS, as well as to
RIDEM, in order to obtain updated information regarding listed species. A response from the USFWS
received on February 13, 2013, indicated that no federally listed or proposed threatened or endangered
species or critical habitat are known to occur within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (Chapman
2013). However, since that time, the northern long-eared bat has been listed as a federally threatened
species under the ESA, effective May 4, 2015 and USFWS issued a final 4(d) rule on January 14, 2016.
NMFS stated that certain New England coastal waters support various listed species, including sea turtles,
and five distinct population segments (DPSs) of Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus)
(Colligan 2013). As stated in Section 7.12.3, no listed marine mammals are expected to exist in the
project area. A response from RIDEM received on February 12, 2013, indicated that no state-listed rare,
threatened, or endangered species are located within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (Jordan
2013).
See Section 6.12.2 for a discussion of threatened and endangered species potentially occurring in
Narragansett Bay offshore of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
A discussion of the Navy’s ongoing informal consultation with the USFWS regarding the northern longeared bat is discussed in Section 3.12.1.3.
During the spring, summer, and fall months, the northern long-eared bat is likely to use forested edge
habitat; spaces under tree bark, in cavities, or in crevices of both live and dead trees; coastlines; and/or
abandoned buildings within NAVSTA Newport for roost sites, foraging, and/or travel. Suitable roost trees
are defined as those that have a DBH greater than 3 inches. Bats are also known to roost in structures
such as barns and sheds when suitable roost trees are not available. Summer foraging habitat consists of a
variety of forested habitats, including both dense forests and loose aggregates of trees. In addition, bats
may forage in adjoining lands such as wetlands, old fields, and agricultural lands (USFWS 2013a).

The Navy conducted various passive acoustic monitoring surveys for bats between 2009 and 2013 at
NAVSTA Newport in support of a proposed 20 MW wind energy facility within the NAVSTA Newport
installation. The general survey areas were coastal areas at the southern end of the station (such as the
Bishop Rock peninsula and a coastal met tower) and Tank Farms 4 and 5. Results for northern long-eared
bats are summarized in Table 6.12-4. The 2009 and 2010 surveys did not report results for northern longeared bats, which was not a named species for those surveys. During a survey conducted in the spring
and late summer of 2011, northern long-eared bats were detected at two of the three locations monitored:
the coastal met tower and a 1.5-meter-high stake at Tank Farm 4. The third survey location used in 2011
consisted of a met tower at Tank Farm 4, at which the northern long-eared bat was not detected (Tetra
Tech, Inc. 2011c). Fifteen northern long-eared bat calls were reported for the 2013 survey: three calls at
Bishop Rock peninsula, two calls at a stake location at Tank Farm 4, five calls at a stream location at
Tank Farm 4, and five calls at a wetland location at Tank Farm 5 (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014b, 2014c). The
closest monitoring location is located within Tank Farm 5, approximately 0.3 miles from the southern
boundary of the surplus property. No monitoring was conducted in 2012 (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014b).
Active acoustic monitoring for bats was conducted in summer 2013 along transects in the same general
areas of the station—coastal areas at the southern end of the station and Tank Farms 4 and 5. Northern
long-eared bat calls were not specifically reported as a result of the active acoustic monitoring. The Navy
conducted mist netting for bats over seven nights in July 2013 at various locations, including three
locations adjacent to or near the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property: one adjacent to the northern end of
the property, one adjacent to the southern end of the property (near the intersection of Greene Lane and
Defense Highway), and one within the interior of Tank Farm 5. Because few bats were caught, and none
were northern long-eared bats, radiotelemetry for northern long-eared bats has not been performed.
Echolocation bat passes that were documented in conjunction with the mist-netting survey did not
attribute any of the passes to the genus Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014b).
The Navy conducted a field survey in December 2014 of the vegetation at Tank Farms 4 and 5 and three
PPV housing sites, to evaluate the presence of summer roosting habitat for northern long-eared bats. The
closest site to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is Tank Farm 5, located just across the Defense
Highway from the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The Greene Lane Housing Site, located across the
Defense Highway, north of the northern end of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, is also discussed
below.
Suitable summer roosting habitat was considered to be trees with one or more of the following
characteristics:

•

DBH greater than 3 inches,

•

Thick peeling, flaking, and loose bark,

•

Knot holes,

•

Suitable summer roosting habitat was considered to consist of high-quality forest stands of mature and
successional species, with roosting trees having the general characteristics listed above. Potentially
suitable summer roosting habitat was defined as smaller stands of trees with fewer roosting
characteristics. About 26 percent (17 acres) of the 65-acre Tank Farm 5 consists of suitable or potentially
suitable summer roosting habitat for the northern long-eared bat. Approximately 14.6 acres were deemed
to be suitable summer roosting habitat and approximately 2.4 were deemed to be potentially suitable.
Suitable habitat is located along eastern and southern portions of Tank Farm 5 (see Figure 10.12-3). All
six of the ornamental trees at the Greene Lane Housing site were determined to be potentially suitable
summer roosting habitat.
The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding the potential presence of the northern long-eared bat at the
surplus properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston 2015a). The Navy received a response from the USFWS via
electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal consultation and provide additional information
about the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015).
The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b).
Additional discussion regarding the status of ESA consultation for the northern long-eared bat is
presented in Section 11.2.3. The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding the potential presence of the
northern long-eared bat at the surplus properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston 2015a). The Navy received a
response from the USFWS via electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal consultation and
provide additional information about the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern longeared bat (von Oettingen 2015). The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts on August 27,
2015 (Preston 2015b). To date, USFWS has not provided a response, and further informal consultation
with the USFWS on the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat is ongoing.
ESA consultation for northern long-eared bat is ongoing.

10.12.4 Significant Habitats
Based on a review of the Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program database, RIDEM’s Division of
Planning and Development has indicated that no unique natural communities or other significant wildlife
communities exist at or near the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (Jordan 2013). However, the
following aquatic communities have been documented.
Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
Approximately 1.1 acres of eelgrass habitat have been identified within the property boundaries of the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, and approximately 1.8 acres of eelgrass have been mapped within
200 feet of the surplus property (RIDEM, Narragansett Bay Program, and RI CRMC 2003; Applied
Science Associates 2011 [see Figure 10.12-2]). In addition to eelgrass, widgeon grass has been
previously documented at this surplus property, likely in similar environments as eelgrass (U.S.
Department of the Navy 2009); however, digital data from the state of Rhode Island did not confirm this.
The eelgrass habitat is found towards the southern end of the property immediately to the south of the
former Midway Pier. Eelgrass can provide habitat for up to 40 different species of fish, as well as
waterfowl, crustaceans, and benthos.
Wetlands
As noted in Section 10.12.1, approximately 0.35 acres of estuarine and marine wetlands are found on the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

11 Midway Pier/Greene Lane Environmental Consequences
11.1 Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

This section describes the potential land use impacts resulting from disposal and reuse of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes
an examination of site-specific land uses, direct and indirect 19 impacts on surrounding existing land uses,
consistency with local zoning and land use plans, and consistency with the enforceable policies of the RI
CRMP.
The study area comprises the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and land within 0.25 miles of the
corridor in the Town of Middletown. While a small area of low-density residential land in the Town of
Portsmouth is located within 0.25 miles of the property, the proposed action would not be expected to
have notable indirect impacts on this land use because maintaining the open space land uses at the site is
not expected to induce changes in land use on surrounding properties. Therefore, the discussion of
impacts in the following sections focuses on surrounding properties in the Town of Middletown.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternative 1 and 2, the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property would be under the jurisdiction of the Town of Middletown. The use of shoreline park
land and areas designated as open space along the Defense Highway and the development of new
buildings or structures on the site would be regulated by the town and its zoning ordinance and guided by
applicable plans and regulations.

11.1.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

11.1.1.1 On-Site Land Use
Under Alternative 1, Defense Highway and Stringham Road would be retained under Navy ownership,
but the land parcels adjacent to the Defense Highway would be used for open space and recreation. The
former Middletown Transfer Station in the former Midway Pier/Greene Lane area and Navy-owned
utility lines along the road corridor would be left in place. A bituminous concrete multi-use pathway
would be constructed in a greenbelt between the railroad right of way and the shoreline, although the
railroad right-of-way is not included in the surplus property boundaries. The pathway would be 12 feet
wide in most areas; in areas that are constrained because of topography or other factors, the width may be
reduced to 10 feet. A shoreline park would be constructed at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. The
park would include a fishing pier, kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, a 0.3-acre parking lot, picnic
areas, and pathways (see Figure 11.1-1). The restrooms, playground, and picnic area would comprise
0.09 acres. The existing pier would be rebuilt to be a 15-foot-wide and 250-foot-long concrete pier.
Alternative 1 would minimally impact the existing land use at the site. In the former Midway Pier/Greene
Lane area, the gravel parking lot would be replaced with open space and recreational land uses, including
the buildings, structures, and parking area previously noted. Redevelopment of the existing pier at the
same location would not change the existing land use. Implementation of Alternative 1 would result in
opening public access to previously restricted military property and the maintenance of open space and
creation of new recreational facilities on the site, a regional increase in public open space and recreational
areas compared with existing conditions.

19

Indirect impacts on surrounding land uses are based on the potential for the proposed action to generate changes
in the land use type, pattern, or density.

Draft EIS

11-1

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

11.1.1.2 Surrounding Land Use
Implementation of Alternative 1 would include minor changes to the existing open space along the
corridor; the open space parcels would transition from federal government use to public use. Public use
of these parcels would not cause changes in land use substantially different from existing conditions and
would be consistent with surrounding land uses in the Town of Middletown. The proposed shoreline park
under Alternative 1 would be contained entirely within the site boundaries and would have no direct
impacts on surrounding land uses. Access to the shoreline park would be provided off of Defense
Highway and Greene Lane, and no new access points would be required. Indirect impacts on the
surrounding transportation network are discussed in Section 11.4.
Maintaining existing open space land uses and creating a shoreline park on the site would not result in any
growth-induced changes in land use in the surrounding area because these uses would be similar to
existing land uses and would not increase the residential population or create significant new
opportunities for employment. The Redevelopment Plan notes that the Defense Highway is a “critical
third transportation connection for north-south circulation on the island, with a high volume of traffic”
(RKG Associates, Inc. et al. 2011). Routes 114 and 138 are the only other major north-south roadways
on the island. Defense Highway and Stringham Road currently are open to civilian vehicle traffic;
development of the shoreline park and multi-use path would increase vehicle use of the roadway only
slightly more than existing conditions (see Section 11.4 for a discussion of additional trips generated and
impacts on LOS). Given the other factors that affect urban development and growth, such as economic
conditions, the availability of land, and local zoning ordinances, additional access points created along
these roadways would have a minor, long-term impact on surrounding land uses.
11.1.1.3 Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
Town of Middletown. Redevelopment and reuse of parcels in the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
would be subject to the zoning ordinances of the Town of Middletown. Alternative 1 would be consistent
with the regulations of the Town of Middletown’s public zoning district. Parcels along the roadway
would remain under the ownership of the town government, and use of the parcels for a public park and
open space would be consistent with the existing zoning. Alternative 1 would be consistent with the
recommended future land use of the site for conservation, recreation, and open space land uses, identified
in the Town of Middletown’s Comprehensive Community Plan and the town’s 2014 comprehensive plan
update (Town of Middletown Planning Department 2008, Town of Middletown Planning Department
2015). Alternative 1 also would be consistent with the comprehensive plan recommendations to protect
and enhance scenic vistas and provide new public spaces and facilities (including the proposed Greene
Lane Park) on Narragansett Bay. The creation of public recreational facilities under Alternative 1 would
facilitate public use and enjoyment of these coastal parcels.
Shoreline Park Master Plan. Alternative 1 generally would be consistent with the preferred conceptual
plan for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property presented in the Shoreline Park Master Plan. The reuse
plan presented as Alternative 1 does not include two of the recreational features identified as high
priorities for the property, the concessions plaza and the train depot and visitor’s center. However,
implementing Alternative 1 would not preclude the Town developing these amenities in the future.
Therefore, Alternative 1 would be consistent with the Shoreline Park Master Plan.
Aquidneck Island Transportation Study. Under Alternative 1, Defense Highway and Stringham Road
and their ROWs would not be transferred to a non-Navy entity. Alternative 1 would be consistent with
the transportation study recommendation for a bike path along the Defense Highway.

Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan. Retaining Defense Highway under Navy ownership under
Alternative 1 would not be consistent with the recommendations of the Aquidneck Island West Side
Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al. 2005) to upgrade this road for use as a scenic byway. However,
Alternative 1 would be consistent with the master plan recommendation to develop a scenic overlook,
park, and fishing pier at the Midway Pier area and create a bike path parallel to Defense Highway.
In summary, Alternative 1 would be consistent with the Town of Middletown’s Comprehensive
Community Plan and 2014 comprehensive plan update, the Shoreline Park Master Plan, the Aquidneck
Island Transportation Study, and partially consistent with the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan.
Alternative 1 would not be consistent with the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan recommendations
for Defense Highway, but would have no effect on the current ownership or use of the road corridor.
Additionally, Alternative 1 would be consistent with the zoning established by the Town of Middletown.
Therefore, no inconsistencies with local planning would result.
11.1.1.4 Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 1 is reasonably
likely to affect the use or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the property
would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the RI CRMP
and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. However, redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
would not be a direct federal action and would therefore fall under the CRMC’s direct state permitting
authority under the Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal projects located within tidal waters, on a
shoreline feature, or within the 200-foot contiguous area. Following disposal of the property, the local
entity implementing redevelopment would be responsible for completing the state permitting process with
CRMC.
For purposes of analysis, consistency of the reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property with the
applicable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP is summarized below. For
additional information, see Appendix B.
RICRMP

Draft EIS

•

Section 200.4 Type 4 Waters – Redevelopment activities at the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property –focus, in part, on the development of a shoreline park next to and with
access to the waterfront that the public could use for, boating, fishing, kayaking, and
beachcombing. The demolished and rebuilt former Midway Pier would be used as a
recreational fishing pier. The Navy informally consulted with NMFS regarding
designated EFH in Narragansett Bay and evaluated the effects of the proposed action on
the 17 species of EFH designated for the bay. This evaluation was completed in
accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The
Navy has determined that environmental impacts from the proposed reconstruction of the
pier will not adversely affect designated EFH within Narragansett Bay. All impacts are
expected to be minor and short-term. Thus, the redevelopment activities proposed for the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be consistent to the maximum extent
practicable with the abovementioned policies of CRMP Section 200.4(C).

•

Section 210.3 Coastal Wetlands - There are 0.35 acres of estuarine and marine wetlands
within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property boundaries, located along the shoreline.
Redevelopment under Alternative 1 would not impact these wetlands because
redevelopment would take place in areas outside these mapped wetland boundaries.
Therefore, the proposed action would be fully consistent with these policies.

11-5

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

•

Section 300 Activities in Tidal and Coastal Pond Wetlands, on Shoreline Features,
and Their Contiguous Areas – Consistency with the policies listed in this section would
be addressed through the state permitting process initiated by the developer. Through the
permitting process, all applicable local zoning ordinances, flood hazard standards, and
environmental requirements will be addressed. Therefore, the proposed action is
consistent with these policies to the maximum extent practicable.

•

Section 300.9 Dredging and Dredged Materials Disposal– The maintenance dredging
proposed at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would include use of a clamshell
bucket or similar equipment to excavate and remove the existing pier. It will be the
responsibility of the developer(s)/property owners to identify and provide
environmentally sound disposal locations and procedures to the CRMC. Prior to any
dredging operation or disposal, the developer(s)/property owner would coordinate with
the CRMC, RIDEM, and the USACE to obtain the appropriate approvals and
authorizations. Through this coordination process, the dredging activities would be
conducted in accordance with all applicable regulations and the proposed action would be
consistent with this policy to the maximum extent practicable.

•

Section 300.18 Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and Aquatic Habitats of Particular
Concern – Approximately 1.1 acres of eelgrass habitat have been identified within the
property boundaries of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and approximately 1.8
acres of eelgrass have been mapped within 200 feet of the surplus property. In addition to
eelgrass, widgeon grass has been previously documented at this surplus property, likely
in similar environments as eelgrass (U.S. Department of the Navy 2009); however, digital
data from the State of Rhode Island did not confirm this (RIDEM, Narragansett Bay
Estuary Program and RI CRMC 2003; Applied Science Associates 2011). The eelgrass
habitat is located at the southern end of the property immediately to the south of the
former Midway Pier. The eelgrass beds that are located along the waterfront near the
proposed shoreline park would not be disturbed during construction of the pier because
the development footprint, as assessed in the EIS and this negative determination, does
not overlap with the mapped locations of SAV. Therefore, the proposed action would be
fully consistent with the policies of this section.

Aquidneck Island SAMP
• Section 130.2 Coastal Greenway – Redevelopment under Alternative 1 at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property would be undertaken to enhance public access to the shoreline
and would likely be considered municipal projects not subject to Section 130.2.
Nevertheless, redevelopment under Alternative 1 would include either the establishment
and maintenance of a coastal greenway or the standards for setbacks and buffers
stipulated in Sections 140 and 150 of the Aquidneck Island SAMP as stipulated in
130.2(c) of the Aquidneck Island SAMP. With adherence to one of the two options, the
future developers/property owners would be complying with this policy. As such, the
proposed action would be fully consistent with this policy.
•

Draft EIS

Section 130.8 Open Space and Public Access – The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
would be consistent with Coastal Policy 130.8 by creating both open space and public
access as part of the proposed action. This previously federally held property along
Narragansett Bay would be opened to the public and would include waterfront uses along
Narragansett Bay. Therefore, the proposed action would be fully consistent with this
policy.

11-6

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

•

Section 130.9 Visual Elements – The proposed action is based upon the Redevelopment
Plan developed by AIRPA; that plan targets specific types of development on each
property based on each site’s physical and environmental setting and location. The Plan,
in summary, is consistent with Coastal Policy 130.9 because reuse and redevelopment at
each property will restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas. The
visual quality of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be enhanced by the newly
created waterfront park and partial coastal greenway. The existing Midway Pier is a
deteriorating and/or outdated pier structure which would be replaced under the
Redevelopment Plan. As such, the proposed action would be fully consistent with this
policy.

•

150.1 Standards Applicable to Entire Development– The developer/property owner
will be responsible during redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property for
providing separate and appropriate environmental documentation and obtaining all the
necessary permits from state and federal agencies that meet the applicable standards
addressing areas such as storm water management (i.e., Rhode Island Stormwater Manual
and CRMP 300.6), groundwater protection, infrastructure, vegetation cover (i.e., Section
150.1 Standards Applicable to Entire Development), SAV, open space, public access
(i.e., CRMP Section 335. Protection and Enhancement of Public Access to the Shore and
Aquidneck Island SAMP Section 150.5 Public Access Standards for all Coastal
Greenways), construction setback, and water quality associated with the proposed activity
(i.e., Water Quality Certificate from RIDEM and USACE permit, concurrent with their
application to CRMC). Therefore, the proposed action would be consistent with these
standards to the maximum extent practicable.

Official consultation with the Rhode Island CRMC was initiated on February 11, 2014 with a letter
outlining the Navy’s CCD. The CRMC concurred with the Navy’s determination that disposal of the
surplus property under Alternative 1 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum
extent practicable with the RI CRMP and that the developer of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
would be required to comply with the applicable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island
SAMP (Willis 2014). A copy of the letter is included in Appendix B.

Like Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would retain Defense Highway and Stringham Road under Navy
ownership. The multi-use pathway between the railroad tracks and the shoreline would be the same under
Alternative 2 as under Alternative 1. Alternative 2 includes expansion of the public recreational facilities
in the Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. Under Alternative 2, a total of approximately 0.9 acres at the
shoreline park would be redeveloped with parking, restrooms, a playground, picnic area, and the pier.
Parking under Alternative 2 would total 0.6 acres and require two areas of cut-and-fill. The area of the
playground would be increased to 0.1 acres, and the pier footprint also would be increased to
approximately 0.1 acre. Alternative 2 would include installing a floating concrete pier at the end of the
redeveloped Midway Pier in a T formation. The floating pier would be 8 feet wide and 50 feet long (see
Figure 11.1-2).
Like Alternative 1, Alternative 2 would minimally impact the existing land use at the site. In the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane area, the gravel parking lot would be replaced with open space and recreational land
uses, including the buildings, structures, and parking area previously noted. Redevelopment of the
existing pier at the same location would not change the existing land use. Like Alternative 1, Alternative
2 would result in opening public access to formerly restricted military property and in maintaining open

space and creating new recreational facilities on the site, resulting in a regional increase in public open
spaces and recreational areas.
11.1.2.2 Surrounding Land Use
The land uses proposed under Alternative 2 would essentially be the same as the land uses proposed
under Alternative 1. Therefore, impacts on surrounding land use under Alternative 2 would be the same
as those described under Alternative 1.
11.1.2.3 Consistency with Land Use Plans and Zoning
The land use proposed under Alternative 2 would essentially be the same as those land uses proposed
under Alternative 1. Therefore, Alternative 2 would be consistent with local zoning ordinances and land
use plans for the same reasons discussed under Alternative 1.
11.1.2.4 Coastal Zone Management
The Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the surplus property under Alternative 2 is reasonably
likely to affect the uses or natural resources of Rhode Island’s coastal zone. Disposal of the surplus
property under Alternative 2 would be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent
practicable with the enforceable policies of the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. However,
redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 2 would not be a direct
federal action and would therefore fall under the CRMC’s direct state permitting authority under the
Rhode Island CRMP for non-federal projects located within tidal waters, on a shoreline feature, or within
the 200-foot contiguous area.
If Alternative 2 is selected, the Navy would be required to prepare a coastal zone consistency
determination for the proposed disposal and reuse of the property under Alternative 2 and submit it to the
Rhode Island CRMC for concurrence.
The enforceable policies of the RI CRMP and applicable policies of the Aquidneck Island SAMP are
outlined in Section 10.1.4. Due to the similarities in land use types proposed, and the same geographic
area of the proposed action under Alternative 2 compared with Alternative 1, consistency of the proposed
action on the use and natural resources of the coastal zone under Alternative 2 would be similar to those
under Alternative 1.

11.1.3 No Action Alternative
Under the No Action alternative, the surplus property at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be
retained by the U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur. The
roadways would remain open to public access, but the other land parcels would remain vacant and closed
to public access. Implementation of the No Action alternative would have no direct or indirect impacts on
surrounding land uses.
Town zoning regulations would not be enforceable since the parcels would continue to be owned by the
federal government and, therefore, would be outside the jurisdictions of the Town of Middletown. The
No Action alternative would preserve open space along Defense Highway, which would be consistent
with the land use designations included in the Town of Middletown, RI, Comprehensive Community Plan.
However, the No Action alternative would prevent redevelopment of the parcels, which would not be
consistent with local land use plan recommendations for redevelopment and reuse of this land. Under the
No Action alternative, none of the potential benefits associated with redevelopment of the parcels along
the corridor would be realized.

11.2 Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice

This section refers the reader back to Chapter 5, where the impact analysis for all four surplus properties
for these resources is located.

11.2.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

A detailed discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental justice consequences associated with the
redevelopment of all four surplus properties, including the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative) can be found in Section 5.2.1.
In summary, implementation of Alternative 1 is anticipated to have a beneficial economic impact on the
regional economy, no noticeable impact on local population and demographic characteristics, no
noticeable impact on the local housing market, and a minor positive fiscal impact on the Town of
Middletown, primarily in the form of construction expenditures. In addition, no disproportionate impacts
on minority, Hispanic/Latino, low-income, or children are anticipated to occur under this alternative.

11.2.2

Alternative 2

A detailed discussion of the socioeconomic and environmental justice consequences associated with the
redevelopment of all four surplus properties, including the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under
Alternative 2 can be found in Section 5.2.2. The summary of impacts described above for Alternative 1
would also apply to Alternative 2.

11.2.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, no redevelopment plan would be implemented and ownership of the
properties would be retained by the Navy. The properties would not be developed and would remain in a
caretaker status. No new economic activity would be generated and no increased employment
opportunities would occur. Regional population and the regional housing market would not be impacted,
nor would the regional commercial property market be impacted. Local government tax receipts would
not increase as the properties would retain their current tax-exempt status.

11.3 Community Facilities and Services

This section refers the reader back to Chapter 5 where the impact analysis for all properties for these
resources is located.

11.3.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

A discussion of the expected impacts on community facilities and services in the City of Newport and the
Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth associated with the redevelopment of all four surplus properties,
including the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative) can be
found in Section 5.3.1.

11.3.2

Alternative 2

A discussion of the expected impacts on community facilities and services in the City of Newport and the
Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth associated with the redevelopment of all four surplus properties,
including the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 2 can be found in Section 5.3.2.

11.3.3

No Action Alternative

There would be no impact on community facilities and services resulting from the No Action alternative
because the properties would be held in caretaker status by the Navy. There would be no change in

Draft EIS

11-11

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

population or employment resulting from this alternative. In addition, no new recreational facilities
would be built if the No Action alternative were to be implemented.

11.4 Transportation

This section summarizes the potential transportation impacts resulting from construction and
implementation of the Redevelopment Plan at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative
1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. The evaluation of transportation impacts upon full buildout is based on the analysis completed for the Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of
Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). Roadways and intersections
evaluated for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property include:
•

Defense Highway/Burma Road

•

Stringham Road

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road Intersection

•

Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane Intersection

Locations of these roadways are shown on Figure 11.4-1.
Traffic generated from construction was not captured in the traffic impact analysis. An evaluation of the
impacts on existing traffic conditions from the construction traffic is based on the volume of construction
vehicles and duration of construction at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

11.4.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property is accessible from a number of roads that intersect the project
area. The proposed fishing pier and shoreline park would be accessed directly from Defense Highway.
Greene Lane would be the nearest connector to West Main Road (State Route 114). Fifty-two parking
spaces would be included under Alternative 1.
Construction-related traffic would consist of delivery trucks, dump trucks, heavy equipment, and vehicles
driven by construction crews. Based on the square footage of the proposed demolition/new construction,
an estimated thirty daily trips would occur for worker commutes, three daily trips would occur for
demolition removal, and four delivery trucks would occur per day (see Appendix D for the methodology).
This could result in short-term impacts on traffic from additional truck trips and slower-moving vehicles.
However, the impacts would not be significant because the impacts would occur for the duration of the
new construction period only. In addition, redevelopment of the Midway Pier/shoreline park is not
expected to occur simultaneously over the course of the 20-year build-out. Impacts are therefore expected
to be minor.
Short-term impacts are likely to occur during the construction period of the redevelopment. However,
impacts would be minor for the duration of the construction due to the size of the proposed
redevelopment activities.
The evaluation of impacts during full build-out under Alternative 1 includes a discussion of projected
traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS) and recommended mitigation measures.

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

11.4.1.1 Projected Traffic Volumes
Full build-out of Alternative 1 would result in a negligible number of new vehicle trips added to the
existing transportation network. Trips generated by use of the proposed multi-use pathway and park are
expected to occur primarily during off-peak hours and weekends. Not all trips to the park are expected to
be new, as its use is likely to capture current drivers along the highway. Because the size of the park and
multi-use pathway are relatively small and are not expected to generate more than one or two peak hour
trips, trip generation was not modeled for this redevelopment.
However, the intersections of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane and Defense
Highway/Burma Road and Stringham Road would see an increase in morning and evening peak hour trips
over existing conditions largely due to the full build-out of the nearby tank farms and annual growth in
background traffic levels. See discussion in Section 9.4.1.1.
11.4.1.2 Projected Level of Service
The intersections of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane and Defense Highway/Burma Road
and Stringham Road would see a decrease in the LOS compared to existing conditions largely due to the
full build-out of the nearby tank farms and annual growth in background traffic levels. See discussion in
Section 9.4.1.2.
Because the size of the park and multi-use pathway are relatively small and are not expected to generate
more than one or two peak hour trips, LOS would not be affected by this redevelopment. Therefore,
redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would have only a minor impact on the
roadway network surrounding the surplus property.
11.4.1.3 Summary
The intersections of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane and Defense Highway/Burma Road
and Stringham Road would see an increase in morning and evening peak hour trips over existing
conditions and a decrease in the LOS, largely due to the full build-out of the nearby tank farms and annual
growth in background levels. Mitigation is proposed under Section 9.4.1.3. Implementation of
Alternative 1 for redevelopment of the surplus property for use as a multi-use pathway and park would
result in minor impacts on the road network near the site.
Sight distances for the potential driveway location at the shoreline park were reviewed and generally
found to meet the AASHTO requirements for the 85th percentile travel speeds along Defense Highway.
These distances should be reconfirmed once the final location of the driveway is determined. The
driveway should also be designed to maximize the visibility for motorists turning into and out of the
property while providing accurate information to the motorist to identify the site.
Other potential mitigation measures would depend on the final design of the site driveways and internal
site roadway network. Improvements along the roadway could be as simple as revised signs, striping, or
redesign to improve traffic flow. The implementation of these mitigation measures would be the
responsibility of the future developer and/or the Town of Middletown.

11.4.2

Alternative 2

Accessibility to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would remain largely the same under both
alternatives but with an increase of parking spaces to 107 spaces under Alternative 2.
The evaluation of impacts during full build-out under Alternative 2 includes a discussion of projected
traffic volumes, the projected impacts on the road network (LOS), and recommended mitigation
measures.
Draft EIS

11-15

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

11.4.2.1 Projected Traffic Volumes
The land uses proposed under Alternative 2 would essentially be the same as those land uses proposed
under Alternative 1. Therefore, impacts on projected traffic volumes under Alternative 2 would be the
same as those described under Alternative 1.
11.4.2.2 Projected Level of Service
The land uses proposed under Alternative 2 would essentially be the same as those land uses proposed
under Alternative 1. Therefore, impacts on the projected LOS under Alternative 2 would be the same as
those described under Alternative 1.
11.4.2.3 Summary
The intersections of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane and Defense Highway/Burma Road
and Stringham Road would see an increase in morning and evening peak hour trips over existing
conditions and a decrease in LOS, largely due to the full build-out of the nearby tank farms. Mitigation is
proposed under Section 9.4.2.3.
The mitigation for impacts from the implementation of Alternative 2 would be the same as those
discussed for Alternative 1.

11.4.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Under caretaker status, the Navy would reduce its overall maintenance on
Defense Highway and Stringham Road, due to the lack of an active mission requirement north of Greene
Lane and limited funding to maintain the road. The Navy is currently determining what their
maintenance program would comprise.
The roads in the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would continue to serve as two-lane roadways used
by the general public. No reuse or redevelopment would occur at the property; however, traffic volumes
are projected to increase 1 percent annually through the year 2032 due to other development projects in
the area and general population and traffic growth.
11.4.3.1 Projected Traffic Volumes
Under the No Action alternative, traffic volumes are projected to increase 1 percent annually through the
year 2032. Traffic volume increases are associated with development projects not specifically identified
as well as annual population and traffic increases. Section 9.4.3.1 provides a comparison of existing peak
hour traffic volumes under Alternative 1 with those projected under the No Action alternative for the
Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane intersection and the Defense Highway/Burma Road and
Stringham Road intersection.
11.4.3.2 Projected Level of Service
The southbound approach to the intersection of Defense Highway/Burma Road and Greene Lane would
continue to operate at LOS A during the morning and evening peak hour. Operation of the westbound
approach would decline from LOS C to LOS F during the morning peak hour and would decline from
LOS C to LOS D during the evening peak hour. The northbound approach to the intersection of Defense
Highway and Stringham Road would continue to operate at LOS A during morning and evening peak
hours. The northeast approach would continue to operate at LOS F during morning peak hours and
would decline from LOS D to LOS F during evening peak hours (Pare Corporation 2013).

Draft EIS

11-16

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Under caretaker status, reduced maintenance may result in deterioration of the roadway due to uncleared
debris, snow, and degradation of pavement. Deterioration of the roadway may result in a decrease in LOS
as vehicles may need to travel at reduced speeds for safety and to prevent damage from potholes.
Therefore, implementation of the No Action alternative may result in minor impacts on transportation.

11.5 Environmental Management

This section describes the potential impacts on environmental management from the implementation of
Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an examination of potential
impacts on the management of hazardous waste, hazardous materials, and ER Program sites associated
with disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
As discussed in Section 3.5.1.5, real property transactions under BRAC require preparing a FOST(s).
The FOST summarizes how the applicable requirements and notifications for hazardous materials,
petroleum products, and other regulated materials (such as ACM, LBP, PCBs, and pesticides) have been
satisfied and whether the property is environmentally suitable for transfer. The FOST for the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property will address any restrictions, notifications, or covenants in deeds related to
hazardous materials at the surplus property.

11.5.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

11.5.1.1 Hazardous Waste
Small amounts of RCRA hazardous wastes would be generated during the demolition of the former
Midway Pier and construction of the new pier, multi-use path, and shoreline park planned for the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane area under Alternative 1. Demolition and construction activities and the operation of
heavy equipment and machinery would result in wastes such as waste oils and oily wastes, chemicals,
acids, paints, and solvents. Demolition and construction contractors would be required under contract to
manage hazardous waste in accordance with Town of Middletown and state and federal requirements.
Future use of the new facilities would not be expected to generate hazardous waste. There would
therefore be a minor short-term impact on hazardous waste management under Alternative 1. This impact
would not be significant.
11.5.1.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks, Fuel Piping, and Oil/Water Separators
There are no storage tanks or OWSs at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The two USTs associated
with former Building 71 and the OWS associated with former Building 70 (see Figure 11.5-1) were
removed in 1995 and 1999, respectively. Remediation in the area of former Buildings 70 and 71 has
substantially been completed. With the possible exception of long-term groundwater monitoring that
might be prescribed, isolated areas of petroleum contamination near former Buildings 70 and 71 and
Defense Highway would be remediated before property transfer. No storage tanks or OWSs would be
installed for the waterfront development proposed at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane area under Alternative
1. The active 1,000-gallon UST located at NAVSTA Newport Building 694 is just outside of the property
to be disposed as surplus. There would be no impacts on the management of storage tanks and OWSs
under Alternative 1.
The underground fuel pipeline that runs along Defense Highway, from the intersection of Defense
Highway and Stringham Road to Pier 1 (see Figure 11.5-1), would remain in place under Alternative 1.
That pipeline is adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The pipeline was cleaned and
abandoned in place in 2000 and is not known to contain any petroleum constituents. Most of the soil

Draft EIS

11-17

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

along the pipeline length has not been assessed (see Section 10.5.2.2). Soil beneath and around pipeline
portions that have not been assessed could be contaminated if the pipeline leaked when it was operational.
There would be a minor impact under Alternative 1 related to the unknown condition of the soil near
unassessed portions of the underground fuel pipeline. This impact would not be significant, and
appropriate notifications in the deed or other real estate instrument transferring the property would alert
future property owners to the presence of the nearby pipeline and further mitigate any impacts.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
The steam line that runs alongside the underground fuel pipeline along Defense Highway is wrapped in
asbestos-containing pipe wrap. The steam line would remain in place during redevelopment of the
property. Under Alternative 1, there would be a minor long-term impact from the ACM that remains on
the underground steam line that runs along Defense Highway, adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. This impact would not be significant because the ACM would be on underground surfaces.
There are no known sources of LBP or lead at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. There would be
no impacts associated with construction activities and future use of the new waterfront facilities under the
redevelopment plan because asbestos and LBP are no longer used in new building materials. Any
potential impact would be further mitigated by including proper notifications of the existence of possible
sources of ACM or LBP in the deed or other real estate instrument transferring the property.
PCBs and Pesticides
There are no known sources of PCBs at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and redevelopment of the
property would not introduce new sources of PCBs. Therefore, there would be no impact associated with
PCBs under Alternative 1.
Pesticides are currently used at NAVSTA Newport properties as needed and in accordance with the
Integrated Pest Management Plan (see Section 3.5.1.2). It is expected that in the future pesticides would
similarly be used responsibly and in accordance with applicable local and state regulations by the
property managers of the open spaces and facilities that would occupy the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property under Alternative 1. Therefore, there would be no impact related to the use of pesticides under
Alternative 1.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Radioactive materials would not be used at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1.
The redevelopment planned for Alternative 1 involves open-air spaces, for which radon would not be a
concern. Therefore, there would be no impacts from radioactive materials and radon under Alternative 1.
11.5.1.3 Medical Waste
There would be no medical waste associated with the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under
Alternative 1, and therefore no impact.
11.5.1.4 Environmental Restoration Program
Under Alternative 1, remedial activities would continue at IRP Site 13, Tank Farm 5, which is near but
not directly adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (see Figure 11.5-1). The remaining
remedial activities are scheduled to be performed by 2016, with long-term groundwater monitoring
continuing into the foreseeable future. As discussed in Section 3.5.1.4, the Navy will follow the
provisions of CERCLA Section 120(h) related to property transfer. CERCLA-related covenants and
restrictions likely would not apply to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property because it does not overlap
with Tank Farm 5. Alternative 1 would be compatible with the ER Program and there would be no
significant impact.

11.5.2

Alternative 2

11.5.2.1 Hazardous Waste
Similar to Alternative 1, small amounts of RCRA hazardous wastes would be generated during the
demolition of the former Midway Pier and construction of the new pier, multi-use path, and shoreline
park planned for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. Future use of the new facilities would not be
expected to generate hazardous waste. There would be a minor short-term impact on hazardous waste
management under Alternative 2. This impact would not be significant.
11.5.2.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks, Fuel Piping, and Oil/Water Separators
The same locations of former storage tanks and an OWS in the former Midway Pier area would be
affected under Alternative 2 as under Alternative 1. Remediation in the area of former Buildings 70 and
71 has substantially been completed. With the possible exception of long-term groundwater monitoring
that might be prescribed, isolated areas of petroleum contamination near former Buildings 70 and 71 and
Defense Highway would be remediated before property transfer. No storage tanks or OWSs would be
installed for the redevelopment proposed for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. There would be no
impacts on the management of storage tanks and OWSs under Alternative 2.
As described under Alternative 1, there would be a minor impact under Alternative 2 related to the
unknown condition of the soil near unassessed portions of the fuel pipeline that runs along Defense
Highway adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. This impact would not be significant.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
Under Alternative 2, the impacts on ACM, LBP, and lead management would be the same as described
for Alternative 1. There would be a minor long-term impact from the ACM that remains on the
underground steam line that runs along Defense Highway adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. This impact would not be significant because the ACM would be on underground surfaces.
There are no known sources of LBP or lead at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. There would be
no impacts associated with construction activities and future use of the new waterfront facilities under the
redevelopment plan because asbestos and LBP are no longer used in new building materials.
PCBs and Pesticides
There are no known sources of PCBs at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and there would be no
impact associated with PCBs under Alternative 2. There also would be no impact related to the use of
pesticides for property management, the same as described under Alternative 1.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
There would be no impacts from radioactive materials and radon under Alternative 2, as described under
Alternative 1.
11.5.2.3 Medical Waste
There would be no medical waste associated with the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under
Alternative 2 and therefore no impact.
11.5.2.4 Environmental Restoration Program
Under Alternative 2, the status of remedial activities at IRP Site 13, Tank Farm 5, which is near but not
directly adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, would be the same as described under
Alternative 1. The remaining remedial activities are scheduled to be completed by 2016, with long-term

CERCLA Section 120(h) related to property transfer. Alternative 2 would be compatible with the ER
Program and there would be no significant impact.

11.5.3

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be maintained in a
caretaker status with no redevelopment.
11.5.3.1 Hazardous Waste
Hazardous wastes are not routinely generated at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property; therefore, there
would be no impact under the No Action alternative.
11.5.3.2

Hazardous Materials

Storage Tanks, Fuel Piping, and Oil/Water Separators
Under the No Action alternative, the Navy would complete remediation of isolated areas of petroleum
contamination near former Buildings 70 and 71 and Defense Highway, the same as described for
Alternatives 1 and 2. There are no storage tanks or OWSs associated with the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. Therefore, there would be no impacts on the management of storage tanks and OWSs under the
No Action alternative.
The fuel pipeline that runs along Defense Highway would remain as is underground. The pipeline was
cleaned in 2000. There would be a minor impact related to the unknown condition of the soil near
unassessed portions of the fuel pipeline, the same as described for Alternatives 1 and 2. This impact
would be minor.
ACM, LBP, and Lead
Under the No Action alternative, there would be a minor long-term impact from the ACM that remains on
the underground steam line that runs along Defense Highway, the same as described for Alternatives 1
and 2. The impact would not be significant because the ACM would be on underground surfaces. There
are no known sources of LBP or lead at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
PCBs and Pesticides
There are no known sources of PCBs at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property; therefore there would be
no impact associated with PCBs under the No Action alternative.
Pesticides would continue to be applied as necessary in accordance with the installation Integrated Pest
Management Plan; therefore, there would be no impact related to the use of pesticides under the No
Action alternative.
Radioactive Materials and Radon
Radioactive materials are not used at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and radon is not a concern
for open spaces. There would be no impacts from radioactive materials and radon under the No Action
alternative.
11.5.3.3 Medical Waste
Medical waste is not generated at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property; therefore, there would be no
impact on medical waste management under the No Action alternative.

11.5.3.4 Environmental Restoration Program
Under the No Action alternative, cleanup activities will continue at IRP Site 13, Tank Farm 5, in
accordance with CERCLA and the RIDEM UST program. The No Action alternative would be
compatible with the ER Program and there would be no significant impact.

11.6 Air Quality

This section summarizes the projected emissions associated with the disposal and reuse of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, including emissions from the construction and operation of the proposed new
shoreline park and facilities and associated vehicle trips on local roadways after full build-out.
An analysis of the impact of the proposed action on regional air quality is provided in Chapter 12 and
includes an evaluation of the total emissions of criteria pollutants and HAPs from continuing actions at all
surplus properties upon full build-out (see Chapter 12, Summary of Impacts for all Surplus Property, for a
discussion of the total impacts from this action in the Providence, Rhode Island, air quality region).
Construction and operation emissions from each of the other individual surplus properties are described in
Sections 5.6, 7.6, and 9.6.
Construction emissions have been evaluated individually for each surplus property based on the
assumption that construction emissions are temporary and are not likely to occur within the same year at
all locations or at the same time as ongoing operational emissions, especially considering a 20-year buildout period for the Redevelopment Plan.
Detailed calculations conducted to support the estimated construction emissions are provided in Appendix
D-1. (Section 3.6 discusses regional air quality, applicable regulations and requirements, and methods
used to assess the environmental consequences.)

11.6.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

Under Alternative 1, the existing pier would be demolished. The Defense Highway and Stringham Road
would be retained under Navy ownership. However, a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt on the opposite
side of the railroad tracks, next to the water, would be added. The pathway would be 10 to12 feet wide
and would be surfaced with bituminous concrete. In addition to the roadways, recreation/open space use
is proposed at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. A shoreline park would be included with a fishing
pier, kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, a 0.3-acre parking lot, picnic areas, and pathways.
Construction-related emissions would be primarily exhaust emissions from demolition and construction
vehicles and equipment, demolition material removal, construction materials delivery, construction
employee commutes, and dust resulting from ground disturbance and road traffic. Construction emissions
resulting from this action at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 would be similar
to yet slightly less than emissions from the action proposed under Alternative 2 (see Section 11.6.2).
These emissions would be short-term and localized and would result in minor impacts on air quality.
Mitigation of construction emissions would be implemented with best management practices that could
include proper maintenance of equipment, idling reduction measures, and the use of newer, more efficient
equipment with diesel retrofits to control fine particulate (PM2.5). Particle emissions can also be
controlled by regularly watering graded areas and cleaning streets after grading activities.
Operational emissions include emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic.
Emissions from building energy use result from the direct use of natural gas for hot water, primarily for
heating, as well as the indirect use of electricity. Emissions have been conservatively estimated for the
shoreline park, including the restrooms, which have been assumed to be seasonal (i.e., closed during the
Draft EIS

11-23

winter months). Emissions from increased vehicle use was calculated based on the new vehicle trips
modeled for the proposed redevelopment at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property in the Traffic Impact
Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation
2013).
Total operational emissions after full build-out of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under
Alternative 1 are provided in Table 11.6-1. Operational emissions would result in minor impacts on air
quality, and the mitigation discussed below would reduce adverse impacts.
Implementing traffic-easing roadway designs to lower vehicle speed and reduce congestion, in addition to
expanding public transportation and carpooling programs, would reduce vehicle emissions. These
strategies would likely have limited mitigation effectiveness due to the relatively small build-out planned
for Alternative 1 and limited vehicle trips projected.

Alternative 2

Under Alternative 2, demolition and most new construction would be the same as Alternative 1, with the
exception that, under Alternative 2, there would be greater expansion of the former Midway Pier, there
would be more parking area, and the playground would increase to 0.1 acres.
Construction emissions resulting from the proposed redevelopment at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property under Alternative 2 are provided in Table 11.6-2. These emissions would be temporary and
would occur only during the period of construction, which is conservatively assumed to be one year.
Construction emissions would result in minor impacts on air quality. Measures to mitigate construction
emissions would be the same as those discussed for Alternative 1.
Operational emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic under Alternative 2 would
be the same as those estimated under Alternative 1 and would result in minor impacts on air quality (see
Table 11.6-1.).

11.6.3

No Action Alternative

There would be no changes at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under the No Action alternative.
There would be no new stationary or mobile sources of criteria, HAPs, or GHG emissions from the use of
the property, and the No Action alternative would not impact air quality.

General Conformity Rule Applicability

Since Rhode Island is in attainment for all NAAQS, the General Conformity Rule does not apply to this
action While not applicable to the action, the de minimis thresholds under the General Conformity Rule
have been used to consider the potential level of significance of the air quality impacts under NEPA.
Emissions from construction at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under either alternative would be
below General Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds. Thus, changes to air quality would not be
significant as a result of this construction. The evaluation of all other surplus properties and the total
impacts of this action are discussed in Chapter 12.

11.7 Noise

This section includes an analysis of the potential noise impacts resulting from the proposed
redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No
Action alternative. It includes an analysis of the potential impacts resulting from construction and
operation of the proposed redevelopment plan for the property.

11.7.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

11.7.1.1 Construction
The proposed shoreline park at the former Midway Pier/Greene Lane area in the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property is expected to include a fishing pier, a kayak launch, restrooms, playgrounds, picnic areas,
pathways, and parking. The addition of a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt on the opposite side of the
railroad tracks, next to the water, is also proposed for the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Demolishing the existing pier (shoreline park) would involve removing the existing pier and could
include dredging around the pier with a clamshell bucket to excavate it. Any pilings would be removed
via either direct-pull or vibratory extraction.
Table 11.7-1 provides an estimate of the number and type of construction equipment that would be
required as well as the associated sound pressure level (SPL) for each type of equipment at a distance of
50 feet from the source and at the nearest residence. As seen in Table 11.7-1, the noise level at the
nearest residential receptor along Mayflower Drive at a distance of 590 feet from the park construction

The construction of the multi-use pathway along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would result in
short-term noise impacts as construction activity moves along the pathway. Construction noise impacts
would be temporary and would occur only during the period of construction, which is conservatively
assumed to be one year. In addition, construction would take place between 7:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.
when the noise would be less disturbing to area residents and in accordance with local zoning regulations.
Construction noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation
(conforming to zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
11.7.1.2 Operation
Operation of the park and pier under Alternative 1 would include noise sources such as traffic to and from
the parking lots, children playing, and other recreational activities that would not be expected to result in
a noise impact during the daytime, when the property would have the greatest use. Motor boat traffic is
not anticipated as the pier would have no docking facilities.
Implementation of Alternative 1 at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would result in minor trafficrelated noise impacts in the study area. Only one or two peak-hour trips would be generated for the
shoreline park; therefore, peak evening-hour traffic noise levels at this property were not modeled for
Alternative 1 because they would be assumed to be the same as existing conditions.
Recreational use of the shoreline park and traffic-related noise levels would result in minor impacts on the
ambient noise environment; no mitigation measures are proposed.

11.7.2

Alternative 2

11.7.2.1 Construction
Although the redevelopment of the shoreline park under Alternative 2 would include greater expansion of
the former Midway Pier area, including two areas of cut-and-fill for parking, the estimated construction
noise levels would be similar to Alternative 1; however, the duration of construction may be slightly
longer. Construction of the multi-use pathway along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane would result in shortterm noise impacts as construction activity moves along the pathway.
Construction noise would result in minor impacts on the ambient noise environment, and mitigation
(conforming to zoning regulations) would reduce short-term, adverse impacts on adjacent land uses.
11.7.2.2 Operation
Operation of the park and pier under Alternative 2 would include noise sources such as traffic to and from
the parking lots, children playing, and other recreational activities that would not be expected to result in
a noise impact during the daytime, when the property would have the greatest use
Implementation of Alternative 2 at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would result in minor trafficrelated noise impacts in the study area. Only one or two peak-hour trips to and from the park would be
generated; therefore, peak evening-hour traffic noise levels were not modeled for Alternative 2 because
they would be assumed to be the same as existing conditions.
Recreational use of the shoreline park and traffic-related noise levels would result in minor impacts on the
ambient noise environment; no mitigation measures are proposed.

11.7.3

No Action Alternative

Under this alternative, all excess property would be retained by the U.S. government in caretaker status.
No reuse or redevelopment would occur at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and, as a result, there
would be no additional noise generated and noise levels would be limited to existing traffic noise.

11.8 Infrastructure and Utilities
11.8.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

This section summarizes the potential impacts on infrastructure and utilities resulting from the
implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative for the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property. It includes an examination of the potential impacts on water supply, wastewater, storm
water, and other utilities and solid waste management from disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property.
11.8.1.1 Water Supply
The City of Newport would be expected to have sufficient capacity to meet the future water demands
resulting from implementing Alternative 1.
Water Demand
Full build-out of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 would require a minimal
amount of water (180 gpd) for the proposed restrooms at the shoreline park. Water demand for the
restrooms was projected using planning multipliers for the campground (most applicable land use
category) based on acreage (Nelson 2004). Table 11.8-1 shows the projected water demand for both

alternatives. For more information on the methodology and assumptions used to project water demand,
see Appendix D-3.

Operation and Management
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have a negligible impact on the future capacity of
the City of Newport’s water treatment plant and distribution system. The current average daily demand is
approximately 9.1 mgd, including the City of Newport and the Town of Middletown through the City of
Newport’s distribution system, and also wholesale water supply to NAVSTA Newport and the
Portsmouth Water and Fire District. Total average daily demand is projected to increase to 10.75 mgd by
2030 (Rhode Island Division of Planning 2012).
The City of Newport currently operates two water treatment plants with a combined safe capacity of 13
mgd. Replacement of one of the existing plants and upgrades to the other are expected to increase
capacity to 16 mgd by the end of 2014 (Water World 2012). The expected 180 gpd under Alternative 1
represents a negligible amount of the 5.25 mgd excess projected in 2030. Therefore, the projected
increase in water demand would represent a negligible impact on the operation and maintenance of the
City of Newport’s water treatment plant.
Distribution System
The water mains along the Defense Highway are owned by NAVSTA Newport. Development of the
waterfront park would likely require a new water distribution system to be installed, which would be the
responsibility of the developer/future property owner and would be considered a moderate impact.
Ground would be disturbed when laying new distribution lines, and the developer would be required to
comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. All new distribution systems would be
constructed to ensure that they are adequately sized. In addition, all new distribution systems would
avoid the right-of-way of the existing Navy-owned 10-inch and 12-inch water mains located along
Defense Highway. A 30-foot easement, 15 feet on either side of the centerline of the pipe, would be
needed for the existing Navy-owned infrastructure (Carlson 2012).
Connections to the City of Newport’s water system could be obtained in the area along Greene Lane and
the former Midway Pier (Carlson 2012). In addition, the design and installation of any new water supply
infrastructure would require, if applicable, municipal review and approval and would need to comply with
applicable local codes, ordinances, and regulations.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a negligible impact on water demand. New water distribution
infrastructure would be constructed to accommodate redevelopment.
11.8.1.2 Wastewater
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to have a minor impact on the wastewater system in
City of Newport. The wastewater treatment facility currently has enough capacity to treat additional
wastewater that would be generated by implementing Alternative 1.

Draft EIS

11-30

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Wastewater Volume
No wastewater is currently being generated on the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property as there are no
facilities there. Wastewater flow from full build-out of Alternative 1 would result from the proposed
shoreline park restrooms only. Based on standard multipliers for the park, it is projected that the
development would produce 144 gpd of wastewater (Nelson 2004). Table 11.8-2 provides the projected
volume of wastewater that would be generated by both action alternatives. For more information on the
methodology, assumptions, and assumptions used to project wastewater demand, see Appendix D-3.

Operation and Management
The wastewater flow resulting from full build-out of Alternative 1 would not be expected to have an
adverse impact on the City of Newport’s wastewater infrastructure and treatment plant. The plant has a
current capacity of 10.7 mgd and processes 9.46 mgd. Therefore, the projected increase in wastewater
demand would represent a negligible impact on operation and maintenance of the City of Newport’s
wastewater treatment plant.
Collection System
A sewer line runs along the Defense Highway and a lift station located near the Midway Pier area is
currently owned by NAVSTA Newport. New wastewater infrastructure would be needed for the
shoreline park under Alternative 1, which would be the responsibility of the developer/future property
owner and would be considered a moderate impact. Ground would be disturbed when laying new
collection lines, and the developer would be required to comply with local and state regulations to
minimize disturbance. All new collection system(s) would be constructed to ensure that they are
adequately sized. In addition, all new infrastructure would avoid the right-of-way of the existing Navyowned force main and series of pump stations located along Defense Highway. A 30-foot easement, 15
feet on either side of the centerline of the pipe, would be required for the existing Navy-owned
infrastructure (Carlson 2012).
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a negligible impact on wastewater demand, operation, and
management of the City of Newport’s wastewater treatment plan and the regional distribution system.
11.8.1.3 Storm Water
Implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to decrease the amount of impervious surface area on
the property, resulting in a lower volume of storm water runoff. Much of the existing impervious surface
from the roadway would remain. Full build-out under Alternative 1 is estimated to result in a total of
56,180 square feet of impervious surface area, a decrease of 41 percent over existing conditions
(assuming that the areas within the shoreline park that are not developed, i.e., exclusive of the parking,
restrooms, picnic area, would be replaced with grass). Most of the impervious surface area would be
associated with the roadways and would remain unchanged from existing conditions. The proposed
multi-use pathway and parking area for the shoreline park are the largest areas of impervious surface,
other than the roadways. Total impervious surface area is provided for both alternatives in Table 11.8-3.
For more information on the methodology, assumptions, and assumptions used to calculate existing and
future impervious surface, see Appendix D-4.

The Town of Middletown requires development of a storm water management plan before a building
permit can be obtained, as per Chapter 153, Stormwater Management Ordinance. The storm water
management plan would describe measures to control the volume and quality of storm water runoff and
would incorporate best management practices for water quality control as described in the Rhode Island
Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual. Additionally, the storm water management plan
must demonstrate soil and erosion control in accordance with the Town of Middletown Construction Site
Runoff Ordinance (Chapter 151) and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
A General Permit, Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity, would also be necessary because redevelopment of the proposed
shoreline park and multi-use pathway would disturb more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction
General Permit, RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP, which must include a discussion of
E & S controls.
Additionally, as indicated in Section 3.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, Section 438 of the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires that any development or redevelopment project
involving a federal facility with a footprint exceeding 5,000 square feet shall use site planning, design,
construction, and maintenance strategies in order to maintain or restore the predevelopment hydrology of
the property with regard to temperature, rate, volume, and duration of flow. Compliance with this
requirement can be met through the implementation of LID technologies.
Section 438 applies to the “sponsor of any development or redevelopment project involving a Federal
facility.” The act of transferring the installation will result in the property being no longer federally
owned; consequently, Section 438 would not apply to the redevelopment of the installation. However, as
outlined in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Manual, using LID techniques as a
primary method of storm water control is required (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Thus, although not
required through federal ownership of the property, it is expected that the redevelopment of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property would be consistent with the terms contained in Section 438 of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system would require modifications. New storm water infrastructure
would be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under this
alternative. Ground would be disturbed during construction of new infrastructure, and the developer
would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion
of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would be required to identify what infrastructure
requirements may be necessary.

Operation and Management
Under Alternative 1, the property would likely be transferred to a non-federal agency and infrastructure
would no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the new
property owner would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure located on the property and for its
service and maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in a minor impact on storm water management because the
impervious surface area would decrease, and compliance with state and local regulations and permit
conditions regarding storm water management would mitigate impacts of storm water discharges.
11.8.1.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
Electricity would be supplied by National Grid. Upon full build-out of Alternative 1, it is expected that
total electricity demand would be approximately 9,452 kWh (using U.S. averages for energy use per
square foot, obtained from U.S. Department of Energy 2003, 2009). These averages were used to
estimate total energy use by the proposed new restrooms at the shoreline park. Table 11.8-4 shows the
projected electricity demand for the proposed uses under each alternative.

As shown in Table 5.8-4 in Section 5.8, Infrastructure and Utilities, the Town of Middletown consumed
more than 115 million kWh of electricity in 2011. The 2011 electric consumption represented a decrease
from 2010 but was still an increase over the levels used in 2009. According to the 2012 Regional System
Plan developed by ISO New England (2012), Rhode Island’s overall electricity demand has been
forecasted to grow at a rate of 0.8 percent annually over the next decade.
The annual electricity demand under Alternative 1 would represent less than one tenth of a percent of
2011 energy usage in Middletown and a negligible amount of the total annual energy usage for Newport,
Middletown and Portsmouth combined (Rhode Island Energy 2012a). Considering the 0.8 percent future
annual growth rate in electricity demand at the state level, and the fact that Aquidneck Island comprises
approximately 5.5 percent of the state’s overall population, the annual growth rate for electricity demand
would be expected to be far less than 0.8 percent. Therefore, the electricity demand of the redevelopment
of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 would be expected to be supported by
current electrical capacity and would represent a negligible impact on regional demand.
All electric connections would be constructed to ensure an adequately sized and properly built electric
transmission and conveyance system. Ground would be disturbed during construction of new systems,
and implementation and extension of utility infrastructure would be fully funded and constructed by the
future developer or owner of the property; plans regarding such would be part of the development review
process at the local level.
Natural Gas
Natural gas to the property would continue to be supplied by National Grid. It is expected that a total of
approximately 47,067 cf of natural gas would be needed annually under full build-out of Alternative 1.
Draft EIS

11-33

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Similar to electricity usage, estimates of future natural gas usage were calculated for full build-out as
proposed under Alternative 1 using U.S averages for natural gas use per square foot, which were obtained
from the U.S. Department of Energy’s EIA for specific types of building use. These averages were used
to estimate total natural gas use by the proposed new building spaces. Table 11.8-5 compares natural gas
usage for the two alternatives. Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process, the future development
would work with National Grid to identify what infrastructure requirements may be necessary.

Natural gas use would be negligible for the proposed redevelopment at the shoreline park. Restrooms
would be used seasonally and, therefore, would be unheated. Natural gas use would be limited to heated
water.
The natural gas usage for the Town of Middletown in 2011 was over 105 billion cf (refer to Table 5.8-5 in
Section 5.8 Infrastructure and Utilities). The quantity of natural gas needed under Alternative 1 represents
a negligible percentage of the amount consumed in Middletown in 2011 (Rhode Island Energy 2012a),
and therefore is assumed to be accommodated within existing capacities servicing existing demand.
Redevelopment under Alternative 1 is not anticipated to create a strain on natural gas resources.
11.8.1.5 Solid Waste
Implementation of Alternative 1 and the demolition of the former Midway Pier would have a minor shortterm impact on the generation and management of solid waste. Approximately 800 cubic yards of C&D
waste would be generated from demolishing the deteriorating Midway Pier (see Appendix D-2). Nominal
amounts of C&D waste would be generated from construction of the new pier and shoreline park at the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane area. Much of the C&D waste would be recyclable, and it is anticipated that
the demolition and construction contracts would contain traditional terms and conditions requiring C&D
waste to be recycled to the extent practicable, which reduces disposal costs and is also protective of the
environment. Solid wastes would be routinely generated by users of the new shoreline park and possibly
the multi-use pathway and would consist of mixed trash, food waste, and recyclable beverage containers.

11.8.2

Alternative 2

11.8.2.1 Water Supply
The facilities proposed under Alternative 2 are essentially the same as those proposed under Alternative 1.
Therefore, the water demand would be the same as described under Alternative 1, and impacts from the
operation and management of the new water demand and its distribution system under Alternative 2
would be the same as those described under Alternative 1.
11.8.2.2 Wastewater
The facilities proposed under Alternative 2 are essentially the same as those proposed under Alternative 1.
Therefore, the wastewater volume would be the same as described under Alternative 1, and impacts from
the operation and management of the wastewater generated from the proposed redevelopment, and its
collection system under Alternative 2 would be the same as those described under Alternative 1.

11.8.2.3 Storm Water
Similar to Alternative 1, under implementation of Alternative 2 the area of impervious surface area would
decrease, resulting in a lower volume of storm water runoff. However, all of the existing impervious
surface from the roadways would remain. Full build-out under Alternative 2 is estimated to result in a
total of approximately 76,610 square feet of impervious surface area, a decrease of more than 20 percent
below existing conditions. Most of the impervious surface area would be associated with the roadways
and would remain unchanged from existing conditions. The proposed multi-use pathway and parking
area for the shoreline park are the largest areas of impervious surface, other than the roadways. Estimates
of the total impervious surface area for both alternatives are provided in Table 11.8-3.
Similar to Alternative 1, compliance with local and state storm water management regulations would be
necessary. The Town of Middletown requires development of a storm water management plan before a
building permit can be obtained, as per Chapter 153, Stormwater Management Ordinance. The storm
water management plan would describe measures to control the volume and quality of storm water runoff
and would incorporate best management practices for water quality control as described in the Rhode
Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual. Additionally, the storm water management
plan must demonstrate soil and erosion control in accordance with the Town of Middletown Construction
Site Runoff Ordinance (Chapter 151) and the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
A General Permit, Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity, would also be necessary because redevelopment of the proposed
shoreline park and multi-use pathway would disturb more than 1 acre. Prior to approval of a Construction
General Permit, RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP that must include a discussion of E
& S controls. As discussed above under Alternative 1, Section 438 would not apply to the redevelopment
of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. However, as outlined in Rhode Island’s Stormwater Design
and Installation Standards Manual, use of LID techniques are required as a primary method of storm
water control (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Thus, although not required through federal ownership of the
property, it is expected that the redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be
consistent with the terms contained in Section 438 of the EISA.
Storm Water System
The existing storm water collection system would require modifications. New storm water infrastructure
would be necessary to offset new impervious surfaces associated with redevelopment under this
alternative. Ground would be disturbed during the construction of new infrastructure, and the developer
would be required to comply with local and state regulations to minimize disturbance. Upon completion
of the BRAC disposal process, the future developer would be required to identify what infrastructure
requirements may be necessary.
Operation and Management
Under Alternative 2, the property would likely be transferred to a non-federal agency and infrastructure
would no longer be managed by the Navy. Upon completion of the BRAC process, the future property
owner would be responsible for the storm water infrastructure located on the property and for its service
and maintenance.
In summary, Alternative 2 would result in a minor impact on storm water management because the
amount of impervious surface area would decrease, and compliance with state and local regulations and
permit conditions regarding storm water management would mitigate impacts of storm water discharges.

11.8.2.4

Other Utility Systems

Electricity
The facilities proposed under Alternative 2 are essentially the same as those proposed under Alternative 1.
Therefore, the electrical and natural gas usage would be the same as described under Alternative 1 and
would result in a negligible impact on regional demand.
11.8.2.5 Solid Waste
The same amount of C&D waste—about 800 cubic yards—would be generated under Alternative 2 from
demolition of the deteriorating Midway Pier. Similar to Alternative 1, nominal amounts of C&D waste
would be generated from construction of the new pier and shoreline park facilities at the former Midway
Pier/Greene Lane area. Much of the C&D waste would be recyclable, as described for Alternative 1.
Solid wastes would be routinely generated by users of the new shoreline park and multi-use pathway, the
same as described for Alternative 1.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have a minor, short-term impact on the generation and
management of solid waste from the demolition of the former Midway Pier and a minor long-term
impact, as described for Alternative 1.

11.8.3

No Action Alternative

The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property there would be no
demand for water, electricity, or natural gas, nor would wastewater or solid waste be generated. Some
storm water runoff would occur from the existing 95,870 square feet of impervious surface area.

11.9 Cultural Resources

As discussed in Section 3.9, NEPA guidance requires the evaluation of impacts of a proposed action on
cultural resources, including archaeological resources and architectural or built resources (see Sections
11.9.1.1 and 11.9.1.2, respectively), and Native American resources (see Section 11.9.1.3). The Navy has
also evaluated the potential impacts of the proposed action in terms of their effects on cultural resources
that are historic properties, pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (see Section 11.9.1.4).

11.9.1

Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)

11.9.1.1 Archaeological Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have no impacts on archaeological resources because none are present within the
APE along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
11.9.1.2 Architectural Resources
The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of Alternative 1 under NEPA and determined that
Alternative 1 would have direct impacts on architectural resources. Under Alternative 1, once the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property has been transferred out of Navy ownership, the former Midway Pier
would be demolished as part of subsequent redevelopment of the area in the vicinity of the pier as a
shoreline park for recreation/open space use, including construction of a multi-use pathway in a greenbelt
located on the eastern side of the corridor in the vicinity of the pier, between the shoreline and the existing
railroad tracks (see Figure 2-4). Under Alternative 1, no changes to Greene Lane are anticipated
following property transfer. Midway Pier and Greene Lane have been evaluated for NRHP-eligibility and
recommended not NRHP-eligible (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014). The Navy, in consultation with the

Draft EIS

11-36

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Rhode Island SHPO, determined that Midway Pier and Greene Lane are not NRHP-eligible (Lin 2013;
Sanderson 2013b).
Therefore, the direct impacts associated with demolition and subsequent
redevelopment of this property would not be considered significant and would not require measures to
avoid, minimize, or mitigate these direct impacts.
11.9.1.3 Native American Resources
As indicated in Section 10.9.3, the Navy is consulting with the following federally recognized Indian
tribes regarding Native American resources within the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property: the
Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head
(Aquinnah) (see Appendix A for copies of consultation letters). Consultation remains open.
11.9.1.4 NRHP-Listed or -Eligible Historic Properties
Under Alternative 1, the transfer of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property out of federal ownership or
control would have no effect on historic properties as none are located within the property. The Navy
consulted with the Rhode Island SHPO regarding the lack of historic properties (archaeological or
architectural) at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (Lin 2013). The Rhode Island SHPO concurred
that transfer of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property out of federal ownership or control would have no
effect on historic properties (Sanderson 2013b).

No Action Alternative

The Navy has evaluated the potential impacts of the No Action alternative under NEPA and has
determined that the No Action alternative would have no impacts on archaeological, architectural, or
Native American resources, and no effect on historic properties, because there would be no changes to
existing conditions for these resources.

11.10 Topography, Geology, and Soils

This section summarizes the potential impacts on topography, geology, and soil resources resulting from
the implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property. Because the disposal of the roads and open space along it would not result in
any impacts on soils, this section focuses on redevelopment of the proposed shoreline park and the multiuse pathway. This section also includes a discussion of the potential impacts on the bathymetry and

marine sediment present in the Narragansett Bay off-shore of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
from redevelopment of the former Midway Pier.

11.10.1 Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)
The majority of proposed development would be located in an area that has been previously developed by
the Navy, so implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to result in minor temporary impacts on
topography, geology, and soils from construction of a new building, parking lot, and a multi-use pathway.
11.10.1.1 Topography
Under Alternative 1, development of the shoreline park and multi-use path would largely occur in an area
near the former Midway Pier that was previously graded during the Navy’s development of the area.
Some alteration of existing topography would be expected as a result of grading and associated cut-and–
fill activities necessary to accommodate the new building site (i.e., restrooms). The extent of grading and
cut-and-fill activities would be localized and would depend on the building design and location. Because
the site has already been developed, and because open space areas would be preserved, impacts on
topography would be minor.
11.10.1.2 Geology
Alternative 1 would not impact geologic resources at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
11.10.1.3 Soils
Most of the redevelopment proposed under Alternative 1 would be concentrated on approximately 1 acre
of land. Approximately 0.3 acres of this total would be in an area that has been previously disturbed by
the previous construction of the roadway, the overhead and underground utility lines, the railway,
demolition of shoreside structures, and other development by the Navy in parcels adjacent to the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property. Since buildings previously existed on this property, it is assumed that
urban/manmade soils in these areas have been modified from their original condition. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 1 would be expected to result in a minor impact on soils. However,
considering the size of the shoreline park and multi-use path, it would be expected that temporary and
permanent minor to moderate impacts could occur at full build-out.
Erosion Potential
All soil types located at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property have the potential to be impacted by
development, including construction activities and erosion from wind and water. There are two soil types
that would be impacted by the construction of the shoreline park and multi-use path: Newport silt loam, 3
to 8% slopes, and Pittstown silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes. The soil erosion potential for Newport silt loam, 3
to 8% slopes, is moderate. The soil erodibility factor is 0.24 at a depth of 24 to 30 inches, which means
the soils are moderately susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff (USDA 2012; IWR
2002). The soil erosion potential for the Pittstown silt loam, 3% to 8% slopes, is also moderate. The soil
erodibility factor is 0.28 at a depth of 24 inches to 30 inches, which means they are moderately
susceptible to detachment and they produce moderate runoff. In addition, construction activities
(clearing, grading, landscaping, and movement of equipment, material, and vehicles) would expose soils
to wind and storm water erosion, compaction, and rutting. Soils that are heavily modified may suffer
losses in fertility and productivity.
Soils would be impacted during implementation of Alternative 1, but the impact would be mitigated by
using temporary erosion and sediment control measures during construction, permanent storm water
management measures, and appropriate building site location and design. Project construction could
result in removal of existing vegetation along the footprint for the multi-use pathway, thus requiring
vegetation to be reestablished and slopes created by cutting and filling to be stabilized. If slope
Draft EIS

11-38

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

stabilization and re-vegetation are not properly implemented and maintained, soil erosion and subsequent
sedimentation could result after a rainfall or storm. Soils can be affected by sedimentation when soils
from exposed areas are deposited over undisturbed areas as rainwater or storm water runs off the area.
To mitigate these impacts, it is expected that the developer would implement appropriate erosion and
sediment control measures at construction and demolition sites in accordance with Rhode Island’s Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook (RIDEM et al. 1989) and other applicable state laws. The
handbook provides descriptions of structural measures (e.g., grassed waterway, sediment basin, riprap,
etc.) and non-structural measures (e.g., mulching, topsoiling, and silt curtains). RIDEM requires a
General Permit, Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge
Associated with Construction Activity for soil disturbances of more than 1 acre (RIDEM 2013c). Prior to
approval of a Construction General Permit, the RIDEM requires submittal of an NOI and a SWPPP,
which must include a discussion of erosion and sediment controls. This permit is discussed further in
Section 11.11, Water Resources.
Farmland
The following soils are designated as prime farmland soils along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
(USDA 2012):
•

Newport silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes

•

Pittstown silt loam, 0 to 3% slopes

•

Pittstown silt loam, 3 to 8% slopes.

The FPPA requires that federal actions identify and consider adverse effects on protected farmland.
Projects are subject to FPPA requirements if they may irreversibly convert farmland (directly or
indirectly) to nonagricultural use and are completed by a federal agency or with assistance from a federal
agency. Assistance from a federal agency includes the following:
•

Acquiring or disposing of land

•

Providing financing or loans

•

Managing property

•

Providing technical assistance.

Under Alternative 1, approximately 1.2 acres of Newport silt loam, 3% to 8% slopes, a prime farmland
soil, would be impacted, and less than 0.1 acres of Pittstown silt loam, 3% to 8% slopes. None of the
installation, including the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, is currently used or has been recently used
for farming. For the purposes of farmland protection, the prime farmland has essentially been converted
to urban uses as part of the Defense Highway, development of the railroad bed, and other development in
the area. The NRCS Farmland Protection Policy Act Manual (USDA NRCS n.d.) provides a list of lands
not covered by the act. One such category of lands is “lands identified as ‘urban areas’ on U.S. Census
Bureau maps.” According to the U.S. Census Bureau maps, the majority of Aquidneck Island, has been
classified as an urban area (U.S. Census Bureau 2011). Therefore, Alternative 1 would have no impact on
prime farmland.
Hydric Soils
No hydric soils would be impacted by redevelopment activities, as none exist on-site.

Draft EIS

11-39

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Constructability
The more common sources of construction limitations for the soils at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property include severe restrictions on shallow excavations, e.g., cutbanks cave and wetness, and a severe
slope and a low shrink-swell potential. In general, severe restrictions could lead to a major increase in
construction effort or special design, or intensive maintenance could be required. However, because
much of the area where these soils are located may be modified, it is not possible to determine the
magnitude or severity of the limitations based on available information. Before construction begins,
engineering evaluations will be completed and appropriate engineering techniques identified to mitigate
any soil limitations.
Organic Soils
None of the soils located at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are listed as organic soils.
In summary, there would be minor impacts on soils under Alternative 1, and mitigation would reduce any
temporary impacts. Mitigation would include implementation of appropriate erosion and sediment control
measures in accordance with local and state laws and the Construction General Permit, as discussed in
detail above.
11.10.1.4 Bathymetry
Under Alternative 1, installation of the new replacement pier would displace a volume of sediment at
least equal to the volume of the pilings below the subsurface. The number of pilings needed would be
determined during the pier design stage; however, displacement of sediment in Narragansett Bay
associated with the pilings would result in a minor short- and long-term impact on bathymetry due to
amount of bottom sediment to be removed and the fact that the pier is being rebuilt in the footprint of the
existing pier.
11.10.1.5 Marine Sediment
As indicated above, installation of the pilings associated with the replacement pier would displace a
volume of sediment at least equal to the volume of pilings below the subsurface. However, the impact on
marine sediments would be minor and short-term during the construction period and localized within the
bay and is not expected to affect the overall marine sediment dynamics in Narragansett Bay.

11.10.2 Alternative 2
Similar to Alternative 1, most of the proposed development would be located in areas that have already
been developed by the Navy and implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to result in minor
temporary impacts on topography, geology, and soils during redevelopment of the property (e.g.,
construction of new buildings, parking lots, utilities).
11.10.2.1 Topography
Impacts on topography under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed above for Alternative 1.
11.10.2.2 Geology
Alternative 2 would not impact the geologic resources at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
11.10.2.3 Soils
Implementation of Alternative 2 would be expected to have similar impacts on soils as described under
Alternative 1, including impacts associated with erosion potential, farmland, hydric soils, and
constructability. Alternative 2 would result in approximately 2 acres of disturbance (on land) associated
with the redevelopment footprint, compared with 1 acre under Alternative 1 due to the addition of a larger
parking and playground footprint. Minor impacts on soils would result, and mitigation would reduce
Draft EIS

11-40

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

temporary impacts. The same mitigation measures discussed for Alternative 1 will be implemented to
minimize soil impacts.
Under Alternative 2, approximately 2.9 acres of prime farmland soils would be impacted. However, no
significant impact would occur for the reasons discussed above under Alternative 1.
11.10.2.4 Bathymetry
Impacts on bathymetry under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1; a slightly larger
area would be disturbed under Alternative 2 due to the addition of a floating dock at the end of the pier.
11.10.2.5 Marine Sediment
Impacts on marine sediment under Alternative 2 would be similar to those under Alternative 1; a slightly
larger area would be disturbed under Alternative 2 because of the addition of a floating dock at the end of
the pier.

11.10.3 No Action Alternative
The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
by the U.S. government in caretaker status. No reuse or redevelopment would occur on any of the
property. As a result, the No Action alternative would be expected to have no direct or indirect impacts on
topography, geology, or soils.

11.11 Water Resources

This section summarizes the potential environmental impacts on water resources resulting from
implementation of Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative along the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property. It includes a discussion of surface water, water quality, groundwater,
floodplains, wetlands, and proposed mitigation measures.

11.11.1 Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)
11.11.1.1 Surface Water
Redevelopment of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would have direct impacts on Narragansett
Bay in the form of disturbance of the sediment and substrate of the bay during pile installation and
dredging activities associated with the removal of the existing Midway Pier. Indirect impacts on the
Narragansett Bay as well as Gomes Brook, located adjacent to the surplus property, would also occur.
These indirect impacts are discussed below in Section 11.11.1.2, Water Quality.
To protect surface water, the future developer would be required to consult with the USACE and USEPA
through Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 at the federal
level, and with the state through the CRMC/SAMP processes, as well as RIDEM for the Section 401 of
the CWA, for any in-water work associated with the construction of the pier at the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane property (discussed in Section 11.11.1.5). Given the BMPs developed during future permitting of
the redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any adverse impacts associated with surface waters
would be minor and the disposal and future reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be in
compliance with the CWA.
11.11.1.2 Water Quality
Redevelopment of the proposed fishing pier would require in-water work. Under Alternative 1, the
existing fishing pier (former Midway Pier) would be removed. Demolition of the existing pier would
have a minor impact on the water quality in Narragansett Bay. Water quality could be temporarily

Draft EIS

11-41

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

impacted by the potential re-suspension of sediments. Direct pull or using a clamshell bucket to remove
the existing pilings could re-suspend sediment that is pulled up with and released through the water
column as the pilings are pulled from the substrate. This could result in a temporary “plume” of turbidity.
Although these activities would produce temporary, localized sediment plumes within the construction
site, suspended sediments typically settle out of the water column relatively quickly (in one to several
hours), thereby preventing any long-term adverse impacts on water quality.
After demolition activities are completed, a new 15-foot wide and 250-foot long concrete pier is to be
constructed under Alternative 1. It is assumed that the pilings for this pier would be square, pre-stressed
concrete piles measuring 1 foot by 1 foot. The installation of concrete pilings would have a minor impact
on surface water and water quality in Narragansett Bay from re-suspension of sediments as the pilings are
driven into the sediment and substrate. It is expected that the pilings would be constructed off-site and
then driven into the substrate cured. During construction, sediment would be displaced as the pilings are
embedded in bottom sediments. This would displace a volume of sediment at least equal to the volume of
pilings below the subsurface. The displacement of this sediment and turbidity during the pile-driving
operation would settle soon after pile driving has been completed.
Once in place, the concrete pier would not impact surface water because concrete is an inert material and
not chemically coated. Thus, construction of the new concrete pier would have only a minor, short-term
impact on surface waters and water quality in Narragansett Bay from sediment re-suspension during
construction activities.
Construction vessel operation could also impact water quality through debris and trash losses, deck
drainage, wastewater discharges, bilge pumping, and vessel transport and anchoring. Anchoring
construction vessels may additionally scour the sediment bed and cause an increase in suspended
sediment in the construction site area. Deck drainage is runoff that is introduced to the natural system
during deck cleanings or as wash from rainfall. Drop pans and work areas are other sources of deck
drainage, which often includes petroleum. Extra efforts will be made to avoid any and all oil spills during
construction activities. The potential for petroleum runoff, for example, may be mitigated by installing
gutters and filtration devices along the deck. In the event of an accidental spill, the construction
contractor would implement an emergency response plan.
The proposed pier is to be used for fishing and is not designated for use by recreational boaters. Thus,
recreational boat traffic should not increase in this general area and the potential for spills associated with
boat traffic would be negligible.
On land there would be no direct impacts on surface water from the development of the picnic area,
playground, restrooms, multi-use pathway, or parking area. However, indirect impacts on Gomes Brook,
located just south of the proposed shoreline park, could result in the form of temporary erosion or
sedimentation during construction activities. The same is true for Narragansett Bay.
All redevelopment would require compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations
pertaining to storm water management. Since the proposed shoreline park is located in the Town of
Middletown, the Town of Middletown’s Stormwater Management Ordinance and the Town of
Middletown’s Construction Site Runoff Ordinance, Chapters 151 and 153 of the town code, respectively,
would govern redevelopment. Additionally, a Construction General Permit would be required from
RIDEM for land disturbance greater than 1 acre. Compliance with these laws and regulations and
implementation of best management practices would decrease the magnitude of impacts of storm water
runoff on water quality.

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Full build-out of Alternative 1 is projected to result in a total of 1.3 acres (56,180 square feet) of
impervious surface area. This represents a decrease of 41 percent below existing conditions because it is
assumed that the areas within the shoreline park that are not developed (i.e., exclusive of the parking,
restrooms, picnic area) would be replaced with grass or other vegetation. The portion of the existing
gravel area not redeveloped as a parking area would be replaced with pervious cover. The impervious
surface area associated with the shoreline park and multi-use pathway would continue to generate a longterm increase in precipitation runoff into the watershed and, ultimately, to waterbodies in the area,
including Narragansett Bay. The runoff from the impervious surface area following implementation of
Alternative 1 would be less than that under existing conditions. For more information on the
methodology, assumptions, and calculations used to project the impervious surface area resulting from
implementation of Alternative 1, see Appendix D-4.
The developer would be required to follow all applicable state and local laws and regulations discussed
above, including the abovementioned town ordinances and state permitting requirements, in order to
decrease impacts on water quality from storm water runoff.
Compliance with these laws and regulations and implementation of best management practices would
decrease the magnitude of impacts on water quality from storm water runoff.
Alternative 1 would result in minor impacts on water quality, and mitigation, as outlined above, would
reduce any adverse impacts. The future developer would be required to consult with the USACE and
USEPA through Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 at the
federal level, and with the state through the CRMC/SAMP processes, as well as RIDEM for the Section
401 of the CWA, for any in-water work associated with the construction of the pier at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property (discussed in Section 11.11.1.5). Given the BMPs developed during future
permitting of the redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any adverse impacts associated to water
quality would be minor and the disposal and future reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would
be in compliance with the CWA.
11.11.1.3 Groundwater
As indicated in Section 10.11.3, depth to the water table varies along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property from 1.5 to 3 feet in areas underlain by Pittstown soils to less than 6 feet in areas underlain by
Newport loams (University of Rhode Island Cooperative Extension and Rhode Island Health Source
Water Assessment Program 2003). Construction activities at the proposed shoreline park could extend
below ground surface to a depth that would directly impact the underlying water table. The
developer/contractor would be required to use standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion
sediment control plans and BMPs that would involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate
discharge location, removing sediment from collected water, and preserving downgradient natural
resources. Potential spills of fuels or other chemicals and hazardous materials could occur during
construction activities. Impacts on groundwater resources would be minimized through compliance with
storm water permits and management plans and implementation of BMPs as set forth in the Rhode Island
Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010).
Because of former operations at the former Midway Pier, groundwater in this portion of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property has been documented to contain levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons above
the RIDEM reporting limits (Tetra Tech EC, Inc. 2008c). As indicated in Section 11.5, the FOST for the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property will address any restrictions, notifications, or covenants in deeds
related to hazardous materials at this property.
Minor impacts on groundwater would result; mitigation would reduce adverse construction impacts.

11.11.1.4 Floodplains
Under Alternative 1, approximately 0.17 acres of the 100-year floodplain would be permanently impacted
by the proposed redevelopment features. As shown on Figure 11.11-1, floodplains are located within the
shoreline park, and the proposed redevelopment features would be located within the floodplain areas.
The picnic area, restrooms, a portion of the playground, a small segment of the pier, and the easternmost
portion of the multi-use pathway would be located in the100-year floodplain. The segment of the pier that
is to be located in the floodplain would be a replacement of the existing structure, so redevelopment of the
pier would have a negligible effect on floodplain storage capacity.
In the absence of hydraulic modeling, it is assumed that the approximately 0.17 acre of permanent
floodplain fill would not result in a loss of floodplain storage capacity or a rise in the 100-year floodplain
for Narragansett Bay. The existing vegetation on either side of the proposed redevelopment features
within the shoreline park would remain undeveloped and would help to moderate storm surges and
precipitation.
The future developer of the shoreline park will be required to minimize or offset impacts from
redevelopment that could potentially degrade floodplain values 20 and increase the flood risk to upstream
and downstream activities and will be subject to permitting and regulatory requirements at the local, state,
and federal level. The local building permit process in the Town of Middletown will require that site plans
be prepared showing floodplains. Article 10 of the Town of Middletown zoning code focuses on flood
hazard areas and ensuring public safety, minimizing hazards to persons and property from flooding,
protecting watercourses from encroachment, and maintaining the capability of floodplains to retain and
carry off floodwaters. Under Article 10, all proposed construction or other development within a special
flood hazard area, such as those within the proposed shoreline park, must obtain a permit.
At the state level, the buildings proposed in the flood hazard zones (i.e., restrooms) will be required to
meet the specific requirements for flood zone construction included in the Rhode Island State Building
Code (RISBC). Additionally, the CRMC requires all applicants proposing construction within flood
hazard areas to demonstrate that all portions of the RISBC are to be met. In accordance with EO 11988,
the conveyance of properties in floodplains proposed for disposal for non-federal parties would indicate
restricted uses under floodplain regulations. Overall, the low-impact recreational uses proposed under
Alternative 1 are consistent with the location of the property in a floodplain; due to the recreational nature
of the uses, the risk and impacts from flooding would be minimized. Alternative 1 would result in a
potentially moderate impact on the floodplains.
11.11.1.5 Wetlands
The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property has 0.8 acres of estuarine and marine wetlands along the
shoreline. Redevelopment under Alternative 1 would not impact these wetlands. As shown in Figure
11.11-1, redevelopment would take place in areas outside of these wetlands.
The in-water work associated with the construction of the pier at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
requires USACE permitting under Section 404 of the CWA (discussed in Section 11.11.1.5) and/or
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.

20

Floodplains provide many natural values, including storing flood waters, stabilizing the shoreline in coastal
areas, providing habitat for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife, controlling erosion and sedimentation, and improving
water quality by filtering pollutants.

11.11.2 Alternative 2
11.11.2.1 Surface Water
Impacts on surface water under Alternative 2 would be similar to those discussed under Alternative 1.
Direct impacts on surface waters would occur during pile installation and dredging. Indirect impacts, in
the form of sedimentation and turbidity would result, with the potential of being slightly greater with the
addition of one more floating dock located at the end of the redeveloped pier and the addition of a larger
parking area. These impacts are discussed below in Section 11.11.2.2.
Similar to Alternative 1, to protect surface water, the future developer would be required to consult with
the USACE and USEPA through Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act
of 1899 at the federal level and with the state through the CRMC/SAMP processes, as well as RIDEM,
for the Section 401 of the CWA for any in-water work associated with the construction of the pier and
floating docks at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (discussed in Section 11.11.2.5). Given the
BMPs developed during future permitting of the redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any
adverse impacts associated with surface waters would be minor, and the disposal and future reuse of the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be in compliance with the CWA.
11.11.2.2 Water Quality
Similar to Alternative 1, the redevelopment of the shoreline park, including the fishing pier and the
addition of the multi-use pathway, could have indirect impacts on Narragansett Bay and Gomes Brook.
These indirect, temporary impacts could result from construction activities, both land-based and in-water.
These impacts could potentially be greater under Alternative 2 due to the addition of a floating pier and
the construction of a larger parking lot. All redevelopment would require compliance with the applicable
state and local laws to decrease impacts on water quality from storm water runoff, including the
abovementioned town ordinances. In accordance with these ordinances, prior to redevelopment, the
developer would be required to receive a permit from the Town of Middletown as well as RIDEM (see
Section 11.11.1.2).
As under Alternative 1, construction vessel operation could also impact water quality through debris and
trash losses, deck drainage, wastewater discharges, bilge pumping, and vessel transport and anchoring.
Anchoring construction vessels may additionally scour the sediment bed and cause an increase in
suspended sediment in the construction site area. Deck drainage is runoff that is introduced to the natural
system during deck cleanings or as wash from rainfall. Drop pan and work areas are other sources of
deck drainage, which often includes petroleum. Extra efforts will be made to avoid any and all oil spills.
The potential for petroleum runoff, for example, may be mitigated by installing gutters and filtration
devices along the deck. In the event of an accidental spill, the construction contractor would implement
an emergency response plan.
Full build-out of Alternative 2 is projected to result in a total of 1.8 acres (76,610 square feet) of
impervious surface area. This represents a decrease of approximately 20 percent below existing
conditions because it is assumed that the areas within the shoreline park that are not developed (i.e.,
exclusive of the parking, restrooms, picnic area) would be replaced with grass or other vegetation. The
impervious surface area would continue to generate a long-term increase in precipitation runoff into the
watershed and ultimately to waterbodies in the area, including Narragansett Bay. For more information
on the methodology, assumptions, and calculations used to estimate the impervious surface area resulting
from implementation of Alternative 2, see Appendix D-4.
Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts on water quality, and mitigation, as outlined above, would
reduce any such impacts. The future developer would be required to consult with the USACE and

USEPA through Section 404 of the CWA and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 at the
federal level, and with the state through the CRMC/SAMP processes, as well as RIDEM for the Section
401 of the CWA, for any in-water work associated with the construction of the pier at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property (discussed in Section 11.11.1.5). Given the BMPs developed during future
permitting of the redevelopment, the Navy has determined that any adverse impacts on water quality
would be minor and the disposal and future reuse of the Naval Hospital property would be in compliance
with the CWA.
11.11.2.3 Groundwater
Similar to Alternative 1, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in construction activities that could
extend below ground surface to a depth that would directly impact the underlying water table. The
developer/contractor would be required to use standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion
sediment control plans and BMPs that would involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate
discharge location, removing sediment from collected water, and preserving downgradient natural
resources. Potential spills of fuels or other chemicals and hazardous materials could occur during
construction activities. Impacts on groundwater resources would be minimized through compliance with
storm water permits and management plans and implementation of BMP’s as set forth in the Rhode Island
Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010). Minor impacts on
groundwater would result; mitigation would reduce any adverse construction impacts.
11.11.2.4 Floodplains
Under Alternative 2, approximately 0.19 acres of the 100-year floodplain would be permanently impacted
by the proposed redevelopment features, approximately 0.02 acres more than under Alternative 1. As
shown in Figure 11.11-2, the same proposed redevelopment features as discussed above for Alternative 1
would also impact floodplains under Alternative 2.
In the absence of hydraulic modeling, it is assumed that the approximately 0.19 acres of permanent
floodplain fill would not result in a loss of floodplain storage capacity or a rise in the 100-year floodplain
for Narragansett Bay. The existing vegetation on either side of the proposed redevelopment features
within the shoreline park would remain undeveloped and would help to moderate storm surges and
precipitation.
The future developer of the shoreline park will be required to minimize or offset impacts from
redevelopment that could potentially degrade floodplain values and increase the flood risk to upstream
and downstream activities and will be subject to the permitting and regulatory requirements at the local,
state, or federal level. The local building permit process in the Town of Middletown will require that site
plans be prepared showing floodplains. Article 10 of the Town of Middletown zoning code focuses on
flood hazard areas and ensuring public safety, minimizing hazards to persons and property from flooding,
protecting watercourses from encroachment, and maintaining the capability of floodplains to retain and
carry off floodwaters. Under Article 10, all proposed construction or other development within a special
flood hazard area, such as those within the proposed shoreline park, must obtain a permit.
At the state level, the buildings proposed to be constructed in the flood hazard zones (i.e., the restrooms)
will be required to meet the specific requirements for flood zone construction included in the RISBC.
Additionally, the CRMC requires all applicants proposing construction in flood hazard areas to
demonstrate that all portions of the RISBC are to be met. Although Alternative 2 would result in a
potentially significant impact on floodplains, mitigation would reduce this impact on not significant.

11-48

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

11.11.2.5 Wetlands
Redevelopment under Alternative 2 is expected to impact less than 0.01 acre (approximately 0.003 acre)
of the abovementioned wetlands at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. As shown in Figure 11.11-2,
the majority of redevelopment would take place in areas outside of these wetlands. Using the most
conservative estimate, the redeveloped pier could result in a corresponding less than 0.01 acre area of fill
in the form of pilings to be used to anchor the redeveloped pier; however, final design would determine
the actual locations of the pilings.
Filling a coastal wetland requires a permit from the CRMC and a permit from the USACE under Section
404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the developer will be required to coordinate wetland
mitigation plans with the USACE and CRMC. CRMC Section 300.12(F), Coastal Wetland Mitigation,
outlines the mitigation requirements for alterations to coastal wetlands. As indicated in the regulations,
the following requirements apply:
•

Replacement by a similar type of wetland, which provides an ecological value equal to or
greater than that of the altered wetland; and

•

A 2:1 mitigation ratio for the area of costal wetland restored to the area permanently
altered or lost.

Section 404 of the CWA authorizes the USACE to issue permits regulating the discharge of dredged or
fill materials into waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Compensation requirements typically vary based
on the impacted wetland communities. Specific mitigation requirements for future development projects
would be determined in coordination with the USACE and CRMC. Therefore, Alternative 2 may result in
potential impacts on wetlands, but future development conducted in compliance with existing CWA
regulations would ensure that any impacts on the wetlands would be minor, as any permanent impacts
would be mitigated through the USACE’s compensatory mitigation process under Section 404 of the
CWA.
The in-water work associated with the construction of the pier at the Defense Highway/Stringham Road
Corridor property requires USACE permitting under Section 404 of the CWA (discussed in Section
11.11.1.5) and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.
Therefore, Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts on wetlands. The developer would be required to
avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under state and federal permitting
processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.

11.11.3 No Action Alternative
The No Action alternative is retention of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport by the U.S.
government in caretaker status. Since no development would occur on the property there would be no
impacts on water resources from redevelopment. Some storm water runoff would continue from the
existing approximately 2.2 acres of impervious surface area.

11.12 Biological Resources

This section summarizes the potential impacts on biological resources from the implementation of the
Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1, Alternative 2, and the No Action alternative. It includes an
examination of impacts on vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, and significant
wildlife habitat from disposal and future reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.

Draft EIS

11-49

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

GIS analysis was used to determine the extent of potential impacts on vegetation communities and
wildlife habitat from implementation of the redevelopment alternatives.
Upon completion of the BRAC disposal process under both Alternatives 1 and 2, any future reuse of the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be required to comply with local, state, and federal laws and
regulations pertaining to biological resources. Specifically, consultation with USFWS and NMFS for any
species protected under the ESA would be required for any proposed activities in habitat known to
support federally-listed threatened or endangered species. The USFWS and RIDEM have indicated that
no federally or state-listed or candidate species are located within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
(Chapman 2013; Jordan 2013); however, NMFS has indicated the potential presence of several listed sea
turtles and fish offshore of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (Colligan 2013). Because of the length
of time assumed between consultation for this EIS and the actual redevelopment of this surplus property,
future consultation by the developer will likely be necessary. Additionally, in-water construction activities
by a future developer would likely require Section 10 and/or Section 404 permits from the USACE. As a
federally permited project, USFWS and NMFS would be responsible for reviewing impacts on fish and
wildlife pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and the ESA.

11.12.1 Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)
11.12.1.1 Vegetation
Implementation of the Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1 would necessitate permanent removal of
vegetation to accommodate new facilities and supporting infrastructure. Redevelopment plans under
Alternative 1 along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property are minimal and would comprise
approximately 1.4 acres of disturbance, including the shoreline park, multi-use pathway, and Midway Pier
(both on land and in water). The majority of the features associated with the shoreline park (restrooms,
picnic area, playground, and parking) would be located in areas classified as developed land.
Implementation of Alternative 1 would result in significant long-term impacts on vegetation at the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property; this is true for only the old field habitat, as discussed below. Table
11.12-1 identifies the habitat cover types that would be impacted by the redevelopment of Alternative 1 at
the shoreline park. These impact acreages are representative of areas where the development footprint
overlaps the habitat types.

As indicated in Section 11.11.1.2, full build-out of Alternative 1 is projected to result in a total of 1.3
acres (56,180 square feet) of impervious surface area. This represents a decrease of 41 percent below
existing conditions because it is assumed that the areas within the shoreline park that are not developed
(i.e., exclusive of the parking, restrooms, picnic area) would be replaced with grass or other vegetation.
Open Water
In-water construction under Alternative 1 would involve the removal of the existing pier (former Midway
Pier) from open water habitat, followed by the redevelopment of the pier as a 15-foot by 250-foot long
concrete pier to be used for fishing. The newly developed pier would be located within the same footprint
as the existing pier. The redevelopment of the existing pier at the property would result in approximately
0.005 acres of disturbance of open water. This acreage impact reflects the difference in surface area
between the existing pier and the proposed fishing pier.

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Old Field
The proposed multi-use pathway would permanently impact an additional 0.2 acres of old field habitat in
the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The old field habitat would be converted to impervious surface.
This would be a permanent conversion of 0.2 acres of this habitat, which would not be considered a
significant impact.
11.12.1.2 Wildlife
Because new development at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 would be
limited, impacts on wildlife would be minimal and limited to minor temporary disturbances during
construction, with the exception of the approximately 0.2 acres of permanent impact on old field habitat
from constructing the multi-use pathway. However, loss of 0.2 acres of habitat would not be a significant
impact and adequate suitable habitat is adjacent to the shoreline park.
Terrestrial Mammals
Wildlife species may be temporarily displaced in peripheral areas during construction, when noise and
human activity levels increase. Species that would be most affected include those with relatively small
home ranges. During construction, short-term impacts may include displacement of mobile species such
as eastern gray squirrel, common raccoon, Virginia opossum, woodchuck, and striped skunk. Habitat
fragmentation is not likely to result from the implementation of Alternative 1 because the majority of the
property would retain its current natural conditions. Overall impacts on species diversity and abundance
on the property from construction activities would be minor since the majority of these species would
avoid areas of construction where equipment and human activities create disturbance. Therefore, overall
impacts on terrestrial mammals would be minor. Minor impacts on terrestrial mammals would result from
the implementation of Alternative 1.
Marine Mammals
Construction of Alternative 1 at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would include in-water work
when redeveloping the former Midway Pier into a fishing pier. The fishing pier is proposed to measure
15 feet by 250 feet. Demolition of the existing pier and construction of the pier would disturb the
substrate and the open water habitat (in the form of hydroacoustic noise) at the surplus property.
While construction for Alternative 1 would include in-water work, it is unlikely that the activity would
result in a take of a marine mammal. Removal of the existing pier would include activities such as
dredging with a clamshell bucket as well as possible piling removal. Pilings would be removed by either
direct-pull or vibratory extraction. New pilings would be installed using an impact hammer, in addition to
a barge with a crane. It is assumed that pilings would be constructed off-site. As discussed in Section
10.12.2, reports of harbor seals and harbor porpoises have been documented within one-half mile of the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, in Coddington Cove. (Additional marine mammals with the potential
to be present in the project area are discussed in Section 11.12.1.3, Threatened and Endangered Species.)
Marine mammals are likely to avoid the area during construction activities, and impacts on this species of
marine mammal would not be anticipated to occur. Measures to reduce impacts on marine mammals
would be implemented by the developer through state and federal permitting processes of the
CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.
However, if a marine mammal such as a harbor seal or harbor porpoise were to stray into the waters
immediately adjacent to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, potential impacts from noise generated
during construction activities would be short-term and negligible.
Activities assumed to have hydroacoustic noise impacts include installing concrete piers using a diesel
impact hammer, dredging with a clamshell bucket, and possible piling removal. Pilings would be
removed by either direct-pull or vibratory extraction. New pilings would be installed using an impact

11-53

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

hammer and a barge-mounted crane. Other noise would also be generated by support vessels, small boat
traffic, and other barge-mounted equipment; however, this other noise is likely consistent with existing
vessel traffic in the Bay and in the nearby NAVSTA Newport and East Passage Yachting Center/Melville
marinas. (See section 6.12.1 for a complete discussion regarding noise impacts on marine mammals.)
Measures to reduce impacts on marine mammals would be implemented by the developer through state
and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. This would result in
the future developer’s coordination with NMFS under the ESA and MMPA to minimize impacts on
regulated marine mammals. Pursuant to the MMPA, the Navy concluded the proposed action would be
unlikely to result in a take of a marine mammal. Therefore, the disposal and reuse of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 would have minor impacts on marine mammals.
Other Marine Wildlife
In-water construction activities under Alternative 1 would generate minor, short-term effects on finfish,
shellfish, and crustacean resources in Narragansett Bay. Direct impacts would include temporarily
displacing fish by the operation of construction equipment and noise generated during pile driving. Noise
generated during pile-driving would likely startle fish in the immediate vicinity, potentially displacing
them. Once construction noise has stopped, fish would likely move back into the area.
For a complete discussion of potential impacts of underwater noise on fish, please refer to Section
6.12.1.2.
Additionally, as discussed in Section 10.12.2.2, a 20-acre aquaculture venture exists approximately 350
feet northwest of the proposed pier. Water quality impacts during construction are of most concern
because the pier is to be used for fishing only. These impacts would include those discussed in Section
11.11.1.1, turbidity from increased sediment concentrations and the potential for construction spills, and
would be mitigated to minimize any adverse impacts on the aquaculture farm.
In summary, Alternative 1 would result in minor impacts on other marine life and fish, and BMPs and/or
protective measures implemented by the future developer following consultations with the USACE and
NMFS would ensure that no significant impacts occur to other marine wildlife.
Benthic Organisms
The primary direct impacts on benthic organisms would include mortality during demolition of the
existing pier and pile driving and loss of habitat due to the placement of piles associated with the fishing
pier. Construction activity during demolition of the existing pier (former Midway Pier) would use a
clamshell bucket to dredge around the existing pilings, while removal of any piles would involve either
direct-pull or vibratory extraction. Depending upon the depth of the pile embedment, a vibratory hammer
or water jets may be necessary to loosen the soil around the piles before pulling them out. This could
result in the inadvertent take of benthic species around the existing piles.
Indirect impacts would include turbidity that could disturb the ability of certain organisms to feed, but this
effect would be temporary and limited. Increased turbidities would temporarily cause difficulty in
locating prey for predatory taxa but would not be expected to cause significant adverse effects on species
in the area because they can easily migrate to another area to feed. Benthic organisms, especially slowmoving, fixed, or sediment-dwelling organisms (such as clams, small crustaceans, marine snails, sea
cucumbers, worms, urchins, and sea stars) would be most vulnerable to this impact. Larger or more
mobile benthic species such as the crab, shrimp, or groundfish would likely sense the construction activity
and could move out of the area. Nevertheless, it is possible that these species may not sense which
direction to move to avoid dredging, or become disoriented and could be caught directly by the dredge.
The amount of suspended sediments settling in the surrounding area would not be significant enough to
Draft EIS

11-54

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

bury benthic species in the area. Within a few hours of the dredging, mobile benthic scavenger species
such as crab, shrimp, and sea stars would likely migrate to the impact area to feed on benthic organisms
that had been crushed or injured.
The decrease in soft-bottom habitat (the footprint of the piles) and increase in hard substrate habitat would
result in a localized change in species composition over the long term. Benthic species that burrow into a
substrate, such as clams and worms, thrive in particular types of materials. By replacing (very small)
portions of the seafloor with pilings, pre-construction benthic communities would be slightly altered by
the proposed action. The pilings would increase the available in-water surface area and create
colonization sites for hard-bottom species such as mussels (Mytilus spp.), barnacles (Balanus spp.), and
sea anemones (the fouling community, or the community of organisms found on artificial surfaces). The
new community also would support other species such as copepods, amphipods, annelids, gastropods, and
sea stars that would feed and take refuge in the newly created environment (Kozloff 1996).
Filter- and suspension-feeding invertebrates (e.g., bivalves, tunicates, crustaceans, and some polychaetes)
may close their shells, suspend feeding, or increase feeding rates in response to turbidity increases
(LaSalle et al. 1991; Cruz-Rodriguez and Chu 2002). However, because of the limited time during which
pile driving and dredging would occur (i.e., minutes at a time for several days), along with the limited
increase in turbidity levels, there would not be a significant loss of benthic species in the vicinity of
project areas.
Overall, the direct and indirect impacts under Alternative 1 would be considered minor impacts on the
regional benthic community because the regional benthic community can recolonize over time and
because impacts on the benthic organisms would be localized in relation to the larger regional benthic
community of the Narragansett Bay.
Herpetofauna
Herpetofauna such as the black rat snake and common garter snake may be subject to temporary impacts
under Alternative 1. During construction, these and any other herpetofauna species on the property would
likely avoid areas impacted by noise and human activity. The habitat cover that herpetofauna would most
likely populate at the surplus property are forested and shrubland habitat cover. Aside from a small
portion of shrubland used for the multi-use pathway, no other redevelopment is proposed in either of
these habitat covers under Alternative 1. As such, only minor impacts on herpetofauna would result from
Alternative 1.
Avian Species
As discussed in Section 3.12.1.2, a number of migratory bird species occur at NAVSTA Newport. These
include various species of passerines, waterfowl, and waterbirds. Short-term impacts on avifauna, such as
displacement, may result during construction of Alternative 1. A total of approximately 0.2 acres of old
field habitat would be permanently impacted by Alternative 1. The remaining areas of open space
throughout the corridor property would be preserved as open space and would maintain their existing
conditions. No permanent impact on breeding birds or migrating birds would result. Breeding birds
would avoid areas of construction where equipment and human activities create disturbance. None of the
impacts identified above would result in significant adverse effects on a population of migratory bird
species. In May of 2015, the USFWS initiated a NEPA review of alternatives to authorize take under the
MBTA. At the time of the publication of this Draft EIS, it is uncertain if the future implementation of the
Redevelopment Plan under Alternative 1 may require a take permit under the MBTA. The future
developer would be required to minimize impacts on migratory birds as required under state and federal
permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. Pursuant to the MBTA and
BGEPA, the Navy has determined that implementation of Alternative 1 would have minor impacts on

avian species and the disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would not result in
significant impacts on, or harm of, migratory birds and bald and golden eagles.
11.12.1.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
As discussed in Section 10.12.1.3, NMFS Northeast Region has identified various listed species,
including whales, sea turtles, and Atlantic sturgeon, as well as two federal species of concern (alewife and
blueback herring) that have the potential to occur in the waters of Narragansett Bay due to their
prevalence in New England waters (Colligan 2013). The results of the Navy’s consultation with the
NMFS under Section 7 of the ESA are summarized below. In addition, following initial consultation with
the USFWS in 2013, the northern long-eared bat was listed as threatened and the Navy re-opened
dialogue by sending a letter to the USFWS regarding the northern long-eared bat on June 17, 2015. The
Navy received a response from the USFWS via electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal
consultation and provide additional information about the potential effects of the proposed action on the
northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015). The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts
on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). Consultation regarding the northern long-eared bat under the ESA
is ongoing and additional discussion is provided within this section.
Whales
The North Atlantic right, humpback, and fin whales occur along the U.S. Atlantic Coast at various times
of the year. None of these species are common in Narragansett Bay, although all have been documented
in stranding and live sighting data in Narragansett Bay or along the south shore of Rhode Island
(NBNERR 2009). These species are not likely to be present in Narragansett Bay near the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property. As such, disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under
Alternative 1 would have no effect on these species. Pursuant to the ESA, the Navy has determined that
the disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane would have no effect on the federally endangered
North Atlantic right, humpback, or fin whale. NMFS concurred with the determination, based on the
species preference for deeper water depths and the near-shore location of the proposed action, such that
these species were deemed unlikely to exist in the vicinity of the project area (Colligan 2013). BMPs are
included within this Draft EIS, to minimize the potential for noise-related affects.
Sea Turtles
As discussed in Section 10.12.1.3, four listed species of sea turtles (loggerhead, green, Kemp’s ridley, and
leatherback) are seasonally present in New England from early summer through late fall. Although sea
turtle abundance at the project location in Narragansett Bay is unknown, sea turtles are regular summer
visitors to Rhode Island waters during their southern migration to wintering grounds (NBNERR 2009).
Both the loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley have been documented within Narragansett Bay around
Aquidneck Island (NBNERR 2009). Despite a documented occurrence in 2007, due to its highly pelagic
nature, the leatherback does not usually make its way into Narragansett Bay north of the bay’s mouth
(NBNERR 2009). NMFS Northeast Region stated that the possibility may occur for the green sea turtle to
occur in New England waters, but that it is rare and sporadic (Colligan 2013).
Direct and indirect dredging impacts on sea turtles would be insignificant. Sea turtles are not known to be
vulnerable to capture in mechanical dredges. Additionally, even if a transient sea turtle were present, no
sea turtles are likely to be injured or killed as a result of dredging operations (Bullard 2014). The dredge
sites within the bay may provide suitable forage habitat for sea turtles; however, given the water depths in
those areas, it is unlikely that sea turtles would be present in the area. Opportunistic foraging may occur at
these sites and, thus, dredging could cause a short-term reduction in prey species through the alteration of
existing biotic assemblages and habitat. Any such reduction would be temporary and recolonization
would begin within two months (Bullard 2014). Sedimentation from dredging would be short-term, with
suspended sediment settling out of the water column within a few hours following dredging activities.
Therefore, any change in behavior due to the presence of suspended sediment is likely to be insignificant.
Draft EIS

11-56

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Similar to marine mammals and fish, in-water noise may also be audible to sea turtles within the vicinity
of the project area. Sea turtles are expected to avoid disturbing levels of sound originating from impulse
sources (O’Hara & Wilcox 1990; McCauley et al. 2000). There are currently no official threshold criteria
for either potential injury or behavioral disturbance/harassment for sea turtles. However, McCauley et al.
(2000) reported that impulsive source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS were required to induce a behavioral
reaction in captive green and loggerhead sea turtle. Based on this information, NMFS has determined that
source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS or greater could cause behavioral disturbance and/or other
behavioral or physiological impacts (Lecky 2009).
Therefore, based on the threshold level used by NMFS, there is the potential for disturbance of sea turtles
if impact pile-driving occurs when sea turtles are present in Narragansett Bay (early summer through late
fall). Based on the practical spreading loss model, it is expected that disturbance of sea turtles could
occur within 50 feet (15 meters) of active pile driving. It is likely that sea turtles would avoid the areas
where in-water construction was occurring. Therefore, it is expected that impacts on sea turtles would be
temporary and would result in temporary displacement during pile driving and construction activities.
However, large numbers of sea turtles are not expected to be exposed to pile driving noise during the time
frame of in-water work due to the limited spatial scale of the construction and the low density of sea
turtles within the Narragansett Bay and, in particular the habitat characteristics of the project area within
the vicinity of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. NMFS indicated that it is extremely unlikely that
sea turtles would occur within 0 to 66 feet (0 to 20 meters) of the pile driving, and therefore, would not be
exposed to underwater noise at or above the 166 dB re 1µPa RMS (Bullard 2014). No mitigation
measures were identified through consultation with NMFS.
Pursuant to the ESA, the Navy has determined that the disposal and reuse of the former Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the loggerhead, green, Kemp’s
ridley, or leatherback sea turtles. NMFS concurred with The Navy’s determination that implementation
of the disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property under Alternative 1 may affect, but is
not likely to adversely affect the loggerhead, green, Kemp’s ridley, and leatherback sea turtles (Bullard
2014). BMPs measures referenced by NMFS for sea turtles included implementing construction activities
between November and May (a period when listed species are not likely to be present) and the installation
of piles for the pier with an impact hammer (a technique that minimizes the generation of underwater
noise).
Atlantic Sturgeon
The Atlantic sturgeon is distributed within estuarine and marine waters along the entire East Coast and,
potentially, Narragansett Bay. Atlantic sturgeon travel wide ranges from their natal river. They spend
spring months spawning upriver where the salt front and fall line of large rivers meet and inhabit
estuarine and coastal waters when not spawning (NOAA Fisheries Office of Protected Resources 2012).
Due to their broad distribution, any individuals from the threatened population of Atlantic sturgeon of the
Gulf of Maine DPS or the endangered populations from the New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, South
Atlantic, and Carolina DPSs may occur in the waters of Narragansett Bay (Colligan 2013). Their reliance
on benthic organisms for food and their affinity for shallow nearshore areas may bring them to the waters
near the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The potential occurrence of Atlantic sturgeon near the
surplus property would include the juvenile adult life stages, juvenile Atlantic sturgeon can spend months
to years in estuaries. However, only transient Atlantic sturgeon are likely to be in the project area (Bullard
2014). It is expected that any adult Atlantic sturgeon potentially occurring in the vicinity of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property during in-water construction would avoid the areas; thus, impacts on the
Atlantic sturgeon from operation of construction equipment, including a mechanical dredge and pile
driving equipment and resulting increased turbidity levels would not be significant.

Draft EIS

11-57

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

Direct and indirect dredging impacts on sturgeon would be insignificant. It is likely that subadult or adult
Atlantic sturgeon would easily be able to avoid the dredge. Additionally, because no overwintering
sturgeon are likely to occur in the project area, there would be no increased risk of capture due to the lack
of overwintering areas in the project area (Bullard 2014). Similar to the discussion above for the sea
turtle, the dredge sites within the bay may provide suitable forage habitat for sturgeon. Opportunistic
foraging may occur at these sites and, thus, dredging could cause a short-term reduction in prey species
through the alteration of existing biotic assemblages and habitat. Any such reduction would be temporary
and recolonization would begin within two months (Bullard 2014). Sedimentation from dredging would
be short-term, with suspended sediment settling out of the water column within a few hours following
dredging activities.
Pile-driving activities associated with the proposed action under Alternative 1 would generate underwater
noise that the Atlantic sturgeon could be exposed to; however, no adverse effects on the sturgeon would
be expected. As noted above, Atlantic sturgeon would not be expected to come close to the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property during construction. Any Atlantic sturgeon present in the general vicinity
would be able to detect pile-driving noises, which may elicit an avoidance response. If they were present,
comparison of the established injury thresholds for fish and comparing them, the pile driving sound levels
(Table 7-12.3) indicates that the peak threshold for injury would not be exceeded as discussed in Section
11.12.1.2. There is a potential for impact based on accumulated SEL for a single pile within 33 feet of
active impact pile driving and behavioral disturbance with 83 feet of impact pile driving (Table 7.12-6).
Pursuant to the ESA, the Navy has determined that disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property may affect, but is not likely affect, the federally threatened Atlantic sturgeon. NMFS concurred
with this determination (Bullard 2014). BMPs and protective measures referenced by NMFS for Atlantic
sturgeon included implementing construction activities between November and May (a period when listed
species are not likely to be present) and the installation of piles for the pier with an impact hammer (a
technique that minimizes the generation of underwater noise).
Results of Threatened and Endangered Species Consultation
In a letter dated May 5, 2014, NMFS concluded that based on the analysis above, any effects on listed
species of sea turtles or Atlantic sturgeon would be insignificant or discountable; therefore, concurrence
was provided with the Navy’s determination that the proposed action may affect but is not likely to
adversely affect any listed species of sea turtle or Atlantic sturgeon under NMFS jurisdiction and that
consultation per Section 7 of the ESA has been completed (Bullard 2014). The consultation with the
USFWS regarding the northern long-eared bat is ongoing.
On January 9, 2013, the Navy submitted a letter to the RIDEM requesting information in regards to the
presence of any state listed species or unique natural communities within the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
site (Drozd 2013). The RIDEM responded that the department has no concerns related to state listed or
candidate rare, threatened or endangered species, unique natural communities or other significant wildlife
communities at or near the surplus properties at NAVSTA Newport (Jordan 2013).
Northern Long-Eared Bat
As discussed in Section 10.12.3, the northern long-eared bat has recently been listed by the USFWS as
threatened. The Navy has documented the presence of the northern long-eared bat within approximately
0.3 mile from the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, as discussed below.
According to the Final 4(d) Rule, one must determine whether a project is located within the white-nose
syndrome zone, which is an area comprising those counties within 150 miles of the boundaries of the U.S.
counties or Canadian districts where the fungus or white-nose syndrome has been detected (USFWS
2016). If a project is located within the white-nose syndrome zone, certain conservation measures that
Draft EIS

11-58

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

protect the bat’s most vulnerable life stages are required. Newport County is located within the
designated white-nose syndrome zone; therefore, informal or formal consultation with the USFWS is
required to protect northern long-eared bats.
Based on the results of passive acoustic monitoring, the Navy documented five call sequences for the
northern long-eared bat at Tank Farm 5, the closest monitoring site to the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property, in 2013. Of the 8,826 total call sequences reported at NAVSTA Newport from the passive
acoustic monitoring conducted for bats from 2009 to 2013, 73 calls were documented as non-specific
Myotis species calls, and 1,397 were documented as “unknown high-frequency” calls, which can be
attributable to Myotis (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014c). Northern long-eared bats were not captured during mist
netting conducted at Tank Farm 5 in 2013.
Based on a field survey conducted in December 2014 to determine the suitability of summer roosting
habitat for the northern long-eared bat, approximately 17 acres of suitable or potentially suitable summer
roosting habitat was identified at Tank Farm 5. Suitable summer roosting habitat was defined as trees
with the characteristics of northern long-eared bat roosting trees, described in Section 10.12.3.1.
Acoustic detections were made at Tank Farm 5, located across the Defense Highway from the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, but no mist-net capture or roost tree data are available for the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property. Therefore, the potential effects of the proposed action include permanent
loss of potential roosting habitat and potential impacts on foraging habitats. Approximately 17 acres of
suitable summer roosting habitat was identified at Tank Farm 5. Therefore, the potential effects of the
proposed action include permanent loss of potential roosting habitat and potential impacts on foraging
habitats. According to the USFWS Final 4(d) rule, tree clearing within 150-feet of a known maternal
roost is limited to those months outside the pup period (June 1 – July 31) and no tree clearing is allowed
within a 0.25-mile of a hibernacula (USFWS 2016).
During the initial informal consultation process, prior to issuance of the final 4(d) rule, the Navy has
proposed measures to protect the northern long-eared bat’s most vulnerable life stages and ensure that
reuse of the property does not result in the direct take of northern long-eared bats. These include certain
conservation measures or BMPs as recommended deed restrictions for the future developer(s)/property
owners of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
These recommended measures would be the
responsibility of the developer(s)/property owners to implement as part of development and construction:
•

Project activities must occur more than 0.25 miles from known, occupied hibernacula.

•

All on-site tree and vegetation clearing shall take place in the timeframe between October
1st – April 15th (Chapman 2015).

Therefore the Navy has determined that the implementation of the proposed action may affect but is not
likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat. The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding its
concurrence on the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared bat at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property (Preston 2015b). The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding the potential
presence of the northern long-eared bat at the surplus properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston 2015a). The
Navy received a response from the USFWS via electronic mail requesting that the Navy initiate informal
consultation and provide additional information about the potential effects of the proposed action on the
northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015). The Navy provided an assessment of the potential impacts
on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). To date, USFWS has not provided a response, and further informal
consultation with the USFWS on the potential effects of the proposed action on the northern long-eared
bat is ongoing. ESA consultation for northern long-eared bat is ongoing. As part of any future state and
federal CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 CWA permitting processes, the developer will implement

measures to protect northern long-eared bat as needed to ensure the development is conducted in
compliance with the ESA. Pursuant to ESA, the Navy has determined that the proposed action may affect,
but is not likely to adversely affect the northern long-eared bat under Alternative 1 at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property. The evaluation of impacts and potential for adverse effects to the northern
long-eared bat will be updated upon completion of consultation with the USFWS; the ESA consultation is
ongoing.
11.12.1.4 Significant Wildlife Habitat
Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
Alternative 1 would not result in any impacts on SAV at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The
eelgrass beds that are located along the waterfront near the shoreline park would not be disturbed during
construction of the pier because the development footprint, as assessed in this EIS, does not overlap with
the mapped locations of SAV.
Wetlands
Alternative 1 would not result in any impact on wetlands. The site does not contain wetlands.
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. Alternative 1 would not have any
impact on vernal pools.
Essential Fish Habitat
As noted in Section 10.12, EFH for 17 species is found off the coast of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. The proposed action would have minor temporary effects on EFH species and their habitat
under Alternative 1. These short-term adverse effects, however, would be localized, as described above
for other marine wildlife.
During construction a volume of sediment at least equivalent to the volume of pilings below the
subsurface would be displaced as the pilings are embedded in the bottom sediments. The displacement of
this sediment volume would increase suspended sediment and turbidity within the water column habitat
during the pile-driving operation, but it would be localized in the project area and would settle soon
thereafter (i.e., typically within one to several hours). Water column habitat would be affected, as would
habitat serving as EFH for some species.
The portions of benthic communities within the footprint of the individual piles supporting the fishing
pier and floating piers, as well as in the proposed area for dredging, would likely be destroyed, resulting
in a minor, permanent loss of benthic substrate in the Narragansett Bay. (Impacts on benthic habitat and
species are discussed in Section 11.12.1.2, Benthic Organisms.)
Marine fish use aquatic vegetation habitat for foraging and refuge. One of the most important marine
vegetation types in the marine ecosystem is eelgrass. This environment is the habitat of various life stages
of many marine species, including shellfish such as crabs and bivalves. The proposed redevelopment of
the former Midway Pier at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be located within the same
footprint as the existing pier. This would result in approximately 0.005 acres of disturbance of seafloor.
However, the eelgrass beds that are located along the waterfront near the proposed shoreline park would
not be directly impacted during construction of the pier because the development footprint does not
overlap with the mapped locations of eelgrass. Therefore, no impacts on the HAPCs designated for
eelgrass within the summer flounder EFH would occur.

Draft EIS

11-60

March 2016

Midway Pier/Greene Lane Property

At the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, the pier currently at the site would be reconstructed within the
existing pier footprint. This pier would be fixed, not floating. The elevation would allow sufficient light to
diffuse and refract under the pier. Furthermore, the existing pier is located far enough from nearby
eelgrass beds that overshading from the reconstructed pier is unlikely to significantly impact the summer
flounder HAPC in Narragansett Bay. (See Appendix A and the informal consultation letter to NMFS
dated March 27, 2014, for additional background information regarding potential impacts of shading.)
Designated EFH within the vicinity of each project site would be affected as a result of temporary
disturbance and displacement of fish, temporary increase in sediment loads and turbidity in the water
column, and a minor but permanent disruption of benthic communities within the footprint of the
individual piles and dredged area. The effects would generally be minor and short term, and would be
further offset by implementation of mitigation measures. No eelgrass beds would be directly impacted by
the proposed activity. In its response to the Navy’s informal consultation letter, NMFS indicated that it
cannot concur with the Navy’s determination that the project would have minimal impacts on EFH due to
the lack of specific project details (i.e., specific project design and/or engineering plans that indicate the
exact location of proposed piers and in-water work, location and amount of material to be dredged, etc.).
Additional project-specific details would be made available prior to the construction of the in-water
components of the proposed action by the future developer(s). At such time, authorization from the
USACE under Section 404 of the CWA and/or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 would
be required. These USACE authorizations would be expected to trigger the requirement to consult with
NMFS under the MSFCMA, where any potential effects on EFH would be minimized through the
development of BMPs, to minimize adverse impacts on EFH. Pursuant to the MSFCMA, the Navy has
determined that the project would not adversely affect designated EFH in the Narragansett Bay.

11.12.2 Alternative 2
11.12.2.1 Vegetation
Similar to Alternative 1, the proposed development for Alternative 2 would have minimal impact on
vegetation. As such, implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to result in significant long-term
impacts on vegetation. The increased size of the shoreline park features (i.e., parking, playground and
picnic area) would be accommodated in previously developed areas. Therefore, the terrestrial impacts
under Alternative 2 are the same as under Alternative 1. Table 11.12-2 identifies the habitat cover types
impacted by the redevelopment of Alternative 2 at this property.

impacts).

11.12.2.2 Wildlife
Similar to Alternative 1, due to the limited new development along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property, impacts on wildlife would be minimal and limited to minor temporary disturbances during
construction.
Terrestrial Mammals
Alternative 2 would result in temporary displacement of terrestrial mammals in the vicinity of the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property (see Section 11.12.1.2 for further discussion on potential impacts on
terrestrial mammals). Minor impacts would result (see Section 11.12.1.2 above).
Marine Mammals
The impacts associated with the in-water construction of Alternative 1 also apply to Alternative 2, as
discussed in Section 11.12.1.2. The extent of these impacts would be slightly increased as a result of the
increase in proposed in-water construction for the expansion of the additional floating concrete pier. The
additional floating pier would measure 8 feet by 50 feet and would be constructed at the end of the rebuilt
pier.
Measures to reduce impacts on marine mammals would be implemented by the developer through state
and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA. This would result in
the future developer’s coordination with NMFS under the ESA and MMPA to minimize impacts on
regulated marine mammals. Pursuant to the MMPA, the Navy concluded the proposed action would be
unlikely to result in a take of a marine mammal. Therefore, the disposal and reuse of the Midway
Pier/Greene Land property under Alternative 2 would have minor impacts on marine mammals.
Other Marine Wildlife
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have minor short-term impacts on finfish, shellfish, crustacean,
and benthic resources in Narragansett Bay, similar to those discussed for Alternative 1. However, as the
extent of the proposed in-water construction is greater under Alternative 2 than Alternative 1, the
potential impacts on these resources would be greater. The additional floating pier would measure 8 feet
by 50 feet and would be constructed at the end of the rebuilt pier. The impacts associated with the inwater construction of Alternative 1 also apply to Alternative 2, as discussed in Section 11.2.1.2.
Alternative 2 would result in minor impacts on other marine life and fish, and BMPs developed through
the future developers consultations with the USACE under the CWA and NMFS under the ESA and
MMPA, will ensure that no significant impacts occur to other marine wildlife.
Herpetofauna
Impacts on herpetofauna as a result of Alternative 2 would be similar to those listed under Alternative 1.
Avian Species
Similar to Alternative 1, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in short-term impacts, such as
displacement. The future developer would be required to minimize impacts on migratory birds as
required under state and federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA.
Pursuant to the MBTA and BGEPA, the Navy has determined that implementation of Alternative 1 would
have minor impacts on avian species and the disposal and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property
would not result in significant impacts on, or harm of, migratory birds and bald and golden eagles.
Benthic Organisms
Under Alternative 2, the proposed installations would have minor short-term impacts on benthic resources
in Narragansett Bay, similar to those discussed for Alternative 1. The extent of these impacts would be

slightly more as a result of the increase in proposed in-water construction for the expansion of the pier
and the additional floating concrete pier.
11.12.2.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
Under Alternative 2, impacts on federally listed threatened and endangered species would be the same as
those discussed under Alternative 1.
11.12.2.3.1
Federally Listed Species
Impacts on the federally listed threatened northern long-eared bat would be the same as those discussed
under Alternative 1 because the acreage of old field to be lost under both alternatives is the roughly the
same.
11.12.2.4 Significant Wildlife Habitat
Submerged Aquatic Vegetation
Alternative 2 would not result in any impacts on SAV at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The
eelgrass beds that are located along the waterfront near the shoreline park would not be disturbed during
construction of the pier because the development footprint does not overlap with the mapped locations of
SAV.
Wetlands
Construction of the pilings under Alternative 2 would impact approximately 0.01 acres of the
marine/estuarine wetlands associated with the former Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. The developer
would be required to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on wetlands as required under state and
federal permitting processes of the CRMC/SAMP and Section 404 of the CWA (see Section 11.11 for a
discussion of required wetland permit and a discussion of wetland impact mitigation).
Vernal Pools
There are no vernal pools at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
Essential Fish Habitat
Implementation of Alternative 2 would have minor, short-term impacts on EFH resources at the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, similar to Alternative 1. However, the extent of the proposed in-water
construction and expansion of the existing pier with the addition of a floating concrete pier would result
in slightly more minor and short-term impacts on EFH resources. There would be no significant longterm adverse impacts on fish or their respective EFH. The future developer’s consultation with the
USACE under the CWA and NMFS under the MSFCMA would ensure the development of BMPs to
minimize any adverse effects to EFH. Pursuant to the MSFCMA, the Navy has determined that the
project would not adversely affect designated EFH in the Narragansett Bay.

11.12.3 No Action Alternative
11.12.3.1 Vegetation
Under the No Action alternative, the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be retained by the U.S.
government in caretaker status; no redevelopment would occur. The vegetation along the corridor would
be left in a natural state, with no management, and the various habitat types would not be anticipated to
change in habitat quality.

status. Overall wildlife abundance would likely increase as a result of continued lack of human activity.
Diversity would likely remain constant, as the variety of habitats along the corridor would be maintained.
11.12.3.3 Threatened and Endangered Species
Under the No Action alternative, the property would be retained by the U.S. government in caretaker
status. The potential for the federally listed endangered northern long-eared bat to be present on the site
along with other federal or state-listed species would continue to exist at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property.
11.12.3.4 Significant Wildlife Habitat
The SAV, marine/estuarine wetlands, and EFH that currently exists off the shore of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property is likely to improve in quality over time, with continued limited use of the
area.

12 Regional Air Quality Impact Analysis

This section presents the air quality impact of the total emissions of criteria pollutant and GHG emissions
projected from the redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval Hospital
property, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. Emissions of HAPs from the
proposed action would be negligible and so these have not been quantified. This section provides a
summary of the total estimated emissions associated with the action at all the surplus properties.
(Note: Section 3.6 describes the existing air quality in the region, applicable air quality regulations and
requirements, and methods used to assess the environmental consequences. Sections 5.6, 7.6, 9.6, and
11.6 describe the projected emissions from construction and operation of the Redevelopment Plan at the
individual locations: the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval Hospital property, Tank Farms 1
and 2, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, respectively.)

12.1 Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative)
Construction Emissions
Total annual construction emission estimates for each property are summarized in Sections 5.6, 7.6, 9.6,
and 11.6. Emissions would occur from demolition, construction equipment, construction materials
delivery, demolition material removal, construction employee commute, and dust from ground
disturbance. These emissions would be temporary and localized. Since full build-out of the
Redevelopment Plan is assumed to occur over 20 years, it is also not likely that these construction
emissions would occur within the same year at all locations or at the same time as the operational
emissions. Thus, construction emissions were evaluated individually for each property. Construction
emissions under Alternative 1 at each surplus property would be similar or slightly less than emissions
from Alternative 2. See Section 12.2 Alternative 2 for estimated construction emissions for each
property.
Operational Emissions
Operational emissions from building energy use and increased vehicle traffic have been calculated for all
surplus properties. Emissions from building energy use include the direct use of fuel oil and/or natural
gas—primarily for heating—as well as the indirect use of electricity. As evaluated in the draft Traffic
Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare
Corporation 2013), vehicle traffic would increase by establishing residential, industrial, and retail land
uses, resulting in an increase in vehicle emissions. Table 12.1-1 summarizes total annual operational
emissions that would result from the proposed action under Alternative 1. These emissions would occur
after full build-out of Alternative 1 at all locations.
To mitigate operational emissions, buildings can be designed to meet stringent energy-efficiency
standards. Implementing traffic-easing roadway designs to lower vehicle speed and reduce congestion, in
addition to expanding public transportation and carpooling programs, could reduce vehicle emissions.

12.2 Alternative 2

Alternative 2 provides for the disposal of the surplus property at NAVSTA Newport and redevelopment
at a higher density than Alternative 1, which would result in more construction and operational emissions
from larger buildings and more vehicle trips, compared with Alternative 1.

12.3 Conformity Applicability and Impact Assessment

Following the disposal of the NAVSTA Newport surplus properties, the Navy would not retain control of
the properties and implementation of either Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 would not be considered a
federal action; therefore the General Conformity Rule would not apply. In addition, Rhode Island is in
attainment for all current NAAQS. Rhode Island had previously been designated nonattainment for the
1997 ozone standard; however, on March 6, 2015, the EPA revoked the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS (80
FR 12264; Federal Register 2015. Although the General Conformity Rule does not apply to the
redevelopment, the rule presents conservative thresholds that can be used to determine the potential air
quality impact significance of a proposed action. As a result, the analysis was completed for emissions
resulting from construction and operations at full build-out, and annual emission totals were compared
with General Conformity Rule thresholds.
The data shown in sections 5.6, 7.6, 9.6, and 11.6 indicate that temporary emissions from construction at
each of the surplus properties under either alternative would be below the General Conformity Rule de
minimis thresholds. Tables 12-1 and 12-2 show that annual operational emission increases that result
from total changes at all surplus properties under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 are also below these
thresholds, and changes in air quality would not be significant as a result of this action.

12.4 GHG Emissions and Climate Change

Office of the Chief of Naval Operations Manual M-5090.1 (January 10, 2014) states that the Navy must
address the effects of climate change, identifying and quantifying GHG emissions (where possible) that
may be generated in executing the proposed action, and also describing the beneficial activities being
implemented Navy-wide to reduce GHG emissions. The guidance also requires the Navy to consult the
latest guidance on climate change from the CEQ.
In December 2014, the CEQ issued new draft guidance “to provide Federal agencies direction on when
and how to consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their evaluation of proposed
federal actions in accordance with NEPA and CEQ Regulations implementing the NEPA” (CEQ 2014).
While this guidance is in draft form, “[it] does not change or substitute for any law, regulation, or of
legally binding agreement and is not legally enforceable,” it is intended to describe controlling
requirements under the terms of NEPA and the CEQ regulations (CEQ 2014). The analysis of this action

Draft EIS

12-3

March 2016

has considered the recommendations in this guidance and has included the quantitative and qualitative
review and documentation of GHG emissions and climate change effects for the action.
GHG emissions were estimated for the energy usage in new buildings and for increased vehicle use in the
region associated with the action. Energy use was calculated as described in Chapter 3, and EPA emission
factors have been used to estimate GHG emissions (see Appendix D-1 for detailed assumptions and
calculations). Table 12.4-1 provides a summary of estimated annual GHG emissions that would result
from the full implementation of the proposed action at all surplus properties.

GHG emissions that could result from Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 would be less than 25,000 metric
tons annually under either alternative. While CEQ guidance has noted that the 25,000 metric ton level is
not a threshold for NEPA review, but a threshold for quantifying emissions, it provides a frame of
reference for considering significance of impacts. These totals are from direct and indirect, stationary and
mobile sources associated with the implementation of this project, and they represent about a tenth of a
percent of the state of Rhode Island’s total annual GHG emissions. There would be no new sources that
would require reporting or GHG emission mitigation.
GHG emissions from construction would not be from stationary sources, would be temporary, and would
also be minimal.
GHG construction emissions can be mitigated by using the most efficient equipment available, sourcing
construction materials locally, and implementing a waste management program in order to recycle as
much C & D debris as possible. To mitigate operational emissions, buildings can be designed to meet
energy-efficiency standards. The Department of the Navy has certified more than 30 military construction
projects using the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy Efficient Design (LEED)
program, ensuring energy-efficient construction (U.S. Department of the Navy 2015). Including a 1 MW
photovoltaic solar array would offset some of the electricity needed for the new buildings at Tank Farms
1 and 2. Implementing traffic-easing roadway designs to lower vehicle speed and reduce congestion, in
addition to expanding public transportation and carpooling programs, would reduce vehicle emissions.
The 2014 INRMP includes a discussion of future climate change trends, with a focus on storm surge and
the installation’s vulnerability. By the end of this century in Rhode Island, sea level is projected to
increase by 3 to 5 feet above levels observed in the 1990s, and storm surges associated with more intense
hurricanes is expected to be 2 to 4 feet above sea level (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a). Sea level rise and storm
surge projections were completed for NAVSTA Newport and show a range of sea level rise above mean
higher high water (MHHW) along a thin band along the coastline of the former Naval Hospital property
from 1foot above sea level to 3 feet above sea level, with areas that could be affected by a 3-foot storm
Draft EIS

12-4

March 2016

surge. At the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, a similar range of sea level rise above MHHW is
projected, as well as a 4-foot storm surge (Tetra Tech 2014a). No sea level rise or storm surge concerns
are projected for the former Navy Lodge and Tank Farms 1 and 2 because they lie more inland.
A future project has been identified for the installation to develop a climate change vulnerability
assessment and adaptation plan. The results of this assessment can be used to develop installation-specific
climate adaptation strategies. The assessment and adaptation plan will include a detailed analysis of
installation resources that are at risk from climate change and will also address sea-level rise scenarios,
potential flood zone shifts caused by the sea-level rise scenarios, and an evaluation of risk to hazardous
waste and oils locations from sea-level rise, storm surge, and flood zone shifts (Tetra Tech, Inc. 2014a).

12.5 No Action Alternative

Under the No Action alternative, there would be no new stationary or mobile sources of criteria, HAPs, or
GHG emissions from the surplus properties, and the No Action alternative would not change existing air
quality in the Newport, RI region.

13 Cumulative Impacts

This section examines the potential cumulative effects of the disposal and reuse of surplus property at
NAVSTA Newport. This cumulative impact analysis was developed to be consistent with guidance
published by the CEQ (1997b) and the EPA (1999). In addition, the CEQ issued further guidance to
federal agencies in June 2005 regarding the consideration of past actions in cumulative effects analyses.
The guidance directs the agency preparing a NEPA document to determine the relevant information
pertaining to past actions that could be useful in illuminating or predicting the reasonably foreseeable
direct and indirect effects of a proposed action.
CEQ regulations stipulate that the cumulative effects analysis within an EIS should consider the potential
environmental impacts resulting from “the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,
present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such
other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7). Recent CEQ guidance in considering cumulative effects involves
defining the scope of the other actions and their interrelationship with the proposed action. The scope
must consider geographical and temporal overlaps among the proposed action and other actions. It must
also evaluate the nature of interactions among these actions. Cumulative effects are most likely to arise
when a relationship or synergy exists between the proposed action and other actions expected to occur in
a similar location or during a similar time period. Actions overlapping with or in proximity to the
proposed action would be expected to have more potential for a relationship than those geographically
separated.
Research, literature reviews, and contacts with applicable government and nongovernment agencies were
used to determine impacts and to identify past, present, and future actions within the project area.

13.1 Cumulative Impact Study Area

The study area for this cumulative impacts analysis was identified by first determining the geographic
area that includes the resources that would be directly affected by the proposed action and, second, by
extending the boundaries of the initial geographic area to include the same and other resources affected by
the combined impacts of the project and other actions. The geographic range varies depending on the
resource area analyzed; resource-specific geographic study areas are specifically described. The
cumulative impact analysis is an analysis of resource areas that can be evaluated meaningfully and that
are of concern to resource agencies, local officials, and/or the public. Resource areas evaluated here for
cumulative impacts include land use and zoning, transportation, environmental management, air quality,
utilities and infrastructure, water resources, and biological resources. The cumulative impact analysis
includes a description and evaluation of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions that
could potentially have direct or indirect impacts in combination with the proposed action on these
resource areas.

13.2 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Navy representatives met with municipal officials to identify and discuss any recently completed or
reasonably foreseeable future actions in the vicinity of the surplus property. Available land uses and
development plans and project-specific documents were also reviewed to identify other reasonably
foreseeable future actions near the surplus property. Additionally, NAVSTA Newport documents and
plans were reviewed for Navy-specific projects. Specific projects or actions that were either recently
implemented (past), currently ongoing (present), or considered reasonably foreseeable in the future are
listed and described in Table 13-1. The locations of these projects in relation to the surplus property at
NAVSTA Newport are shown on Figure 13-1.

This section identifies foreseeable non-project actions and long-term trends in or near the study area that
may pose a cumulative effect on the resources, ecosystems, and human environment in the project area
when considered with the effects of the proposed action. Actions are considered reasonably foreseeable
future actions if they have been formally proposed; if plans, plats, or concepts have been prepared; or if
the relevant authorization and/or permits have been obtained but construction has not yet started.
Additionally, due to the uncertainty in the regional economy and ability to secure funding, several
projects listed in Table 13-1 still in the preliminary planning stages are included in the analysis. These
projects have been marked with an asterisk in the discussion below.

13.2.1

U.S. Navy – NAVSTA Newport

13.2.1.1 Other BRAC Actions
The 2005 BRAC Commission realigned several tenants to and from NAVSTA Newport. Incoming
tenants included Rhode Island Army Reserves; the Center for Service Support (CSS); Marine
Detachment (MARDET) Athens; Navy Support Corps School (NSCS); Navy Array Technical Support
Center (NATSC) and other command, control, communications, computers, surveillance, and
reconnaissance functions at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC); and Officer Training
Command (OTC)-Pensacola. Also, the following outgoing realignments were implemented: Chaplains
School (CHAPS), Naval Reserve Readiness Command (REDCOM), and Navy Warfare Development
Command (NWDC) (EDAW/AECOM 2008). These realignments led to population changes at NAVSTA
Newport in 2011. Table 13-2 shows the population changes from these realignments.

The realignments that occurred under the 2005 BRAC Law resulted in new construction at NAVSTA
Newport in preparation for the incoming personnel and missions; all of these projects were completed in
2011 (Sullivan 2013). The projects in relation to BRAC construction (BRACCON) included:

Draft EIS

•

P101: Construction of a Naval Supply Corps School Building, a 58,000 square foot, twostory structure. A classroom, multipurpose spaces, a library and instructor offices were
constructed in addition to renovations to Building 1112 to accommodate MARDET
Athens.

•

P104: Renovation of 20,204 square feet of Fitzgerald Hall (Building 1183) to
accommodate CSS uses.

Farms 3 and 4. The Town of Portsmouth has developed some concepts for the Melville Backyard and
Tank Farms 3 and 4, which are addressed in Section 13.2.4.
13.2.1.2

MILCONs and Other Projects

MILCON
Military construction (MILCON) projects include construction projects for all types of buildings, roads,
airfield pavements, and utility systems costing $750,000 or more, including construction work necessary
to produce a complete and usable facility or complete and usable improvement to an existing facility.
MILCON projects were identified as part of NAVSTA Newport’s facilities master plan, Naval Station
Newport Vision 2035, Master Plan, Newport, Rhode Island (EDAW/AECOM 2008). The plan identifies
both programmed and unprogrammed projects.
Since the development of the plan, nine MILCON projects have been completed (Sullivan 2013; 2015).
They include a vehicular bridge (P339); 15,522 square feet of construction for a training pool replacement
(P370); 11,916 square feet for hazardous materials storage, including demolition of Building 1166
(P448); construction of a 66,892 square foot fitness facility and gym (P347); construction of new OTC
bachelor quarters (P451); improvements to Tomich Hall (P482); relocation of the Naval Academy
Preparatory School (P485); construction of a new electromagnetic sensor facility (P068); and renovations
and construction at Building 119 (P082) (EDAW/AECOM 2008; Sullivan 2015). One other MILCON
project is currently under way at NAVSTA Newport, a re-bulkheading of the quay wall between Piers 1
and 2 to prevent erosion (P469); in addition, one demolition project has been awarded (P346) (Sullivan
2015). In addition, there is a funded project to demolish tanks and associated facilities at Tank Farm 1,
with the scheduled work to be completed in 2016.
Twenty-two projects have not yet been funded at NAVSTA Newport. They are summarized below in
Table 13-3 (also see Table 13-1 for additional detail).

Other Large Projects
Construction of a U.S. Coast Guard facility was completed in December, 2015. This new facility
replaced the maintenance augmentation team facility located in Building 68 on Pier 2 (Sullivan 2013;
2015).
A new visitor quarters (VQ) will be constructed at NAVSTA Newport and this project includes the
completed demolition of Building 444. The new VQ is intended to be a 200-room visitor quarters.
Construction of the VQ is anticipated to be completed in summer/late fall 2016 (Sullivan 2015).
The Navy proposes to allow up to 120 acres to be developed by an independently operated commercial
power utility for the construction, operation, and decommissioning of a solar PV facility at one or more
sites at NAVSTA Newport. Renewable energy generated by the solar PV facilities would be used by the
Navy for operations and activities at NAVSTA Newport. NAVSTA Newport identified three on-station
sites (Tank Farm 4, 5, and the McAllister Point Landfill) and three PPV housing sites (Coddington Cove,
Greene Lane, and Melville) that could accommodate a utility-scale solar PV facility project. If a solar PV
facility is constructed at each of the proposed sites, approximately 31 MW of electricity would be
generated.

13.2.2

Rhode Island Department of Transportation

Pell Bridge Access Improvements
In July 2011, the Aquidneck Island Planning Commission (AIPC) published the Aquidneck Island
Transportation Study. As part of this study, the AIPC developed a conceptual plan for Pell Bridge access
improvements. The plan includes a new two-way connection along J.T. Connell Highway through Van
Zandt Avenue; removing a ramp and reconfiguring the downtown Newport off-ramp to provide more
storage for vehicles on ramp; widening J.T. Connell Highway to four lanes from Admiral Kalbfus Road
to a new connector east of J.T. Connell Highway; constructing four additional roundabouts with medians

Draft EIS

13-14

March 2016

for access management; and removing the elevated highway, which would create land for redevelopment
(Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. 2011). At the time of the development of the transportation study, the
Pell Bridge access improvements project was still in the conceptual stages. The City of Newport is
advancing a concept in which Pell Bridge access ramps would be redeveloped by RIDOT as part of the
development of the Newport Innovation Hub (Carroll 2015) (see Section 13.2.5).

13.2.3

Town of Middletown

13.2.3.1 Large-scale Projects
Two large-scale projects have been formally proposed in planning documents for the Town of
Middletown.
The West Main/Coddington Development Center consists of four parcels that total approximately 14
acres: the former Navy Lodge, the town’s recreation complex, Middletown Public Library, and the former
JFK Elementary School. The preferred scenario for the West Main/Coddington Development Center
would include a mix of uses, including civic (50,000 square feet), retail (80,000 square feet), office
(45,000 square feet), and residential (175 units), along with streetscaping and parking (Vanasse Hangen
Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates, Inc. 2011). The town administration has proposed funding in the
2016 fiscal year budget to continue work to implement the plan. The project relies on the release of three
acres of Navy-owned land to the town.
The Atlantic Beach District Master Plan (Maguire Group and Gates Leighton & Associates 2007) was
created to guide the redevelopment of the Atlantic Beach District, located in the southern end of
Middletown adjacent to the City of Newport boundary and on the east side of Easton Pond, to a
pedestrian-oriented commercial area. The plan recommends a series of roadway and other public
improvements, including the following (Maguire Group and Gates Leighton & Associates 2007):
•

Roundabout at Valley Road and Aquidneck Avenue – Create a roundabout at this
intersection.

•

Sidewalks and new lane configuration for Aquidneck Avenue – Create a more pedestrianfriendly concept along Aquidneck Avenue, including increasing the width of the
sidewalks to 6 feet on the east side.

•

Create a park on Newport Avenue at the intersection of Newport and Aquidneck
Avenues. Excess right-of-way would be used to create a park of approximately 8,900
square feet.

•

Reconfiguration of Crescent Road – Make this roadway a one-way road and reconfigure
the intersection of Crescent Road with Aquidneck Avenue to provide a 90-degree
intersection.

•

Reconfiguration of the intersection of Aquidneck Avenue and Purgatory Road – Create a
“bump-out” in front of the Atlantic Beach Club to provide additional pedestrian space.

•

Improvements to a public parking lot and pedestrian bridge at Dunlap-Wheeler Park –
Reconfigure the parking lot and construct a new bridge connecting the boardwalk at
Easton’s Beach to the park.

RIDOT is expected to begin work to improve four intersections in the district in 2016 (Wolanski 2015),
and the Town of Middletown continues to seek funding for the remaining roadway and public
improvements (Wolanski 2013).

13.2.3.2 Potential Future Redevelopment
There are additional projects that show redevelopment potential in the Town of Middletown.
West Main Road and Browns Lane Retail Development
A project on a 70-acre parcel of land roughly bounded by West Main Road and Browns Lane is in the
planning stages. The proposed project includes more than 400,000 square feet of retail development. A
legal proceeding concluded with the court remanding the development application to the town for
consideration, but the applicant has yet to advance the project and it is unknown whether the project will
proceed (Wolanksi 2015).
Subdivision at Bailey Avenue and Sachuest Drive
The town approved a plan to build 12-lot subdivision at the terminus of Bailey Avenue where Sachuest
Drive begins. Development has yet to start (Wolanski 2015).
Light Industrial Redevelopment on West Main Road
A 24-acre property located on West Main Road roughly opposite Marshall Lane is zoned for light
industrial use and offers significant development (Pare Corporation 2013). A plan for development of a
self-storage facility was approved, but the applicant has yet to proceed (Wolanski 2015).
Convenience Store and Gas Station Renovation and Expansion
A special use permit was requested for the renovation and expansion of a Cumberland Farms retail store
and gasoline dispensing facility on Aquidneck Avenue. The project is being reviewed by the town.

13.2.4

Town of Portsmouth

O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment
A parcel of land next to Weaver Cove could be redeveloped to include approximately 900 boat slips and
900 dwelling unit facilities. The majority of development is proposed along the shore of Weaver Cove,
south of Melville, with a small portion on the parcel of land immediately east of Defense Highway (Pare
Corporation 2013). The last project-related activities occurred in April 2014 (Crosby 2015).
Development of Melville Backyard Property
The NAVSTA Newport Melville Backyard property is approximately 32 acres located at the northern end
of the installation. NAVSTA Newport intends to dispose of the property as surplus sometime in the
future. The property, located west of Alexander Road, is bounded by Alden Way to the south and the
Melville Marina to the north. This parcel is zoned as vacant land but the adjacent parcels are zoned for
developed recreation. Various concepts for development have been discussed to date, although no plans
are currently being reviewed (Pare Corporation 2013). The developer and RIDEM are in discussions
regarding cleanup of the property (Crosby 2015).
Potential Sale of Raytheon Property
Raytheon has been actively trying to sell three buildings on the southeast corner of their property along
with an undisclosed amount of land surrounding the buildings located on West Main Road. The town has
been made aware of potential buyers (Crosby 2015). This area could be redeveloped into any number of
uses, including light manufacturing, a technical school, or indoor storage (Pare Corporation 2013).

13.2.5

City of Newport

Several projects in the City of Newport are anticipated; however, none of these are currently programmed
or funded. Projects with higher likelihood to move forward are discussed below.

Draft EIS

Redevelopment as Part of Pell Bridge Realignment
A Statewide Planning Challenge Grant was awarded to the City of Newport to complete a detailed
planning assessment, market review, circulation and parking review, and a reuse plan for lands adjacent to
the Pell Bridge Ramp, J.T. Connell Highway interchange, and Naval Health Clinic–New England (Bronk
2012). As indicated in the North End Master Plan (City of Newport 2006), the approximately 32 acres
comprising several parcels near the Pell Bridge Realignment are recommended for redevelopment. The
city has been working with Matrix Design Group of Colorado on the development of an integrated project
to position the potential redevelopment of the bridge ramps as part of a larger mixed-use resilience
innovation hub development. Activities to date include a SWOT analysis, draft of new zoning for the
area around the ramps from Commercial/Industrial to Commercial Technology zoning, public outreach,
development of an investment portfolio document and a Request for Proposals for potential developers
(Carroll 2015).
Adaptive Reuse of Surplus School Buildings
Due to shifts in demographics and a decrease in the school-age population, the City of Newport is
proceeding with adaptive reuse of surplus school buildings designated as excess by the City of Newport
(DeIonno 2013). The former Carey Elementary School has been redeveloped as condos and is no longer
city property; Sheffield School is being converted to a technology accelerator with expected completion
in fall 2016; and reuse and market analysis is being conducted for four other schools (Carroll 2015).

13.3 Cumulative Impact Analysis

This section identifies the cumulative effects associated with redevelopment of surplus properties at
NAVSTA Newport and the projects listed above in Section 13.2. This analysis focuses on the human
environment. If redevelopment of surplus properties does not result in a direct or indirect impact, then no
further analysis of potential cumulative effects is necessary. The following resources have been included
in the cumulative effects analysis:

13.3.1

•

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

•

Transportation

•

Environmental Management

•

Air Quality

•

Infrastructure and Utilities

•

Cultural Resources

•

Water Resources

•

Biological Resources.

Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources

13.3.1.1 Geographic Study Area
The geographic study area for land use included the City of Newport and Towns of Middletown and
Portsmouth. Because the surplus properties are currently not in use and would be transferred from Navy
to local government ownership, the proposed action under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 would have no
direct impacts on land use on NAVSTA Newport. Redevelopment of the surplus properties would have
indirect impacts on land use on NAVSTA Newport because they are located next to portions of either the
active installation or military housing areas. These indirect impacts would be in the form of increased
traffic (see Section 13.3.2.2 for a discussion of transportation cumulative impacts). Therefore, the

Draft EIS

13-17

March 2016

installation is not included in the study area for cumulative impacts on land use. The geographic study
area for coastal resources included portions of the City of Newport, the Towns of Middletown and
Portsmouth, and NAVSTA Newport in the 200-foot contiguous zone of Narragansett Bay.
13.3.1.2 Cumulative Impact Analysis
To assess cumulative impacts on land use, the following actions were considered:
•

Future actions that would convert existing land uses to new uses. Projects identified
include new mixed-use, marina-related, residential, commercial, and industrial
development, which could result in changes in land use types, and state and local
transportation projects, which could result in indirect land use impacts.

•

Future actions that would convert or expand existing land uses in the 200-foot contiguous
zone of Narragansett Bay and, therefore, would require state-permitting or a federal
consistency determination. Projects identified include marina-related, residential,
recreational, and various federal development and redevelopment projects.

The proposed action would result in the transfer of approximately 158 acres of federal land to local
governments, including approximately 8.3 acres to the City of Newport, approximately 13.7 acres to the
Town of Middletown, and approximately 136 acres to the Town of Portsmouth.
Under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2, existing land use for the surplus properties would change. The
former Navy Lodge property would be incorporated into the Town of Middletown, and the vacant
property would be converted to commercial use. The former Naval Hospital property would be
incorporated into the City of Newport and converted to a mixed-use development. Tank Farms 1 and 2
would be incorporated into the Town of Portsmouth. Portions of the tank farms would be converted to
office, light industrial, marina-related, and infrastructure uses, while the remainder would be preserved as
open space. The Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be incorporated into the Town of Middletown
and converted to recreational use or preserved as open space. Under the No Action alternative, land use
on the surplus properties would not change. The surplus properties would remain under the ownership of
the U.S. government in caretaker status, and public access would be prohibited.
The majority of the state, local, and private projects identified in Section 13.2 would result in changes in
land use in the study area, either through development of vacant land or redevelopment of developed land.
Many of these projects would be small-scale and would not be located adjacent to the surplus properties.
Compliance with local zoning ordinances would be expected to ensure consistency of these projects with
existing land uses in the study area and local land use controls.
In addition, several larger planned development and redevelopment projects are located near the surplus
properties:

Draft EIS

•

West Main/Coddington Development Center – Government to mixed-use

•

O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment – Open space and recreational to marina-related
and residential uses

•

Development of the Melville “Backyard” Property – Various plans under consideration

•

Pell Bridge Ramps Relocation and Innovation Hub Development – Reconfiguring
transportation facilities.

13-18

March 2016

Each of these projects is addressed in local land use plans, including the draft Portsmouth Tank Farm
Redevelopment Plan (Town of Portsmouth 2008b), West Main/Coddington Development Center Master
Plan (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. and RKG Associates, Inc. 2011), and the 2006 North End Master
Plan (City of Newport 2006). Additionally, each of these projects is included in the analysis and
recommendations put forward in the Aquidneck Island West Side Master Plan (The Cecil Group et al.
2005). Each of these planned projects would result in changes in land use and could increase the density
of land use on the properties identified in the community plans. Depending on the availability of land and
economic incentives for additional development, these projects could indirectly result in conversion of
additional land to denser development. As a result, the proposed action—when considered with the other
development and redevelopment projects identified in Section 13.2—could have long-term changes and
potential cumulative impacts on land use. The local planning process would ensure that changes in land
use associated with the proposed projects and redevelopment under Alternative 1 or 2 would be consistent
with local land use controls and compatible with existing surrounding land uses or planned land uses on
the surplus properties. The local land use plans previously identified include recommendations for
measures to implement these projects and the proposed action at the local government level, including
any necessary changes in local zoning ordinances, to ensure the consistency of these projects with local
land use controls.
Multiple private, local government, and federal projects would occur in the 200-foot contiguous zone of
Narragansett Bay. These projects would be subject to federal consistency review or would be under
CRMC’s direct state permitting authority for non-federal projects, and the Navy, local implementing
entity, or private entity would be responsible for completing the state permitting process with CRMC,
which would ensure consistency with the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP. While
development and redevelopment projects identified in Section 13.2 would increase the built area along the
Narragansett Bay shoreline, maintaining consistency with the RI CRMP and the Aquidneck Island SAMP
would ensure this development occurs in a way that maintains public access to the shoreline and avoids or
mitigates impacts on coastal resources.

13.3.2

Transportation

13.3.2.1 Geographic Study Area
For the purposes of this analysis, the study area includes the area defined in the Traffic Impact Analysis
for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at the Naval Station Newport (Pare Corporation 2013). The
traffic study area encompasses key roadways and intersections in the vicinity of each of the surplus
properties. The former Navy Lodge property, located in the southwestern area of Middletown, is
accessed from Coddington Highway and West Main Road. The former Naval Hospital property is located
just north of Pell Bridge and is accessed via Third Street and Admiral Kalbfus Road. Tank Farms 1 and 2
are located in Portsmouth and have a series of access points from Stringham Road, West Main Road,
Bradford Avenue, Alexander Road and the Defense Highway/ Burma Road.
13.3.2.2 Cumulative Impact Analysis
The Traffic Impact Analysis for the Disposal and Reuse of Excess Parcels at Naval Station Newport (Pare
Corporation 2013) generated future traffic volumes by projecting the existing traffic volumes with an
annual growth rate coupled with the inclusion of known potential developments within the study area.
Background growth is defined as the growth expected within a study area based on development projects
not specifically identified as well as annual population and traffic increases (Pare Corporation 2013).
Therefore, by taking into account the combination of known potential developments and background
growth with the project-specific traffic volumes, cumulative impacts have already been accounted for in
the impacts presented for each property in Chapters 5, 7, 9, and 11.

Draft EIS

13-19

March 2016

Alternative 1 is projected to generate more than 5,319 combined weekday trips and Alternative 2 would
generate more than 7,345 weekday trips. This would include an additional 598 and 851 evening peak
hour trips under Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, respectively. These trips would likely be dispersed
across the City of Newport and Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. Cumulative impacts on traffic
from the combined proposed action and proposed projects could be expected. However, as discussed in
the individual property impacts and mitigation discussions (5.4.1.3, 7.4.1.3, 9.4.1.3, and 11.4.1.3), the
following measures would help to address and mitigate cumulative impacts:

13.3.3

•

Use of public transportation routes located near the surplus properties, such as the former
Naval Hospital

•

Review and confirmation of sight distances for potential driveway locations and design of
driveways to maximize visibility for motorists

•

Potential improvements along the roadways including revised signs, striping, or possible
geometric improvements.

Environmental Management

13.3.3.1 Geographic Study Area
The geographic study area for evaluating cumulative impacts on environmental management consists of
NAVSTA Newport, the City of Newport, and the Towns of Middletown and Portsmouth.
13.3.3.2 Cumulative Impact Analysis
The transfer and redevelopment of the surplus properties under Alternative 1 or 2 would not result in
quantifiable impacts on storage tanks, fuel piping, oil/water separators, PCBs, pesticides, radioactive
materials, radon, or medical waste. Minor impacts would be associated with the management of
hazardous waste, ACM, and LBP. These areas are therefore not addressed under the cumulative impact
analysis. This analysis focuses on cumulative impacts associated with the ER Program.
The transfer and redevelopment of the surplus properties under Alternative 1 or 2 would be compatible
with the Navy’s ongoing ER Program at NAVSTA Newport. As discussed in Section 3.5.1.3, two of the
surplus properties—Tank Farms 1 and 2—are ER Program sites that would be remediated under
CERCLA before redevelopment would take place. Only one of the recent or reasonably foreseeable
projects in Table 13-1 is near Tank Farms 1 and 2. The Melville Backyard area is about 0.1 miles west of
Tank Farms 1 and 2, at the northernmost end of NAVSTA Newport (see Figure 13-1). The Melville
Backyard is a former industrial area that supported the Navy’s distribution of fuel from the tank farms to
ships. Development of that waterfront property within the next 20 years is being considered. That
timeframe would be compatible with the ER Program timetable for the CERCLA remediation of Tank
Farms 1 and 2, which is scheduled to be completed in FY17 (see Section 9.5.1.4). As a result, these two
projects under remediation would pose beneficial cumulative impacts resulting from site cleanup.

13.3.4

Air Quality

A variety of factors influence the air quality of a region. These factors include weather (air speed and
temperature), traffic patterns, individual commuting choices, and economic activity. In addition, the
extent of the impacts of many of the other reasonably foreseeable projects identified for consideration of
cumulative impacts cannot be accurately determined with the currently available project information. The
recently completed BRAC projects and the future MILCON projects were assumed to not exceed the
General Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds because of their size. The Navy and other developers are
required to adhere to planning, permitting, and monitoring requirements as set forth through state and
federal review processes. As discussed in Chapter 3, Rhode Island is in attainment for all NAAQS. The
Draft EIS

13-20

March 2016

Office of Air Resources (OAR) of RIDEM is responsible for the preservation, protection, and
improvement of air quality in Rhode Island. This is accomplished, in partnership with the EPA, by
regulating the emission of air pollutants from stationary and mobile emission sources (RIDEM 2013d).
Through air quality monitoring, inspecting emission sources, developing state implementation plans and
permit requirements, and establishing and implementing an air pollutant emission inventory, the OAR
manages state resources and development to protect air quality and ensure progress toward compliance
with the NAAQS. Each of the reasonably foreseeable projects would be subject to the OAR requirements.
13.3.4.1 Geographic Study Area
The geographic study area for evaluating cumulative impacts for air quality comprises NAVSTA
Newport, the City of Newport, and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth. Air quality is also
managed at the state level, and the regional level through the implementation of NOx transport regional
requirements. In addition, GHG emissions are generated locally but are contributing to impacts on a
global scale.
13.3.4.2

Cumulative Impacts Analysis

Construction Emissions
Under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2, construction would result in a temporary increase in regional
emissions. However, as indicated in Chapter 12, although the General Conformity Rule does not apply to
redevelopment, temporary emissions from construction were analyzed for all surplus properties and were
below the General Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds. Therefore, changes to air quality would not be
significant as a result of the implementation of the proposed action under either alternative.
Other construction projects in the region would result in a temporary increase in emissions, and there
could be the potential for temporary cumulative impacts on air quality. With a build-out duration of 20
years, the extent of cumulative impacts on air quality would depend on concurrent construction schedules
of projects located in the same geographic area. For most projects, specific data regarding construction
schedules and final configurations of project size, type, and location are unavailable; thus, potential
cumulative impacts cannot be quantified. Cumulative construction emissions would be reduced through
dust control, proper equipment maintenance, and idling restrictions on construction equipment.
Building Use Emissions
Under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2, building use emissions would be generated from heating and
operation of residential, commercial, industrial, and marina-related buildings. However, as indicated in
Chapter 12, although the General Conformity Rule does not apply to redevelopment, annual operational
emissions were analyzed for all surplus properties and were below the General Conformity Rule de
minimis thresholds. Therefore, changes to air quality would not be significant as a result of the
implementation of the proposed action under either alternative.
For other proposed construction and community development projects, building use could have potential
cumulative impacts on air emissions. The extent of cumulative impacts on air quality would depend on
building size and type, location, use, and timeline during the 20-year build-out. However, this
information is not available, so the extent of cumulative impacts cannot be quantified. These potential
impacts could be reduced by using modern building construction techniques and installing energyefficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.
Mobile Sources
Under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2, vehicle traffic patterns and volumes would change and the number
of automobiles and trucks would increase at full build-out. However, these mobile sources have been

Draft EIS

13-21

March 2016

taken into account as part of the analysis for construction and operational emissions, as discussed above.
Those mobile sources, as one component of the total construction and the total annual operational
emissions, were below the General Conformity Rule de minimis thresholds.
Cumulative mobile source emissions could be mitigated by providing public transportation and
carpooling programs and thereby reducing the number of vehicles.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
GHGs are a leading cause of climate change. GHGs contribute to climate change by slowing or
preventing the loss of heat to space, acting as a blanket. This process is commonly referred to as the
“greenhouse effect.” Global climate change threatens ecosystems, water resources, coastal regions, crop
and livestock production, and human health. Many scientific studies have correlated the observed rise in
global annual average temperature and the resulting change in global climate patterns with the increase in
GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere (U.S. EPA 2014).
As discussed in Chapter 12, GHG emissions were estimated for the energy usage in new buildings and for
increased vehicle use in the region associated with the action. The total GHG emissions associated with
the action are less than 25,000 metric tons annually under either alternative, which is below the total that
the CEQ guidance (CEQ 2014) recommends for detailed description in NEPA analyses. These totals also
only represent about a tenth of a percent of the State of Rhode Island’s total annual GHG emissions.
The CEQ guidance notes that climate change is a global problem that results from global GHG emissions.
From a quantitative perspective, there are no dominating sources and few sources that would even be
close to dominating total GHG emissions. Potential GHG emissions from the Project will be reduced
through the implementation of energy efficiency building and transportation BMPs. The global climate
change problem is much more the result of numerous and varied sources, each of which might seem to
make a relatively small addition to global atmospheric GHG concentrations.
Federal agencies are, on a national scale, addressing emissions of GHGs through reductions mandated by
Executive Orders. Most recently, on March 19, 2015, President Obama issued EO 13693, “Planning for
Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,” which replaces EO 13423 and EO 13514. EO 13693 requires
federal agencies to meet emission-reduction goals associated with energy use, water use, building design
and utilization, fleet vehicles, and procurement and acquisition decisions. The CEQ provided
implementation guidance to meet these new goals (CEQ 2015). In addition, recent federal laws and
regulations will require inventorying and tracking GHG emissions from large sources (74 FR 56260) and
CAA Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting (74 FR 55292).
The Navy has developed the U.S. Navy Climate Change Roadmap (U.S. Department of the Navy 2010b)
to describe actions to assess, predict, and adapt to global climate change, noting that climate change is a
national security challenge with strategic implications for the Navy. The Navy’s Energy Strategy, a
separate guidance document, addresses mitigation efforts in reducing GHG emissions through energy
efficiency and renewable energy (U.S. Department of the Navy 2010b).
The Roadmap states that climate change is affecting and will continue to affect U.S. military installations
worldwide and notes that sea level rise and storm surge will lead to an increased likelihood of inundation
of coastal infrastructure (U.S. Department of the Navy 2010b). The Rhode Island Climate Change
Commission produced a 2012 progress report that notes that, as a result of climate change, Rhode Island
will most likely experience stronger, more frequent hurricanes and Nor’easter storms (Rhode Island
Climate Change Commission 2012). Both reports identify the need to address these impacts with
improved coastal infrastructure. The goal of the Rhode Island Climate Change Commission is to foster
new initiatives that invest in climate change assessment and adaptation, including the revision of
Draft EIS

13-22

March 2016

infrastructure design and construction standards, interagency and inter-government planning and
coordination, public education and outreach, and research and monitoring.
It will be important for the development under this action to consider the potential impacts of sea level
rise and storm surges in the design and construction of the project. Building resilient structural integrity
into buildings, roads, and wharfs will minimize these effects of climate change on the project under both
Alternatives 1 and 2. As discussed in Section 12.5, the installation will be undertaking a climate change
vulnerability assessment and adaptation plan and the results of those efforts will be used to develop
installation-specific climate adaptation strategies.

13.3.5

Utilities and Infrastructure

13.3.5.1 Geographic Study Area
For the purposes of this analysis, the study area includes the NAVSTA Newport surplus properties, the
City of Newport and the towns of Middletown and Portsmouth.
13.3.5.2

Cumulative Impacts Analysis

Water, Wastewater, Other Utility Systems
The reuse and redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge, former Naval Hospital, Tank Farms 1 and 2, and
the Midway Pier/Greene Lane properties are projected to require 32,361 gpd of water under Alternative 1
and 38,480 gpd under Alternative 2, accounting for less than 1 percent of Newport’s projected water
surplus (6.7 mgd) in 2030. The total wastewater generated by all properties would be 30,453 gpd under
Alternative 1 and 36,621 gpd under Alternative 2. The Newport wastewater treatment facility is currently
near capacity and the majority of the Town of Portsmouth relies on on-site treatment or storage for
wastewater. Virtually any new development on Aquidneck Island would require upgrades to
infrastructure and/or capacity, which would be the responsibility of the future developer and local
municipality to address. The combined electricity consumption of the five properties is estimated to be
approximately 4,930,379 kWh under Alternative 1 and 6 and 308,189 kWh under Alternative 2. It is
assumed National Grid would be able to meet demand, although some infrastructure improvements may
be needed in some areas. The combined natural gas consumption for the surplus properties is 17,344,883
cf under Alternative 1 and 20,830,440 cf under Alternative 2. It is assumed National Grid would also be
able to meet the additional natural gas demand although, similar to electricity, infrastructure
improvements may be necessary. A total of 1,795,290 to 1,970,520 square feet of impervious surface
would be created under Alternative 1 and Alternative 2, respectively. This represents an increase of 106
percent to 126 percent in impervious surfaces over existing conditions. The Rhode Island Stormwater
Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010) includes requirements for
mitigating storm water runoff.
A proposed subdivision at Bailey Avenue and Sachuest Avenue would include 12 lots. Nearby, another
12-lot subdivision on Green End Avenue is under construction as of 2015. Housing units built in these
subdivisions can be expected to increase demand for water, electricity, and natural gas and generate a
wastewater and storm water runoff. Minor cumulative impacts on utilities from the housing subdivisions
and reuse of the former Navy Lodge property could occur.
The proposed West Main/Coddington Development Center would include the development of the former
Navy Lodge property with four other parcels. The development would increase the demand for all
utilities in this area. The existing wastewater pumping stations in the vicinity do not have additional
capacity for new development. Upgrade costs are estimated at $750,000 to $1,000,000 (Vanasse Hangen
Brustlin Inc. and RKG Associates, Inc. 2011). Therefore, the proposed development center and

Draft EIS

13-23

March 2016

redevelopment of the Navy Lodge property would pose cumulative impacts on wastewater. LID storm
water systems would be required to manage storm water runoff and would provide some mitigation of the
increase in impervious surface. Therefore, minor cumulative impacts on storm water could occur. The
Development Center and redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge property could pose cumulative
impacts on water supplies and other utilities.
A proposed development of 400,000 square feet of retail along West Main Road and Brown Lane would
be expected to require 50,000 gpd of water and generate 47,600 gpd of wastewater in addition to
increased requirements for electric and gas service. As with the West Main/Coddington Development
Center, this development is likely to increase wastewater capacity limitations. As a result, cumulative
impacts would be expected from the proposed retail and redevelopment of the former Navy Lodge
property. Cumulative impacts on other utilities from the retail development and reuse of the former Navy
Lodge property would be expected but would be offset by the ability of private service providers to
upgrade and expand electric and gas utilities, as needed.
A proposed development near Weaver Cove would be expected to increase the demand on all utilities.
Water usage and wastewater generation for the 900 housing units is estimated to be 162,000 gpd and
145,800 gpd, respectively. The proposed development is located near the Tank Farms 1 and 2 properties
in an area that has limited wastewater infrastructure. Due to the scale of the projects, cumulative impacts
on wastewater and storm water from the development near Weaver Cove and the reuse of Tank Farms 1
and 2 and reuse of the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property would be expected. Cumulative impacts on
water and other utilities from the proposed development and reuse of Navy surplus properties could also
occur. Cumulative impacts would be offset with the 20-year build-out period and ability of private service
providers to upgrade and expand services, as needed.
Development of the innovation hub and relocation of the Pell Bridge access ramps in the City of Newport
would be expected to increase the density of land use within the 32-acre area and increase demand for all
utilities, as it would entail constructing new office space, housing, and retail facilities. Cumulative
impacts on wastewater and storm water would be expected, along with minor cumulative impacts on
water and other utilities.
Cumulative impacts from several projects would be expected; however, the extent of the impacts cannot
be accurately determined with the currently available project information. Demand for utilities would
vary depending on the type and size of development. These projects include the following:

Draft EIS

•

Plans for adaptive reuse of additional excess school buildings would be expected to
increase demand for all utilities. Cumulative impacts on utilities would be expected for
the adaptive reuse of excess school buildings and reuse of the surplus Navy properties.

•

The light industrial redevelopment on West Main Road would be expected to increase
demand for utilities, depending on the proposed square footage. Cumulative impacts
from light industrial development on West Main Road and reuse of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property would be expected.

•

Development of 32 acres of the Melville “Backyard” would be expected to increase
demand for utilities. Cumulative impacts from the development of the Melville
“Backyard” and reuse of Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be expected.

•

Redevelopment of the Raytheon parcel in Portsmouth would be expected to increase
demand for utilities. Cumulative impacts of the redevelopment of the Raytheon property
and reuse of Tanks Farms 1 and 2 would be expected.

13-24

March 2016

A number of BRAC action projects were recently completed on NAVSTA Newport in 2011 that resulted
in the demolition and construction of a number of buildings; the constructed buildings include space for
an additional 880 personnel. These projects are located on Coddington Point, Coasters Harbor Island, and
the NUWC campus. The remaining MILCON projects would also be located on Coddington Point,
Coasters Harbor Island, and the NUWC campus and would involve rehabilitating existing buildings or
constructing new buildings on the base. Impacts on NAVSTA Newport’s utility infrastructure and
capacity allotments as well as the City of Newport’s water and wastewater treatment infrastructure would
occur. Therefore, no cumulative impacts with the redevelopment of the surplus properties would be
expected.
Solid Waste
The transfer and redevelopment of the surplus properties would impact the generation and management of
solid waste from the C&D waste created from demolition and construction. Nearly all of the projects
listed in Table 13-1 would similarly generate large quantities of C&D waste, resulting in local cumulative
impacts associated with those projects that have been recently completed, are under way, or are approved
for imminent implementation.
C&D wastes commonly consist of materials such as wood, concrete, masonry, metal, building materials
(e.g., shingles, wallboard, carpeting), asphalt, and structural and mechanical components. Table 13-4
shows the estimated quantities of C&D waste that would result from construction or demolition of a
representative 25,000-square-foot nonresidential building and a representative 1,500-square-foot
residential dwelling.

For example, demolition of the 143,000-square-foot Nimitz Hall at NAVSTA Newport generated more
than 45,000 cubic yards of C&D waste. If the 400,000-square foot West Main Road and Browns Lane
retail development project is approved and implemented for the Town of Middletown, more than 3,500
cubic yards of C&D waste would result from construction.
C&D waste is recyclable and it is typically more cost-effective to recycle than to dispose of in a landfill
with landfill fees being weight-based. RIDEM encourages C&D recycling, discourages the disposal of
C&D waste in landfills, and regulates at least two C&D debris-processing facilities in the state (RIDEM
2012). The Central Landfill, which is the primary state sanitary landfill, has submitted an application to
RIDEM to expand the landfill for the sixth time, which would be projected to extend landfill life by about
17 years (RIDEM 2011b). The state’s other licensed landfill, in Tiverton, is close to capacity (TivertonLittle Compton Patch 2011).
Demolition and construction contractors typically recycle C&D waste based on cost benefits. Applicable
mitigation for the cumulative impact of generating and managing large quantities of C&D waste from
planned and potential projects in the geographic study area may include the following:

Draft EIS

13-25

March 2016

•

NAVSTA Newport projects: Ensure that demolition and construction contracts follow
the installation’s Solid Waste Management Plan (Nobis Engineering 2003), which would
require that solid waste be minimized and recycling be maximized. NAVSTA Newport
annually reports the amount of C&D debris recycled and the amount disposed of
(NAVSTA Newport 2012c).

•

Non-NAVSTA Newport projects: Require that demolition and construction contracts
contain traditional terms and conditions mandating the recycling of C&D waste to the
extent practicable.

Non-C&D solid wastes would be routinely generated by future industrial, commercial, and residential
uses planned under Alternative 1 or 2 as well as by the recent and reasonably foreseeable projects listed in
Table 13-1. Such solid wastes would consist of mixed trash, food waste, and traditional recyclables such
as paper, cardboard, and containers. It would be expected that existing solid waste management services
(including the Central Landfill) could accommodate non-C&D solid wastes because of the long build-out
times anticipated for the projects. Applicable mitigation could include the implementation and
enforcement of solid waste management policies that minimize solid waste generation and maximize
recycling. These include pay-as-you-throw programs in Middletown which are being considered in
Newport and Portsmouth, and comprehensive recycling programs undertaken by all three municipalities.
Implementation of the proposed action under Alternative 1 or 2, coupled with the recent and reasonably
foreseeable projects listed in Table 13-1, thus would be anticipated to result in cumulative impacts on
C&D waste management and non-C&D solid waste management. These cumulative impacts could be
partially offset by recycling and waste minimization practices. In addition, the build-out period of 20
years and economic conditions would serve to space construction and demolition projects over time.

Cultural Resources

13.3.6.1 Geographic Study Area
The geographic study area for evaluating cumulative impacts on cultural resources encompasses the APE
for the proposed action, collectively comprised of the former Navy Lodge property, the former Naval
Hospital property, the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property, and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
13.3.6.2 Cumulative Impacts Analysis
This analysis focuses on the cumulative impacts on cultural resources (archaeological sites, architectural
resources, and Native American resources) and historic properties (those cultural resources that are listed
in or determined eligible for listing in the NRHP) that are in the APE for the proposed action. Only one
of the Navy projects listed in Table 13.1, the demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1
(MILCON, N32411), overlaps the geographic study area for cultural resources as defined above. None of
the other projects listed in Table 13.1 are located within the geographic study area for cultural resources.
The Navy project to demolish abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 (MILCON, N32411) overlaps the APE
at the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property. Therefore, this project, when considered in conjunction with the
proposed action, has the potential to result in cumulative impacts on cultural resources only where it
overlaps the APE at Tank Farms 1 and 2, as discussed below. It would have no cumulative impacts on
any other cultural resources that are located in remaining portions of the geographic study area for
cultural resources, such as the portion of the U.S. Naval Hospital Newport Historic District within the
APE at the former Naval Hospital property (there are no cultural resources located within the APE at the
Navy Lodge property or within the APE at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property).

Description of Navy Project to Demolish Abandoned Facilities at Tank Farm 1
In July 2015, the Navy determined that it must demolish abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 to comply
with Rule 13 of the Rhode Island Rules and Regulations for Underground Storage Tank (UST) Facilities
used for Petroleum Products and Hazardous Materials. The proposed demolition of abandoned facilities
at Tank Farm 1 to comply with Rule 13 is a separate action from the disposal of the Tank Farms 1 and 2
properties that are part of this proposed action. The proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank
Farm 1 consists of the demolition of eight abandoned fuel underground storage tanks and all associated
fuel distribution piping and concrete pipe chamber, bottom sediment water piping, ring drain piping, oilwater separators, other fuel operating-related structures and piping, as well as the earth berm
containments for Tank Farm 1 (Dorocz 2015a). Subsequently, the Navy determined that the proposed
demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 would also consist of the demolition of the concrete
utility trenches and the associated fuel distribution piping, bottom sediment water piping, and steam
distributing piping in trenches within Tank Farm 1 (NAVSTA Newport 2015). In summary, as part of the
demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 to comply with Rule 13, the following buildings or
structures at Tank Farm 1 will be demolished: Tanks 9 and10 and 13 through18; Buildings 49, B60, and
P30; underground direct piping (including steam lines, berm drain lines, fuel lines, bottom sludge and
waste lines, and foam lines) and concrete utility tunnels and pipe chambers (Structures S133, S140, S267,
S268, U238; all remaining separators tanks, chambers and valve chamber pits; and two transformers
vaults (S359, S360). Additionally, Building 30 (an underground reservoir that is located outside the
currently drawn boundaries of Tank Farms 1 and 2 but is associated with the fueling operation of the
Tank Farm) is part of the same demolition action at Tank Farm 1 (Dorocz 2015a; NAVSTA Newport
2015).
The Navy project to demolish abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 (MILCON, N32411) would result in
long-term direct and indirect impacts on architectural resources within the APE at the Tanks Farms 1 and
2 property, consisting of the demolition of tanks and associated piping and other ancillary facilities at
Tank Farm 1. Because the buildings and structures comprising Tank Farm 1 are considered contributing
resources to the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District, the long-term direct and indirect impacts
of demolition are considered an adverse effect on historic properties under Section 106 of the NHPA and
require mitigation, as discussed in greater detail below.
With regard to the proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1, the Navy has evaluated
the project-specific effects of the demolition of the abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 and determined
that the demolition project would have an adverse effect on Tank Farm 1, which is eligible for listing on
the NRHP (Dorocz 2015a). Tank Farm 1 is considered NRHP-eligible because its facilities are
contributing resources to the Melville Naval Historic District (Groesbeck and Bedford 2014; Sanderson
2013b). In a letter dated July 28, 2015, the Navy initiated Section 106 consultation with the Rhode Island
SHPO in order to resolve the adverse effects of the demolition project on historic properties (Dorocz
2015a). The Rhode Island SHPO concurred with the Navy’s determination that the demolition of the
abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 will have an adverse effect on historic properties because Tank Farm
1 is located within the Melville Naval Historic District and indicated that a memorandum of agreement
(MOA) for the mitigation of the adverse effect should be prepared by the Navy (Sanderson 2015).
The Navy also notified the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP) in a letter dated
September 8, 2015, of the proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1 and the
determination that the demolition project would have an adverse effect on historic properties. The Navy
also invited the ACHP to participate in consultation to resolve the adverse effect on historic properties
and be a signatory party to the MOA between the Navy and the Rhode Island SHPO. The Navy further
indicated that the Navy’s proposed resolution of adverse effects would be to prepare Rhode Island
Historic Resources Archive Documentation for the demolition of structures at Tank Farm 1 and create
documents and drawings for review and approval by the Rhode Island SHPO before demolition is begun.
Draft EIS

13-27

The Navy also indicated that it will notify, by letter, the Town of Portsmouth, the Aquidneck Land Trust,
the Narragansett Indian Tribe, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head
(Aquinnah) as part of the Section 106 consultation process to resolve the adverse effect on historic
properties (Dorocz 2015b). The ACHP acknowledged receipt of the Navy’s correspondence and declined
to participate in consultation to resolve adverse effects. However, the ACHP requested that the Navy file
the MOA developed in consultation with the Rhode Island SHPO and supporting documentation with the
ACHP in order for Navy to complete the requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA (Thompson 2015).
Cumulative Impacts on the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District
The proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1, considered in conjunction with the
disposal of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property out of federal ownership, represents a cumulative long-term
negative impact on architectural resources. This cumulative impact on architectural resources would
occur because all of the extant buildings and structures located at Tank Farms 1 and 2 will either be
removed or will no longer be under the control of the Navy. This cumulative impact would be significant
because all of the architectural resources that respectively comprise Tank Farms 1 and 2 are considered
historic properties as contributing resources to the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval Historic District.
Similarly, the proposed demolition of abandoned facilities at Tank Farm 1, considered in conjunction
with the disposal of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property out of federal ownership, represents a cumulative
adverse effect on historic properties. This cumulative adverse effect on architectural resources would
occur because all of the extant buildings and structures located at Tank Farms 1 and 2 will either be
removed or will no longer be under the control of the Navy. As such, this cumulative adverse effect
would result from physical destruction of contributing resources to the NRHP-eligible Melville Naval
Historic District, changes to the physical features (e.g., removal of buildings and structures) within the
historic district’s setting that contribute to its historic significance, and transfer of property out of federal
ownership or control (i.e., the disposal of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property) without adequate and legally
enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property’s historic
significance.
With regard to the proposed transfer of the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property out of federal ownership, the
Navy is in the process of consulting with the Rhode Island SHPO pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA,
including consulting on the effects of the proposed action on historic properties within the APE (Preston
2013; Lin 2013; Sanderson 2013b), as discussed in Section 9.9.1.4. As part of this ongoing consultation,
the Rhode Island SHPO has acknowledged that once the Navy has disposed of the property, subsequent
redevelopment is outside of the Navy’s control and has indicated that a standard treatment to mitigate any
indirect adverse effects of subsequent redevelopment on historic properties would be to include historic
preservation provisions, such as a historic preservation easement, in a deed of transfer (Sanderson 2013a).
The evaluation of cumulative impacts and effects on historic properties will be updated upon completion
of consultation with the Rhode Island SHPO with regard to the proposed transfer of the Tank Farms 1 and
2 property.

Water Resources

13.3.7.1 Geographic Study Area
The geographic study area for evaluating cumulative impacts on water resources encompasses the
watersheds in which Aquidneck Island is located: Mount Hope Bay, Upper East Passage, Lower East
Passage, Aquidneck Island-Frontal Atlantic Ocean, and the Sakonnet River watershed.
13.3.7.2 Cumulative Impacts Analysis
This analysis focuses on surface waters and wetlands as well as water quality.

Draft EIS

13-28

March 2016

Surface Waters and Wetlands
The cumulative impacts analysis for surface waters and wetlands focuses on direct (alteration) and
indirect (water quality-related) impacts. In the absence of specific data pertaining to water resources for
each of the proposed projects in Sections 13.2.2, 13.2.3, 13.2.4, and 13.2.5, a desktop analysis was
completed using USFWS wetland and riparian data, as developed for use in Google Earth. With the
exception of Narragansett Bay, the Navy projects proposed in Sections 13.2.1.1 and 13.2.1.2 do not
appear to be located on or near other surface waters, with the exception of the proposed solar PV facility,
which would avoid all direct impacts on wetlands and streams. Therefore, impacts on surface waters
would be indirect, as discussed below.
Non-Navy project areas where surface waters or wetlands were observed during the desktop analysis are
discussed below. These projects have been evaluated qualitatively, as no specific information is available
regarding proposed impacts or mitigation.

Draft EIS

•

The subdivision proposed in Middletown at the terminus of Bailey Avenue has the
potential to impact a wetland located south of Bailey Avenue and approximately 285 feet
west of Sachuest Drive; no other surface waters were noted. Twelve lots are proposed as
part of this subdivision and in the absence of specific subdivision plans, it is not possible
to determine whether that wetland would be directly impacted (permanent fill) to
facilitate the construction of the various lots, or whether indirect impacts would result.
The developer for this subdivision would be required to comply with the Rules and
Regulations Governing the Administration and Enforcement of the Freshwater Wetlands
Act and to obtain a permit from RIDEM if alteration to a wetland is necessary, as well as
a permit from the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting
process, the developer would be required to submit mitigation plans. Although potential
cumulative impacts on wetlands could occur, the requirement to avoid, minimize, and
mitigate impacts on wetlands under federal and state permit programs would prevent
significant cumulative impacts on wetlands.

•

The proposed O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment would be located immediately
adjacent to Narragansett Bay and would require in-water work to construct the proposed
slips. Similar to the proposed action, indirect impacts on water quality of the Narragansett
Bay would be anticipated due to the in-water construction. Turbidity would be short-term
and localized and the same precautions pertaining to construction-related spills would be
taken. Although potential cumulative impacts on water resources could occur, impacts
would be expected to be minor.

•

Additionally, according to the USFWS wetland and riparian data, a coastal wetland is
located along the shoreline in that area of Weaver Cove. Depending on the locations of
the piles or other structures needed to construct and anchor the proposed slips, permanent
impacts on the coastal wetland would likely result. Filling a coastal wetland requires a
permit from the CRMC and a permit from the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA.
As part of the permitting process, the developer will be required to coordinate wetland
mitigation plans with the USACE and CRMC. Although potential cumulative impacts on
wetlands could occur, the requirement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on
wetlands as required under federal and state permit programs would reduce significant
cumulative impacts on wetlands.

•

Development of the Melville “Backyard” property would be located adjacent to the
Narragansett Bay. Similar to the proposed action, indirect impacts on water quality of the
Narragansett Bay would be similar to those discussed below under Water Quality.

13-29

March 2016

•

Realignment of the Pell Bridge access ramps could have the potential to impact a wetland
area north of Route 138, west of Malbone Road – either directly or indirectly. As
previously discussed above, if the wetland would be directly impacted (permanent fill),
compliance would be required with the Rules and Regulations Governing the
Administration and Enforcement of the Freshwater Wetlands Act. A permit from RIDEM
would have to be obtained if alteration to the wetland is necessary as well as a permit
from the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA. As part of the permitting process, the
developer would be required to submit mitigation plans. Although potential cumulative
impacts on wetlands could occur, the requirement to avoid, minimize, and mitigate
impacts on wetlands as required under federal and state permit programs would prevent
significant cumulative impacts on wetlands.

Water Quality
This cumulative impacts analysis for water quality focuses on two primary variables related to water
quality: ground disturbance associated with clearing and grading activities, and the addition of impervious
surface. Any project requiring earth-moving activities during construction or the permanent addition of
impervious surface has the potential to impact water quality. Degradation of water quality could occur
from increased storm water volume and uncontrolled runoff.
Construction and implementation of the Navy projects discussed in Sections 13.2.1.1 and 13.2.1.2 would
result in short- and long-term impacts on surface water quality as a result of increased storm water runoff.
However, these impacts would be avoided or mitigated by the following:
•

Using best management practices that meet current RIDEM storm water management
standards, including sediment barriers, minimizing disturbed areas, and planting
temporary vegetation cover where needed

•

Implementing LID measures during construction and operation of the new facilities that
meet the basic and general standards set forth in the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and
Installation Manual, which requires the use of LID techniques as a primary method of
storm water control

•

Adhering to the Navy’s LID policy, which sets a goal of no net increase in storm water
volume and sediment or nutrient loading from major renovation and construction projects
through use of LID techniques, as applicable.

Adhering to these standards and policies during construction and operation of the identified Navy projects
would reduce impacts on surface water quality to minimal levels. Thus, the Navy projects described
above coupled with the proposed action would pose cumulative impacts; however, impacts would not be
expected to be significant.
The non-military projects described under Sections 13.2.3, 13.2.4, and 13.2.5 could also impact surface
water quality. Similar to the proposed action, temporary impacts would be anticipated as a result of
ground-disturbing activities associated with the various development projects, specifically, the O’Neill
Properties Group Redevelopment and the development of the Melville “Backyard” property, which are
both adjacent to the Narragansett Bay; and the potential redevelopment of the Raytheon property, as
across West Main Road is the Lawton Valley reservoir. However, it is assumed that state and local
permits and regulations pertaining to storm water management and erosion and sediment control would be
adhered to. Each of the three municipalities on Aquidneck Island has ordinances that focus on storm
water management. Additionally, a General Permit—Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System Storm Water Discharge Associated with Construction Activity—would be necessary for any

Draft EIS

13-30

March 2016

project that would disturb more than 1 acre. Therefore, cumulative impacts on water quality could occur
but would likely be minimal.
Due to the lack of detail regarding final development plans for the reasonably foreseeable projects in
Sections 13.2.3, 13.2.4, and 13.2.5, determining the amount of impervious surface to be added as a result
of the construction of these projects is not feasible. It is assumed that these developments would be
required to provide for on-site storm water management, in compliance with local and state regulations.
Therefore, cumulative impacts on water quality would be anticipated but would not likely be significant.

13.3.8

Biological Resources

13.3.8.1 Geographic Study Area
For the purposes of this analysis, the study area includes all of Aquidneck Island.
13.3.8.2

Cumulative Impact Analysis

Vegetation
At full build-out under Alternative 1, inclusive of all surplus properties, approximately 9.4 acres of old
field, 14.5 acres of ruderal forest, and 2.7 acres of mixed oak/white pine forest would be impacted. Under
Alternative 2, approximately 9.4 acres of old field, 16.4 acres of ruderal forest, and 2.7 acres of shrubland
would be impacted. In addition to these permanent conversions of natural vegetation to developed land,
additional temporary impacts (i.e., disturbance) would occur during construction. These temporary
disturbances would cease following construction and redevelopment, and the developer would restore that
land to the originally existing conditions.
To date, no environmental studies have been completed for the foreseeable projects; therefore, any
potential resource impacts resulting from their implementation cannot be identified at this time. In the
absence of specific data pertaining to habitat and impacts for the foreseeable projects, a desktop analysis
was completed using aerial photographs to determine vegetation cover types at the locations of the other
proposed projects to provide for a qualitative analysis. A summary of that analysis is provided below.
The majority of other recently completed or reasonably foreseeable actions identified in Section 13.2,
(i.e., MILCON and BRACCON redevelopment projects), would be located on previously developed sites
and would not be expected to result in impacts on vegetation. The development of the proposed MILCON
and BRACCON projects typically involve redevelopment or renovation of existing buildings or disturbed
areas. Given that most of the vegetation on the MILCON and BRACCON project properties is either
regularly maintained or has been previously disturbed, long-term impacts from a loss of vegetation during
construction would be minor and, therefore, cumulative impacts on vegetation would be negligible.
The subdivision proposed for the terminus of Bailey Avenue would primarily impact areas of open,
maintained grass. Therefore, no cumulative impacts on vegetation would result. The subdivision proposed
for Lot 106, located at 385 Green End Avenue, would result in the permanent conversion of upland
forested and shrubland habitat types. Cumulative impacts on these habitat types would result because 14.1
acres of grassland and 2.2 acres of shrubland would be impacted under Alternative 2, the higher
development alternative. These cumulative impacts would be considered minor because these habitat
types occur throughout Aquidneck Island.
Development of the West Main/Coddington Development Center would primarily impact previously
developed land and areas of maintained grass and other landscaped areas. The plan for the development

Draft EIS

13-31

March 2016

center would integrate areas of open space and landscaping. As such, long-term cumulative impacts from
a loss of vegetation would be very minor.
The West Main Road and Brown Lane retail development is approximately 1.32 miles from the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property, and the more than 400,000 square feet of retail development proposed could
impact 9.2 acres of agricultural land. Implementation of Alternatives 1 or 2 for the proposed action
would not impact agricultural land, so there would be no cumulative impacts on agricultural land.
The light industrial redevelopment along West Main Road, opposite Marshall Lane, would primarily
impact grassland and shrubland cover types. The property covers 24 acres and, assuming that the entire
property would be redeveloped, permanent conversion of grassland and shrubland habitat would be
necessary. Therefore, cumulative impacts on these habitat types would result because grassland and
shrubland habitat would be impacted under Alternative 2. These cumulative impacts would be considered
minor because these habitat types occur throughout Aquidneck Island.
The proposed development of the Melville “Backyard” Property could disturb up to 32 acres of upland
forested land and grassland just south of Tank Farms 1 and 2, if the entire property were to be
redeveloped. However, given that the property is currently developed with some outbuildings and other
infrastructure, the total area of potential disturbance would be less. Given the lack of details regarding
redevelopment, it can be assumed that there would be some permanent conversion of forested and
grassland habitat, and cumulative impacts on these habitat types would result due to the grassland and
shrubland habitats that would be impacted under Alternative 2. These cumulative impacts would be
considered minor because these habitat types occur throughout Aquidneck Island.
The O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment proposes a new marina with 1,500 boat slips and 900
residential units along the shore in Weaver Cove in Portsmouth. Construction of the residential units
would impact previously disturbed land and existing impervious surface. The proposed project could also
impact vacant grassland along the shore and, potentially, shrubland and upland forest. Because the land is
already paved with concrete, new development would not be anticipated to adversely impact the existing
vegetation because it is limited to the shoreline areas. Therefore, long-term cumulative impacts on
vegetation would not be anticipated.
Development of the proposed solar PV facility at Tank Farms 4 and 5 would require clearing existing
vegetation. Habitat types at Tank Farms 4 and 5 include old field, northern hardwood forest, and ruderal
forest; cumulative impacts on these habitat types would result because these same habitats also would be
impacted by Alternatives 1 and 2. These cumulative impacts would be considered minor because these
habitat types occur throughout Aquidneck Island.
The potential sale of the Raytheon property could lead to redevelopment of that site, which is dominated
by an existing developed footprint of two buildings and associated parking. The remainder of the site is
maintained grass. Therefore, long-term cumulative impacts from a loss of vegetation would be very
minor.
The foreseeable projects proposed in the City of Newport are proposed in previously developed areas.
Neither conversion of habitat nor cumulative impacts would result from the projects.
Wildlife
The cumulative impacts analysis for wildlife focuses on terrestrial and marine mammals.
Terrestrial. Alternatives 1 and 2 would not result in long-term adverse impacts on wildlife at the surplus
properties. The diversity of wildlife on the surplus properties such as the former Navy Lodge and the
Draft EIS

13-32

March 2016

former Naval Hospital is limited because maintained landscaping and impervious surfaces from previous
development and disturbance at these sites are predominant. Under Alternative 1 or Alternative 2, small
terrestrial mammals, amphibians, and reptiles could be impacted during construction. Upon completion of
construction, recolonization of these species would be expected.
Based on the review of the sites on which the foreseeable projects would be located, the following
projects, due to their locations on previously developed sites or sites with limited vegetation, would not
be expected to result in an impact on wildlife resources and thus, would not contribute to cumulative
impacts:
•

MILCON and BRACCON projects

•

West Main/Coddington Development Center project

•

O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment

•

Raytheon Property

•

Redevelopment of the Pell Bridge Realignment

•

Adaptive Reuse of Surplus School Buildings.

As indicated above under the discussion of vegetation, the subdivision proposed for the terminus of
Bailey Avenue would primarily impact areas of open, maintained grass. Wildlife diversity in this type of
habitat would be low and therefore, only minor, temporary cumulative impacts on wildlife would result,
primarily from construction-related disturbance. The subdivision proposed for Lot 106 located at 385
Green End Avenue would result in the permanent conversion of upland forested and shrubland habitat
types. These habitat losses, coupled with the proposed action would result in the permanent loss of habitat
area and would be considered a cumulative impact on wildlife.
The more than 400,000 square feet of retail development proposed for the West Main Road and Brown
Lane retail development project would impact 9.2 acres of agricultural land. While agricultural land is not
a naturally occurring ecological community, it provides a transition corridor between adjacent habitats as
well as foraging opportunities for terrestrial mammals, raptors, and other birds of prey. Wildlife typical
of this property would avoid the areas of disturbance during construction and would recolonize in nearby
suitable habitat following finalization of the project. The additional temporary impacts that would be
incurred from the redevelopment of the Navy surplus properties increase the potential for cumulative
temporary impacts on wildlife resources.
The light industrial redevelopment along West Main Road, opposite Marshall Lane, would primarily
impact grassland and shrubland cover types. Given the potential impacts on these habitat types, and that
Alternatives 1 and 2 would also impact the same habitat types, there is a potential for temporary impacts
(temporary displacement, etc.) as well as long-term cumulative impacts (direct habitat loss) on wildlife.
The proposed development of the Melville “Backyard” Property could result in the disturbance of up to
32 acres of upland forested land and grassland just south of Tank Farms 1 and 2 if the entire property
were to be redeveloped. However, given that the property is currently developed with some outbuildings
and other infrastructure, the total area of potential disturbance would be less. Given the lack of details
regarding redevelopment, it can be assumed that there would be some permanent conversion of forested
and grassland habitat. Therefore, there is a potential for temporary impacts as well as long-term
cumulative impacts on wildlife.

Draft EIS

13-33

March 2016

Similarly, development of Tank Farms 4 and 5 would result in some permanent conversion of old field
and forested habitat, and there is a potential for temporary and long-term cumulative impacts on wildlife.
Marine Mammals and Fish. Under Alternatives 1 and 2, marine mammals and fish would be
temporarily disturbed during construction of floating docks at the former Naval Hospital and pier
demolition and reconstruction at the proposed shoreline park along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. Noise from construction equipment and activity in the water (i.e., pile driving) would result in
marine mammals and fish temporarily avoiding these areas. According to reference source levels, impact
pile driving of 16-inch diameter concrete piles would produce SPLs of approximately 169 dB re 1µPa
RMS at 10 meters from the source (unattenuated). This source level is less than NMFS Level A threshold
criteria for both pinnipeds and cetaceans. Therefore, no marine mammals would be injured as a result of
Alternative 1 or 2. Although there is the potential for Level B behavioral harassment within 130 feet of
active impact pile driving, it would be expected that the implementation of possible mitigation measures
such as the use of a bubble curtain would reduce the source level and, therefore, the distance to the
threshold range for Level B harassment. Additional mitigation measures may include driving piles with
cushions made of wood to reduce the pressure pulse (Miller et al. 2010). Appropriate mitigation measures
will be identified through consultation with NMFS as part of the Section 7 process. Also, by ensuring that
the Level B acoustic-filled area around active impact pile driving is monitored by a trained marine
mammal/protected species observer, the risk of a marine mammal being exposed to harassing levels of
sound would be reduced.
Based on conservative calculations regarding the distance range from active impact pile driving that the
threshold for potential behavioral impacts would reach coupled with the average number of strikes to
drive a concrete pile, it would be expected that injury based on accumulated SEL could occur to fish
greater than 2 grams within 33 feet of impact pile-driving and to fish less than 2 grams within 66 feet of
impact pile driving. Behavioral disturbance could occur to fish of all sizes within 83 feet of impact piledriving. However, due to this very small acoustic-filled area, and the mitigation measures that will be put
in place, such as the bubble curtain, it would be expected that these areas would be reduced in size, and
therefore impacts would be minor and temporary.
Additional direct impacts include the potential for vessel strikes with marine mammals during
construction and operation. However, strike risk would be expected to be minor because the animals can
avoid the vessels. Indirect impacts on marine mammals include temporary displacement as they avoid
areas of turbidity. Turbidity could also affect foraging success and prey availability. Resuspension of
bottom sediments during both the installation and removal activities would likely have a short-term,
minor adverse impact on the water column due to the small area of disturbance compared with the greater
Narragansett Bay size.
Those foreseeable projects with the potential to result in cumulative impacts when considered with the
proposed action are discussed below.
Proposed re-bulkheading of the quay wall between Piers 1 and 2 under MILCON P469 could result in
noise and suspended sediments in the water column, which would affect the water quality and habitat of
marine resources. These impacts would be short-term, however, and sediments would resettle after the
construction is completed. Potential cumulative impacts would be minimized by avoidance and
minimization measures during all planned in-water construction projects, in addition to the proposed
erosion control planned upon completion of construction. Temporary short-term cumulative impacts
could result from the proposed in-water construction of MILCON P469, considering the in-water work
also proposed for the Navy surplus properties. If construction schedules overlap, potential impacts on
marine mammals would increase from simultaneous proximate in-water projects. Piers 1 and 2 are located

13-34

March 2016

approximately 1.8 miles north of the former Naval Hospital property and approximately 2.3 miles north
of the proposed shoreline park along the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property.
The O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment proposes 1,500 new slips and 900 residential units along the
shore in Weaver Cove in Portsmouth. Construction would include in-water work to develop the boat
slips, potentially impacting marine habitat and wildlife in the vicinity. Noise and vibration would likely
result from these activities, causing temporary disturbance of any marine mammals nearby. Installation
of the marina would result in increased boat traffic in the water, which could result in a long-term direct
impact on marine mammals from vessel strikes.
Threatened or Endangered Species
NMFS Northeast Region has identified various listed species, including whales, sea turtles, and Atlantic
sturgeon, as well as two species of concern (alewife and blueback herring) that have the potential to occur
in the waters of Narragansett Bay offshore of the former Naval Hospital and the Midway Pier/Greene
Lane properties due to their prevalence in New England waters (NOAA 2013).
The North Atlantic right, humpback, and fin whales are not likely to be present in Narragansett Bay near
the former Naval Hospital property or the proposed shoreline park. As such, it is not anticipated that
implementation of Alternatives 1 or 2 would impact these species. Both the loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley
sea turtles have been documented within Narragansett Bay around Aquidneck Island (NBNERR 2009).
Despite a documented occurrence in 2007, due to its highly pelagic nature, the leatherback sea turtle does
not usually make its way into Narragansett Bay north of the bay’s mouth (NBNERR 2009). NMFS
Northeast Region stated that the possibility may occur for the green sea turtle to occur in New England
waters, but that it is rare and sporadic (Colligan 2013). Similar to marine mammals and fish, in-water
noise may also be audible to sea turtles within the vicinity of the project area. NMFS has determined that
source levels of 166 dB re 1µPa RMS or greater could cause behavioral disturbance, and/or other
behavioral or physiological impacts on sea turtles (Lecky 2009). Therefore, there is the potential for
disturbance to sea turtles should impact pile driving occur when sea turtles are present in Narragansett
Bay. Based on modeling, it would be expected that disturbance to sea turtles could occur within 82 feet of
active pile driving. It is likely that sea turtles would avoid the areas where in-water construction was
occurring. It would be expected that any sea turtle potentially occurring in the vicinity of the surplus
property during in-water construction would avoid the areas and therefore avoid impacts. Impacts on sea
turtles would be temporary and result in temporary displacement during demolition, pile driving, and
construction.
Any adult Atlantic sturgeon potentially occurring in the vicinity of the former Naval Hospital during inwater construction would likely avoid the areas and therefore impacts on the Atlantic sturgeon from
operation of construction equipment, including pile driving equipment, and resulting increased turbidity
levels would not be significant. Pile-driving activities associated with Alternative 1 or 2 would generate
underwater noise that the Atlantic sturgeon could be exposed to; however, no effects on the sturgeon
would be expected. Atlantic sturgeon would not be expected to come close to the former Naval Hospital
property or the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property during construction. Any Atlantic sturgeon present
within the general vicinity would be able to detect pile-driving noises which, as a result, may elicit an
avoidance response to the waters around the surplus property. If they were present, using the established
injury thresholds for fish and comparing them to the summary of pile driving sound levels, the peak
threshold for injury would not be exceeded. However, there is a potential for impact based on
accumulated SEL for a single pile within 33 feet of active impact pile driving and behavioral disturbance
within 83 feet of impact pile driving.
The only other reasonably foreseeable projects with in-water work are the proposed re-bulkheading of the
quay wall between Piers 1 and 2 under MILCON P469 and the O’Neil Properties Redevelopment; these

two projects and the potential impacts associated with them are discussed above. Temporary short-term
cumulative impacts could result from the proposed in-water construction of MILCON P469, considering
the in-water work also proposed for the Navy surplus properties. Construction of the boat slips for the
O’Neil Properties Redevelopment would include in-water work to develop the boat slips, potentially
impacting marine habitat and wildlife in the vicinity. Noise and vibration would likely result from these
activities, causing temporary disturbance to any marine mammals nearby. Installing the marina would
result in increased boat traffic in the water, which could result in a minor but long-term cumulative impact
on threatened and endangered species due to vessel strikes.
Federally Listed Species
As discussed in Sections 6.12.3, 8.12.3, and 10.12.3, the northern long-eared bat was listed as threatened
in April 2015, and this species has been observed at NAVSTA Newport. The Navy re-opened dialogue
by sending a letter to the USFWS regarding the northern long-eared bat on June 17, 2015 (Preston
2015a). The Navy received a response from the USFWS via electronic mail requesting that the Navy
initiate informal consultation and provide additional information about the potential effects of the
proposed action on the northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015). The Navy provided an assessment
of the potential impacts on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). The Navy contacted the USFWS regarding
the potential presence of the northern long-eared bat at the surplus properties on June 17, 2015 (Preston
2015a). The Navy received a response from the USFWS via electronic mail requesting that the Navy
initiate informal consultation and provide additional information about the potential effects of the
proposed action on the northern long-eared bat (von Oettingen 2015). The Navy provided an assessment
of the potential impacts on August 27, 2015 (Preston 2015b). To date, USFWS has not provided a
response, and further informal consultation with the USFWS on the potential effects of the proposed
action on the northern long-eared bat is ongoing. ESA consultation for northern long-eared bat is ongoing.
The Navy has documented the presence of the northern long-eared bat within approximately 0.3 mile
from the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property and suitable habitat within approximately 50 feet from the
Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, the closest surplus property to documented species presence and
suitable habitat presence. While no specific habitat surveys have been completed on the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property or the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property (approximately 1 mile away from
documented suitable habitat) to identify suitable habitat, the same general habitat types –—old field and
ruderal forest—exists on the surplus property and Tank Farms 4 and 5, the closest sites where suitable
habitat has been surveyed and identified. Permanent removal of old field and ruderal forest habitat would
be necessary to facilitate redevelopment at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane and Tank Farms 1 and 2
properties. To be conservative, the ultimate property developer and/or property owner of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property and the Tank Farms 1 and 2 property would implement a number of BMPs,
specific to safeguarding the northern long-eared bat.
Several of the past, present, or reasonably foreseeable projects —the light industrial redevelopment along
West Main Road, the Melville “Backyard,” the O’Neil Properties Group Redevelopment, and the
proposed solar facility at Tank Farms 4 and 5—would also permanently remove shrubland and forested
habitats. However, given the amount of total forest cover in the state, coupled with remaining forested
areas around Aquidneck Island, cumulative impacts on these habitats may affect, but are not likely to
adversely affect northern long-eared bats in the state.
13.3.8.3 Significant Wildlife Habitat
This discussion focuses on those significant wildlife habitats that would be impacted as a result of
implementation of Alternatives 1 and 2.
Wetlands
Cumulative impacts on wetlands are discussed above in Section 13.3.7.2.
Draft EIS

13-36

March 2016

Essential Fish Habitat
The proposed action under Alternatives 1 and 2 at the former Naval Hospital and Midway Pier/Greene
Lane surplus properties and development of MILCON P469 would result in temporary minor impacts on
EFH. These impacts would be temporary and not expected to be significant. As indicated in Sections
7.12.1.4 and 11.12.1.4, the Navy has determined environmental impacts from the proposed action at the
former Naval Hospital and Midway Pier/Greene Lane properties will not adversely affect designated EFH
within the Narragansett Bay.
The marina development and resulting increase in boat traffic from the O’Neil Properties Group
Redevelopment could adversely affect EFH for 17 species as a result of this development.
Short-term minor impacts associated with in-water construction activities, such as from the installation of
new pilings, would increase suspended sediments and noise levels. However, the majority of EFH species
are highly mobile and would likely leave the area during construction activities and return when these
activities are completed; even the less mobile species (e.g., flounder) could readily avoid harm from
construction. Also, the adverse effects on the habitat and forage species that occur at the property would
be short-term and localized. The increased vessel traffic associated with operation of the enhanced pier
would result in minor adverse effects on EFH through increased disturbance of the water column and the
increased potential for spills or fuel leaks into the water column. However, because vessel usage within
the bay already is extensive, cumulative impacts would not be significant. Therefore, overall cumulative
impacts on EFH would be short-term and minor.

14 Best Management Practices, Mitigation, and Monitoring

This section provides a summary of the BMPs applicable to all of the surplus properties and action
alternatives and the site-specific mitigation measures that are presented in Chapters 5, 7, 9, and 11 for
each alternative at the former Navy Lodge property, former Naval Hospital property, Tank Farms 1 and 2,
and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property, respectively, to mitigate site-specific impacts. These BMPs
and mitigation measures are appropriate and reasonable and would reduce the environmental impacts
associated with the redevelopment of the surplus properties at NAVSTA Newport. All of the BMPs and
mitigation measures discussed below are the responsibility of the developer, except where indicated
otherwise.
The BMPs and mitigation measures identified below generally apply to both Alternative 1 and 2. Where
a BMP or mitigation measure is specific to one of the four properties, it is noted in parentheses.

14.1 Best Management Practices

There are not specific BMPs associated with Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice or Cultural
Resources. BMPs associated with the other resource areas evaluated in this EIS are noted below.
Land Use, Zoning, and Coastal Resources
• The Town of Middletown should implement the proposed Coddington Center Overlay
District and retain ownership of the parcel (Navy Lodge).
• Modify the site’s existing zoning designation rezoning the area or revising the types of
uses permitted in the Residential R-10 zoning district (City of Newport), or obtain a
variance from the requirements of the current zoning ordinance (Naval Hospital).
• Apply for a use variance from the requirements of the zoning ordinance (Tank Farms 1
and 2).
Transportation
• Before construction, the developer should confirm sight distances for the potential
driveway location and design driveway to maximize visibility for motorists turning into
and out of the property while providing accurate signs enabling motorists to identify the
site.
Environmental Management
• The developer should ensure that demolition and construction contracts contain
traditional terms and conditions requiring recycling C&D waste to the extent practicable.
• The developer should note the possibility of an on-site UST in the construction contract.
If a UST is encountered during redevelopment of the property, it will have to be managed
in accordance with RIDEM’s UST regulations.
• The developer should note the possibility of asbestos wrap on underground utility pipes
in the construction contract. Any underground ACM encountered during building
construction would need to be evaluated by a specialized ACM removal contractor.
• If the one transformer reported at the former Navy Lodge is handled or removed during
redevelopment activities, the developer should inspect it for a “PCB-free” label. If such a
label is not found, the transformer should be evaluated for PCBs (Navy Lodge).
• Use specialized and authorized removal contractors for removal and disposal of the ACM
and LBP during removal of Tanks 9 and 10 and demolition of various structures (Tank
Farms 1 and 2).

Draft EIS

14-1

March 2016

Air Quality
•
•
•
•

Noise

•

The developer should properly maintain equipment, adhere to idling-reduction measures,
and use newer, more efficient equipment with diesel retrofits to control fine particulate
matter (PM10) to decrease air emissions.
The developer should regularly water graded areas and clean streets after grading
activities.
The developer should design buildings to meet stringent energy-efficiency standards to
mitigate operational air emissions.
The developer should implement traffic-easing roadway designs to lower vehicle speed
and reduce congestion and expand public transportation and carpooling programs to
reduce vehicle emissions.
The developer should conduct construction activities between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and
8:00 p.m. when the noise would be less disturbing for area residents.

Infrastructure and Utilities
• The developer should use BMPs for water quality control as described in the Rhode
Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual (RIDEM and CRMC 2010).
•

The developer should use BMPs for structural measures (e.g., grassed waterway,
sediment basin, riprap, etc.) and non-structural measures (e.g., mulching, placing topsoil,
silt curtains, etc.) as described in the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook (RIDEM et al. 1989) to decrease impacts on soils and erosion.

•

Adhere to the Town of Portsmouth’s 2008 Storm Water Discharge Control Ordinance
and 2010 Storm Water and Sediment Control Ordinance. Implement temporary erosion
and sediment control measures during construction, permanent storm water management
measures, and appropriate building site location and design (Tank Farms 1 and 2).

Topography, Geology, and Soils
• The developer should use BMPs for structural measures (e.g., grassed waterway,
sediment basin, riprap, etc.) and non-structural measures (e.g., mulching, placing topsoil,
silt curtains, etc.) as described in the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook (RIDEM et al. 1989) to decrease impacts on soils and erosion.
• The developer should implement temporary erosion and sediment control measures
during construction, permanent storm water management measures, and appropriate
building site location and design.
Water Resources
• The developer should implement temporary erosion and sediment control measures
during construction, permanent storm water management measures, and appropriate
building site location and design.
•

•

Draft EIS

The developer should use standard dewatering techniques and follow erosion sediment
control plans and BMPs that would involve preventing erosion, selecting an appropriate
discharge location, removing sediment from collected water, and preserving
downgradient natural resources.
Minimize or offset impacts from redevelopment that could potentially degrade floodplain
values and increase the flood risk to upstream and downstream activities (Naval
Hospital).

14-2

March 2016

•
•
•
•

Implement an emergency response plan by the construction contractor in the event of an
accidental spill into the water (Naval Hospital).
Install gutters and filtration devices along the deck to decrease petroleum run-off into the
water from construction vessels (Naval Hospital and Midway Pier/Greene Lane).
Minimize or offset impacts from redevelopment that could potentially degrade floodplain
values or increase the flood risk to upstream and downstream activities (Midway
Pier/Greene Lane).
Implement an emergency response plan by the construction contractor in the event of an
accidental spill into the water (Midway Pier/Greene Lane).

Biological Resources
• The developer should restore temporarily disturbed areas.
•

Implement an SPCC plan that will minimize the adverse effects on fisheries resources of
any spill and provide procedures for clean-up effort (Naval Hospital and Midway
Pier/Greene Lane).

•

Restore bottom contours and shoreline areas in the vicinity of the construction activities
to mitigate impacts on fisheries resources (Naval Hospital).

•

To minimize potential impacts on the northern long-eared bat, the developer should
implement the following BMPs or protective measures (Tank Farms 1 and 2 and Midway
Pier/Greene Lane):

•

−

Project activities must occur more than 0.25 miles from known, occupied
hibernacula.

−

All clearing of trees and vegetation on-site shall take place in the timeframe between
October 1st – April 15th.

To minimize potential impacts on marine mammals, the developer should implement the
following potential protective measures (Naval Hospital and Midway Pier/Greene Lane):
− Monitoring for the presence of marine mammals with a trained marine
mammal/protected species observer stationed at shore-side locations or from a boat in
the harbor during all pile-driving activities. Work will be stopped if marine mammals
are spotted.
− Installing a bubble curtain to reduce in-water noise during pile driving.
− Driving piles with a cushion made of wood to reduce pressure pulse.

14.2 Mitigation Measures

There are not specific mitigation measures associated with certain resource areas, such as Land Use,
Zoning and Coastal Resources, Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice, Community Services and
Facilities, Environmental Management, Air Quality, Noise, Infrastructure and Utilities, and Water
Resources. Mitigation measures and/or protective measures associated with the other resource areas
evaluated in this EIS are noted in below.
Transportation
• The developer will review sight distances and driveway design to maximize visibility for
motorists.

Draft EIS

14-3

March 2016

•
•

•

The developer will improve roadways by revising signs, striping, or by instituting
requirements for improving roadway and traffic configurations, depending on final
design of the driveway and parking lot network.
Review the need for new traffic signals or signs to ensure that safety and the level of
service is not impacted. With an increase in traffic and risks, signalize the intersections of
West Main Road and Bradford Avenue and Defense Highway and Stringham Road to
mitigate safety concerns at these intersections (Tank Farms 1 and 2).
If Bradford Avenue is ultimately to be used an as access point, signalization/roadway
improvements would need to be considered to improve safety in the vicinity of the
Melville School per the Traffic Impact Assessment. These may include limiting the
existing easement along the road to only emergency vehicles or installing a traffic light
(Tank Farms 1 and 2).

Cultural Resources
• The Navy is in the process of consulting with the Rhode Island SHPO pursuant to Section
106 of the NHPA, including consulting on the effects of the proposed action on historic
properties within the APE (Preston 2013; Lin 2013). As part of this ongoing
consultation, the Rhode Island SHPO has acknowledged that once the Navy has disposed
of the property, subsequent redevelopment is outside of the Navy’s control and has
indicated that a standard treatment to mitigate any indirect adverse effects of subsequent
redevelopment on historic properties would be to include a historic preservation easement
in a deed of transfer (Sanderson 2013a) (Naval Hospital and Tank Farms 1 and 2).
Topography, Geology, and Soils
Biological Resources
• Continue consultation with USFWS once project-specific details (i.e., construction plans)
are available to determine appropriate mitigation measures (Tank Farms 1 and 2 and
Midway Pier/Greene Lane).
•

Continue consultation with NMFS for EFH once project-specific details (i.e.,
construction plans) are available to determine appropriate mitigation measures (Naval
Hospital and Midway Pier/Greene Lane).

14.3 Monitoring

No long-term monitoring has been found to be applicable for this EIS.

15.2 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources

NEPA (42 U.S.C. § 4332 Section 102(2)(C)(v), as implemented by CEQ regulation 40 CFR 1502.16),
requires an analysis of significant, irreversible effects resulting from implementation of a proposed action.
Resources that are irreversibly or irretrievably committed to a project are those that are typically used on
a long-term or permanent basis; however, those used on a short-term basis that cannot be recovered (e.g.,
non-renewable resources such as metal, wood, fuel, paper, and other natural or cultural resources) also are
irretrievable. Human labor is also considered an irretrievable resource. All such resources are irretrievable
Draft EIS

15-2

March 2016

in that they are used for a project and, thus, become unavailable for other purposes. An impact that falls
under the category of the irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources is the destruction of
natural resources that could limit the range of potential uses of that resource.
Short-term irreversible commitments of resources associated with the construction activities include the
use of energy and utilities. Construction materials and building supplies would be committed to the
redevelopment and reuse of the surplus properties at NAVSTA Newport. The use of these materials, such
as gravel, concrete, steel, glass, etc., represents a long-term commitment of these resources that would not
be available for other projects. Fuel, lubricants, and electricity would be required during construction
activities for the operation of the various types of construction equipment and vehicles and for the
transportation of workers and materials to the construction sites. However, these resources are not in short
supply, and their use would not have an adverse effect upon their continued availability.
In the long-term, implementation of either Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 would result in irreversible or
irretrievable commitments of resources if land development were to physically eliminate or diminish the
character of natural resources on or immediately adjacent to the surplus properties. Specifically, this
would include threatened and endangered species and significant wildlife habitat. Each of the surplus
properties has been previously developed with buildings, roadways, and other infrastructure. As such, the
properties do not represent unaltered or non-disturbed areas. No designated critical habitat exists within
the surplus properties. However, several listed marine mammals and one fish (Atlantic sturgeon) have the
potential to be present off-shore of the former Naval Hospital property and the Midway Pier/Greene Lane
property. Any potential impacts on these listed species would not result in an irreversible or irretrievable
commitment of resources. Under Alternatives 1 and 2, permanent wetland impacts would result.
Approximately 0.04 acres of marine/estuarine wetland along the former Naval Hospital shoreline would
be filled to facilitate construction of the floating docks. Additionally, approximately 0.08 acres of a
potential wetland would be filled to facilitate redevelopment at Tank Farm 1 under Alternative 1, and 0.09
acres under Alternative 2.
Under Alternative 1, approximately 2.7 acres of mixed oak/white pine forest, 9.2 acres of old field, and
14.5 acres of ruderal forest at Tank Farms 1 and 2 would be permanently converted to facilitate
redevelopment. Under Alternative 2, the same acreages for mixed oak/white pine forest and old field
would be permanently converted as under Alternative 1. Additionally, 16.4 acres of ruderal forest would
be permanently converted. These impacts would not be considered significant for several reasons: the
tank farms have already been developed; undeveloped areas on-site following redevelopment would
remain undeveloped; and the adjacent property would also remain undeveloped. Under Alternative 1,
approximately 0.6 acres of old field habitat would be permanently converted to facilitate the development
of the shoreline park and the multi-use pathway at the Midway Pier/Greene Lane property. Under
Alternative 2, a slightly larger area of old field habitat would be converted, for a total of 0.7 acres. Similar
to Tank Farms 1 and 2, these impacts would not be considered significant, as portions of the Midway
Pier/Greene Lane property were previously developed, and open space areas within the property would be
left undeveloped as old field habitat.
The disposal of surplus property, although an irreversible action, does not represent an irretrievable
commitment of land resources, since this action makes resources available for future reuses. The proposed
action also represents the irretrievable commitment of human resources and materials requiring the use of
fossil fuels, electrical energy, and other energy resources during construction and operation of facilities.
These resources would be irretrievably committed to the action. However, under both Alternatives 1 and
2, a solar array is proposed for development at the Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties. It is expected that 1.2
million kWh of energy would be generated by the solar array; it is assumed this energy would help to offset the energy used for operation of the new facilities at the Tank Farm 1 and 2 properties.

15.3 Relationship between Short-term Use of the Environment and Longterm Productivity

NEPA requires consideration of the relationship between short-term use of the environment and the
impacts that such use could have on the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of the
affected environment. Impacts that narrow the range of beneficial uses of the environment are of
particular concern. Such impacts include the possibility that choosing one alternative could reduce future
flexibility to pursue other alternatives, or that choosing a certain use could eliminate the possibility of
other uses at the site.
Implementation of either Alternative 1 or Alternative 2 would result in new development requiring
various services; under Alternative 2, the level of services needed would be higher than that under
Alternative 1. Long-term benefits resulting from implementation of either of these alternatives would
occur at the expense of short-term impacts in the vicinity of the surplus properties. These short-term
impacts would occur during the construction period of the selected alternative. Implementation of either
alternative would require an estimated 20-year build-out period. During this period, the following types of
construction activities would occur: demolition, clearing, grading, excavating, surfacing, road and parking
paving, erection of structures, and landscaping. Short-term impacts on local noise, air quality, water
resources, and biological resources, as well as possible traffic detours and delays, could occur in the
vicinity of the surplus properties. However, these impacts would be temporary, and proper controls, in the
form of BMPs and other measures, would be utilized to prevent these effects from having significant
impacts on the environment.
In addition, short-term gains in the local economy would occur if local workers are hired and if local
businesses provide services and supplies during the construction period. Upon completion of
redevelopment, the gains in the local economy would evolve into long-term benefits from the reuse of the
surplus properties, including an expanded municipal tax base, new businesses and job creation and,
potentially, new employee and business spending in the region.
