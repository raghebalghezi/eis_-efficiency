Abstract:
This Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) analyzes the impacts from demolition of two historic
World War II-era hangars at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The Draft EIS also looks at other disposition
options and a “no action” alternative. Both buildings have been found to be unsafe for occupancy and
have no remaining military purpose. The hangars are contributing resources within the Ladd Field
National Historic Landmark and Ladd Air Force Base Cold War Historic District, and their loss would
be a significant impact to cultural resources. All other impacts would be less than significant.
Mitigation measures are described to minimize adverse impacts on cultural resources.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has been prepared in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) (42 United States Code §4321 et seq.); NEPAimplementing regulations issued by the President’s Council on Environmental Quality (40 Code of
Federal Regulations [CFR] §§1500–1508); and the Army’s NEPA-implementing regulation (32 CFR
§651, Environmental Analysis of Army Actions).

Proposed Action
The United States (U.S.) Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) prepared this Draft
EIS to assess the potential environmental impacts resulting from the determination and implementation
of a disposition for Hangars 2 and 3 and supporting infrastructure 1 located at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.
The USAG FWA is home to the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark (Ladd Field NHL) and the
Ladd Air Force Base Cold War Historic District (Cold War Historic District). Hangars 2 and 3 are
contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District. The USAG FWA
concluded that the determination and implementation of a disposition for the hangars would have an
adverse effect on the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District. Because the hangars are
contributing resources within the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District, the proposal to
determine and implement a new disposition or state for Hangars 2 and 3 is considered an undertaking
under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and requires Section 106 consultation procedures
of the NHPA to be followed. Actions will be taken to avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate any
adverse effects on historic properties.
The intent of this Draft EIS is to inform the decision makers, agencies, interested parties, Alaska Native
tribes, and the public of possible environmental consequences associated with the Proposed Action.

Purpose and Need for Action
The military built Hangars 2 and 3 between 1943 and 1944 as semi-permanent structures with a
functional lifespan of 40 years. At the end of their life expectancy in 1983, the hangars continued to be
used without a long-term plan or funding to perform a large-scale rehabilitation of the structures.

1

The supporting infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, concrete foundations, the small, empty, flammable liquids
storage facility located between Hangars 2 and 3, paved parking areas, utilities (i.e., service utilidors, manholes, vents, utility
poles, head bolt heaters, electrical power lines, and communications), and the security fence line.

Executive Summary

iii

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Funding was focused on mission-essential programs and needs of the installation with maintenance and
repair of Hangars 2 and 3 occurring as necessary. In addition, to accommodate changing missions, the
Army completed numerous interior modifications to the hangars, including creating doorways and
windows and altering the interior lateral cross-bracing. The lack of large-scale rehabilitation and the
numerous interior modifications, along with the age of the structures, a fire in Hangar 2, and the harsh
Alaskan environment, have contributed to the compromised structural integrity of both hangars. The
hangars now exhibit serious structural, electrical, and safety deficiencies, and both have been declared
unsafe for occupancy and are vacant. As a result, helicopter maintenance activities performed in
Hangars 2 and 3 were relocated to other facilities along the airfield. Because basic utilities are kept on
throughout the year, approximately $350,000 per hangar is spent annually to provide minimum heating,
electrical, and water utilities.
The purpose of the Proposed Action is to resolve the safety and fiscal concerns regarding the hangars,
as well as to address the underutilization of the real property space they occupy. Determination of their
disposition is needed to resolve their inability to meet the functional requirements as maintenance
facilities for modern aircraft, to resolve their current condemned status that prevents them from serving
an active military function at Fort Wainwright, and to resolve the safety hazard they present.
Implementation of a final decision on the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 would meet the following
objectives:
•

Eliminate fire and safety issues associated with Hangars 2 and 3

•

Eliminate non-mission essential funding expenditures

•

Make available the valuable airfield space the hangars occupy to support the military mission
because the hangars no longer meet the functional requirements of maintenance facilities for
aircraft and are unable to support the aviation mission

•

Meet the special requirements for NHLs under Section 110 of the NHPA and its implementing
regulations (to the maximum extent possible, undertake such necessary planning and actions
that minimize harm to NHLs)

•

Avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate any adverse effects on historic resources through
Section 106 consultation

EIS Study Area
The study area for this Draft EIS includes the area potentially influenced by the Proposed Action. The
main study area includes Hangars 2 and 3 and the area immediately surrounding them; however, for
some resource areas, the area potentially influenced by the Proposed Action extends beyond the

iv

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
immediate vicinity. For example, air quality impacts have a regional influence; impacts to cultural
resources include the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District; and impacts from hazardous
materials and hazardous waste and impacts to safety, environmental justice and the protection of
children, and transportation may affect portions of Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB).

Public, Agency, and Tribal Outreach
The Army published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS for the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3
in the Federal Register on November 16, 2011 (76 Federal Register 70978). Publication of the NOI
began a 63-day scoping period from November 16, 2011, to January 17, 2012. The Army also published
an Open House Public Meeting notice in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner on November 11 and 16,
2011, and on December 4, 7, 11, and 14, 2011. The notice indicated the Army’s intent to prepare an
EIS, conduct Section 106 consultation, and hold a public scoping meeting on December 14, 2011.
The Army used the scoping period to help determine the resource areas to be addressed in the EIS and
to identify significant issues related to the Proposed Action. Comments received during the scoping
period suggested the following potential alternatives: donating the hangars to the Tanana Valley State
Fair Association, converting one or both hangars into a roller derby rink for use by the local roller derby
leagues, and moving both hangars to alternate locations in Fairbanks to be used by the community as a
museum or to support other activities. These alternatives were considered and are addressed in Chapter
2.0 of the Draft EIS. Another comment indicated that alternatives for the Proposed Action need to take
into account the military mission of Fort Wainwright. As described in Chapter 2.0 of the Draft EIS, as
part of the screening criteria for alternatives, the mission of Fort Wainwright is taken into consideration
in determining which alternatives to carry forward for analysis.
The USAG FWA held an agency scoping meeting on December 15, 2011, at the initiation of the EIS
process to inform agencies of the Proposed Action and to solicit input on the potential alternatives and
areas of concern that the individual agencies might have. Agency representatives provided a number of
comments that helped the USAG FWA focus the EIS analysis on the environmental issues of
importance. The major theme of the comments concerned the hangars’ historical significance and
context, the desire to preserve that significance, and accessibility to the public for appreciation.
Additional comments included concerns about hazardous materials and air quality impacts.
The USAG FWA also consulted with Alaska Native tribes. Six federally recognized tribes were sent
letters notifying them of the Army’s intent to prepare an EIS and informing them about the public
scoping meeting times and locations. The tribes were also offered the opportunity to enter into
government-to-government consultation, as well as to become consulting parties to the NHPA Section

106 process. The letters were followed up with emails, telephone calls, and faxes, respective of the
tribes’ wishes for mode of communication. The Army received responses from four tribes (Village of
Dot Lake, Healy Lake Village, Native Village of Tanacross, Native Village of Tetlin, and), indicating
they would not require consultation. The remaining two tribes (Nenana Native Association and
Northway Village) did not provide formal responses. The Army followed up with these two tribes via
email and telephone calls to discuss the undertaking, and it was understood by the USAG FWA that
although a formal response was not issued, consultation would not be required.
The Draft EIS has been filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the Army
published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register. A 45-day public comment period begins on
the date the USEPA publishes its notice of receipt of the Draft EIS in the Federal Register. Notices
announcing the availability of the Draft EIS and the public meetings are being published in the
Fairbanks Daily News-Miner four times between the release of the Draft EIS and the public meetings,
and a final notice will be published in the newspaper prior to the end of the comment period. The Army
also sent notices to agency and tribal representatives, as well as private individuals and organizations,
that expressed interest in the EIS. Copies of the Draft EIS were provided to the Noel Wien Library, and
the Draft EIS files were posted to the USAG FWA Environmental website available at:
http://www.wainwright.army.mil/env/NEPA/Current.html.
An agency meeting and a public meeting will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, to review the Army’s
Proposed Action and findings of the Draft EIS and to collect comments. The meetings will be an open
house format and include a verbal presentation by Army representatives. A court reporter will
transcribe the proceedings of the meetings and take formal comments at the public meeting. Comments
submitted will be thoroughly considered and incorporated into the Final EIS, where appropriate.

Alternatives
The Army considered a wide range of potential alternatives for the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 on
Fort Wainwright. The USAG FWA used a screening process to evaluate five action alternatives,
eventually narrowing the list to those considered reasonable and legally viable. This Draft EIS evaluates
the only reasonable action alternative and the No Action Alternative.

Executive Summary

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Alternatives Screening Criteria
The following screening criteria were developed based on the purpose and need for the Proposed
Action:
1. The action must directly address the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3.
2. The action must be compatible with the current and future military mission at Fort Wainwright.
3. The action must not be prohibitively expensive. This means a viable disposition option is one
where the amount of money required to implement it would be supported by the Army’s
funding decision process or non-federal sources.
4. The action must have a reasonably foreseeable funding source, or mechanism for obtaining
applicable and timely funding, to pay for life, health, and safety upgrades or demolition actions.

Alternatives Considered
The Army considered five separate alternatives:
1. Demolition of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both
2. Rehabilitation of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both to support identified uses
3. Removal and reconstruction of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both on Fort Wainwright
4. Closed layaway of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both
5. Transfer of ownership of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both to non-Army entities
The above four screening criteria were applied to all five of the alternatives and each of the alternative’s
specific uses. All of the action alternatives other than demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 were not
compatible with the current or future military mission or were prohibitively expensive.
As a result of the analysis of the alternatives based on the screening criteria, only one action alternative
was considered reasonable and will be carried forward in the Draft EIS for further evaluation—
demolition of Hangars 2 and 3. None of the other uses met all four of the screening criteria and were
dismissed from further evaluation. The No Action alternative also will be carried forward in the Draft
EIS for a full analysis in accordance with Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR
§1502.14).

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3
Under this alternative, Hangars 2 and 3 and their supporting infrastructure would be demolished
beginning in spring 2014. Demolition would involve removal of the hangars, totaling 24,016 cubic
yards of non-hazardous debris; demolition of existing and abandoned utilities not belonging to Doyon
Utilities (the current utility provider for the installation), totaling approximately 2,680 linear feet;

Executive Summary

vii

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
demolition of existing parking areas for privately owned vehicles, lighting, head bolt outlets and power
source, encompassing an area of approximately 3.3 acres; and demolition of the concrete building slabs
and foundations within 5 feet of the building, to a depth of 8 inches, totaling approximately 2,075 cubic
yards of debris. In addition, a small (200-square-foot), open, flammable liquids storage facility located
between Hangars 2 and 3, which is currently empty, would be demolished, totaling approximately
91 cubic yards of debris. Prior to demolition, the Army would conduct hazardous material surveys of
the buildings and their supporting infrastructure, including surveys for soil contamination. The Army
would remove and dispose of any hazardous materials found. Asbestos containing building materials
would be disposed of in the Fort Wainwright landfill, while all other hazardous materials would be
disposed of off-post in the FNSB landfill in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations.
Non-hazardous demolition debris would be disposed of in the FNSB landfill; however, the Army would
divert (i.e., salvage, recycle, or reuse) non-hazardous materials from being placed in the landfill to the
maximum extent practicable.
Once demolition of the hangars is complete, concrete would be added to the building and infrastructure
footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield, which is designated as an aircraft parking
apron. The Army would construct two asphalt access roads to the new apron to facilitate travel by
emergency and maintenance vehicles. Infiltration areas, swales, and culverts for stormwater would be
installed as needed, to include the addition of topsoil and seeding. Security fencing, compatible with
existing design, would also be installed. The total area encompassed by this project is approximately
10 acres. Any future construction on this site is currently unknown and is beyond the scope of this EIS.
If future construction does occur, it would be the subject of separate NEPA documentation. Alternative
1 is the Army’s preferred alternative.

Alternative 2: No Action
Under the No Action Alternative, no demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would occur. While remaining
intact, the hangars would continue to not meet the functional requirements of maintenance facilities for
aircraft and would serve no active military function. The hangars would remain vacant because they
have been found to be unsafe for occupancy. The Army would continue to heat the facilities to prevent
snow buildup on the roofs (which, if allowed to accumulate, could cause their collapse). Maintenance
and upkeep of the hangars, such as security patrols, pest control, and building systems maintenance,
would continue based on current funding levels and other maintenance priorities at Fort Wainwright;
however, as large structural systems fail, they would not be replaced or receive major repairs. For
example, recent freezing and bursting of water pipes in Hangar 2 in late 2012 rendered the fire

viii

suppression system within the side offices inoperable. Unsafe working conditions and current funding
levels prevent this system from being repaired.
Maintenance and upkeep of the hangars, including utilities, requires approximately $350,000 per hangar
in annual funding. Given the current disrepair of the hangars, they present safety concerns for any
person entering them, and in some cases, safety concerns prevent maintenance (USAG FWA, 2011a).
Prior to their condemnation in 2011, the following maintenance activities were performed: fire
suppression sprinkler maintenance, oil-water separator maintenance, minor facility preventative
maintenance, and project-by-project repair maintenance. All maintenance activities except fire
suppression sprinkler maintenance were halted following the determination that the hangars were
unsafe for occupancy. Because there will be no large-scale rehabilitation efforts and the likelihood that
future system failure will not result in replacement or repair, the structural integrity of the hangars will
continue to deteriorate over time. The eventual uncontrolled collapse of the buildings or perhaps the
total loss of one or both hangars by fire, due to inoperable fire suppression systems, is likely. At such
time the buildings do collapse, all debris would be treated as waste and disposed of in the FNSB
landfill. Due to the uncontrolled nature of the potential collapse, it is likely that the option for salvaging,
recycling, or reusing building materials would be eliminated. Thus, the total amount of debris generated
under the No Action Alternative would likely be more than that generated under Alternative 1 due to
the inability to divert materials from local landfills. Any follow-on actions associated with the location
would be subject to funding, but the current preference would be that concrete is added to the building
footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield as an aircraft parking apron.

Environmental Consequences and Proposed Mitigation Measures
This Draft EIS presents the existing environment and the potential environmental consequences that
could occur with implementing Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, or Alternative 2, No
Action, as well as mitigation measures for reducing environmental impacts associated with the
alternatives. Table ES-1 summarizes the environmental impacts associated with each alternative for
each resource area evaluated in this Draft EIS. A summary of proposed mitigation measures is provided
after the table.

Field National Historic Landmark

For all of the resource areas, except cultural resources, none of the effects of the Proposed Action
would result in significant impacts; therefore, no mitigation measures are needed and none were
identified. For cultural resources, the loss of the hangars as contributing resources to the Ladd Field
NHL and the Cold War Historic District, either through demolition under Alternative 1 or the likely
uncontrolled collapse of the buildings under the No Action Alternative, would be a severe impact.
Despite the physical loss of the hangars, the impact to the overall integrity of the Ladd Field NHL and
Cold War Historic District would be moderate. Because of the adverse impacts to the Ladd Field NHL
and the Cold War Historic District, mitigation measures were developed and agreed upon in a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among the USAG FWA, the Alaska State Historic Preservation
Office, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation through the Section 106 consultation
process. The mitigation measures, which are fully described in the MOA, will include public outreach,
x

re-evaluation of the Ladd Field NHL, and stewardship of the Ladd Field NHL. Mitigation under the No
Action Alternative would be the same as under Alternative 1, except the time frame for completing the
stipulations would be based on the date of execution of the MOA, rather than on the demolition of the
hangars.
Though the Proposed Action would not result in significant impacts to any of the resource areas other
than cultural resources, there are a number of standard measures, including best management practices,
that would be employed where appropriate, to reduce or minimize potential impacts for air quality,
hazardous materials and hazardous waste, and transportation.

Cumulative Effects Analysis
The Army conducted a cumulative impact assessment to determine if the combined effects of each
alternative along with other projects in the region might be significant. After review of past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable future actions occurring in the same region of influence as the Proposed
Action, the Army determined that the following resources could be sensitive to cumulative effects:
cultural resources and hazardous materials/hazardous waste.
For cultural resources, the geographic scope of analysis was expanded to include World War II
resources in Alaska, with particular focus on World War II NHLs in Alaska. For hazardous
materials/hazardous waste, the geographic scope included FNSB. Other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions considered during the cumulative effects analysis comprise military
construction, military training, military reorganization, and World War II resources. The analysis in the
Draft EIS concludes that there would be cumulative effects on cultural resources and from hazardous
materials/hazardous waste; however, the effects would not be significant. For cultural resources, the
loss of the two hangars would contribute to the dwindling numbers of World War II resources in
Alaska, resulting in moderate cumulative impacts. For hazardous materials/hazardous waste, the
amount of construction and demolition debris from the Proposed Action and other identified projects
disposed of in the landfills would contribute to minor cumulative impacts. Impacts would be minor
because the Fort Wainwright landfill already has a proposed closure date of September 2015 and the
FNSB landfill already accepts on average 298 tons of debris per day and is expected to be operational
until the year 2086.

Conclusion
After considering public, agency, and tribal input and comments on the Draft EIS, and reviewing the
environmental impacts associated with the alternatives to the Proposed Action, the Army will select an
alternative to implement. The Army’s final decision, to be made by the USAG FWA Garrison
Commander, will be documented in a Record of Decision and take into account technical and economic
feasibility; life, health, and safety concerns; environmental issues; and the ability to meet objectives of
the Fort Wainwright and U.S. Army Alaska missions.

PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION

Introduction

The United States (U.S.) Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) prepared this Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the potential environmental impacts of its proposal to
determine and implement the disposition 2 of Hangars 2 and 3 and supporting infrastructure, 3 located on
the Main Post of Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The U.S. Department of the Army (Army) considered
dispositions, ranging from various reuses to demolition. The hangars are contributing resources to the
Ladd Field National Historic Landmark (Ladd Field NHL) and the Ladd Air Force Base (Ladd AFB)
Cold War Historic District (Cold War Historic District). Constructed between 1943 and 1944 as semipermanent structures, these hangars have received varying degrees of operational maintenance over the
years, but no large-scale rehabilitation has occurred. To accommodate changing missions, the Army
completed numerous interior modifications to the hangars, including creating doorways and windows
and altering the interior lateral cross-bracing. The lack of a large-scale rehabilitation and the numerous
interior modifications, along with the age of the structures, a fire in Hangar 2, and the harsh Alaskan
environment, have contributed to the compromised structural integrity of both hangars. The USAG
FWA has condemned the buildings, and they are no longer used because of the safety hazard they
present.
This Draft EIS has been prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as
amended (NEPA) (42 United States Code [U.S.C.] §4321 et seq.); NEPA-implementing regulations
issued by the President’s Council on Environmental Quality4 (CEQ) (40 Code of Federal Regulations
[CFR] §§1500–1508); and the Army’s NEPA-implementing regulation (32 CFR §651, Environmental
Analysis of Army Actions). The purpose of this Draft EIS is to inform the decision makers, agencies,
interested parties, Alaska Native tribes, and the public of possible environmental consequences
associated with the reasonable disposition alternatives for Hangars 2 and 3.

2

For purposes of this study, the term disposition refers to the future and final treatment of the hangars.

3

The supporting infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, concrete foundations, the small, empty, flammable liquids
storage facility located between Hangars 2 and 3, paved parking areas, utilities (i.e., service utilidors, manholes, vents, utility
poles, head bolt heaters, electrical power lines, and communications), and the security fence line.
4
Established within the Executive Office of the President by Congress as part of NEPA, CEQ oversees federal agency
implementation of the environmental impact assessment process and ensures that federal agencies meet their obligations under
NEPA.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
As contributing resources 5 to both the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District, Hangars 2 and 3
are important resources to Fort Wainwright’s history. Because of their special designation as part of the
Ladd Field NHL, the determination of their disposition merits special consideration. The USAG FWA
has entered into consultation concerning the hangars’ proposed disposition as required by Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR §800).
The USAG FWA concludes that the disposition of the hangars would result in historic properties being
adversely affected. The disposition of the hangars would adversely affect two contributing resources
and, in so doing, would adversely affect the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District. In
accordance with 32 CFR §651.41(b), an EIS is required when a proposed action has the potential to
significantly affect historic resources; consequently, the USAG FWA prepared a Draft EIS for this
action.
NHLs are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they
possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage and history of the United
States (NPS, 2012a). Currently, there are approximately 2,500 properties with this distinction. Because
NHLs possess national-level significance, the NHPA includes provisions that specifically address a
federal agency’s responsibilities when its activities affect these properties. Section 110(f) of the NHPA
requires that federal agencies exercise a higher standard of care when considering undertakings that
may directly and adversely affect NHLs. The law requires that agencies “to the maximum extent
possible, undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to such
landmark.”
Section 106 consultation and considerations and NEPA analysis were coordinated to prevent a
duplication of efforts and ensure that all relevant information was shared and available to support the
development of disposition alternatives, as well as to support an informed decision on the Proposed
Action. More information about the Section 106 consultation process can be found in Section 1.5.

U.S. Army in Alaska – History and Mission

The Army has had a presence in Alaska since 1867, when the territory was transferred from Russia to the
United States. Initially, Soldiers were charged with maintaining law and order in the new territory and

A historic district is a geographically definable area that possesses a significant concentration of elements (contributing
resources) that are united by past events, by plan, or by physical development. A contributing resource can be a building, site,
structure, or object that adds to the historical or traditional cultural associations, historic architectural qualities, or
archaeological values for which a historic district or historic property is significant (NPS, 1998).

helped build new forts at Wrangell and St. Paul Canal and on Kodiak Island and the Kenai Peninsula
(Army, 2012a). Through the late 1800s to the turn of the century, the Signal Corps operated weather
stations, and a number of officers led small geographic explorations into various parts of Alaska as
mapmaking and road and bridge building expanded the frontier (Army, 2012a). The Army in Alaska saw a
decline in activity from 1908 to 1938, followed by a surge in activity during World War II. Beginning in
1938, military construction accelerated in advance of World War II. The Army built Ladd Field, near
Fairbanks, in 1940 as a cold weather test station, and Fort Richardson, near Anchorage, in 1940/1941
(Army, 2012a). During World War II, Alaska played a critical role in the North Pacific Theater. Ladd
Field was the aircraft transfer point in the Lend-Lease Operations 6 between the United States and the
Soviet Union. Following World War II, many small Army installations throughout the state closed, and the
emphasis of the remaining installations turned to training (Army, 2012a).
Today, the Army in Alaska is protecting America’s interests in the Pacific Region and providing forces
to overseas contingency operations. Headquartered at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER), U.S.
Army Alaska (USARAK) has units at two installations (Fort Wainwright and JBER) collectively
covering 1.65 million acres with nearly 12,000 Soldiers and 2,500 civilian employees. Its mission is to
deploy combat-ready forces to support joint military operations worldwide and serve as the Joint Forces
Land Component Command to support Joint Task Force Alaska (Army, 2012a). Forces currently
stationed at Fort Wainwright are the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team and the 16th Combat Aviation
Brigade (Army, 2012a).

1.1.2

History of Ladd Field and Hangars 2 and 3

The installation, known today as Fort Wainwright, entered the world stage during the 1940s because of
a unique episode in American military history brought about by weather, geography, and international
politics. In 1939, in anticipation of an impending war on the European front, construction began on a
small, cold weather test station designated as Ladd Field, the first Army airfield in Alaska. Even before
the construction of facilities was complete, the Cold Weather Test Detachment was immediately
stationed at Ladd Field with the primary mission to ensure that all military aircraft could function and
be maintained in extreme arctic and sub-arctic conditions.

6

Under Public Law 77-11, the U.S. government assisted Allied forces during the war by providing Lend-Lease deliveries of
aircraft and war materiel. From 1942–1945, the U.S. government supplied the Soviet Union with more than 7,900 U.S.-built
aircraft over the Alaska-Siberia route. Pilots from the Air Transport Command flew aircraft from Great Falls, Montana,
through Canada and Alaska until they reached Ladd Field. At Ladd Field (the official transfer point), Soviet pilots took over
the ferrying operation, flying the aircraft to Nome, then across Siberia, and on to the European war front.

While cold weather testing remained an important element of Ladd Field during World War II, the
airfield became a critical component to an act of U.S. diplomacy with the Soviet Union, in part, because
of its location and its cold weather testing activities. Under the authority of the Lend-Lease Bill, which
the U.S. Congress passed on March 11, 1941, the United States and Soviet Union agreed that Ladd
Field would be the transfer point for thousands of warplanes provided to the Russians to assist in the
fight against Germany. Alaska’s position on the world map made it ideal as a transfer point. A route
was established to ferry planes to Ladd Field. There, the United States transferred the planes to Russian
ownership, and Russian Soldiers then flew the planes across Alaska into Siberia and delivered them to
the front lines of World War II. Ladd Field’s geography also made it a perfect location for aircraft
repair and a supply depot.
With the demands of wartime, Ladd Field was quickly transformed from a small, carefully planned
permanent garrison into a major military installation that was home to thousands of troops. Originally,
Ladd Field was planned as a permanent garrison and the buildings were laid out in a horseshoe pattern
on the north side of the main runway with the massive Hangar 1 dominating the scene next to the
airfield. Along the horseshoe, there were quarters for enlisted men and officers, a hospital, theater,
power plant, and the commander’s house (Figure 1-1). The design and construction of this portion of
the field occurred before the demands of the war created an emergency situation in which appearances
were expendable, and utility and speed of construction were critical. During this period of utility and
rapid expansion, the airfield grew with more than 700 buildings constructed to accommodate the
addition of 4,500 troops needed to support aircraft repair, supply depot activities, and Lend-Lease
Operations. Hangars 2 and 3 were two of these wartime facilities built solely to support the war effort.
During World War II, Hangars 2 and 3 were used as aircraft maintenance hangars. In addition, Hangar
2 was used as a parachute and cold weather testing sewing shop, and Hangar 3 served as a passenger
terminal.
Located on the southwest corner of Ladd Field, Hangars 2 and 3 are twin Birchwood hangars, named
after the first hangar of this type constructed at Birchwood Airfield near Anchorage, Alaska. The
hangars feature structural systems that are constructed completely of wood. Birchwood hangars were
built at a number of installations throughout Alaska, including Eareckson Air Station on Shemya Island
and at Galena Airfield, but few survive today. The structural design allowed for their closed bowstring
wood trusses and barrel vault-shaped roofs to provide a clear span across the full open bay of both
hangars (Figures 1-2 and 1-3). The north and south elevations of each hangar bay are flanked by twostory, shed-roofed housing offices and classroom spaces.

In 1947, Ladd Field was transferred to the 11th Air Force, and renamed Ladd Air Force Base. During
the Cold War, Ladd AFB served as the Alaska Air Command headquarters for all of the territory north
of the Alaska Range. During the Korean War, the U.S. Department of the Air Force (Air Force)
constructed additional facilities at Ladd AFB and also stationed fighter-intercept squadrons there, some
of which were housed in Hangars 2 and 3. In 1960, the Air Force suspended flying operations at the
installation, and in January 1961, the Air Force transferred Ladd AFB back to the Army and it was
renamed Fort Wainwright.
Constructed between 1943 and 1944, Hangars 2 and 3 were part of the World War II expansion of Ladd
Field, and they remained in continuous use as aircraft hangars for almost 70 years, until spring 2011.
The hangars initially served as repair and maintenance facilities for fixed-wing aircraft and in recent
years provided the same function for helicopters. Because of issues concerning the structural integrity
of the hangars, the USAG FWA Directorate of Public Works structural engineers found Hangars 2 and
3 to be unsafe for occupancy and officially condemned the buildings in March and April 2011,
respectively (Webb, 2011a,b). They are currently unoccupied.
In 1985, the National Park Service (NPS) designated Fort Wainwright’s Ladd Field as a NHL (Figure
1-4) for the role it played in supporting the Army’s Cold Weather Test Detachment and as the transfer

point for the Alaska-Siberia route of the Lend-Lease Operations during World War II. The NHL is
bound on the east and west by the Chena River and on the north and south by roads established during
World War II. Currently, the NHL encompasses 20 resources. The majority of the contributing
resources are located in the North Post area, including Hangar 1 (Building 1557) where physical
transfer of planes occurred. The south edge of the NHL contains World War II hangars and noncontributing service buildings. Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL,
making the hangars nationally significant. In addition, the hangars are contributing resources to the
Cold War Historic District at Fort Wainwright, which was identified in 2010 for its association with the
strategic air reconnaissance, air defense, and Arctic research missions of the Cold War. The Cold War
Historic District boundaries largely encompass the same area as the NHL.

1.1.3

Hangars 2 and 3 Background – Maintenance Context

The military built Hangars 2 and 3 between 1943 and 1944 as semi-permanent structures. The military
employed two general types of construction during the war effort: temporary and permanent. These
general types of World War II construction may be further subdivided into four categories:
(1) permanent; (2) semi-permanent; (3) temporary; and (4) theater-of-operations. Permanent
construction was intended for use after the war; it typically was built of masonry (brick, tile, or
concrete) and metal frame. Semi-permanent construction typically consisted of cinderblock
construction, wooden-frame construction clad with synthetic siding, or a mixture of wooden frame and
masonry. Semi-permanent construction often resulted from ad hoc compromises between the desire for
permanent construction and shortages of time and material (Goodwin and Associates, Inc., 1997).
In 1977, when the hangars were 35 years old, a Building Information Schedule 7 for Fort Wainwright,
Alaska, indicated that each hangar would reach the end of its functional lifespan in 1983 and
recommended they both be replaced at that time (Dickinson-Oswald-Walch-Lee Engineers/Maynard
NBBJ Alaska Architects and Planners, 1977). Nevertheless, in 1983, the Army did not replace the
hangars, and they continued to be used without a long-term plan or funding to perform a large-scale
rehabilitation of the structures. Funding was focused on mission-essential programs and needs of the
installation with maintenance and repair of Hangars 2 and 3 occurring as necessary.

7

The Army used the information compiled in a Building Information Schedule to evaluate building conditions and uses. The
completed form contains information for each numbered building. This information includes available utilities, number of
stories, square footage, type (permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary), year built, materials, uses (original, current, and
recommended), and estimated life. Reduced site plans and mimeographed and annotated building lists that duplicate or
supplement the standard form information are also included (U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 2012).

Chapter 1.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Over the past 70 years, the structural integrity of the wooden trusses has deteriorated with age and
exposure to the harsh Alaskan environmental conditions, and they currently meet nine of the top eleven
reasons why bowstring wooden trusses fail (Provenghi, 2009; Webb, 2011b). Structural assessments of
the hangars indicate that most wooden framing members display weaknesses resulting from cracking
and splitting (Figures 1-5 through 1-8). As a result, the hangars’ ceiling trusses cannot support
helicopter maintenance equipment, and their infrastructure no longer meets the standards of a functional
work space. According to Army Real Property regulations (Department of the Army Pamphlet 415-28
[Army, 2006a]), a building that provides consolidated multipurpose space for the maintenance, repair,
and major overhaul of military aircraft and includes maintenance bays, tech supply, production control,
and quality control areas directly related to the maintenance and supervision of aircraft, component and
assembly rebuilding, and quality control of aviation maintenance, is considered a facility that can
provide a functional work space for organizational, installation, or depot-level aviation maintenance.
Because of the hangars’ lack of structural integrity, to include weakened trusses and the inability of the
roofs to meet current building codes for snow load, the Army condemned both hangars in March and
April of 2011 and subsequently recorded them as “non-functional” in Fort Wainwright’s real property
records in May of 2011. The Army changed the operational status of the hangars from “functional” to
“non-functional” after considering the Directorate of Public Works structural engineering reports and
the facility category code definitions.

While no large-scale rehabilitation of the structures has taken place, maintenance and repair projects
have occurred as needed including, but not limited to, upgrades to the hangar doors (1960, 1962, and
1979), repairs to roof trusses (1973 and 1984), roof repairs (1950, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1991, and 1996),
exterior frame wall repairs (1974), and installation of new fire protection (1978 and 1986) and heating
systems (1971 and 1983, 1993). Major alterations to the buildings have resulted in the replacement of
the original hangar doors (1989), windows (1971 and 2001), siding (1974), and roofing materials (1970
and 1986). With no previous funding to perform a large-scale rehabilitation, the hangars now exhibit
serious structural, electrical, and safety deficiencies. Additionally, during many of the interior door and
window alterations and additions, load bearing structural members were severed to accommodate these
changes, further compromising the structural integrity of the structures.
In 2009, the Army continued its transformation in Alaska by expanding USARAK’s aviation assets and
capabilities at Fort Wainwright to support both integrated training for existing USARAK forces and to
enhance the Army’s capability to support military operations around the world. To support the 2009
transformation, the Army is currently building three new modern hangars at Fort Wainwright to provide
consolidated indoor storage, as well as space for the maintenance and repair/reconditioning of
helicopter engines, airframes, and electronic and optical systems, facility maintenance functions that
could not be met by Hangars 2 and 3 (CH2M HILL, Inc., 2009). Hangars 2 and 3 were to be used to
support aviation operations until the Army constructed its new helicopter hangars, which are expected
to be fully operational in 2014. However, on February 17, 2011, an electrical fire in Hangar 2 severely
damaged the west end of the hangar roof decking and the roof trusses (Figures 1-9 through 1-11),

Chapter 1.0

1-11

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
prompting the USAG FWA Directorate of Public Works structural engineers to conduct investigations
that indicated that Hangar 2 lacked structural integrity. In March 2011, these Army engineers found
Hangar 2 to be unsafe for occupancy (Webb, 2011a). Army engineers also performed a structural
assessment of Hangar 3 and found the same structural deficiencies, resulting in Hangar 3 being declared
unsafe for occupancy in April 2011 (Webb, 2011b). As a result, helicopter maintenance activities
performed in Hangars 2 and 3 were immediately relocated to other facilities along the airfield.
Currently, Hangars 2 and 3 are unoccupied and lack the structural integrity needed to house any
military functions (see Section 1.1.2 for additional information).

Purpose and Need for Action

The purpose of the Proposed Action is to determine a disposition for Hangars 2 and 3 that will resolve
safety and fiscal concerns and land use issues and comply with statutory requirements. As noted in
Section 1.1, disposition is needed because the hangars no longer meet the functional requirements of
maintenance facilities for the modern Army aircraft fleet, currently serve no active function, and are a
safety hazard due to their compromised structural integrity. Additionally, the hangars continue to be
heated in the winter months to help prevent snow buildup on the roofs which, if left to accumulate,
could collapse the structures. Maintaining the minimum heating (to avoid roof collapse and frozen
pipes), electrical (to maintain indoor and outdoor lighting, fire suppression systems, pump mechanisms
and equipment failure notifications), and water (to ensure fire suppression) requirements creates annual
utility costs for these unoccupied facilities of approximately $350,000 per hangar (see additional
information in Section 2.4.1). Contributing to these high utility costs is the fact that these hangars were
not originally constructed with energy efficiency as a primary goal, and these high utility costs divert
operation and maintenance funds that could be used for other priority projects on Fort Wainwright.
A decision on the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 would:
•

Eliminate fire and safety issues associated with Hangars 2 and 3

•

Eliminate non-mission essential funding expenditures

Chapter 1.0

1-13

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
•

Make available the valuable airfield space the hangars occupy to support the military mission
because the hangars no longer meet the functional requirements of maintenance facilities for
modern aircraft and are unable to support the aviation mission

•

Meet the special requirements for NHLs under Section 110 of the NHPA and its implementing
regulations (to the maximum extent possible, undertake such necessary planning and actions
that minimize harm to NHLs)

•

Avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate any adverse effects on historic resources through
Section 106 consultation

1.3

Scope of Environmental Analysis

This Draft EIS identifies, documents, and evaluates the potential impacts of demolishing Hangars 2 and
3 including direct, indirect, long-term, and short-term impacts; any irreversible or irretrievable
commitments of resources; cumulative impacts; and practical mitigation measures for reducing
environmental impacts associated with the Proposed Action on the environmental, cultural, and
socioeconomic resources of Fort Wainwright. This Draft EIS focuses on the resources, ecosystems, and
human communities of concern that the Proposed Action could affect. The scope of this Draft EIS was
determined through a combination of internal Army planning, as well as public and agency input and
concerns expressed during the scoping period (for public and agency concerns taken into consideration
see Section 1.6, Public Involvement). The Army has determined that the actions associated with
demolishing the hangars have the potential to result in adverse impacts to air quality, cultural resources,
hazardous materials/hazardous waste, human health and safety, socioeconomics, sustainability, 8 and
transportation; therefore, these resource areas are analyzed in detail in this Draft EIS. Chapter 3.0,
Section 3.1.2, Presentation of Resource Areas, further identifies these resource areas and the resource
areas that were considered but not carried forward for detailed analysis because of their low potential to
be affected.
The geographic scope of this Draft EIS includes the area potentially influenced by the Proposed Action.
The main study area includes Hangars 2 and 3 and the area immediately surrounding them; however,
for some resource areas, the area potentially influenced by the Proposed Action extends beyond the
immediate vicinity. For example, air quality impacts have a regional influence, while impacts to

8
For the purposes of the Army and Fort Wainwright, sustainability is centered on meeting current and future mission
requirements worldwide, while safeguarding human health and improving the quality of life and enhancing the natural
environment (Army, 2004).

1-14

Chapter 1.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
cultural resources include the Ladd Field NHL of which the hangars are contributing resources (Figure
1-4). For cultural resources, the USAG FWA has considered the cumulative effect of the Proposed
Action on cultural resources on the larger collection of World War II-related historic properties in
Alaska. The geographic scope or region of influence for each resource area is identified in Chapter 3.0
within the discussion for each resource area.

1.4

Decision to be Made

This Draft EIS provides public officials, citizens, and Army decision makers with the information
necessary to evaluate the environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic impacts associated with the
proposed alternatives. The Draft EIS will help the USAG FWA Garrison Commander, the Army’s
decision maker, make a decision that is based on an understanding of environmental consequences and
take action to protect, restore, and enhance the environment. It also provides a record of public, tribal,
and agency input received on the Proposed Action, the environmental analysis presented in the Draft
EIS, and how the Army considered that input during this process.
The decision to be made is whether or not to demolish Hangars 2 and 3. The final decision and rationale
for selection will be presented in a Record of Decision (ROD). Through the NEPA process, alternatives
for implementing the Proposed Action are developed and analyzed to provide decision makers with
options as well as an understanding of how the Proposed Action may affect various resources.
Alternatives considered must be reasonable and meet the purpose of and need for the Proposed Action.
The selected alternative will take into account technical, economic, and political feasibility;
environmental and social issues; and the ability to meet USAG FWA and USARAK mission objectives.
This analysis will include a discussion of avoiding and minimizing environmental harm from the
alternative selected. The USAG FWA Garrison Commander will decide which alternative to
implement. Concurrence from the Regional Director, Installation Management Command Pacific, also
will be obtained on the selected alternative.
The following reasonable alternatives, which will be presented to the USAG FWA Garrison
Commander for evaluation, are described in detail in Chapter 2.0, Description of the Proposed Action
and Alternatives:
•

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

•

Alternative 2: No Action (retention of the status quo, which is to continue to maintain Hangars
2 and 3 in their unoccupied state and perform minimal maintenance activities)

National Historic Preservation Act Consultation

Section 106 of the NHPA requires that federal agencies take into account any effect or potential effect
of their undertakings 9 on historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (National Register). 10
As subsequent sections of this document illustrate, the USAG FWA has exhibited a higher standard of
planning and consideration regarding this proposed undertaking associated with Hangars 2 and 3 and
the Ladd Field NHL, thus meeting the Section 110 responsibilities regarding NHLs. Most recently, the
USAG FWA conducted multiple studies of the hangars and, more notably, analyzed the potential
impacts to historic resources through the NEPA EIS process, ensuring that the Army is taking the
requisite “hard look” at the consequences of its Proposed Action. The information developed and
obtained through both the Section 106 and NEPA process will allow the Army to plan and make an
informed decision on the disposition of the hangars. Over the last 11 years, the USAG FWA contracted
three separate studies to ascertain in detail the structural needs and the costs to rehabilitate Hangars 2
and 3 (see Section 2.3.3.2). In addition, the Army developed a detailed rehabilitation cost estimate to
support reuse of the facility (see Section 2.3.1). The Army conducted three studies and developed a
specific cost estimate to illustrate its intent to plan thoughtfully for minimal harm to the Ladd Field
NHL. These studies and cost estimates then informed the development of alternatives for the EIS,
which ultimately informs the final decision to be made.
Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing structures to the Ladd Field NHL, as well as the Cold War Historic
District at Fort Wainwright, which was determined to be eligible for the National Register in 2010.
Because the Proposed Action is considered an undertaking, the Army must comply with Section 106 of
the NHPA. In addition to the NEPA process, the Army also is concurrently engaging in the Section 106
consultation process. The USAG FWA has determined that both the Proposed Action and the No
Action Alternative would adversely affect the hangars, and in so doing, both the Ladd Field NHL and
the Cold War Historic District as a whole. As a result, the Army is pursuing a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) pursuant to 36 CFR §800.6(2)(c) to mitigate any adverse effect.

9
The 1992 amendments to NHPA specifically defined the term undertaking as “a project, activity, or program funded in whole
or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency, including A) those carried out by or on behalf of the
agency; B) those carried out with Federal financial assistance; C) those requiring a Federal permit, license, or approval; and D)
those subject to State or local regulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency” (16 U.S.C.
§470w(7)).
10

The National Register, established under the NHPA of 1966, is an official list of significant state, local, and national historic
properties.

Chapter 1.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
While actions that the Army conducts in compliance with NEPA and Section 106 are separate, the
individual outcomes of these processes directly impact and inform one another. Through the NEPA
process, alternatives for the Proposed Action are developed and analyzed for potential impacts to
resource areas, including cultural resources. In the Section 106 process, the Army presents the
alternatives, along with the potential impacts to historic resources, to the consulting parties. 11 The
Army, in coordination with the consulting parties, then develops and sets forth in the MOA ways to
avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate the potential adverse effects of the Proposed Action on cultural
resources. Within the MOA, stipulations are developed for each alternative being considered. These
stipulations are then incorporated into the EIS as measures under each alternative for mitigating adverse
effects. They are included in the analysis and presented to the decision maker. The MOA for this
Proposed Action is included as an appendix (Appendix A). The mitigation measures identified in the
MOA will be incorporated into the ROD, helping to inform the USAG FWA Garrison Commander
when selecting an alternative to implement. Once a final decision is made on which alternative to
implement, the Army will implement its decision in accordance with the stipulations set forth in the
MOA.
As part of the Section 106 consultation process and in accordance with 36 CFR §800.3, the USAG
FWA notified the Alaska State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) of the undertaking affecting
Hangars 2 and 3 in October 2011. In November 2011, the USAG FWA invited nine groups to
participate in the Section 106 process as consulting parties. Those invited were the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP), the Alaska SHPO, the NPS, Tanana Yukon Historical Society (TYHS),
Bureau of Land Management, Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB) Historic Preservation
Commission, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum, and the
Alaska Association for Historic Preservation. The Alaska SHPO, the NPS, and the ACHP responded,
agreeing to participate as consulting parties. The USAG FWA also received notice from the National
Trust for Historic Preservation acknowledging receipt of the invitation and saying it would follow up
with additional correspondence indicating whether or not it would participate as a consulting party;
however, no further correspondence was received. No other correspondences from other agencies have
been received to date. Although no written response was received from TYHS or the FNSB Historic
Preservation Commission, they actively participate as consulting parties regarding this undertaking.

11
Consulting parties are those that have consultative roles in the Section 106 process and include SHPO, Indian tribes,
representatives of local governments, individuals or organizations with a demonstrated interest in the undertaking, and
members of the public (see 36 CFR §800.2).

Chapter 1.0

1-17

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
The first Section 106 consultation meeting was held in December 2011 to inform participating agencies
of the project. The following six agencies attended the meeting: the Alaska SHPO, the NPS, the TYHS,
Bureau of Land Management, the FNSB Historic Preservation Commission, and the ACHP (via
teleconference). The USAG FWA subsequently met with the consulting parties six times in 2012 (April
24, May 21, June 12, July 2, October 26, and November 27) and twice in 2013 (January 22 and March
5) to discuss the potential adverse effects of the undertaking; ways to avoid, minimize, and mitigate the
potential adverse effects; and the development of the MOA for the project. Additional Section 106
consultation meetings will be held as necessary after the end of the public comment period for the Draft
EIS.
Information gathered during the Section 106 process regarding adverse effects of the alternatives and
ways to avoid, minimize, and mitigate these adverse effects was then incorporated into this Draft EIS.
For a discussion on the adverse effects and mitigation measures to minimize the adverse effects, see
Section 3.3.2.

1.6

Public Involvement

Public participation opportunities for this Draft EIS and decision making on the Proposed Action are
guided by 32 CFR §651.45. In general, an EIS process begins with the publication of a Notice of Intent
(NOI) to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register, after which the scoping process begins. Scoping is the
period when the public, agencies, organizations, and tribes identify important issues they believe the
Army needs to address in the EIS. A Draft EIS is then prepared and filed with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA), and the Army publishes a Notice of Availability (NOA) in the Federal
Register and in newspapers in communities that the Proposed Action could affect. A public comment
period lasting at least 45 days begins on the date the USEPA publishes its notice of receipt of the Draft
EIS in the Federal Register. During the comment period, but after at least 15 days following
publication of the NOA, a public meeting, or series of meetings, is held to provide the public,
organizations, agencies, and tribes an opportunity to present comments and issues of concern. (For this
Draft EIS, the comment period will be 45 days, and the public meeting will be conducted as an open
house.) A Final EIS is then prepared that addresses all comments received on the Draft EIS. The Final
EIS is filed with the USEPA and made available to the public by publishing a NOA in the Federal
Register and local newspapers. A final decision on the Proposed Action, which is documented in a
ROD, may be made 30 days following the Final EIS NOA publication. The ROD is a public document
that states the decision, the alternatives, and factors considered, as well as any mitigation measures that
will be adopted. A NOA for the ROD is published in the Federal Register and in local newspapers.

Throughout this process, the public may obtain information on the status and progress of the Proposed
Action and the EIS through the USAG FWA NEPA website at:
www.wainwright.army.mil/env/NEPA/Current.html.

1.6.1

Notice of Intent

The Army published a NOI to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register on November 16, 2011 (76
Federal Register 70978) (see Appendix B). Publication of the NOI began a 63-day scoping period from
November 16, 2011, to January 17, 2012. The Army also published an Open House Public Meeting
notice in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner on November 11 and 16, 2011, and on December 4, 7, 11,
and 14, 2011. The notice indicated the Army’s intent to prepare an EIS, conduct Section 106
consultation, and hold a public scoping meeting. The Army used the scoping period to determine the
resource areas to be addressed in the EIS and to identify significant issues related to the Proposed
Action.

1.6.2

Public Scoping

As part of the scoping process, the USAG FWA held a public scoping meeting on December 14, 2011.
The scoping meeting was held at the Noel Wien Public Library in Fairbanks, Alaska, and 19 people
attended. A court reporter was available to record public comments; however, no comments were given.
Written comments received during the comment period included the following potential alternatives:
donating the hangars to the Tanana Valley State Fair Association, converting one or both hangars into a
roller derby rink for use by the local roller derby leagues, and moving both hangars to alternate
locations in Fairbanks so that they could be used by the community as a museum or to support other
activities. These alternatives were considered and are addressed in Chapter 2.0. Another comment
indicated that alternatives for the Proposed Action need to take into account the military mission of Fort
Wainwright. As described in Chapter 2.0, as part of the screening criteria for alternatives, the mission
of Fort Wainwright is taken into consideration in determining which alternatives to carry forward for
analysis. All of the public scoping comments are provided in Appendix C.

1.6.3

Cooperating Agencies

NEPA mandates that federal agencies responsible for preparing NEPA analyses and documentation
must do so “in cooperation with state and local governments and other concerned public and private
organizations” and other agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise (42 U.S.C. §§ 4331[a]
and 4332[c]). The CEQ regulations addressing cooperating agencies status (40 CFR §1501.6 and

Chapter 1.0

1-19

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
§1508.5) allow federal agencies (as lead agencies) to invite tribal, state, and local governments, as well
as other federal agencies, to serve as cooperating agencies in the preparation of an EIS.
Because the Army’s Proposed Action would involve potential adverse impacts to the Ladd Field NHL,
in October 2011, the USAG FWA invited the NPS, the ACHP, and the Alaska SHPO to become
cooperating agencies for this EIS. Both the NPS and the ACHP declined the invitation, and no response
was received from the Alaska SHPO (see Appendix D); however, all three agencies will continue to
participate in the NEPA process and are consulting parties in the NHPA Section 106 process (see
Section 1.5).

1.6.4

Interagency Coordination

Throughout the development of this Draft EIS, the Army coordinated with various federal, state, and
local agencies about its proposal for the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3. Involvement activities included
scoping and distribution and review of the document. The USAG FWA sent scoping invitation letters to
the following agency and organization representatives (see Appendix D for all agency correspondence
letters):

At the initiation of the EIS process, the Army held an agency scoping meeting on December 15, 2011,
to inform agencies of the Proposed Action and to solicit input on the potential alternatives and areas of
concern. Agency representatives provided a number of comments that helped the Army focus the EIS
analysis on the environmental issues of importance. The major theme of the comments concerned the
hangars’ historical significance and context, the desire to preserve that significance, and accessibility to
the public for appreciation (see Appendix D). Additional comments included concerns about hazardous
materials and air quality impacts. The historical significance and context of the hangars is addressed in
Section 3.3, Cultural Resources, and is an important factor in the Section 106 process and the
development of the MOA with the Section 106 consulting parties. Issues regarding air quality and
hazardous materials are addressed in Section 3.2, Air Quality, and Section 3.4, Hazardous
Materials/Hazardous Waste, respectively.
In support of the release and public review of this Draft EIS, the Army sent letters to interested agency
representatives, as indicated in Chapter 5.0, announcing the release of this Draft EIS and inviting
review. An agency meeting will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, to review the Army’s Proposed Action

Government-to-Government Consultation

The USAG FWA consulted with Alaska Native tribes in accordance with the requirements of
Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 4710.02, DoD Interactions with Federally-recognized Tribes
(DoD, 2006); Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments;
the DoD American Indian and Alaska Native Policy (DoD, 1998) and Alaska Implementation Guidance
(DoD, 2001); and the Department of the Army American Indian and Alaska Native Policy (Army,
2012b). Six federally recognized tribes were sent letters notifying them of the Army’s intent to prepare
an EIS and informing them about the public scoping meeting times and locations (see Appendix D).
The tribes were offered the opportunity to enter into government-to-government consultation and to
become consulting parties to the NHPA Section 106 process. The letters were followed up with emails,
telephone calls, and faxes, respective of the tribes’ wishes for mode of communication. The Army
received responses from four tribes (Village of Dot Lake, Healy Lake Village, Native Village of
Tanacross, and Native Village of Tetlin), indicating they would not require consultation. The remaining
two tribes (Nenana Native Association and Northway Village) did not provide formal responses. The
Army followed up with these two tribes via email and telephone calls to discuss the undertaking, and it

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION AND
ALTERNATIVES

Introduction

This chapter explores and evaluates all possible alternatives developed in accordance with the purpose
and need for the Proposed Action described in Section 1.2, and the objectives described below in
Section 2.3. The purpose and need sets forth a rational context in which to analyze the viability of
potential alternatives. The United States (U.S.) Department of the Army (Army) considered a wide
range of potential alternatives, eventually narrowing the list to those considered reasonable and legally
viable for the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 on Fort Wainwright. This chapter presents the screening
process used to eliminate several non-viable alternatives from detailed consideration and to identify
action alternative(s) carried forward for full analysis in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
and Section 106 process. For alternatives eliminated from detailed study, the analysis used to eliminate
them is presented.
One reasonable action alternative was identified through the screening process: demolition of Hangars 2
and 3. This Draft EIS also carries forward the alternative of no action, also known as maintaining the
status quo. The Army’s preferred alternative is identified in Section 2.5.

2.2

Proposed Action

The Proposed Action is to determine and implement a disposition for Hangars 2 and 3 and supporting
infrastructure 12 located at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.

2.3

Screening Criteria, Viability Analysis and Comparison of Potential
Alternatives

The U.S. Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) developed a screening process to
evaluate reasonable alternatives and determine their ability to satisfy the purpose and need of the
Proposed Action. The following sections discuss the screening criteria and viability analysis used to
arrive at a full range of reasonable alternatives to fulfill the purpose and need. The screening criteria

12

The supporting infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, concrete foundations, the small, empty, flammable liquids
storage facility located between Hangars 2 and 3, paved parking areas, utilities (i.e., service utilidors, manholes, vents, utility
poles, head bolt heaters, electrical power lines, and communications), and the security fence line.

Chapter 2.0

2-1

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
and viability analysis for the alternatives are based on the following objectives of the purpose and need
to determine the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3:
•

Resolve life, health and safety concerns

•

Address fiscal concerns

•

Consider land use requirements

•

Ensure statutory compliance

The No Action Alternative was not included in the viability analysis because it is an alternative that
must be considered in accordance with Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 Code
of Federal Regulations [CFR] §1502.14) and carried through for full analysis in the Draft EIS.

2.3.1

Screening Criteria

The following screening criteria are based upon the objectives outlined above and the purpose and need
discussed in Section 1.2.
•

Screening Criterion 1: The action must directly address the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3.

•

Screening Criterion 2: The action must be compatible with the current and future military
mission at Fort Wainwright , including:
-

The USAG FWA’s mission for airfield and support facilities that considers acceptable land
use designations, anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures, availability of airfield
buildable space, effective use of maintenance funds, and energy conservation and
sustainability.

-

The U.S. Army Alaska (USARAK) mission that supports rapid deployment needs, training
requirements, and the ability to accommodate future mission changes.

•

Screening Criterion 3: The action must not be prohibitively expensive. This means a viable
disposition option is one where the amount of money required to implement it would be
supported by the Army’s funding decision process or non-federal sources. The general
guidance for rehabilitation costs is based on the Reuse Study of Hangars 2 and 3 Fort
Wainwright, Alaska (Design Alaska and JCA, 2012), as well as estimates resulting from a 2012
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Alaska District Planning Charrette and Form DD1391

development 13 evaluating the stationing requirements to support unmanned aircraft systems
(UASs) in Alaska. The necessary facility upgrades are those that are described in the 2008
Condition Assessment and Rehabilitation Plans, Hangars 2 and 3, Ladd Field National
Historic Landmark, Fort Wainwright, Alaska (The Louis Berger Group [LBG], 2008) and
summarized in Section 2.3.3.2 under the subheading Discussion of Screening Criterion 3. The
general guidance for demolition costs is based on cost estimates resulting from the development
of Form DD1391 for the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3.
•

Screening Criterion 4: The action must have a reasonably foreseeable funding source, or a
mechanism for obtaining applicable and timely funding, to pay for life, health, and safety
upgrades or demolition actions.

2.3.2

Potential Action Alternatives Considered

The following potential alternatives were examined in the viability analysis:
1. Demolition of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both and conversion of the demolition footprint
along the airfield to concrete apron
2. Rehabilitation of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both to support the following uses:
a. UAS maintenance hangar
b. Aviation combined arms tactical trainer (AVCATT) simulator training
c. Fixed simulator training
d. Physical fitness center/gymnasium
e. Arctic readiness center/fieldhouse
f.

General purpose warm storage

2.3.3.1

Demolition of Either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or Both

Under this alternative, demolition of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both would occur and the
remaining footprint of the building would be converted to concrete apron space. Two scenarios of this
option are discussed below.

Demolition of One Hangar and Retention of the Other
The USAG FWA considered demolishing one hangar and retaining the remaining hangar. The
remaining hangar would continue to be minimally maintained as described under the No Action
Alternative (see Section 2.4.2).

Discussion of Screening Criterion 1 (Hangar Disposition)
The option of demolishing one hangar and retaining the other does not meet the first screening criterion
because it only directly addresses the disposition of one of the buildings. Maintaining the status quo for
the remaining hangar avoids identifying a disposition for that hangar. The hangar would continue to
serve no active military function, would continue to remain vacant, and would still be considered unsafe
for occupancy. Currently, no rehabilitation efforts are planned for the remaining hangar, and its
structural integrity would continue to deteriorate, eventually resulting in the building’s structural
failure.
Overall, the option of demolishing one hangar and allowing the other hangar to remain does not meet
the purpose and need defined in Chapter 1.0.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 2 (Mission Compatibility)
Allowing one hangar to remain vacant would not be compatible with the current or future military
mission at Fort Wainwright because it would occupy valuable real property space on the active airfield
without serving an active function.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 (Cost)
The cost associated with demolition of one hangar is approximately $3 million. This amount is not
considered prohibitively expensive because it is currently eligible for Army funding; however,
continued minimal maintenance of a vacant hangar will require that the USAG FWA spend
approximately $350,000 per hangar each year to achieve minimum heating, electrical, and water
requirements necessary to prevent building collapse and ensure adequate response in case of an
emergency. Evaluated within the context of funding for base operations, the USAG FWA considers
spending approximately $350,000 per hangar annually on a facility that has no current or future use to

2-6

Chapter 2.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
be prohibitively expensive. In addition, the cost for demolition is reasonable when compared to new
construction or rehabilitation costs.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 4 (Funding Source)
Military construction (MILCON) funding to support demolition in accordance with Army Regulation
(AR) 420-1 is included in the Fiscal Year Defense Program 2013–2019, allowing for timely access (by
fiscal year [FY] 14) to an applicable funding mechanism to support this action.

Conclusion
In summary, demolishing one hangar and retaining the other does not directly address the disposition of
Hangars 2 and 3. It would not support the current and future military mission of Fort Wainwright.
Demolition has a reasonable cost figure associated with it, when compared to new construction or
rehabilitation costs, and is eligible for funding under the MILCON program in FY 14; however, the
Army funding approval entities cannot support annual maintenance costs of approximately $350,000
per hangar to ensure the structural stability of a building that no longer has an identified use and is
condemned. Therefore, this option is not carried forward in this Draft EIS as a reasonable action
alternative.

Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3
Under this alternative, the USAG FWA would demolish both hangars and their supporting
infrastructure.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 1 (Hangar Disposition)
Demolishing both hangars meets the first screening criterion because it directly addresses the
disposition of both hangars.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 2 (Mission Compatibility)
By creating concrete apron space, both the USAG FWA and USARAK missions are met because the
area’s conversion to concrete is compatible with existing airfield land use designations and supports
existing and future military training needs.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 (Cost)
The cost associated with demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 is approximately $6.3 million (Army, 2012c).
This amount is not considered prohibitively expensive because it is currently considered eligible for
Army funding pending National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis. In addition, the cost for
demolition is reasonable when compared to new construction or rehabilitation costs.

Chapter 2.0

2-7

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Discussion of Screening Criterion 4 (Funding Source)
MILCON funding to support demolition in accordance with AR 420-1 has been identified in the Fiscal
Year Defense Program 2013–2019, allowing for timely access (by FY 14) to an applicable funding
mechanism to support this action.

Conclusion
In summary, demolition of the hangars directly addresses the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3, supports
the current and future military mission on Fort Wainwright, has a reasonable cost associated with it, and
is eligible for funding under the MILCON program in FY 14. This alternative is carried forward in this
Draft EIS as a reasonable action alternative. A more detailed description of this alternative is provided
in Section 2.4.1.

2.3.3.2

Rehabilitation of Either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or Both To Support Identified
Uses

Under this alternative, rehabilitation of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both to support a variety of
reuses would occur. The reuses identified during internal and external scoping or developed by the
Army as part of mitigation identified in the Programmatic Agreement Among the United States
Department of the Army, the Alaska State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation Regarding Aviation Stationing at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, are: 14

Chapter 2.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Discussion of Screening Criterion 1 (Hangar Disposition)
The option of rehabilitating either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both for reuse, regardless of reuse type,
meets the first screening criterion because it directly addresses the disposition of the buildings.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 2 (Mission Compatibility)
The reuse options of the UAS maintenance hangar, the simulator training facility, and warm storage are
compatible with the second screening criteria for their potential to meet current and future military
missions at Fort Wainwright. While the physical fitness and arctic readiness centers would be
compatible with the USARAK mission, these reuse options do not fully support USAG FWA’s mission.
These options are not an appropriate use of valuable real property space located on the airfield, and they
would ultimately be an ineffective use of facility planning and maintenance funding since they do not
have facility codes recognized as being compatible with active airfield uses within the Army’s Facility
Management Program. (Compatible facility codes are defined as those that support airfield utilization:
facilities and shops for maintenance and repair of rotary and fixed wing aircraft.) Compatibility with
existing airfield land use designations necessitates the reuse option to be one that does not create
unauthorized access to the active runway and surrounding area. The remaining reuse options of the
youth center, museum, and roller rink would likely result in a high volume of non-Army use that is not
authorized to occur on an active military airfield. These types of uses are not compatible with airfield
security requirements that prevent non-military entities from accessing the area. Furthermore, the youth
center, museum, and roller rink do not support the current USARAK mission of rapid deployment,
military training requirements, or assistance of future mission changes.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 (Cost)
Beginning in 2001, the USAG FWA contracted for several reports that produced reuse options and
rehabilitation cost estimates for Hangars 2 and 3 (ECI/Hyer, Inc., 2003; LBG, 2008; Design Alaska and
JCA, 2012). The reports, each conducted by third-party consultants, conclusively established that a
considerable amount of funding would be required to rehabilitate both hangars to meet basic life,
health, and safety building codes. In addition, in July 2012, a MILCON Charrette was held by the
USACE Alaska District to develop Form DD1391s and a cost estimate for a project that represented a
practical and mission essential reuse alternative for one of the hangars—rehabilitation to support
proposed UAS operations at Fort Wainwright. Table 2-2 summarizes the cost estimates associated with
rehabilitation of Hangars 2 and 3. Overall, the facilities have continued to deteriorate over time, thereby
raising the estimated costs of rehabilitation in addition to other factors as explained below.

Note:

USACE – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

2003 Condition Assessment/Economic Analysis
The first of the economic analysis reports was prepared in response to a Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA) that was signed by the Army in 2001 with the Alaska State Historic Preservation Office
(SHPO), the National Park Service (NPS), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and other
consulting parties regarding a series for proposed demolitions of historic properties on Fort Wainwright,
including Hangars 2 and 3. The MOA stipulated that a report, including an economic analysis, be
developed prior to the Army making a final decision on demolition of Hangars 2 and 3. The report titled
Condition Assessment/Economic Analysis of Fort Wainwright Hangars was completed by ECI/Hyer,
Inc. in 2003. This report identified a rehabilitation cost of $7.5 million per hangar. Soon after the
completion of ECI/Hyer, Inc. (2003), the Alaska SHPO terminated the MOA, stating termination was in
the best interest of all the consulting parties and would better preserve the landmark. This meant that
any future proposal for demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would require consultation with the Alaska
SHPO and other consulting parties, and would effectively start the Section 106 process over again.

2008 Condition Assessment and Rehabilitation Plans
In 2005, the Army began developing an EIS for the stationing of an Aviation Task Force at Fort
Wainwright. Originally, demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 was part of the undertaking, and Section 106
consultation on the demolition of the hangars was initiated. In support of this consultation, a second
report on the cost of rehabilitating the hangars was completed. The Condition Assessment and
Rehabilitation Plans, Hangars 2 and 3 (LBG, 2008) identified a rehabilitation cost of $22 million per
hangar. While the 2005 EIS NEPA process was still in its scoping period, demolition of Hangars 2 and

2-10

Chapter 2.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
3 was removed as part of both the Proposed Action and the Section 106 consultation. This occurred
because it was determined that Hangars 2 and 3 did not require demolition in order to support stationing
of the Aviation Task Force and construction of the unit’s required facilities.
LBG (2008) describes in full detail the basic rehabilitation needs for the hangars, as summarized in
Table 2-3. Because both hangars are contributing structures within the Ladd Field National Historic
Landmark (Ladd Field NHL), all proposed work would need to be respectful of the historic character of
the buildings, both in terms of the construction materials and finishes. Rehabilitating Hangars 2 and 3
would need to follow, as closely as possible, the guidelines in the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation. The various reuse studies incorporated these standards into their estimates, and
where possible, existing original and historic materials would be retained and preserved. Under all reuse
options, the Army would treat interior spaces with contemporary materials; repair structural problems;
rehabilitate the exterior envelope of the buildings; replace heating, water supply, and electrical systems
to meet contemporary requirements and codes; and complete additional work to ensure potential
continued use of these buildings.

2012 Reuse Study
In 2012, a study, Reuse Study of Hangars 2 and 3 Fort Wainwright, Alaska (Design Alaska and JCA,
2012) was conducted as mitigation for the stationing of the Aviation Task Force at Fort Wainwright. As
part of this Aviation Stationing project, the helicopter maintenance functions of Hangars 2 and 3 were
to be relocated to new facilities and, as a result, would leave the hangars without an assigned use or
function. The study’s purpose was to identify potential reuses for the hangars and to provide basic
rehabilitation cost estimates for each reuse. The reuse options identified (simulator training, physical
fitness center, and warm storage) were based on types of facilities that had real property deficits at Fort
Wainwright as documented in USAG FWA’s Real Property Master Plan, Installation Status Report, and
Real Property Planning and Analysis System (RPLANS). Potential reuse costs ranged from $32 million
to $38 million per hangar depending on reuse type. The USAG FWA began its development of
alternatives for the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 with the rehabilitation estimates provided in the 2012
Reuse Study.
Given the increasingly high cost associated with rehabilitation, as identified in the 2012 Reuse Study,
the USAG FWA attempted to identify cost saving measures by accepting the NPS’s suggestion to have
one of its subject matter experts survey the hangars to identify cost reduction solutions associated with
rehabilitating a historic structure (NPS, 2012b; Crosby, 2012). As a result of consultation with the NPS
and the Alaska SHPO, the USAG FWA was provided some flexibility in the application of the
Secretary of the Interior’s standards for proposed rehabilitation methods. The USAG FWA subject
matter experts reviewed the provided suggestions and determined that many were already calculated
into the 2012 Reuse Study costs; however, one suggestion—construction of an internal steel
superstructure—was unique. (The USACE Alaska District employed this same approach during the
UAS Planning Charrette, based on the NPS recommendation, as explained in the following paragraphs.)
Additionally, during the review, the 2012 Reuse Study was found to be missing the required USACE
Alaska District standard overhead or Design-Build contracting costs and did not address some critical
structural improvements. This additional information led to the determination that rehabilitation costs
were likely to be even higher than identified in the 2012 Reuse Study.

2012 USACE Alaska District Charrette
In July 2012, a MILCON Charrette was held by the USACE Alaska District to develop Form DD1391
construction project descriptions for a project that represented a practical and mission essential reuse
option for one of the hangars—rehabilitation to support UAS operations. The USACE Alaska District
planning process used the 2012 Reuse Study base rehabilitation costs (i.e., $38 million per hangar) and

Chapter 2.0

2-13

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
added $4 million in costs that were specific to the UAS reuse, as well as the following four additional
costs that had not yet been accounted for in the previous hangar studies:
•

$9.5 million in additional structural and foundational repairs

•

5 percent standard contingency fee

•

6.5 percent USACE Alaska District overhead

•

4 percent Design-Build cost

All of these costs escalated the total rehabilitation cost to support UAS operations to $60 million per
hangar.
Because of all of the unknown conditions associated with rehabilitating a 70-year-old, deteriorated
building, the same additional costs ($9.5 million in additional structural and foundational repairs, 5
percent standard contingency fee, 6.5 percent USACE overhead, and 4 percent Design-Build cost) can
be applied to the other reuse options, which results in a range of costs from $48 million to $55 million
per hangar (Table 2-4). At the same planning charrette, a separate Form DD1391 was developed for
construction of a new UAS maintenance hangar of comparable size at Fort Wainwright with identical
project specific reuse and overhead costs resulting in a final cost estimate of $38 million (Army,
2012e). To complete the comparison, the cost to construct a new warm storage facility at Fort
Wainwright would be approximately $36 million.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
During the development of the Form DD1391 for rehabilitation of one hangar, the Army determined
that Hangar 2 would be the preferable facility to reuse, despite the existing fire damage. Full-scale
rehabilitation of these facilities would address the structural deficiencies that both hangars are
experiencing, and because Hangars 2 and 3 are nearly identical, the cost to rehabilitate and maintain
would be similar. There would be no appreciable rehabilitation cost difference between Hangars 2 and 3
due to the 2011 fire damage because suppression activities prevented the fire from spreading through
the entire facility. The MILCON charrette conducted by the USACE Alaska District began with the
intention of evaluating Hangar 3 for rehabilitation into a UAS maintenance/storage hangar. As the
evaluation proceeded, it became apparent that Hangar 3 could not adequately meet the necessary
requirements for renovation into a UAS hangar primarily because of current plans to construct a new
hangar in proximity to the eastern side of Hangar 3, scheduled to begin in FY 13. Construction of this
new hangar would essentially cut off aircraft access to the airfield from the eastern bay door of Hangar
3. The western bay door of Hangar 3 could still provide access to the airfield; however, because of the
manner in which the UAS maintenance bays would be configured, the use of both the east and west
hangar doors is essential to meet mission requirements.
Hangar 2’s superior airfield access, along with its east and west hangar door capabilities, made this
hangar the better choice of the two, even with the fire damage. This is due in part to the lack of eastern
door access in Hangar 3, which would result in a hangar bay size that is smaller than the required square
footage and an inadequate layout for the unrestricted operation of the UAS. Because of the location
deficiencies of Hangar 3, Hangar 2 was considered as the preferable facility at Fort Wainwright that
could potentially meet the UAS mission requirements (Army, 2012f).
The cost of a particular Army construction project is an important factor in determining the justification
of the activity. The MILCON project review process, as conducted by the major Army commands,
Headquarters, USACE, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and ultimately Congress, considers
economics as key to obtaining MILCON funding. Due to funding fluctuations and mission
prioritizations, the Army often does not have adequate funding for replacement of aging facilities or
renovation of existing ones. Decision makers must be confident that the most economical and beneficial
alternatives to meet the Army needs are being considered. The Army’s ultimate goal is that tax dollars
are spent most economically and scarce resources are allocated efficiently (Army, 1992).
The USAG FWA must consider the wider context of the current fiscal reality within the military
budget. The Department of Defense (DoD) continues to institute its More Disciplined Use of Resources
campaign by developing strategies to realize savings. Current trends indicate that the military force

Chapter 2.0

2-15

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
structure is drawing down, resulting in a pause to the MILCON program at specific installations as the
effects of the military drawdown are determined. Most recently, the USAG FWA has experienced a
$320 million MILCON loss over the current 5-year program. Only one $10 million MILCON project
was awarded to the USAG FWA over this period. As a whole, the DoD can anticipate a $9.6 billion
reduction to the FY 13 MILCON program and a reduction of about $60 billion during the period of
FY 13 through FY 17. The Army, alone, has committed to saving approximately $21.7 billion between
FY 13 and FY 17. The MILCON program will see a reduction of approximately $8 billion during the
same period (DoD, 2012). These projections were made prior to the 2013 Sequestration, which will
cause an even larger impact on funding availability.
Based on the thorough and varied cost estimation efforts that the Army conducted to determine an
accurate rehabilitation cost for Hangars 2 and 3, as well as the current DoD More Disciplined Use of
Resources financing strategy, the USAG FWA determined that rehabilitation of either one or both of
Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 for any reuse option would not satisfy the third screening criteria. The amount of
money required to implement a reuse through facility rehabilitation would be prohibitively expensive
and would not be approved for funding. The USAG FWA considered the most recent local MILCON
funding loss of $320 million, as well as the cost range for rehabilitation—$48 million to $60 million—
and reasonably concluded that the cost associated with rehabilitation is prohibitively expensive given
the current DoD fiscal posture.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 4 (Funding Source)
The USAG FWA determined that rehabilitation of one or both of Hangars 2 and 3, despite the reuse
option chosen, would not satisfy the fourth screening criteria of having a clearly identified, applicable,
and timely funding source or a mechanism that would guarantee the funding needed to support the basic
rehabilitation of these facilities. The USAG FWA has explored all possibilities available to obtain an
applicable and timely funding source, as outlined below.
The USAG FWA researched the various funding possibilities for rehabilitating the hangars and
identified three possible Army funding sources: rehabilitation financed by the sustainment, restoration
and modernization (SRM) program; minor construction financed by the unspecified minor military
construction, Army (UMMCA) program; and major construction financed by the Army’s MILCON
program (Table 2-5). Use of these funds is restricted by statutory limitations that Congress has enacted
for each funding program.

Up to $3 million can be spent on projects that correct a threat to life, health, or safety.

Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization Funding Source
For a project to be eligible for restoration finance under the SRM program, the funded repair project
cost must not exceed 50 percent of the repair-to-replacement value of the facility (Army, 2010, 2012g).
The current replacement value of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 would be approximately $38 million. 16
Based on the regulation, in order to obtain funding, the repairs to either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 could not
exceed $19 million. The current USACE Alaska District rehabilitation estimate of $60 million, as well
as those values determined as part of the reuse study ($48 million to $55 million) (Table 2-4), clearly
exceed the 50 percent repair-to-replacement value of the hangar. Thus, the high cost of rehabilitation
for Hangars 2 and 3 (ranging from $48 million to $60 million) makes them unlikely candidates for
funding under this program.
Use of the USAG FWA’s local SRM funding source is not a valid option because the local SRM
funding amounts do not support the cost of rehabilitating the hangar(s). For example, the FY 12 budget,
used as a benchmark, identified a total of $46 million for Fort Wainwright to spend on the annual
sustainment of facilities. Approximately $28 million of this total is non-discretionary, meaning that the
funds cannot be spent on anything other than what it was intended for. The USAG FWA’s discretionary

16

The cost to construct a new UAS hangar, $38 million, was used as the replacement value because it represents the most
current and valid cost estimate for a new hangar facility at Fort Wainwright.

Chapter 2.0

2-17

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
SRM budget totaled about $18 million for this period. Even if it was possible to allocate the entire $18
million toward a single project without detrimental effects to other needs at Fort Wainwright, it is still
insufficient to support the current rehabilitation cost estimate that ranges from $48 million to $60
million per hangar.

Unspecified Minor Military Construction, Army, Funding Source
For a project to be eligible for minor construction funding under the UMMCA program, the total
funded costs cannot exceed $2 million. Based on the cost estimates outlined in Section 2.3.3.2 under the
subheading Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 and in Table 2-4, rehabilitation of either hangar would
not be eligible for this type of funding.

Military Construction Funding Source
The USAG FWA considered relying on the MILCON process and submitting a hangar rehabilitation
project as part of its annual budget request for new construction. Public law governs MILCON. Every
Army MILCON undertaking must be specifically authorized and funded in MILCON legislation or
performed under special statutory authority. The MILCON program is typically a 5-year process and
involves a sequence of reviews by the Office of the Secretary of the Army, the Office of the Secretary
of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, and Congress. Program changes continue throughout
the review until the MILCON program becomes law.
Following a requirements analysis, which is based on potential military unit stationing actions,
programmatic documents (referred to as Form DD1391s) are developed for potential MILCON
projects. Each installation maintains a Real Property Planning Board to prioritize its list of MILCON
projects and DD1391 programmed amounts in accordance with the Army’s Facility Investment Strategy
(FIS) Guidance (Army, 2012h) for the current Program Objective Memorandum (POM).
The Army’s FIS guidance encompasses the SRM, UMMCA, and MILCON funding programs
previously mentioned. The FIS was developed and approved to optimize the Army’s application of
scarce resources. Essentially, through implementation of the FIS, the Army intends to sustain needed
facilities and improve their quality, dispose of unnecessary facilities, and build-out the most critical
facility shortfalls. The Army has identified the following critical facility shortfalls for the FY 15 to FY
19 MILCON cycle: organizational vehicle maintenance, ranges and training support systems, and Army
Reserve Component readiness facilities. Additional focus areas are trainee barracks, organic industrial
base, and energy/utilities (Army, 2012h). The Army, thus the USAG FWA, will concentrate its
investment in these areas. If a proposed project does not fall within one of these critical shortfalls or
focus areas, the likelihood of it being prioritized is very low. The USAG FWA uses the FIS as the basis

2-18

Chapter 2.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
for providing sufficient facilities for mission requirements at the least cost with acceptable quality,
functionality, and quantity.
The FIS guides Army installations on how to use the various funding mechanisms. The Army FIS
Guidance requires consideration of the full range of facility funding solutions, by first using SRM
funding to the maximum extent possible prior to considering an UMMCA or MILCON solution. The
FIS further iterates that projects submitted for funding consideration must be fully supported and
documented in an installation’s local Real Property Management Plan, Installation Status Report, and
RPLANS, in addition to being classified as a critical shortfall or focus area.
Fort Wainwright is part of the Pacific Region and the following military installations in the region can
submit projects to the annual Installation Management Command (IMCOM) Pacific Region/U.S. Army
Pacific Command Construction Requirements Review Committee to establish one consolidated Base
Operations and Mission priority list that is submitted to their respective higher headquarters offices:
USAG Fort Wainwright, USAG Fort Greely, USAG Red Cloud, USAG Yongsan, USAG Humphreys,
USAG Daegu, USAG Japan, USAG Hawaii, an USAG Kwajalein Atoll. Projects from the previous
year’s regional effort are carried over into the new cycle and reprioritized with the newly introduced
requirements. Then, each Army region priority list is assessed, and a Headquarter IMCOM priority is
established. Ultimately, the FY 15 to FY 19 priority list is finalized for the Army. In accordance with
the Army FIS, IMCOM can only present three projects for consideration for the FY 15 to FY 19 POM.
In understanding Army FIS guidance, the MILCON process, and the prioritization of projects locally,
regionally, and across the entire Army, it becomes obvious that hangar rehabilitation would not be
viewed as a likely project to be funded in the near future, if at all. With no reasonable expectation of
MILCON funding for this project at this time, applying a “wait-and-see” approach to MILCON funding
for these facilities is not a responsible use of government funds. It does not support the tenets of
purposeful facility sustainment within the Army as it necessitates incurring ongoing annual
maintenance costs (approximately $350,000 per hangar per year), additional wear and tear to the
facilities that could possibly render rehabilitation obsolete, and overall project cost escalation to a point
where the range of $48 million to $60 million would no longer be a valid estimate for rehabilitation.
In another attempt to secure funding for the rehabilitation of the hangars, the USAG FWA used the
2012 Reuse Study estimate of $32 million to $38 million per hangar to research potential partnership
opportunities with other federal, state, or private/commercial interests. No entity expressed an interest
in a funding partnership. This communication is further explained in detail in the following
Section 2.3.3.4.

Chapter 2.0

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Conclusion
In summary, the potential alternative of hangar rehabilitation associated with the relevant reuse options,
directly addresses the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 and supports the current and future military
missions of Fort Wainwright. This alternative is prohibitively expensive (even to rehabilitate one
hangar) and lacks the necessary applicable and timely funding mechanism to support its successful
implementation. Given the current and future economic outlook for the Army and nation, the USAG
FWA has decided that further advancement of rehabilitation would not be in the best interest of the
Army’s limited funding, and it would not be smart planning on the part of the USAG FWA. The USAG
FWA has determined proceeding with this option, while knowing that rehabilitation is not fundable, is
impracticable. As a result, this alternative was determined to be not reasonable. Because it is no longer
considered reasonable, this potential alternative of rehabilitation is not carried forward for full analysis.

2.3.3.3

Removal and Reconstruction of Either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or Both on Fort
Wainwright

Discussion of Screening Criterion 1 (Hangar Disposition)
The option of removing the hangars via deconstruction and reconstructing them at a different location
on Fort Wainwright for reuse, regardless of reuse type, meets the first screening criterion as it directly
addresses the disposition of the buildings.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 2 (Mission Compatibility)
All reuse options except the roller rink and the museum are compatible with the second screening
criteria for their potential to meet current and future military missions at Fort Wainwright. Even though
the roller rink and museum reuse option would be compatible with existing military land use
designations, they are not an appropriate use of valuable real property space, and would ultimately be
an ineffective use of facility planning and maintenance funding because the Army has no need for a
roller rink or museum at this time. Furthermore, these reuse options do not support the current
USARAK mission of rapid deployment, military training requirements, or assistance with future
mission changes.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 (Cost)
Based on the thorough cost-estimation efforts that the Army conducted in attempting to determine an
accurate rehabilitation cost for Hangars 2 and 3 (described in Section 2.3.3.2 under the subheading
Discussion of Screening Criterion 3), as well as the current DoD More Disciplined Use of Resources
financing strategy, the USAG FWA determined that removal and reconstruction of either one or both of

2-20

Chapter 2.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 to support any reuse option would not satisfy the third screening criteria. The
amount of money required to implement a reuse through facility relocation would be prohibitively
expensive.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 4 (Funding Source)
Based on the previous discussion of available Army funding mechanisms for this type of construction
project (discussed in Section 2.3.3.2 under the subheading Discussion of Screening Criterion 4) and
similar to the hangar rehabilitation alternative, the proposal to remove and reconstruct one or both of
the hangars would not be viewed as a likely project to be funded in the near future. There is no
reasonable expectation of MILCON funding for this project at this time.

Conclusion
In summary, the potential alternative of removing and reconstructing the hangars on Fort Wainwright
directly addresses the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 and except for the roller rink and museum reuse
options supports the current and future military missions of Fort Wainwright and USARAK. This
alternative is prohibitively expensive (even to relocate one hangar) and lacks the necessary applicable
and timely funding mechanism to support its successful implementation. As a result, this alternative
was determined to be not reasonable. Because it is no longer considered reasonable, this potential
alternative of removal and reconstruction is not carried forward for full analysis.

2.3.3.4

Closed Layaway of Either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or Both

Under this alternative, the hangars would remain vacant and unused because no specific reuse has been
identified. During their permanent closed layaway lifespan, the hangars would be rehabilitated to
provide for their long-term structural integrity and to meet life, health, and safety standards to protect
any user of the facility. All work under this alternative affecting historic materials, surfaces, and
finishes would be undertaken in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the
Treatment of Historic Properties. Repairs to the following areas would be required for closed layaway:
architectural, fire protection, mechanical, and electrical.
Long-term maintenance support would include roof repairs, security patrols, deactivation of certain
non-critical utility systems, and pest management.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 1 (Hangar Disposition)
The closed layaway alternative would directly address the disposition of the hangars.

Chapter 2.0

2-21

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Discussion of Screening Criterion 2 (Mission Compatibility)
Closed layaway does not meet the second screening criteria because both hangars would remain vacant
and would not support the Army’s mission at Fort Wainwright. These unused facilities would occupy
valuable space on the active airfield that could be used for other purposes that actively contribute to the
Army’s mission in Alaska.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 (Cost)
Closed layaway of the either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both does not meet the third screening criteria.
The cost to rehabilitate the hangars to provide for their long-term structural integrity would be
prohibitively expensive and would not be approved by the Army funding entities, as discussed in
Section 2.3.3.2 under the subheading Discussion of Screening Criterion 3.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 4 (Funding Source)
There is no identified, timely funding source as discussed in Section 2.3.3.2 under the subheading
Discussion of Screening Criterion 4.

Conclusion
Because closed layaway would not support the military mission in Alaska, is prohibitively expensive,
and has no identified and timely funding source, this alternative is not considered reasonable.
Consequently, this potential alternative is not carried forward for full analysis.

2.3.3.5

Transfer of Ownership of Either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or Both to Non-Army
Entities

Under this alternative, the Army would partner with another federal or state agency or private entity and
transfer ownership of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 or both for rehabilitation and reuse. The receiving
entity would be responsible for rehabilitating the structure to comply with all applicable building codes;
improve life and safety conditions, including AT/FP measures; and correct damage and deficiencies to
ensure the long-term structural integrity of the hangar(s). The partnering agencies would also be
responsible for the management, operations (to include utilities) and maintenance of the hangar(s), as
well as the funding necessary to carry out all of these activities, including rehabilitation.
The USAG FWA sent letters to several agencies to inquire about their potential interest in reusing the
hangars. The agencies receiving letters were identified based on their existing use of Ladd Field or their
responsibilities for aviation management in Alaska. The USAG FWA required that any potential reuses
identified by outside agencies be compatible with the current and future military mission at Fort

2-22

Chapter 2.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Wainwright. Options included the rehabilitation of the hangars to support reuse as an armory, aircraft
maintenance, or warm storage. A rehabilitation cost estimate of $32 million to $38 million was also
included. Letters were sent to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Fire Service, and the
Alaska Army National Guard due to their existing use of Ladd Field. Letters were also sent to the
Department of the Interior National Business Center/Aviation Management, Alaska Regional Office,
and the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry, due to their aviation
management responsibilities within the Interior Alaska Region. A letter of inquiry was also sent to the
NPS due to its special expertise and regulatory authority regarding the Ladd Field NHL. Each agency
responded that they were currently not interested in partnering with the Army to rehabilitate and reuse
the hangars (see Appendix D for all correspondence).
The USAG FWA conducted market research in spring 2012 to determine the feasibility of ownership
transfer of the hangars to a private or commercial entity. Research into the region’s commercial real
estate market found that comparable-sized facilities to the hangars are available for rent or purchase off
military land for considerably less money than the cost of rehabilitating one or both hangars. Current
rental rates, if applied to a potential future lease situation of the hangars by a private entity, are not high
enough to enable the Army to realize a return on a potential investment of approximately $48 million to
$60 million for rehabilitation of one hangar (McEnteer, 2012). Given this market research, the
opportunity for the Army to partner with or support the use of the hangars by a private or commercial
entity is not likely to present itself.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 1 (Hangar Disposition)
The transfer of ownership alternative would directly address the disposition of the hangars.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 2 (Mission Compatibility)
This option could support the second screening criteria if both hangars were reused in a way that is
compatible with the current and future military mission at Fort Wainwright.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 3 (Cost)
This option does not meet the third screening criteria. The cost to rehabilitate the hangars would be
prohibitively expensive and would likely not be approved by another agency’s funding entity or allow
the Army to realize a return on its investment if it were able to lease the hangars to a private party.

Discussion of Screening Criterion 4 (Funding Source)

Chapter 2.0

2-23

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
None of the agencies contacted by the USAG FWA were interested in partnering with the Army to
provide funding and rehabilitate the hangars for a compatible use.

Conclusion
Because no federal or state entity responded with interest in rehabilitating and reusing the hangar(s),
and market research does not support soliciting potential interest from private or commercial entities,
this alternative is not considered reasonable. Consequently, this potential alternative is not carried
forward for full analysis.

2.3.3.6

Conclusion of Viability Analysis

A range of potential alternatives were screened for their ability to meet the stated objectives of the
purpose and need. After application of the screening criteria, as listed in Section 2.3.1, one reasonable
and viable alternative remains.
Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, would result in the footprint of the demolished hangars
being converted to concrete airfield apron space, and the actual hangar material being disposed of either
through recycling/diversion or at an approved landfill. This alternative has the potential to satisfy the
screening criteria set forth in the viability analysis, the objectives of the Proposed Action, and the
purpose and need. It is carried forward through the remainder of this Draft EIS.
In addition, Alternative 2, the No Action Alternative, must be considered and carried through for
analysis in the Draft EIS, as required by 40 CFR §1502.14(d). Under the No Action Alternative,
Hangars 2 and 3 would continue to not meet the functional requirements of maintenance facilities for
aircraft, they would continue to serve no active military function, and they would continue to remain
vacant because they have both been found to be unsafe for occupancy. No large-scale rehabilitation
efforts are currently planned for the hangars and their structural integrity would continue to deteriorate,
perhaps resulting in structural failure. Alternative 2, the No Action Alternative, does not meet the
purpose and need, and leaving the hangars vacant would not be compatible with the current and future
military mission at Fort Wainwright. This alternative is carried forward through the Draft EIS as
required by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR §1502.14). It serves as a baseline against which the impacts
of the action alternatives can be measured.

Alternatives Carried Forward

This section provides detailed descriptions of both the reasonable action alternative and the No Action
Alternative to be analyzed in this Draft EIS.

2.4.1

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under this alternative, Hangars 2 and 3 and their supporting infrastructure would be demolished
beginning in spring 2014. Demolition would involve removal of the hangars, totaling 24,016 cubic
yards of non-hazardous debris; demolition of existing and abandoned utilities not belonging to Doyon
Utilities (the current utility provider for the installation), totaling approximately 2,680 linear feet;
demolition of existing privately owned vehicle (POV) parking areas, lighting, head bolt outlets and
power source, encompassing an area of approximately 3.3 acres; and demolition of the concrete
building slabs and foundations within 5 feet of the building, to a depth of 8 inches, totaling
approximately 2,075 cubic yards of debris. In addition, a small (200-square-foot), open, flammable
liquids storage facility located between Hangars 2 and 3, which is currently empty, would be
demolished, totaling approximately 91 cubic yards of debris. Prior to demolition, the Army would
conduct hazardous material surveys of the buildings and their supporting infrastructure, including
surveys for soil contamination. The Army would remove and dispose of any hazardous materials found.
Asbestos containing building materials would be disposed of in the Fort Wainwright landfill, while all
other hazardous materials would be disposed of off-post in the Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB)
landfill in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations. Non-hazardous demolition debris
would be disposed of in the FNSB landfill; however, the Army would divert (i.e., salvage, recycle, or
reuse) non-hazardous materials from being placed in the landfill to the maximum extent practicable.
Once demolition of the hangars is complete, concrete would be added to the building and infrastructure
footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield, which is designated as an aircraft parking
apron. The Army would construct two asphalt access roads to the new apron to facilitate travel by
emergency and maintenance vehicles. Infiltration areas, swales, and culverts for stormwater would be
installed as needed, to include the addition of topsoil and seeding. Security fencing, compatible with
existing design, would also be installed. The total area encompassed by this project is approximately 10
acres. Any future construction on this site is currently unknown and is beyond the scope of this EIS. If
future construction does occur it would be the subject of separate NEPA documentation.

Chapter 2.0

2-25

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

2.4.2

Alternative 2: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, no demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would occur. While remaining
intact, the hangars would continue to not meet the functional requirements of maintenance facilities for
aircraft; thus, serving no active military function. The hangars would remain vacant because they have
been found to be unsafe for occupancy. The Army would continue to heat the facilities to prevent snow
buildup on the roofs (which, if allowed to accumulate, could cause their collapse). Maintenance and
upkeep of the hangars, such as security patrols, pest control, and building systems maintenance, would
continue based on current funding levels and other maintenance priorities at Fort Wainwright; however,
as large structural systems fail they would not be replaced or receive major repairs. For example, recent
freezing and bursting of water pipes in Hangar 2 in late 2012 rendered the fire suppression system
within the side offices inoperable. Unsafe working conditions and current funding levels prevent this
system from being repaired.
Maintenance and upkeep of the hangars, including utilities, requires approximately $350,000 per hangar
in annual funding. Given the current disrepair of the hangars, they present safety concerns for any
person entering them, and in some cases, safety concerns prevent maintenance from being performed
(USAG FWA, 2011a). Prior to their condemnation in 2011, the following maintenance activities were
performed: fire suppression sprinkler maintenance, oil-water separator maintenance, minor facility
preventative maintenance, and project-by-project repair maintenance. All maintenance activities except
the fire suppression sprinkler maintenance were halted following the determination that the hangars
were unsafe for occupancy. Because there will be no large-scale rehabilitation efforts and the likelihood
that future system failure will not result in replacement or repair, the structural integrity of the hangars
will continue to deteriorate over time. The eventual uncontrolled collapse of the buildings or perhaps
the total loss of one or both hangars by fire, due to inoperable fire suppression systems, is likely. At
such time the buildings do collapse, all debris would be treated as waste and disposed of in the FNSB
landfill. Due to the uncontrolled nature of the potential collapse, it is likely that the option for salvaging,
recycling, or reusing building materials would be eliminated. Thus, the total amount of debris generated
under the No Action Alternative would likely be more than that generated under Alternative 1 due to
the inability to divert materials from local landfills. Any follow-on actions associated with the location
would be subject to funding, but the current preference would be that concrete is added to the building
footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield as an aircraft parking apron.

Identification of the Preferred Alternative

The Army’s Preferred Alternative is Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3. Demolition would
involve removal of the hangars and their supporting infrastructure, including demolition of existing and
abandoned utilities not belonging to Doyon Utilities; demolition of existing POV parking areas,
lighting, head bolt outlets, and power source; demolition of the small open, flammable liquids storage
facility that is located between Hangars 2 and 3; and removal of concrete building slabs and
foundations. Once demolition of the hangars is complete, concrete would be added to the building and
infrastructure footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield, which is designated as an
aircraft parking apron. Alternative 1 is described in further detail in Section 2.4.1 above.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSEQUENCES

Introduction

This chapter describes the affected environment of Fort Wainwright, Alaska, and the surrounding area,
as well as the environmental impacts associated with each alternative. The affected environment
consists of areas and the resources within those areas that may experience environmental effects
resulting from implementing the alternatives described in Chapter 2.0. A study area, or region of
influence (ROI), is described for each resource area examined in this analysis. The ROI varies among
resources and defines the geographic extent of potential effects from the alternatives on the important
elements of that resource. Immediately following the Affected Environment section for each resource is
the presentation of Environmental Consequences section, which details the environmental impacts
associated with each alternative. Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, is presented first,
followed by the analysis of Alternative 2, No Action. Any mitigation measures identified to reduce or
eliminate the impact of an alternative on a resource are identified within the analysis for that resource
area. In addition to identifying the direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with each
alternative, the cumulative impact of the alternatives with other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions within the ROI 17 for each resource area are discussed in Section 3.9. As
required by 40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] §1502.16, this chapter also describes in Section 3.10
any adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided, any irreversible or irretrievable commitments
of resources if the proposed action is implemented, and the relationship between short-term uses of the
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity,

3.1.1

Presentation of Resource Areas

Analysis of the environmental consequences of the Proposed Action focuses on those areas of concern
identified during scoping. Environmental consequences associated with the Proposed Action include

3-2

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
direct, indirect, short-term, and long-term impacts; cumulative impacts; and any irreversible or
irretrievable commitments of resources.
The CEQ defines direct effects as those caused by the action and occur at the same time and place;
whereas, indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance but
are still reasonably foreseeable (40 CFR §1508.8). For example, impacts from the demolition of
Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright would be a direct effect associated with the alternatives, while an
increase in local spending by construction workers hired to perform the demolition would be an indirect
effect. Impacts are characterized as beneficial or adverse and short term or long term. Beneficial
impacts are those that would result in a positive change in the condition or appearance of the resource
or a change that would move the resource toward a desired condition. Adverse impacts are those that
would result in a negative change to the appearance or condition of the resource. Short-term impacts are
those that would be temporary and associated with the demolition/construction phase but would no
longer be perceptible once demolition/construction is completed or shortly thereafter. Long-term
impacts are those that would be permanent or would persist for the operational life of the project.
Although further adapted to address the unique characteristics of each resource category carried
forward for analysis in this chapter, the qualitative terms used to assess the anticipated impacts
associated with each of the alternatives are generally defined as:
•

None—No measureable impacts are expected to occur.

•

Minor—Adverse impacts are expected to occur; impacts would be measureable and may have
a slight effect on the resource.

•

Moderate—Adverse impacts are expected to occur; impacts would be noticeable and would
have a measureable effect on the resource.

•

Severe—Adverse impacts are expected to occur; impacts would be obvious, would be
significant, and would have serious consequences on the resource.

•

Beneficial—Only beneficial impacts are expected to occur.

CEQ guidelines indicate significance of an impact is determined by the intensity and the context of the
impact. Intensity refers to the severity or extent of an impact (i.e., none, minor, moderate, or severe) and
context relates to the environmental circumstances at the location of the impact. Significance criteria
were developed in consideration of CEQ’s guidance for determining significance (40 CFR §1508.27).
For this analysis, the first three qualitative impact categories (none, minor, and moderate) are
considered not significant. The next category (severe) is considered significant. The “none, minor, and
moderate” qualitative impact categories could be a result of avoidance, minimization, or mitigation of
Chapter 3.0

3-3

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
adverse impacts. The significance criteria are described for each resource area at the beginning of each
Environmental Consequences section, and the terms impact and effect are used interchangeably
throughout this document.

3.1.2.1

Resource Areas Carried Forward for Analysis

After consideration of the anticipated impacts associated with the proposed alternatives and information
gathered during both the internal and public scoping process, the following resource areas were selected
to be carried forward for detailed analysis in this Draft EIS:
•

Air Quality

•

Cultural resources

•

Hazardous materials/hazardous waste

•

Safety

•

Environmental justice and the protection of children

•

Sustainability

•

Transportation

3.1.2.2

Resource Areas Dismissed From Further Analysis

After considering information gathered during the internal and public scoping processes, factors used to
evaluate the context and intensity of a potential impact, and the anticipated impacts associated with the
proposed alternatives, it was determined the following resources would not experience a measureable
impact as a result of either alternative. Consequently, they were dismissed from further analysis for the
reasons described below:
•

Airspace—There would be no impact to the operation of the active Army airfield; no change
to, or interference with, Federal Aviation Administration airspace; and no impact to the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Fire Service’s use of the airspace and its ability to
respond to wildfires.

•

Biology—There would be no impact on threatened or endangered species since none occur on
Fort Wainwright (USFWS, 2011). The area surrounding Hangars 2 and 3 is heavily developed,
being either paved or maintained as improved grounds with no functional natural ecosystems to
maintain flora or fauna; however, birds do use some buildings on post for nesting. All
migratory birds are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA); however, cliff
swallows and mew gulls tend to be more visible around Fort Wainwright. Beginning around

3-4

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
May 1 of each year, cliff swallows build mud nests under eave spaces of many buildings on
Fort Wainwright and mew gulls build nests on vehicles and other equipment. Other birds of
concern are ravens and owls. The MBTA prohibits the “take” of any migratory bird during the
breeding season without a permit. “Take” is defined broadly and includes the removal of
occupied nests. Occupied nests are defined as those nests that hold eggs and/or chicks. Once a
nest is active, it cannot be removed without a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS). However, the USAG FWA does not seek or receive permits for the depredation of
cliff swallow nests. The MBTA and USFWS guidelines provide that nests may be removed
prior to becoming active or once active nests are abandoned around July 15. Prior to and during
demolition activities, the demolition contractor would be required by USAG FWA to monitor
Hangars 2 and 3 for nest building activities and remove any nests found prior to them becoming
active. If active nests are found, all activities that could affect the nests would cease until the
nest is abandoned. As a result, there would be no effect on migratory birds.
•

Floodplains—The Main Post of Fort Wainwright, including Ladd Field, is within the 100-year
floodplains of the Chena and Tanana rivers. Executive Orders 11988 Floodplain Management
and 11990 Protection of Wetlands prohibit building within a floodplain unless there is no
practical alternative. As part of the Proposed Action, once the hangars are demolished concrete
would be added to the building and infrastructure footprints to maintain consistency with the
adjacent airfield. While this is considered new construction, there is no practical alternative to
doing this work within the floodplain. This new apron would occur only within the footprint of
existing construction (the hangars and supporting infrastructure) that is already within the
floodplain and would cause no new impedance or channelization of the flows of these rivers.
Additionally, some of the paved area would be replaced with grassed areas (infiltration areas
and swales), reducing the overall amount of impervious surface. This is in compliance with
Section 438 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 which requires federal
projects greater than 5,000 square feet to restore, to the maximum extent technically feasible,
the predevelopment hydrology of the property. Therefore, there would be no impact to
floodplains.

•

Geology and Topography—The site is essentially flat and the disposition of Hangars 2 and 3
would not change the geology or topography of the site, so there would be no impact.

•

Land Use—There would be no effect on land use since implementing the disposition of the
hangars would not change existing airfield land use designation and would be compatible with
an active Army airfield and the USAG FWA Real Property Master Plan. Any future use of this
site for purposes other than as an airfield apron is currently unknown and is beyond the scope

Chapter 3.0

3-5

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
of this EIS. Determination of a future use of this site would be subject to a separate NEPA
analysis.
•

Noise—The dominant source of noise in the project area is from the airfield. While demolition
of Hangars 2 and 3 would increase noise in the immediate vicinity of the hangars, this noise
would be temporary and minor. Operations would also comply with USAG FWA’s Installation
Operational Noise Management Plan (Army, 2011) which provides recommendations for ways
to minimize potential noise impacts. There would be no impact to sensitive noise receptors
because no sensitive noise receptors occur in the immediate vicinity of Hangars 2 and 3. There
would also be no impact from truck noise. Transportation routes to and from the hangars to the
Fort Wainwright and Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB) landfills are main roads and the
trucks would not alter the noise environment of those roads.

•

Socioeconomics—The Proposed Action would create about 68 jobs (both directly and
indirectly) and approximately $6,822,640 in sales volume for the local economy in FNSB (see
Appendix F). These beneficial impacts, however, would be temporary (only occurring during
the demolition/construction period) and are extremely small and not significant; a negligible
change from the average rate of employment over time in FNSB and a less than one percent
change in sales volume over time in FNSB. The Proposed Action would also have no impact on
the population, housing, or community and public services of Fort Wainwright or FNSB.

•

Soils—Soils in the vicinity and within the footprint of Hangars 2 and 3 have been previously
disturbed during construction of the airfield and the hangars, so no new impacts to soils would
occur. While the soils may be contaminated from previous activities, impacts from potential
disturbance of contaminated soils during demolition activities are addressed under the
Hazardous Materials/Hazardous Waste resource area (see Sections 3.4.2.2 and 3.4.2.3).

•

Subsistence—No impacts to subsistence would occur. Section 803 of the Alaska National
Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) defines subsistence use as: “the customary and
traditional uses by rural Alaska residents of wild renewable resources for direct, personal, or
family consumption as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or transportation; for the making and
selling of handicraft articles out of non-edible byproducts of fish and wildlife resources taken
for personal or family consumption; for barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption;
and for customary trade.”
Under Alaska State law, subsistence uses are defined as: “the noncommercial, customary and
traditional uses of wild, renewable resources by a resident domiciled in a rural area of the state
for direct personal or family consumption, such as food, shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, or
transportation; for the making and selling of handicraft articles out of non-edible byproducts of

3-6

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
fish and wildlife resources taken for personal or family consumption; and for customary trade,
barter, or sharing for personal or family consumption (Alaska Statute 16.05.940[33]).” The site
of Hangars 2 and 3 is heavily developed and contains no wild renewable resources as defined
by the ANILCA or as defined under Alaska State law that would allow for subsistence use.
•

Utilities—The disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 would not require an upgrade in the capacity of
the utility systems on Fort Wainwright, so there would be no adverse impact to utilities. If the
hangars are demolished, additional capacity would be available to be used elsewhere on the
installation which would be a beneficial impact.

•

Visual Resources—The disposition of the hangars would be consistent with the visual context
of an active Army airfield and the surrounding resources of the Fort Wainwright installation so
there would be no impact to visual resources.

•

Water Resources—The Clear Creek Channel, a main drainage ditch on Fort Wainwright that
eventually discharges to the Chena River, is located directly west of the Hangar 2 apron. The
channel receives storm water from the apron around both hangars via storm drain catch basins.
For demolition activities, the demolition contractor would be responsible for preparing and
following a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, which would include best management
practices (BMPs). Following BMPs, such as using silt fencing around the catch basins and
along Clear Creek Channel, would help prevent siltation or contamination of surface waters,
resulting in no impact. Additionally, there would be no on-site storage or use of petroleum
products, chemicals, etc. that could pose a threat to surface waters.
The entire project site is an impervious surface, and under the Proposed Action, some of the
paved area would be replaced with grassed areas, reducing the overall amount of impervious
surface. This would reduce the amount of stormwater produced on the site resulting in
beneficial impacts. Additionally, any excavations to take place would be to minimal depths so
that there would be no impacts to groundwater.

3.2

Air Quality

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) defines ambient air in 40 CFR §50.1(e) as “that
portion of the atmosphere, external to buildings, to which the general public has access.” In compliance
with the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 1977 and 1990 CAA Amendments, the USEPA has
promulgated National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The NAAQS were enacted for the
protection of the public health and welfare, allowing for an adequate margin of safety. To date, the
USEPA has issued NAAQS for the following criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide

Chapter 3.0

3-7

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
(SO2), particulate matter (particles with a diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers
[PM10] and particles with a diameter less than or equal to nominal 2.5 micrometers [PM2.5]), ozone (O3),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and lead (Pb).

3.2.1.1

Affected Environment
Air Quality General Conformity

Federal regulations designate Air Quality Control Regions in violation of the NAAQS as nonattainment
areas. According to the severity of the pollution problem, nonattainment areas can be categorized as
marginal, moderate, serious, severe, or extreme. Severity categories have not yet been applied to PM2.5
nonattainment areas. The USEPA classifies a portion of the FNSB airshed as in nonattainment for PM2.5
(see Figure 3-1). The entire FNSB airshed also was previously in nonattainment for CO, but on
September 27, 2004, it came into attainment for that pollutant (USEPA, 2012a). To prevent reverting
back into nonattainment, the FNSB is listed as in maintenance for CO. The FNSB is in attainment for
all other criteria pollutants (USEPA, 2012a). For purposes of this analysis, the ROI includes the entire
FNSB airshed with regard to the PM2.5 nonattainment and CO maintenance areas.
The NAAQS for PM2.5 and CO are listed in Table 3-2.

To regulate the emission levels resulting from a project, federal actions located in nonattainment or
maintenance areas are required to demonstrate compliance with the general conformity guidelines
established in 40 CFR §93, Determining Conformity of Federal Actions to State or Federal
Implementation Plans (the Rule). Section 93.153 of the Rule sets the applicability requirements for
projects subject to the Rule through the establishment of de minimis levels for annual criteria pollutant

emissions. These de minimis levels are set according to criteria pollutant nonattainment area and
maintenance area designations. For projects with emissions that fall below the de minimis levels, a full
conformity determination is not required. Those projects with emissions at or above the de minimis
levels are required to perform a conformity analysis as established in the Rule. The de minimis levels
apply to emissions that can occur during demolition/construction or operation phases of the action.

3.2.1.2

Air Permit Requirements

Title V Permit
Fort Wainwright is regarded as a single source, but it is permitted as two entities and operates under
two Title V permits (Permit No. AQ0236TVP02; Permit No. AQ1121TVP01; December 5, 2008). The
main sources of emissions on Fort Wainwright are six coal-fired boilers (the Central Heating and Power
Plant [CHPP]) and a coal preparation plant. Doyon Utilities Inc. operates these facilities, and they are
listed on one of the two Title V permits. This permit is issued under the control of Doyon Utilities Inc.
Several marginal emissions units also are located on Fort Wainwright, including small backup
generators, small diesel boilers for Bassett Hospital, and underground storage tanks listed on the second
Title V permit, which is issued under the control of the Army (AKDEC, 2008a,b).

3.2.1.3

Existing Ambient Air Quality Concentrations

Stations that meet the USEPA’s design criteria for State and Local Air Monitoring Stations and
National Air Monitoring Stations monitor ambient air quality in FNSB. At various times over the past
five years, five different stations have monitored PM2.5 and CO. Currently, there are only two active
monitoring stations: one is located at 809 Pioneer Road (monitoring PM2.5 and CO) and the other is
located at the State Office Building (monitoring PM2.5). The highest and second highest values recorded
at all five stations during the period from 2007 through 2011 are shown in Table 3-3.

3.2.1.4

Meteorology/Climate

Temperature is a parameter used in calculating emissions for air quality applicability. The climate in
Fairbanks, Alaska, ranges from 72 degrees Fahrenheit in July to an average of –17 degrees Fahrenheit
in January. Fairbanks receives an average of 11.3 inches of precipitation annually. April is the driest
month (NOAA, 2013). During the winter months, low temperatures and calm winds combined with
high emissions in Fairbanks create surface-based inversions. Surface-based inversions result in poor
dispersion of air pollutants, which can create unhealthy air quality conditions.

3.2.1.5

Air Emissions at Fort Wainwright

As part of its Title V permit, the USAG FWA monitors permanent stationary source emissions, as well
as generator emissions, annually. Construction emissions are not included in the calculation of annual
emissions because these emission sources are temporary and not regulated by Title V of the CAA.
Emissions at Fort Wainwright are nearly at the potential to emit limitations listed under the Title V
permits. The potential to emit represents the maximum emissions a stationary source can produce if
operating at maximum capacity 24 hours a day for the entire year and takes into account federal
enforceable limits (i.e., permit limits, coal use to less than 336,000 tons per year [TPY]). These
maximum emissions are provided as the baseline emissions in Table 3-3. Ninety percent of all
emissions at Fort Wainwright are from the CHPP. Total operational emissions at Fort Wainwright in
2012 are shown in Table 3-4.

Regional Air Quality Index Summary

The USEPA calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI) for five major air pollutants regulated by the CAA:
ground-level O3, PM, CO, SO2, and NO2. The USEPA collects data daily to determine air quality for the
region and releases it in the form of the AQI. The AQI ranges from zero to 500, with zero being no air
pollution and 500 representing severely unhealthy air pollution levels. An AQI value between 101 and
150 indicates that air quality is unhealthy for sensitive groups, who may be subject to negative health
effects. Sensitive groups may include those with lung or heart disease and will be more negatively
affected by lower levels of ground level ozone and particulate matter than the rest of the general public.
An AQI value between 151 and 200 is considered to be unhealthy and may result in negative health
effects for the general public, with more severe effects possible for those in sensitive groups. AQI
values above 200 are considered very unhealthy. An AQI greater than 300 represents hazardous air
quality (Clean Air Partners, no date). Table 3-5 shows the recent AQI data for Fairbanks. There were no
days with an AQI value above 301 in this time frame.

Greenhouse Gases

There is broad scientific consensus that humans are changing the chemical composition of earth’s
atmosphere. Activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and other changes in land use, are
resulting in the accumulation of trace greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), in our
atmosphere. An increase in GHG emissions is said to result in an increase in the earth’s average surface
temperature, which is commonly referred to as global warming. Global warming is expected, in turn, to
affect weather patterns, the average sea level, ocean acidification, chemical reaction rates, and
precipitation rates, all of which is commonly referred to as climate change. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change best estimates are that the average global temperature rise between 2000 and
2100 could range from 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.08 degrees Fahrenheit) (with no increase in GHG
emissions above year 2000 levels) to 4.0 degrees Celsius (6.66 degrees Fahrenheit) (with substantial
increase in GHG emissions) (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). Even small increases
in global temperatures could have considerable detrimental impacts on natural and human
environments.
GHGs include water vapor, CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, O3, and several hydrocarbons and
chlorofluorocarbons. Each GHG has an estimated global warming potential, which is a function of its
atmospheric lifetime and its ability to absorb and radiate infrared energy emitted from the earth’s
surface. A gas’s global warming potential provides a relative basis for calculating its carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e), which is a metric measure used to compare the emissions from various GHGs based
upon their global warming potential. CO2 has a global warming potential of 1 and is therefore the
standard to which all other GHGs are measured.
Water vapor is a naturally occurring GHG and accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse
effect. Next to water vapor, CO2 is the second-most abundant GHG. Uncontrolled CO2 emissions from
power plants, heating sources, and mobile sources are a function of the power rating of each source, the
feedstock (fuel) consumed, and the source’s net efficiency at converting the energy in the feedstock into
other useful forms of energy (e.g., electricity, heat, and kinetic). Because CO2 and the other GHGs are
relatively stable in the atmosphere and essentially uniformly mixed throughout the troposphere and
stratosphere, the climatic impact of these emissions does not depend upon the source location on the
earth (i.e., regional climatic impacts/changes will be a function of global emissions).

Regulatory Climate
In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the USEPA has the regulatory authority to list
GHGs as pollutants under the federal CAA. Congress has considered numerous proposals and bills to
regulate GHGs but has not adopted any legislation.
Currently, federal agencies address emissions of GHGs by reporting and meeting reductions mandated
in laws, executive orders, and policies. The most recent of these are Executive Order 13514, Federal
Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, of October 5, 2009, and Executive
Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, of
January 26, 2007.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and Executive
Orders 13514 and 13423 require the federal government to adhere to specific energy improvements,
which address waste reduction and improvements in efficiency. Specifically, the Department of
Defense’s (DoD) Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan contains strategies to reduce energy waste
and improve efficiency (DoD, 2010).
On May 13, 2010, the USEPA issued the Tailoring Rule, which establishes a common sense approach
to addressing GHG emissions from stationary sources under the CAA permitting programs. The
Tailoring Rule includes three steps aimed at setting GHG thresholds for prevention of significant
deterioration (PSD) 18 and Title V permits for new, modified, and existing sources. Steps 1 and 2 set
thresholds for these major stationary sources. Step 3, finalized on June 29, 2012, did not revise the
thresholds established under Steps 1 and 2 but opted not to apply PSD or Title V GHG permitting
thresholds to smaller stationary sources at this time (USEPA, 2012e). Under Steps 1 and 2, PSD
requirements applied to new sources with the potential to emit at least 100,000 TPY CO2e or existing
sources that emit 100,000 TPY CO2e and undertake modifications that increase emissions by at least
75,000 TPY CO2e. Title V GHG requirements apply to new or existing sources with the potential to
emit 100,000 TPY CO2e (USEPA, 2012e). In Alaska, 3,750 TPY CO2e is used as the permitting
threshold (AKDEC, 2012).

18

A PSD is required for major source facilities in areas in attainment for all criteria pollutants. It requires a
general conformity-like analysis be completed for modifications to those facilities so that air quality does not
deteriorate.

Baseline Greenhouse Gas Emissions at Fort Wainwright
GHG emission sources at Fort Wainwright include boilers, chillers, water heaters, and emergency
generators. Total GHG emissions from the CHPP in 2011 were 445,870 metric tons CO2e (491,482
tons) (USEPA, 2013). 19 Consequently, because it exceeds the 100,000 TPY CO2e, Fort Wainwright will
likely require a Title V permit for GHG emissions as the Tailor Rule is implemented.

3.2.2

Environmental Consequences

A project general conformity rule applicability analysis per Section 93.153 of the Rule has been
performed that evaluated the proposed demolition of Hangars 2 and 3. The applicability analysis
estimated the level of potential air emissions for CO, PM2.5, and the PM2.5 precursor pollutant SO2 to
analyze impacts to air quality. The de minimis thresholds for areas in nonattainment for PM2.5 are 100
TPY for PM2.5 and SO2, and 100 TPY for CO maintenance areas.
For Alternative 1, demolition emissions were estimated based on square footage and known building
footprints, estimates of the amount of construction debris to be generated, the size of dump trucks to be
used for hauling debris to landfills, and the distance to be traveled to and from the landfills. A complete
detailed description of all of the assumptions and methodology used to estimate the potential emissions
under alternative 1 can be found in Appendix G.
Under the No Action alternative, it is assumed that any future demolition and construction-related
impacts resulting from the uncontrolled collapse of the hangars would have the same short-term (heavy
equipment-related) impacts to air quality or GHGs as Alternative 1.

3.2.2.1

Significance Criteria

For the purposes of assessing the significance of impacts related to air quality the following impact
thresholds were developed:
•

None—No measurable impacts are expected to occur. Ambient air quality would not change.

•

Minor to Moderate (not significant)—The degree to which activities result in measureable
changes to the local and regional air quality.

•

Severe (significant)—Activities causing an exceedance of regulatory thresholds would
represent a significant impact.

At the writing of this Draft EIS, the report providing GHG emissions for 2012 was not yet available.

3.2.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Alternative 1 would require the operation of heavy equipment and dump trucks for demolition
activities, including hauling demolition debris to the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfills, and
construction activities for placing an airfield concrete apron within the footprints of the hangars and
associated infrastructure once they are removed. Appendix G provides a full conformity applicability
analysis for the emissions associated with these activities and describes the assumptions made in
calculating the amount of emissions. Operational emissions, such as heating or increased vehicle
emissions, associated with implementing Alternative 1 would not increase. With both hangars being
demolished, the operational demand on the CHPP would be reduced, resulting in a decrease in
emissions from the CHPP, which would be a beneficial impact on air quality. This reduction in the
demand on the CHPP is shown in Table 3-6 as operational emissions.
The air quality impacts associated with the demolition of both hangars and construction of the airfield
concrete apron in their building footprints are provided in Table 3-6. As shown in Table 3-6, emissions
associated with these activities, when compared to the de minimis thresholds for an area that is in
nonattainment for PM2.5 and in maintenance for CO, fall below the de minimis thresholds for these
pollutants and any precursor emissions.

To help control fugitive dust, primarily PM2.5, from ground-disturbing activities, construction vehicles
would adhere to BMPs that would include washing down all construction vehicles before leaving the
project area and cleaning soil out of tracked equipment before entering the roadway. Other BMPs
include using a water truck to moisten soils before any grading, minimizing areas of ground
disturbance, and avoiding activity during periods of high wind.

Greenhouse Gases
Under Alternative 1, demand on the CHPP would be reduced because of the removal of both hangars.
This would reduce the amount of coal-burned emissions and CO2e emissions resulting in a beneficial
impact on air quality. Using 2011 GHG emissions from the CHPP, it was determined that 300,000 tons
of coal produces 445,870 metric tons of CO2e. Using this total, it can be assumed that 1 ton of coal
produces approximately 0.672 metric ton of CO2e. Therefore, a reduction in 3,000 tons of coal annually
(the estimated electrical and heating demand used by both hangars, as fully described in Appendix G)
would eliminate 2,018.52 metric tons of CO2e.
Under Alternative 1, the only increase in criteria pollutants would be a small, temporary increase in
PM2.5 emissions during demolition and construction activities, resulting in a short-term, minor impact
on air quality. Overall, once the hangars are demolished and the airfield concrete apron is completed, all
emission pollutants would be reduced, including SO2, CO, and GHG emissions, resulting in long-term,
beneficial impacts to air quality. A Record of Non-Applicability 20 is provided in Appendix G.

3.2.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, while the hangars remain structurally intact, operational (heat and
electrical use) emissions would continue. These emissions are expected to be similar to the operational
emissions as fully outlined in Appendix G, Section 7.2.1. These emissions would represent a continued
long-term, minor impact to air quality, but would not change the existing air quality conditions. Without
large-scale rehabilitation efforts, it is expected that the hangars would eventually collapse on their own.
When that occurs, there would be temporary emissions similar to those described under Alternative 1
from the use of construction equipment to remove the debris, including hauling debris to a landfill and
placing an airfield concrete apron within the footprints of the hangars and associated infrastructure once
the debris is removed. These temporary emissions would result in short-term, minor impacts to air
quality. Once all demolition activities and the airfield concrete apron are complete, the No Action
Alternative would result in long-term, beneficial impacts to air quality from the reduction in operational
emissions and the reduced demand on the CHPP. Similar to Alternative 1, BMPs would be employed to
help control fugitive dust, mainly PM2.5, during ground-disturbing activities.

20

A Record of Non-Applicability is a short, written document used to declare that the requirements of the general
conformity rule do not apply to a specific action (Army, 2006b).

Cultural Resources

Cultural resources consist of prehistoric and historic buildings, sites, structures, artifacts, objects, and
districts. A number of statutes and regulations that have been enacted at the local, state, and federal
levels protect cultural resources and must be considered during the NEPA process.
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and its associated regulations (36 CFR §800) provide
for the preservation of cultural resources. The act established the National Register of Historic Places
(National Register), which is a listing of historic properties that are significant to American history and
culture and is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS). Sections 106 and 110 of the NHPA set
forth the processes federal agencies must follow to manage and protect cultural resources under their
care. Section 106 and its implementing regulation require that federal agencies consider the effects of
their undertakings on historic properties and define processes for resource identification, significance
evaluation, assessment of effects on significant historic properties, and resolution of adverse effects on
such properties. Section 110 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to institute programs to identify and
evaluate historic resources under their care and to consider all prudent and feasible alternatives, to the
maximum extent possible, to avoid an adverse impact on a National Historic Landmark (NHL) by a
proposed undertaking. The agency must afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)
an opportunity to review an undertaking that results in an adverse effect. Under Section 110, the USAG
FWA has an added level of responsibility with regard to the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark
(Ladd Field NHL) that it does not have for the National Register-eligible Ladd Air Force Base (Ladd
AFB) Cold War Historic District (Cold War Historic District). At the state level, the Alaska State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)/Office of History and Archaeology implements the Alaska
Historic Preservation Act (Alaska Statute 41.35.70) and works to preserve sites and buildings that
reflect Alaska’s heritage.
The USAG FWA has considered the applicability of other federal laws and regulations concerning the
management of cultural resources and the impact of the Proposed Action. Federal regulations
concerning archaeological sites are not applicable to the Proposed Action because previous construction
activities have disturbed the ground at Hangars 2 and 3, and no known archaeological resources have
been identified in the vicinity.
Likewise, although the USAG FWA has consulted with federally recognized tribes and tribal
organizations, the Proposed Action is not anticipated to result in adverse impacts to tribal resources
because no tribal lands or known tribal resources exist within the footprint of the area that the Proposed

3-18

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Action might disturb. See Section 1.6.5 for additional information on government-to-government
consultation.

National Register of Historic Places
To be eligible for listing in the National Register, resources must meet one or more criteria as defined in
36 CFR §60.4. These criteria include the property’s association with a significant historical event or
with a famous person, the property’s embodiment of the characteristics of an architectural style or work
of a master, or the property’s ability to contribute to scientific/historical research.
Groupings of buildings or sites also may qualify for listing in the National Register as historic districts.
Historic districts can comprise buildings, sites, or objects that lack individual distinction, but when
viewed as a whole, they are considered significant. Individual resources within a district are considered
either contributing or non-contributing. Contributing resources are those that were constructed during a
district’s period of significance and add to the character and historic significance of a property through
historical association or architectural value. Non-contributing resources are those that do not date to a
period of significance, have been altered, and no longer retain their historical appearance or do not add
to a district’s historic character or significance.
In order to qualify for the National Register, a resource must also possess integrity (i.e., important
historic physical features must be present and recognizable). The NPS defines integrity as “the ability of
a property to convey its significance” (NPS, 1997). The integrity of historic properties is based on seven
aspects: Location, Setting, Feeling, Association, Materials, Workmanship, and Design. The aspects are
defined by the National Register Bulletin, How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation
(NPS, 1997) (Table 3-7). A property does not necessarily need to possess all seven aspects to retain
overall integrity and in some instances, certain aspects may be more important than others to a
property’s significance.
Descriptions of each aspect of integrity as currently retained by the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War
Historic District are provided below. The integrity of Hangars 2 and 3 will not be discussed because the
buildings do not possess sufficient significance independent of the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold War
Historic District to qualify for individual listing in the National Register. Although previous alterations
to character-defining features of the hangars, including siding, windows, and hangar doors, have
diminished the integrity of the hangars, they continue to possess sufficient integrity to maintain their
status as contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District and will be
discussed within that context (see Section 3.3.1.3) (Bittner, 2010; USAG FWA, 2010a,b).

Table 3-7: Definitions of the Aspects of Integrity
Integrity Aspect

Definition

Location

The place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the historic event
occurred.

Setting

The physical environment of a historic property and the visual connections created by that
physical environment. Setting refers to the character of the place in which the property
played its historic role. The physical features that constitute the Setting of a historic
property include topographic features, vegetation, manmade features, and the relationship
between buildings or open spaces that create a landscape with distinctive spatial
relationships between historic resources.

Feeling

A property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time. In
many ways Feeling is the sum of all aspects of integrity. This is a particularly important
aspect when applied to historic districts. Districts as a whole should convey a sense of
history and communicate their place in time.

Association

The direct link between an important historic event or person and a historic resource.

Materials

The physical components that were combined or deposited during a particular period of
time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form or construct a historic resource.

Workmanship

The physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during any given period
in history or prehistory.

Design

The combination of elements that create the form, plan, spatial structure, and style of the
property.

Source: NPS (1997)

National Historic Landmarks
The National Register also includes NHLs, which are historic properties that the Secretary of the
Interior has determined to be of national significance. These resources possess exceptional value in
illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. NHLs are National Register resources that
are afforded a greater degree of protection because of their high level of historical significance. NHLs
must meet the criteria as defined in 36 CFR §65.4(a and b). To qualify as an NHL, a property must
possess national significance through its association with historical events or a nationally significant
person, represent an ideal of the American people, or possess architectural significance. Additionally, a
historic district or archaeological site may also qualify as an NHL. An NHL must also meet the integrity
requirements as discussed above.

3.3.1

Affected Environment

The area of potential effect (APE) includes historic properties and areas whose character could be
altered by the Proposed Action. For NEPA purposes, the APE for cultural resources is the same as the
ROI for the affected environment and NEPA analysis. The USAG FWA, through its Section 106
consultation with the Alaska SHPO, has defined the APE to include the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold

3-20

Chapter 3.0

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
War Historic District, based on the Proposed Action’s potential to adversely affect Hangars 2 and 3,
which are contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District.

3.3.1.1

Ladd Field National Historic Landmark

In 1985, the Ladd Field NHL at Fort Wainwright was listed in the National Register as a historic district
of national significance for its role in the Army Air Corps’ cold weather testing prior to and during
World War II, its role as an air depot commanded by the Air Transport Command, and its role in the
Lend-Lease Operations as the transfer point of planes to the Russians for transport along the AlaskaSiberia Route.
The Ladd Field NHL embodies the pre-World War II and World War II military construction (see
Figure 1-4). The Ladd Field NHL nomination included 26 buildings and structures that contributed to
the historic district. The historic features that comprise the Ladd Field NHL include wood, concrete,
and steel buildings; concrete and cement runways, taxiways, and roadways; timber and steel-frame
aviation hangars; and associated utilities. The period of significance for the Ladd Field NHL extends
from 1939 when construction began on the airfield to 1945 when the war ended, the Soviet mission left
Ladd Field, and the Air Transport Command transferred Ladd Field from the Army Signal Corps to the
Air Force. Ladd Field was the first Army airfield in Alaska and was a key part of the region’s defense
buildup for World War II.
In 1961, when the Air Force transferred Ladd Field back to the Army, 50 of the 671 extant World War
II buildings on the installation were scheduled for disposal because they had either deteriorated beyond
economic restoration or they did not fit the foreseeable requirements for the Army or Air Force. The
buildings were either sold to the public or transferred to the state of Alaska. Most temporary structures,
such as Quonset huts, were moved off the installation to new locations (Price and Sackett, 2001; Design
Alaska and JCA, 2011). The initial design and layout of the airfield and installation were developed in
the late 1930s and early 1940s prior to the United States’ entry into the war. Pre-war facilities at Ladd
Field were designed as permanent structures; however, as the war progressed and construction
materials, especially steel, became more limited, buildings were constructed as semi-permanent or
temporary structures.
The centrally located airfield is the anchoring visual and organizational element of the Ladd Field NHL
and includes runways, taxiways, and aprons surrounded by open spaces. North Post, located directly
north of the airfield, consists of a collection of flight service facilities, housing, and administrative
buildings. The parade ground at the center of North Post remains an important visual and organizational

Chapter 3.0

3-21

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
element of that area. In 1941, the Army completed Hangar 1, located on the south edge of the parade
ground. Hangar 1 served as the installation’s headquarters and sheltered aircraft throughout the cold
weather testing program. Later, the Army used one-half of the hangar to prepare aircraft for transfer to
Soviet pilots. North Post is the original garrison built for the cold weather test detachment right before
the start of World War II. Once the war began, an additional runway, hangars, and other support
facilities were constructed south of the original runway. North Post continued to play a major role in all
activities at Ladd Field supporting the war effort, including the Lend-Lease Operations and the air depot
functions. North Post has the needed concentration, linkage, and continuity among its historically united
buildings and structures to form a historic district while continuing to retain a high degree of integrity.

Current Integrity of the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark
The Ladd Field NHL is significant for its association with a specific historic event or trend in history.
The property’s significance is best embodied in the integrity aspects of Location, Setting, Feeling, and
Association. These aspects are deemed most important because they more closely connect the built
environment (buildings, structures, and objects) to the associated historic events. The aspects of
Materials, Workmanship, and Design are secondary to the property’s significance.
Since Ladd Field was listed as an NHL in 1985, six of the 26 original contributing buildings have been
lost, including the Power and Heating Plant (Building 1561), the Community Center (Building 1560),
and a double hangar (Building 2106). In 1987, efforts to demolish one of the wartime Kodiak hangars
(Building 1542) with explosives resulted in a second hangar (Building 1543) catching fire. As a result,
both buildings were completely destroyed (Thompson, 1984a; Bittner, 1987). In August 2004, a fire,
with origins unknown, resulted in the destruction of Hangar 6 (Building 2085), a third wartime
Birchwood hangar built at Ladd Field. Since 1945, 18 new buildings have been constructed within the
NHL boundaries, most of which are located in the southeastern section of the district (Design Alaska
and JCA, 2011).
Although changes have occurred over time, the Ladd Field NHL currently retains sufficient integrity to
convey its historic significance. The following paragraphs describe each aspect of integrity as currently
retained by the Ladd Field NHL. Three integrity degree descriptors are used in the following
discussion: high, medium, and low.
Location—The Ladd Field NHL continues to possess a high degree of integrity of Location because it
is still located where it was originally constructed and where the historic events of cold weather testing
and World War II occurred.

3-22

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Setting—The Ladd Field NHL possesses a high degree of integrity of Setting as seen by the planned
development of the original garrison in North Post, as well as in the associated airfield components.
North Post is an example of how Setting can be created by the spatial relationships between buildings
and how the original garrison was oriented to create a specific shape (the horseshoe). Setting can also
be observed in the landscape surrounding the Ladd Field NHL, which is flat and has a minimum
amount of vegetation as would be expected from an area along an active airfield. In addition, the flat,
horizontal runways are still retained and so is the orientation of the airfield just south of and running
parallel to a distinctive and anchoring land feature, Birch Hill.
Feeling—The Ladd Field NHL possesses a high degree of integrity of Feeling, which essentially is the
sum of all aspects of integrity. This is easily understood within North Post, the original garrison because
its historic sense of a particular period of time can be easily observed and understood. This area
comprises a concentration of buildings that are united historically and aesthetically through their
physical arrangement and visual connections.
Association—The Ladd Field NHL possesses a high degree of Association primarily because of events
that occurred in North Post. The vast majority of activities associated with cold weather testing and the
transfer of aircraft to the Russians were conducted within buildings around North Post. During the war,
the interior of Hangar 1 (which is the southernmost anchor of North Post) was divided in half with one
side housing Russian maintenance operations and the other side housing the Cold Weather Test
Detachment. Also, transient Russian and American pilots were housed in Building 1051 and Building
1049, and the Commander of the Cold Weather Test Detachment lived in Quarters 1. Hangar 1 also
functioned as the Command Headquarters overseeing air depot, Lend-Lease Operations, and cold
weather testing functions. Building 1024 housed vital communication functions during the war.
Building 1541, an aircraft maintenance shop, was built during the war to most likely support LendLease Operations and air depot functions. Hangars 2 and 3, located south of the runway, also contribute
to Association. They are the last remaining hangars built during the war to support the war effort. The
main purpose of these hangars was to support the air depot functions of the installation with commercial
flights and maintenance needs. They were associated with Lend-Lease Operations too, in that American
pilots who ferried the planes from Great Falls, Montana, took commercial flights leaving out of Hangar
2 initially and later Hangar 3 for their return trips.
Materials—Currently, there is a low degree of integrity of Materials present within the Ladd Field
NHL. The majority of the original windows and roofs have been replaced with substitute materials that
have over time eroded the Material integrity of the Ladd Field NHL. The copper roofs on the North

Chapter 3.0

3-23

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Post’s administrative buildings and housing have been removed and most of the original siding has
been replaced or covered by vinyl siding. Some historic material is still present in the Ladd Field NHL,
especially in Hangar 1, which still retains the historic massive interior doors used during World War II
to divide the hangar into separate areas for U.S. and Russian operations.
Workmanship—The Ladd Field NHL retains a medium degree of this aspect of integrity primarily due
to the presence of the many permanent structures located in the North Post area. Within North Post,
Workmanship is exhibited throughout the design and construction of the utilidors, which were an
engineering feat for their time, as well as the North Runway. Both the utilidors and North Runway were
adapted to local permafrost conditions by using specialized concrete mixes and engineering
applications. Hangars 2 and 3 were constructed from a standard design that was used in many military
installations in Alaska. The hangars, therefore, have a low degree of Workmanship that was common
for semi-permanent and temporary facilities built during the war. As a result, the hangars do not
significantly contribute to this aspect of Ladd Field NHL’s integrity.
Design—The Ladd Field NHL retains a high degree of integrity of Design. North Post was designed as
a pre-World War II test station and airfield. The majority of the buildings that comprise North Post
were designed to be permanent structures and were placed in symmetrical order with the orientation of
the buildings circling the parade ground and radiating outward from the horseshoe shape created by
Freeman Road. Hangars 2 and 3 also contribute to Design; however, they exemplify the hurried,
utilitarian military style of intense construction that occurred during World War II in support of the war
effort. Although now surrounded by roads on the west and south and administrative space to the east,
the hangars were originally surrounded by Quonset Huts and other temporary structures.

3.3.1.2

Ladd Air Force Base Cold War Historic District

In 2010, the USAG FWA determined that the Cold War Historic District was eligible for listing in the
National Register due to its association with the strategic air reconnaissance, air defense, and Arctic
research missions of the Cold War and specifically for its role in the early Cold War defense mission of
the 46th/72nd Air Reconnaissance Unit and Fighter Intercept Squadrons (Meeks, no date; Bittner,
2010). The USAG FWA identified 36 contributing resources in the Cold War Historic District.
During the Cold War, Ladd AFB served as the Alaska Air Command Headquarters for all the territory
north of the Alaska Range. Ladd AFB was significantly associated with strategic aerial reconnaissance,
air defense operations, and Arctic research (Price and Sackett, 2001). When the Army assumed control
of the installation in 1961 and renamed it Fort Wainwright, operations became devoted to Army Cold

3-24

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
War missions, such as aviation, training, and ground defense. During the Cold War period, Hangars 2
and 3 housed fighter intercept squadrons as part of the Aircraft Control and Warning System.
The Cold War Historic District largely comprises the same contributing resources as the Ladd Field
NHL, including Hangars 2 and 3, with the addition of several buildings surrounding the airfield that
were built during the early Cold War (see Figure 1-4).

Current Integrity of the Cold War Historic District
The Cold War Historic District retains all the same aspects of integrity in the same degree as the Ladd
Field NHL, except it retains a medium degree of integrity of Materials, and its Association is based on
Cold War events, rather than World War II events. Location, Setting, Feeling, and Association are
deemed the most important aspects of the Cold War Historic District’s integrity because they more
closely connect the built environment (buildings, structures, and objects) to the associated historic
events.

3.3.1.3

Hangars 2 and 3

Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing resources to both the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic
District for their roles in the military defense mission. Located along the southern boundaries of the
Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District, they are a set of twin Birchwood hangars with
distinctive barrel-shaped roofs that were authorized for construction in 1943 and were completed the
following year as part of the World War II expansion of Ladd Field. During World War II, the Army
used Hangars 2 and 3 as maintenance hangars, providing service to various aircraft including bombers,
light bombers, and fighter planes. In addition, the Army used Hangar 2 as a parachute and cold weather
testing sewing shop and Hangar 3 as a passenger terminal.
The hangars are approximately 200 feet wide by 202 feet long and nearly 60 feet in height. The airfield
apron to the north and paved parking on the east, west, and south sides surround the hangars.
Montgomery Road extends along the south side of the site, and Meridian Road is located to the west.
With their massing, height, and distinctive barrel roofs, the hangars are the last remaining anchor for the
southwest corner of the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District. They are also a significant part
of the visual connections within certain portions of the historic districts and contribute to the setting
within this area of the cantonment. Hangar 2 and 3 were built during World War II to support the war
effort along with two other Birchwood hangars in the southeastern corner of the district (Hangars 5 and
6 are no longer extant). The two sets of Birchwood hangars anchored the southern corners of the airfield
with access to the newly created South Runway. When Ladd Field was designated as an NHL in 1985,

Chapter 3.0

3-25

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Hangars 2, 3, and 6 were extant. Hangar 6 (Building 2085) was destroyed by fire in 2004. Recent
construction actions within this portion of the Ladd Field NHL have occurred, further affecting the
visual relationship between North Post and Hangars 2 and 3 by obscuring much of the viewshed
(CH2M HILL, Inc., 2009; Army, 2009).
Hangars 2 and 3 are similar to one another in design, construction methods, and building materials. The
structures, which are oriented east-to-west, are set on a concrete foundation, are of wood frame
construction and are clad on the exterior with corrugated metal siding. While the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) Seattle District Engineer designed the hangars they were named after Birchwood
Airfield near Anchorage, Alaska, which was the site of the first such hangar. This hangar design is
distinctive for its use of wooden bowstring trusses, which create the large barrel-shaped roof (Figure 3-2).
Several Birchwood hangars were constructed during World War II at U.S. aircraft facilities, for both the
Army and the U.S. Department of the Navy (Miller, 2010; Ross, 1969; Eielson Air Force Base, no date;
Envirosphere Company, 1988). The use of wooden trusses rather than steel trusses likely was a result of
wartime construction material shortages.
Figure 3-2: Barrel-Shaped Roofs of Hangars 2 and 3

Source: Army
Because of the use of wooden trusses, the hangars were categorized as semi-permanent structures. As
noted in Section 1.1.3, semi-permanent facilities were intended for use during the war, but had a limited
life expectancy afterward. A 1977 Building Information Schedule for facilities at Fort Wainwright
advised that without “major work” to extend the building life, the hangars would become unusable in
1983 and recommended replacement at that point in time (Dickinson-Oswald-Walch-Lee
Engineers/Maynard NBBJ Alaska, 1977). The fact that no large-scale rehabilitation occurred since the
1977 report indicates these facilities have outlived their expected lifespan by nearly 30 years.

3-26

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Although no large-scale rehabilitation of either Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 has taken place, significant
maintenance efforts, as well as material alterations, have occurred over the years. Because of their
construction, semi-permanent buildings are expected to require a moderate to high level of maintenance
(Dickinson-Oswald-Walch-Lee Engineers/Maynard NBBJ Alaska, 1977). Activities at Hangars 2 and 3
included, but were not limited to, upgrades to the hangar doors (1960, 1962, and 1979), repairs to roof
trusses (1973 and 1984), roof repairs (1950, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1991, and 1996), exterior frame wall
repairs (1974), and installation of new fire protection (1978, 1986) and heating systems (1971 and 1983,
1993). Major alterations to the buildings have resulted in the replacement of the original hangar doors
(1989), windows (1971, 2001), siding (1974), and roofing materials (1970, 1986). Hangar tenants and
office occupants have performed other alterations not noted above. Such alterations include the removal
or compromise of inter-column braces on each wall of the main hangar bay; these braces are considered
an essential component of the hangars’ lateral resistance system (LBG, 2008; Design Alaska and JCA,
2011).

3.3.1.4

Summary of Completed Mitigation Relating to Ladd Field NHL and Cold War
Historic District

In the past, mission-related projects have resulted in adverse effects on historic resources at Fort
Wainwright, including the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District. In each of these
instances, the USAG FWA signed Section 106 Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) and Programmatic
Agreements with the Alaska SHPO and other consulting parties. These documents are summarized in
Table 3-8.
These mitigation efforts have focused on the maintenance of resources in the Ladd Field NHL and Cold
War Historic District, the compilation of documentation on historic properties, and the availability of
additional public outreach materials. Traditional mitigation measures, such as architectural and
historical documentation, development of historic contexts, development of teaching plans, and public
outreach efforts, have been completed for actions affecting the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic
District, including actions specifically affecting Hangars 2 and 3. These mitigation measures are
outlined in Appendix H.

In 1986, Historic American Building Survey Level 1 documentation was completed as mitigation for
the ongoing use and management of the Ladd Field NHL. This documentation resulted in the
completion of large-format photography and historical data pages for Hangars 2, 3, and 6. The USAG
FWA mitigated demolition of the hangars as part of a previous action that resulted in the Memorandum
of Agreement among the U.S. Department of the Army, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
and the Alaska State Historic Preservation Officer Regarding United States Army Alaska Demolition of
Buildings in the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark, signed on May 23, 2001. All mitigation
associated with this MOA was completed, but the MOA was later terminated prior to execution of the
demolition of the hangars.
In 2006, the USAG FWA contracted for a Conditions Assessment and Rehabilitation Plans Report
(LBG, 2008) to identify potential reuses of Hangars 2 and 3 that would meet current and future
anticipated mission needs associated with the projected move of the Aviation Task Force to Fort
Wainwright. The report analyzed reuse of the hangars for warm storage or offices, as well as a layaway
plan for the hangars, and provided cost estimates for the potential actions. Mitigation for Aviation
Stationing in 2009, which proposed new construction in the Ladd Field NHL and potential changes in
use for Hangars 2 and 3, resulted in the completion of a Reuse Study for the hangars, as well as an
update to the Historic American Building Survey documentation (Army, 2009). The latter project is

3-28

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
ongoing. Between 2010 and 2012, as a part of mitigation for the removal of the shed roof overhangs on
Hangars 2 and 3, the Army collected additional photographs and architectural drawings of the
overhangs, developed a Maintenance Component of its Integrated Cultural Resources Management
Plan, and required the approval from consulting parties if the overhangs were replaced rather than
repaired.
The USAG FWA is currently implementing numerous other mitigation actions through agreements with
the Alaska SHPO, the ACHP, the NPS, and other consulting parties. Extensive public outreach
programs have been developed that highlight the history of Ladd Field and Fort Wainwright, as well as
Fort Wainwright’s role in the Fairbanks community. The USAG FWA staff has been trained in the
management of historic properties to ensure sensitivity with regard to maintenance of historic buildings
and the retention of historic fabric. The USAG FWA Cultural Resources staff has developed a driving
tour of the installation that highlights the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District and prepared
a tri-fold public interpretation pamphlet on the Cold War Historic District and a public presentation on
Cold War history at Fort Wainwright. Design guidelines for new construction in the Ladd Field NHL
have been developed to preserve the integrity of the NHL, as well as that of the Cold War Historic
District.
As noted above, recent new construction activities in the southern portion of the Ladd Field NHL and
Cold War Historic District have resulted in the execution of agreement documents to mitigate the
impacts to the historic visual connection between North Post and Hangars 2 and 3. These impacts were
mitigated through the 2009 Programmatic Agreement among the U.S. Department of the Army, the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the Alaska State Historic Preservation Officer
Regarding Aviation Stationing (Army, 2009).

3.3.2

Environmental Consequences

As noted in Section 3.3.1, for NEPA purposes, the ROI for impacts is the same as the APE, which
includes the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District.
Implementing a disposition for Hangars 2 and 3 involves two historic properties: the Ladd Field NHL
and the Cold War Historic District. Hangars 2 and 3 possess historic significance for their status as
contributing resources to these two historic districts. The hangars are not individually eligible for listing
in the National Register because they do not possess sufficient significance independent of their
associations with the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold War Historic District. In addition, numerous material
alterations have significantly diminished the integrity of the hangars.

Chapter 3.0

3-29

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
The impacts to cultural resources from the Proposed Action are twofold: the loss of the hangars as
contributing resources within the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District, and the impact of the
loss of the two contributing resources to the integrity of the two districts. The following analysis,
therefore, provides a two-tiered approach to evaluating the impacts of both alternatives.

3.3.2.1

Significance Criteria

For the purposes of assessing the degree of the impacts related to cultural resources, the following
thresholds were developed:
•

None—No measurable impacts are expected to occur.

•

Minor to Moderate (not significant)—The degree to which activities would affect the Ladd
Field NHL or the Cold War Historic District but would not cause either the physical loss of a
contributing resource or the reduction in the integrity of the district to such a degree that it
would lose its designation as a historic property.

•

Severe (significant)—Activities that would adversely affect the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold
War Historic District by causing either the physical loss of a contributing resource or the
reduction in integrity of the district to such a degree that it would lose its designation as a
historic property.

All adverse impacts are considered long term because historic properties cannot be recreated.

3.3.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under this alternative, the Army would demolish both hangars. The loss of the hangars as contributing
resources to the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District would be a severe impact because
the two resources would lose their ability to convey their historic significance. Loss of contributing
resources within a National Register district generally is significant because the physical fabric of the
district is eroded.
Despite the physical loss of Hangars 2 and 3, the impacts to the overall integrity of the Ladd Field NHL
and Cold War Historic District would be moderate. Even with the loss of the two hangars, the Ladd
Field NHL and Cold War Historic District would continue to contain a large number of original
contributing resources and, thus, retain their overall integrity and continue to convey their historical
significance. An analysis of impacts to each aspect of integrity for the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War
Historic District is summarized in Table 3-9.

As noted in Sections 3.3.1.1 and 3.3.1.2, the Ladd Field NHL retains a low degree of integrity of Materials,
while the Cold War Historic District retains a medium level of integrity of Materials.

Location—Under Alternative 1, the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District degree of integrity
for Location would not be affected because the historic districts would not be moved and would remain
located where they were originally constructed and where the historic events of cold weather testing,
World War II, and the Cold War occurred.
Setting—Alternative 1 would affect two elements of Setting: the visual connections within certain
portions of the landmark and the hangars themselves. With the loss of the two hangars, the visual
connection between the original North Post area and the hangars would be lost. The loss of the hangars
would alter other views looking within or out from the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic
District. By losing the hangars, the Setting of the southwest corner would be changed because it would
no longer reflect the familiar World War II-era physical environment produced by the presence of the
two large and visually dominate hangars. Although this loss would have a moderate impact on this
aspect of integrity, it would not alter the high degree of Setting that the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War
Historic District would retain overall. Previous new construction has resulted in past impacts obscuring
the views from the North Post to the southwest corner of the districts; however, more significant views

Chapter 3.0

3-31

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
within the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District would be retained, including those in the
North Post area.
Feeling—The aspect of Feeling is created by the combination of the six other aspects of integrity.
Because the loss of the hangars under Alternative 1 would affect Setting, Association, Materials, and
Design, it would also have a moderate impact to Feeling within the southwest corner of the Ladd Field
NHL and the Cold War Historic District. Even with this impact, a high degree of Feeling would
continue to exist within the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District because the area that
most expresses this aspect of integrity is the North Post.
Association—Alternative 1 would cause a moderate impact to the integrity of Association through the
loss of the two hangars. Although the hangars were historically associated with the air depot and LendLease Operations, the Ladd Field NHL would still retain a high degree of Association because the vast
majority of activities associated with cold weather testing and the transfer of aircraft to the Russians
occurred in North Post. Associations with Cold War operations would remain intact.
Materials—Alternative 1 would cause a moderate impact to the integrity of Materials because of the
loss of the wooden bowstring trusses used in the construction of Hangars 2 and 3. This is a material that
is only found within these two contributing resources of the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic
District.
Workmanship—Hangars 2 and 3 are a standard design that was used on many military installations in
Alaska; therefore, they possess a low degree of Workmanship associated with semi-permanent and
temporary wartime construction. Therefore, the loss of the hangars would not affect the integrity of
Workmanship within the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold War Historic District.
Design—Alternative 1 would cause a moderate impact to Design as an aspect of integrity because of
the loss of contributing resources that exemplify the type of design found during the war effort of
World War II. Even with the loss of Hangars 2 and 3, the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic
District would continue to retain a high degree of integrity for Design through the planned, formally
designed, largely intact North Post.
Although the loss of the hangars would affect five of the seven aspects of integrity, none of the five are
affected to a severe (significant) degree (see Table 3-9). The impacts do not diminish the overall degree
of any aspect of integrity of the Ladd Field NHL or Cold War Historic District. This analysis is based
on the uniqueness of the Hangars 2 and 3 as compared to the rest of the Ladd Field NHL’s contributing
buildings. The hangars are theatre-of-operations, standard-designed buildings, constructed to support

3-32

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
the war effort. The rest of the contributing buildings within the Ladd Field NHL are located in North
Post, and all but one were built just prior to the war. They are permanent structures with a higher degree
of integrity of Design, Workmanship, and Materials than Hangars 2 and 3. Setting and Feeling are more
apparent in North Post than in the southwest corner where Hangars 2 and 3 are located. Also, the
buildings in North Post are more closely associated with the Cold Weather Test Detachment and the
Lend-Lease Operations. The hangars are very different resources from the rest of the contributing
resources within the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District, so the integrity held by those
North Post-contributing buildings would still be retained and would not be significantly affected by the
loss of the hangars. Likewise, the Cold War Historic District retains its integrity and the majority of the
contributing resources that are central to that district’s historical significance. Even with the loss of
Hangars 2 and 3, the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District would retain the identity for
which they are historically significant. Thus, impacts to these cultural resources as a result of
Alternative 1 are expected to be moderate and not significant.
In summary, although Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold
War Historic District, the demolition of these two hangars would not affect any of the seven aspects of
integrity to the degree that the integrity of the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold War Historic District would
change. Both historic districts would retain sufficient integrity to convey their historical significance.
In November 2011, the USAG FWA initiated Section 106 consultation with the Alaska SHPO and other
consulting parties because the Proposed Action would result in adverse impacts to the Ladd Field NHL
and the Cold War Historic District. Through this consultation, an MOA (Appendix A) was drafted that
includes mitigation for these impacts. Because of the large amount of previous mitigation associated
with Hangars 2 and 3 (see Section 3.3.1.4), the Army has determined that a reduced amount of
additional mitigation is appropriate to compensate for the adverse effects of the Proposed Action. As
agreed upon through the Section 106 consultation process, the mitigation would focus on using existing
documentation to further goals and objectives for public outreach concerning Fort Wainwright’s
historic properties, mainly the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District.
Details of the mitigation efforts are provided in the MOA (Appendix A), but the stipulations are
summarized below.
•

Public Outreach—In pursuit of more visibility and appreciation for the Ladd Field NHL, the
USAG FWA Cultural Resources staff would be available upon request to present lectures to
local Fairbanks groups (military and/or non-military) on Fort Wainwright’s World War II
history. The staff would engage the public through previously developed publications and

Chapter 3.0

3-33

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
would submit articles on historic preservation efforts at Fort Wainwright in local and state
publications, websites, and newspapers. Starting six months after the execution of the MOA
and continuing for five years, the USAG FWA would update and seek input from consulting
parties on the public outreach projects.
•

Re-evaluation of the Ladd Field NHL—The USAG FWA would complete a re-evaluation of
the NHL through preparation of a revised draft NHL nomination, including an analysis of
cumulative effects on the Ladd Field NHL from previous demolitions and additions. The
USAG FWA would submit the appropriate documentation to the NPS Alaska Region, which
would then coordinate with the NHL Program in Washington, D.C. If Alternative 1 were
selected, the USAG FWA would submit the re-evaluation documentation within five years after
demolition of the hangars. If the No Action Alternative were chosen, the USAG FWA would
submit the documentation within five years from the execution of the MOA.

•

Stewardship of the Ladd Field NHL—With the expected loss of Hangars 2 and 3, the USAG
FWA would refocus the efforts of its Public Works staff on effective stewardship through
focused and purposeful management of the remaining elements that comprise the NHL. The
USAG FWA would use existing and currently planned documentation to further historic
preservation objectives and goals including, but not limited to, using the already developed
Design Guidelines for the Ladd Field NHL, the educational PowerPoint presentations on
historic preservation subjects, and the currently planned, but not yet developed, Historic
Buildings Assessment Report. Within one year of completing the Historic Buildings
Assessment Report for the Ladd Field NHL, recommendations from the report would be
submitted for consideration in the Directorate of Public Works Annual Work Plan.

The USAG FWA Cultural Resources staff is responsible for completing these mitigation efforts and
ensuring that the agreed-upon benchmarks are met within the time frames specified in the MOA. If any
signatory party to the MOA objects to any mitigation actions proposed or the manner in which the
terms of the MOA are implemented, a process for dispute resolution is available to all parties (see
Appendix A, MOA, Stipulation IV).

3.3.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

As noted in Section 2.4.2, the No Action Alternative would likely result in the loss of both hangars
through either the catastrophic structural failure of the buildings or possibly by fire. Therefore, the
impacts of the No Action Alternative would be the same as the impacts for Alternative 1 (Demolition)
because the end state of the hangars (physical loss) is the same; the impacts under the No Action
Alternative would just occur at a later time while the impacts from Alternative 1 would be immediate.

3-34

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
The likely structural failure of both of the hangars would be a severe impact because two contributing
resources to the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District would lose their ability to convey their
historical significance. However, the No Action Alternative would result in only a moderate impact to
the integrity of the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District. The loss of the hangars would not
significantly affect any of the seven aspects of integrity to the degree that the overall integrity of either
the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold War Historic District would change (see Table 3-9). Both historic
properties would retain sufficient integrity to convey their historical significance.
As agreed upon by the consulting parties in the MOA developed through the Section 106 consultation
process, mitigation under the No Action Alternative for the eventual loss of the hangars would be the
same as for Alternative 1, except that the documentation for the re-evaluation of the Ladd Field NHL
would be submitted to the NPS Alaska Region within five years after the execution of the MOA instead
of within five years of the demolition of the hangars. Also similar to Alternative 1, because of the large
amount of previous mitigation associated with Hangars 2 and 3, the mitigation measures agreed to as
part of the MOA focus on using existing documentation to further public outreach goals concerning
Fort Wainwright’s historic properties. This mitigation would compensate for the adverse effects of the
Proposed Action.

3.4

Hazardous Materials/Hazardous Waste

The potential impacts hazardous materials and hazardous waste can have on human health and the
environment largely depend on their types, quantities, toxicities, and associated management practices.
There is cause for concern if the use or exposure of these substances violates applicable federal, state,
or local laws and/or regulations, including potential non-compliance with Army guidelines and policies
for handling hazardous materials and waste.
The following provides a summary of federal, Army, and state laws, regulations, and guidelines related
to hazardous materials and hazardous waste at Fort Wainwright.

Federal

The Installation Restoration Program (IRP) is the DoD’s program designed to identify,
characterize, and remediate environmental contamination on military installations. The
program was implemented in response to CERCLA requirements to remediate sites that
posed a health threat. Section 211 of Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
amended CERCLA and established the Defense Environmental Restoration Program that
ensures that DoD agencies have the right to conduct their environmental restoration
programs.

•

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 USC §§6901–6992k and 40 CFR
§§260–272 as related to hazardous waste management)—The RCRA requires the systematic
tracking of all hazardous waste from cradle-to-grave. This hazardous waste tracking system
mandates the collection and retention of key information, including the generator of the waste,
how the waste is routed to the receiving facility, a description of the waste, the quantity of the
waste, identification of the facility that receives the waste, and other relevant data. The RCRA
Corrective Action Program requires responsible parties of active facilities to investigate and
clean up hazardous waste releases.

•

Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 USC §2601 et seq.; 40 CFR §§700–723; 40 CFR
§§745–766; 40 CFR §§790–799)—The TSCA addresses concerns regarding chemical
substances and mixtures whose manufacturing and use may pose an unreasonable risk of injury,
adverse health, or adverse environmental consequences. Toxic chemical substances regulated
under TSCA include asbestos, lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and as well as numerous
other substances.

•

Oil Pollution Act (OPA) (33 USC § 2701 et seq.)—The OPA requires oil storage facilities to
develop plans describing how spills or releases would be addressed. Specifically, OPA requires
that facilities prepare and implement spill prevention, control, and countermeasures plans and
facility response plans. These plans specify how these facilities would assess and respond to
spills/releases.

•

Pollution Prevention Act (42 United State Code §13101 et seq.)—The Pollution Prevention Act
focuses on pollution source(s) reduction and promotes the implementation of new and
innovative practices to conserve and protect natural resources. These measures may include, but

State of Alaska
Title 18, Environmental Conservation, of the Alaska Administrative Code contains the criteria for
management, generation, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials and waste. The State of Alaska
also oversees the DoD CERCLA sites via implementation of ADEC’s regulatory responsibilities of
oversight on contaminated site cleanup work to ensure that sites are cleaned up to meet state standards
and to protect human health, safety, welfare, and the environment.

3.4.1

Affected Environment

The ROI for hazardous materials and hazardous waste includes the demolition footprint for Hangars 2
and 3 and the aircraft apron construction footprint. The ROI also includes the Fort Wainwright and
FNSB landfills because of the disposal of the demolition debris, which would include hazardous
materials and hazardous waste.

3.4.1.1

Hazardous Waste Generation, Storage and Disposal

Fort Wainwright is a large-quantity generator of hazardous waste that comes from training, aircraft,
vehicles, and maintenance, and generally consists of petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POLs), solvents,
paints, and adhesives (CH2M HILL, Inc., 2009). The USAG FWA is registered with the USEPA, per
RCRA, with the facility identification number AK6210022426. Current policy stipulates that DoD
facilities will use materials that are the most environmentally suitable and least damaging as long as the
materials meet the criteria and specifications for a given task. USARAK 200-1 Pamphlet governs all
aspects of managing hazardous materials/regulated waste by both military and civilian personnel, at all
USARAK facilities, including Fort Wainwright. The Army recycles metal, fuel, oil, batteries and
antifreeze (CH2M HILL, Inc., 2009).

3.4.1.2

Site and Soil Contamination

Fort Wainwright is on the National Priorities List (NPL) under CERCLA. The NPL specifies national
priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or
contaminants throughout the United States and its territories. The Fort Wainwright NPL site comprises

3-38

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
six Operable Units (USAG FWA, 2011b). Twelve source areas have been identified within these six
Operable Units, and several have been further divided into sub-areas. A Federal Facility Agreement
between the USEPA, the ADEC, and the Army sets deadlines, objectives, responsibilities, and
procedural frameworks for implementing an IRP.
Hangars 2 and 3 are not within an IRP site; however, an area adjacent to Hangar 3 within the proposed
boundaries of Aviation Task Force Military Construction, Army, Site Number CC-FTW-103 is in the
process of being designated as an IRP site (Fish, 2012). As shown in Figure 3-3, the area is
approximately 124 feet east of Hangar 3 (USAG FWA, 2012a). A preliminary site evaluation conducted
in 2008 found contamination exceeding ADEC criteria in subsurface soils. During follow-up
investigations in 2010, concentrations of trichloroethene, vinyl chloride, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5trimethylbenzene,

diesel

range

organic

compounds,

gasoline

range

organic

compounds,

benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluroanthene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, and dieldrin were detected above the
ADEC cleanup criteria in soil samples collected from 1 to 10 feet below ground surface (Fish, 2012).
Concentrations of contaminants in groundwater did not exceed the ADEC groundwater cleanup levels.
In 2011, approximately 660 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed from the site. One soil
sample with results of diesel range organic compounds (645 milligrams per kilograms [mg/kg])
exceeding the ADEC cleanup criteria remains in the area at 4 feet below ground surface due to the
proximity to a buried utility corridor. No other sample results above ADEC cleanup criteria remain in
the area.
Another IRP site, FTWW-018 (location of former Building 3009), is approximately 74 feet from the
southwest corner of Hangar 2. The area was the location of Building 3009, a temporary building used as
a wood shop that was demolished in 2001 (CH2M HILL, Inc., 2009). The site received a no further
action determination from the USEPA and is now closed with Institutional Controls in place (USAG
FWA, 2012a).
As discussed, Hangars 2 and 3 are not within an IRP site (CH2M HILL, Inc., 2009); however, based on
the hangars’ historical use for aircraft maintenance during World War II, it is assumed that spills from
the day-to-day activities of the previous functions are on the floors of the buildings, the parking lot, and
in the soil in the area. The majority of these undocumented, historical spills are assumed to be of grade
115/145 aviation gasoline, which contained significant amounts of tetra-ethyl lead (Griffin, 2013a). The
other substance spilled is assumed to be of grade 80/87 aviation gasoline (also contained tetra-ethyl
lead) that was used in ground support equipment and military vehicles. In addition, it is assumed that

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
there were releases of POLs, such as hydraulic oils, lubricants, greases, and also solvents, used in
aircraft maintenance (Griffin, 2013a). Although chemical sampling has not been conducted in the
project area itself, chemical samples were collected in association with other projects by the USACE
and Jacobs Engineering in the southeastern area adjacent to the project site. Those samplings showed
exceedances of ADEC cleanup criteria for trichloroethene, chloroform, and diesel range organic
compounds (Jacobs, 2012).
The USAG FWA has documented records of more recent spills from 1996 to the present (Griffin,
2013b). These recent spills, including JP-4 and JP-8 (jet fuels), antifreeze, hydraulic fluids, engine oil,
and mercury, were cleaned up per the Alaska State standards, which are more stringent than federal
standards (Griffin, 2013c).
Between Hangars 2 and 3, there is a small open, flammable liquids storage facility that the Army would
demolish under Alternative 1. The facility was historically used for hazardous (flammable liquids)
material storage by aviation units assigned to the hangars. It is currently unused and empty except for a
small amount of refuse (Gray, 2013). Additionally, the Army would remove two above-ground installed
oil water separators associated with the hangars.
The USAG FWA actively manages use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste
through the development and implementation of plans to eliminate or reduce products that pose
environmental risk. Any project that involves excavation or movement of soils must include field
screening for petroleum products (plus any other identified contaminants). Soils exhibiting readings less
than 20 parts per million (ppm) are considered clean and may be reused on site or disposed of in
accordance with the scope of work for the specific project.

3.4.1.3

Asbestos Containing Building Materials, Lead-based Paint, and Other
Hazardous Materials

In October 2011, the USACE conducted Hazardous, Toxic, Radiological Waste (HTRW) assessment
surveys of Hangars 2 and 3 (USACE, 2012a,b). The surveys constituted of an inspection of the
buildings to identify and assess all accessible asbestos containing building materials (ACBM), leadbased paint (LBP), and other hazardous materials at the hangars. The results of the surveys were
provided for demolition bidding purposes only. The following sections present brief summaries of the
findings from the 2011 HTRW assessment surveys and other previous surveys.

Chapter 3.0

3-41

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Asbestos Containing Building Materials
Asbestos is a naturally occurring fibrous mineral, and the most common types of asbestos are chrysotile
(white) and amosite (brown/off-white). Because it is fire-resistant, resists many chemicals, and is an
excellent insulator, asbestos was added to a variety of building materials and other products and was
routinely used in buildings constructed prior to 1980. These materials included pipe insulation, floor
tiles, cement siding, and wall/ceiling coverings. As long as the ACBM remains non-friable and in good
condition, it is not considered a health risk. Because of the age of Hangars 2 and 3, they are sources for
ACBM and present health and safety concerns for construction and building maintenance personnel
when performing maintenance actions that could disturb this substance.
The 2011 HTRW assessment survey found asbestos in wallboard joint compound; sheet flooring; 9inch x 9-inch dark brown, light brown, and white floor tiles; and floor tile mastic in Hangar 3. The
survey in Hangar 2 found asbestos in floor tile mastic. It should be noted that the although every
reasonable attempt was made to locate all ACBM present in the areas surveyed, areas that were
inaccessible were addressed via extrapolation of conditions in accessible building space and a review of
building plans, specifications, or other building documents provided to USACE (USACE, 2012a,b).
Inaccessible areas included but were not limited to: within walls, within fire doors, enclosed pipe/duct
chases, inside mechanical equipment, behind inaccessible doors, inside utilidors, and underground
utilities.
During a 1997 asbestos survey, the Army found chrysotile in the black mastic (heavy adhesive used on
tile flooring) in the tile floor of Hangar 2 on the second floor; chrysotile, or white asbestos, is the most
commonly encountered form of asbestos (NTL, 1997). Chrysotile asbestos fibers were also found in
pipe insulation and pipe paint chips in the mechanical room of Hangar 2, during a subsequent 1998
asbestos survey (NTL, 1998). Chrysotile was found in Hangar 3 during the following asbestos surveys:
1991 for suspected asbestos in the all of all levels (USAG FWA, 1991) and 2003 in the black mastic in
the tile floor (NTL, 2003).
The USAG FWA manages asbestos in accordance with its 2007 Asbestos Management Plan, which was
developed in accordance with AR 200-1, to reduce the exposure of occupants and workers and to
ensure compliance with all federal laws, including NESHAP asbestos requirements and Army
regulations regarding asbestos management to identify, abate, and dispose of ACBM (USAG FWA,
2007a). According to the Asbestos Management Plan, any ACBM will be handled in accordance with
applicable USEPA and OSHA regulations by a licensed contractor. Per the requirements, the USAG
FWA will provide a written “Notification of Demolition and Renovation” to the USEPA Region 10

3-42

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Asbestos Coordinator 10 working days prior to beginning any work on an asbestos project. Currently,
ACBM resulting from renovation and demolition projects is disposed of at the Fort Wainwright landfill,
which is anticipated to close in September 2015. After the Fort Wainwright landfill closes, ACBM will
be disposed of at the FNSB landfill (Adams, 2013).

Lead and Lead-based Paint
LBP was used as coatings and finishes before the hazards associated with lead accumulation in children
were identified. Regulating of LBP began in 1978, long after Hangars 2 and 3 were constructed;
therefore, it is likely that the hangars contain LBP and pose health and safety concerns for construction
and building maintenance personnel. Activities such as sanding, scraping, manual demolition, abrasive
blasting, cutting, torching, or welding of LBP are trigger tasks that can result in significant worker and
community exposures. The federal definition of LBP is paint with greater than or equal to 1 milligram
per square centimeter (mg/cm2) lead (USEPA, 2000).
During the 2011 HTRW assessment surveys, the USAG FWA did not conduct LBP testing; however,
the technical memoranda for the surveys state that due to the age of the structure and type of
construction, it is assumed that all painted surfaces contain lead at some level. Other components of
Buildings 3005 and 3008 that may contain lead are lead plumbing vents on the roof.
During a 2010 LBP survey, the USAG FWA found various levels of LBP in Hangar 3, ranging from 0.9
mg/cm2 to 9.9 mg/cm2 (USAG FWA, 2010c). Although a LBP survey has not been conducted for
Hangar 2, it is assumed that the building also contains similar levels of LBP because of the similar
construction and renovation time frames as Hangar 3.
Army guidance for LBP in facilities requires that each installation must develop and implement a
management plan for identifying LBP, risk assessment, worker safety, worker training and certification,
and identification, evaluation, management, and abatement of LBP hazards in accordance with AR 42070, Facilities Engineering, Building and Structures. The USAG FWA’s 2007 Lead Based Paint
Management Plan (USAG FWA, 2007b) provides guidance for LBP removal for Fort Wainwright and
requires that LBP removal be conducted in accordance with applicable TSCA, OSHA and Army
regulations. All demolition or renovation projects are subject to the requirements of this plan.

Other Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Wastes
The 2011 HTRW assessment surveys noted other miscellaneous hazardous materials and hazardous
waste present in Hangars 2 and 3 (USACE, 2012a,b), including:
•

PCBs and lead in light ballasts in the fluorescent light fixtures located throughout the buildings
(magnetic ballasts can contain PCBs in both the start-up capacitor and the asphalt in which the
electronics are embedded, and electronic ballasts contain lead solder)

•

Mercury in the fluorescent lamps and thermostats located throughout the buildings

•

Glycol in the heating systems

•

Small amounts of radioisotopes in lights and smoke detectors

•

Lead-acids batteries located in the emergency light fixtures as well as the public address system
in the buildings

•

Chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants in drinking fountains and window air conditioner units

•

Dry chemical fire suppression systems in hazardous waste accumulation chambers

•

Miscellaneous containers of fuel, oil, cleaning solvents

•

Oil-water separators and associated piping

Other hazardous waste in the buildings includes aircraft exhaust emissions coated on the existing
insulation on the underside (interior surface) of roof decks surfaces (LBG, 2008). Additionally, there is
a potential for mold, mildew and bird guano in the buildings (USACE, 2012c). Inhalation of these
materials could present a hazard to workers.

Environmental Consequences
Significance Criteria

For the purposes of assessing the significance of impacts related to hazardous materials and hazardous
waste and other concerns, the following impact thresholds were developed:
•

None—No measurable impacts are expected to occur.

•

Minor to Moderate (not significant)—The degree to which activities increase the potential for
environmental or human exposure to hazardous materials and hazardous waste.

•

Severe (significant)—Activities that violate applicable regulations or that seriously threaten or
cause exposure to hazardous materials or hazardous waste capable of causing imminent and
substantial endangerment to human health and the environment would represent a significant
impact.

3.4.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, the USAG FWA would demolish Hangars 2 and 3 and their supporting
infrastructure and convert the building footprints into a concrete airfield apron. The USAG FWA would
dispose of the demolished hangar material either through recycling/reuse or in a landfill. As discussed
in Section 2.4.1, under Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, demolition would involve
removal of the hangars, totaling 24,016 cubic yards of non-hazardous debris; demolition of existing and
abandoned utilities not belonging to Doyon Utilities, totaling approximately 2,680 linear feet;
demolition of existing privately owned vehicle parking areas, lighting, head bolt outlets, and power
source, encompassing an area of approximately 3.3 acres; and demolition of the concrete building slabs
and foundations within 5 feet of the building, to a depth of 8 inches, totaling approximately 2,075 cubic
yards of non-hazardous debris. In addition, demolition of the small, open, flammable liquids storage
facility located between Hangars 2 and 3 would result in approximately 91 cubic yards of nonhazardous debris.
Demolition activities would be conducted per all applicable federal, state, Army, and installation
regulations, guidelines and management plans. The USAG FWA, through its contract, would provide
the demolition and construction contractor with the requirements for handling, removing, and disposing
of existing hazardous materials/hazardous waste in the buildings; and the requirements for the potential
use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste that would result during the demolition
and construction activities. As part of the contract, the contractor would be required to prepare and
submit a Hazardous Materials Abatement Work Plan to be approved by the USAG FWA for waste
containment, removal, and disposal of the hazardous materials and hazardous waste.
Under Alternative 1, the USAG FWA would demolish and remove materials within the hangars that
have been determined as containing ACBM. The USACE prepared building demolition estimate states
that Hangars 2 and 3 would each generate approximately 100 cubic yards of ACBM (USACE, 2012d).
Appropriately licensed and trained contractors would conduct the demolition and removal of the
hangars in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations, and in adherence to the USAG
FWA’s management plans. Per the USAG FWA’s Asbestos Management Plan, a licensed contractor
would be responsible for handling any ACBM in accordance with applicable USEPA and OSHA
regulations. Per NESHAP asbestos requirements, the USAG FWA would provide a written
“Notification of Demolition and Renovation” to the USEPA Region 10 Asbestos Coordinator 10
working days prior to beginning any work on an asbestos project. The ACBM would be transported, in
compliance with all applicable regulations, to the Fort Wainwright landfill for disposal. The toxicity
characteristic leaching procedure—a soil sample extraction method for chemical analysis employed as

Chapter 3.0

3-45

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
an analytical method to simulate leaching through a landfill—would be required during demolition for
disposal purposes. This testing methodology is used to determine if the waste is a regulated waste or
construction and demolition (C&D) waste.
Because of the historic functions of Hangars 2 and 3 and the contaminants found in adjacent areas, it is
assumed that floors (concrete) and the soils in the area contain POLs, trichloroethene, chloroform, and
diesel range organic compounds. Under Alternative 1, the USAG FWA would also demolish the small,
vacant, open flammable liquids storage facility. Because of the historic use of the area as storage for
hazardous materials, contaminants are likely to be present in the ground in the area. During grounddisturbing activities, the excavated soil must be screened for potential contaminants to include field
screening for petroleum products (plus any other identified contaminants). Soils exhibiting readings of
20 ppm or higher must be handled per requirements stated in the USAG FWA’s Environmental
Concerns for MILCON Projects, Appendix A, Handling / Management of Contaminated Soil (USAG
FWA, 2011c).
Because of the age of the structure and type of construction, it is assumed that all painted surfaces in the
hangars contain lead at some level. Although no testing was performed during the 2011 HTRW
assessment survey, a 2010 LBP survey of Hangar 3 found various levels of lead that exceeded the
USEPA threshold for the substance in paint, and it is assumed that Hangar 2 has similar levels of LBP.
Per the USAG FWA Lead based Paint Management Plan, appropriately licensed and trained contractors
would conduct LBP removal in accordance with applicable OSHA, ADEC, and Army regulations.
These regulations require the contractor to provide appropriate engineering controls, medical
surveillance, personal protective equipment in lieu of a negative exposure assessment, air monitoring,
and training necessary to work in lead areas. LBP waste from buildings that are demolished would
require disposal in accordance with the USEPA, Army, ADEC, and USAG FWA regulations and
requirements and would be disposed of at the FNSB Landfill. LBP waste would require a toxicity
characteristic leaching procedure sample during the demolition to determine whether the waste is a
regulated waste or a C&D waste.
The building demolition estimates prepared by the USACE anticipate that Hangars 2 and 3 would each
generate approximately 500 cubic yards of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including the LBP
waste that would be disposed of at the FNSB landfill. The other hazardous materials and hazardous
waste include:
•

Equipment that contains PCBs

•

Mercury

•

Glycol

•

Radioisotopes

•

Lead-acids batteries

•

Chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants

•

Dry chemical fire suppression systems and containers of fuel, oil, cleaning solvents

•

Oil-water separators and associated piping

Hazardous waste also includes the interior surface of roof decks surfaces coated with aircraft exhaust
emissions. To ensure the protection of workers and the environment, the hazardous materials and
hazardous waste would be removed, transported, and disposed of in compliance with applicable federal,
state, Army, and USAG FWA regulations, as well as FNSB landfill requirements.
In the event that mold, mildew, and bird guano are found in the buildings, the contractor would be
required to perform abatement, debris removal, and demolition activities in a manner that prevents
exposure of workers to airborne pathogens and biological matter. The contractor would be required to
properly remove the contaminants prior to building demolition and would be responsible for the lawful
collection, characterization, and disposal of all biological matter on surfaces in accordance with the
USEPA regulations. Prior to the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, the USAG FWA would conduct
appropriate surveys to further verify and confirm the presence and extent of the hazardous materials and
hazardous waste.
The proposed demolition and concrete airfield apron construction is not expected to affect the
contaminated area adjacent to Hangar 3 because these activities would be conducted within the
footprint of the existing hangar and would not be conducted within the area of known contamination.
If additional hazardous materials and hazardous waste that have not been identified are encountered
during demolition activities and if those substances could be hazardous to human health upon
disturbance, the contractor would be required to stop that portion of work and notify the Contracting
Officer immediately. The USAG FWA would then determine in a timely manner if the material is
hazardous. If the material is not hazardous or poses no danger, the USAG FWA would direct the
contractor to proceed without change. If material is hazardous and handling of the material is necessary
to accomplish the work, the USAG FWA would issue an appropriate modification to the contract.
While no known underground storage tanks are known to exist on the project site, if any underground
storage tanks are discovered during demolition, their removal would be conducted in compliance with
federal and state regulations, and any contaminated soils would be remediated.

Chapter 3.0

3-47

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Under Alternative 1, only minor impacts are anticipated from contaminated soils, hazardous materials,
and hazardous waste because the demolition, disposal, and construction activities would be conducted
in compliance with federal, state, and Army regulations and with adherence to the USAG FWA’s
specific guidance. The proper removal and disposal would result in beneficial impacts in the long term
because the risk of potential exposure to the environment would be avoided. Beyond adherence to the
plans and regulations discussed above, no additional mitigation has been identified or is needed.

3.4.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

The No Action Alternative would result in moderate impacts related to contaminated soils, hazardous
materials, and hazardous waste. Although the USAG FWA would continue to follow its current
procedures regarding the management of hazardous materials and waste, the continued degradation of
the hangars would result in an increased risk of exposure to the environment from contaminated soils,
hazardous materials, and hazardous waste. These types of exposures could occur if the buildings
deteriorate to the point where the interiors are exposed to the elements or the buildings collapse.
Because the USAG FWA would still be required to comply with applicable regulations for removal and
disposal of the hazardous materials, hazardous waste, LBP, asbestos, and PCBs, the degraded buildings
would increase the safety risk for the workers involved.
If the buildings collapse, the focused removal and disposal of the hazardous materials and hazardous
waste would be difficult and could result in contaminating demolition debris that otherwise could be
diverted from the landfills. This scenario could potentially contaminate a worst-case scenario of
approximately 12,008 cubic yards of C&D debris per hangar, which is projected to go to the FNSB
landfill. The 24,016 cubic yards of contaminated C&D debris for the two hangars would be in addition
to the approximately 1,200 cubic yards of the ACBM and other hazardous materials and hazardous
waste (100 cubic yards and 500 cubic yards, respectively, for each hangar) projected to be going to the
landfill as separate waste streams. Under this scenario, approximately 25,216 cubic yards of C&D
debris could require disposal as ACBM or hazardous materials and hazardous waste, and has the
potential to impact the FNSB landfill capacity. However, the impacts to the FNSB landfill capacity is
anticipated to be minor because in fiscal year (FY) 11, approximately 298 tons per day of refuse
material was taken to the landfill, and the landfill is projected to be operational until the year 2086.

Safety

3.5.1

Affected Environment

The ROI for safety includes Hangars 2 and 3,the area immediately surrounding them within 100 feet,
and the haul routes to and from the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfills.
As discussed in Section 1.1.3, Hangars 2 and 3 are semi-permanent buildings constructed in 1943–
1944. When constructed, the hangars had an estimated life cycle of 40 years, and in 1983, they required
a full-scale rehabilitation. This rehabilitation did not occur because funding was focused on mission
essential programs and other needs of the installation. With the limited maintenance funding, numerous
requirements for funding, and discussions of demolition, rehabilitation for Hangars 2 and 3 was
deferred in favor of other critical facilities (Design Alaska and JCA, 2012).
Although no large-scale rehabilitation of the structures has taken place, over the life of the hangars
maintenance and repair projects have occurred as needed including, but not limited to, upgrades to the
hangar doors, repairs to roof trusses, roof repairs, and replacement of the original hangar doors,
windows, siding, and roofing materials. During many of the interior door and window alterations and
additions, load bearing structural members were severed to accommodate these changes. Because no
full-scale rehabilitation has occurred over the last 70 years, which is almost double the estimated lifecycle of the buildings, the hangars exhibit serious structural, electrical, and safety deficiencies, which
are presented in detail in the 2008 Condition Assessment and Rehabilitation Plans for Hangars 2 and 3
(LBG, 2008). Deficiencies include non-compliance with contemporary building codes and life and
safety conditions, including anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures, structural deficiencies
and damage in the roof trusses and framing, seismic deficiencies in the columns and roof framing, and
ventilation inadequacies throughout both buildings. These deficiencies affect the general health and
welfare of the buildings’ occupants, as well as the general well-being of equipment kept in the hangars.
The structural integrity of the wooden trusses has deteriorated with age and exposure to the harsh
Alaskan environmental conditions, and they currently meet nine of the top eleven reasons why
bowstring wooden trusses fail (Provenghi, 2009; Webb, 2011b). Structural assessments indicate that
most wooden framing members display weaknesses resulting from cracking and splitting (see Figures
1-5 through 1-8 in Section 1.1.3). As a result, the hangars’ ceiling trusses cannot support helicopter
maintenance equipment, their roofs do not meet building codes for snow load, and their infrastructure
no longer meets the standards of a functional work space. They were recorded as “non-functional” in
Fort Wainwright’s real property records in 2011. A geotechnical investigation and analysis resulted in

Chapter 3.0

3-49

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
the determination that both hangars are founded on soils that are susceptible to liquefaction during a
seismic event (LBG, 2008).
Additionally, on February 17, 2011, an electrical fire in Hangar 2 severely damaged the west end of the
hangar roof decking and the roof trusses (see Figures 1-8 through 1-11 in Section 1.1.3). Subsequent
structural investigations indicated that Hangar 2 lacked structural integrity, and in March 2011, it was
found unsafe for occupancy (Webb, 2011a). A structural assessment of Hangar 3 was also performed
and the same structural deficiencies existing in Hangar 2 were found to exist in Hangar 3, resulting in it
being found unsafe for occupancy in April 2011 (Webb, 2011b). As a result, all activities performed in
Hangars 2 and 3 were immediately relocated to other facilities located along the airfield. In late 2012,
the water pipes in Hangar 2 froze and burst, rendering the fire suppression system within the side
offices inoperable, and current funding levels prevent this system from being repaired. Currently,
Hangars 2 and 3 are unoccupied and lack the structural integrity needed to house any military functions.

Environmental Consequences
Significance Criteria

The following criteria have been used to assess impacts to safety of the buildings’ occupants and the
general well-being of equipment in the buildings:
•

None—No measurable impacts to temporary or permanent safety.

•

Minor to Moderate (not significant)—The degree to which activities increase the potential for
human exposure to safety concerns.

•

Severe (significant)—Activities that violate applicable regulations and policies capable of
causing imminent and substantial human safety concerns and resulting in unacceptable risk
would represent a significant impact.

3.5.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, demolition activities would pose safety hazards because of the structural
degradation and the presence of the hazardous materials/waste and other concerns, such as POLs,
ACBM, LBP, PCBs, and others, as discussed in Section 3.4.1. However, the USAG FWA would
conduct both the demolition activities and the construction of the concrete airfield apron in compliance
with the applicable regulations and guidance, including 29 CFR §1926, Safety and Health Regulations
for Construction, and applicable subparts of 29 CFR §1910, Occupational Safety and Health Standards,
and would ensure the safety and health of the workers during construction. The demolition contractor

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
would be required to prepare and submit a Health and Safety Plan. Prior to the demolition activities,
appropriate surveys would be conducted to further verify and confirm the presence and extent of
hazardous materials and contaminants. As discussed in 3.4.2.2, under Alternative 1, the USAG FWA
would remove, transport, and dispose of hazardous materials/waste and other contaminants, in
compliance with federal, state, and Army regulations and in adherence to the installation’s specific
guidance. Prior to mobilizing to the site, the demolition contractor would be required to erect temporary
project safety fencing around the entire perimeter of the project site and would be responsible for
maintaining the integrity of the perimeter fence, access into and out of the job site, and unauthorized
entry into the facilities themselves. As a result, Alternative 1 would result in only minor safety impacts
during the demolition of the hangars and construction of the airfield concrete apron. By following
applicable regulations for packing and hauling hazardous materials and abiding by posted speed limits
and road weight limits, the USAG FWA’s contractor would ensure that safety would not be
compromised when hauling the debris along the truck routes to the landfills. Once the hangars are
demolished and the airfield concrete apron is completed, Alternative 1 would result in long-term,
beneficial effects on safety because the hazardous materials would be removed and properly disposed of
and there would no longer be a risk of structural failure. Under Alternative 1, mitigation measures
would not be required because the USAG FWA’s contractor would comply with the federal, state, and
Army regulations to avoid adverse effects on safety. The contractor’s adherence to the USAG FWA’s
specific guidance for demolition and construction activities at Fort Wainwright and for the removal and
disposal of contaminated soils, hazardous materials, and hazardous waste would also serve to avoid
adverse effects; therefore, no mitigation measures have been identified or would be needed.

3.5.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

The No Action Alternative would result in long-term, moderate impacts on safety. Under the No Action
Alternative, Hangars 2 and 3 would continue to remain unoccupied because they have both been found
to be unsafe for occupancy. As major systems in the hangars continue to fail (similar to the water pipes
freezing in Hangar 2 in late 2012, which rendered the fire suppression system in the side offices nonfunctional), these systems would not be replaced or repaired. The structural integrity of the hangars
would continue to deteriorate, and it is assumed that the hangars would eventually collapse. Structural
failure would increase the moderate risk of exposure to building debris and hazardous materials and
waste, including ACBM, LBP, PCBs, and others in the environment immediately adjacent to the
hangars. As the buildings continue to deteriorate over time, the No Action Alternative would not
address the buildings’ vulnerability to soil liquefaction during a seismic event.

Chapter 3.0

3-51

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Maintenance and upkeep of the hangars, such as security patrols and pest control would continue based
on current funding levels and other maintenance priorities at the installation; however, the continued
deterioration of the hangars presents safety concerns for any person entering them, and in some cases,
safety concerns prevent maintenance from being performed (USAG FWA, 2011a). These concerns
represent long-term, moderate impacts to the safety of the workers and could require additional
measures to ensure their safety while performing maintenance work.
Once the buildings collapse, removal and transport of the demolition debris, including hazardous
materials and hazardous waste would be conducted in compliance with the applicable regulations and
Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfill requirements (if the buildings collapse after September 2015 then
all materials would be disposed of in the FNSB landfill as the Fort Wainwright landfill will be closing
at that time and no longer able to accept ACBM). Prior to mobilizing to the site, the contractor would
be required to erect temporary project safety fencing around the entire perimeter of the project sites and
would be responsible for maintaining the integrity of the perimeter fence, access into and out of the job
site, and unauthorized entry into the facilities themselves. Additionally, by following applicable
regulations for packing and hauling hazardous materials and abiding by posted speed limits and road
weight limits, the USAG FWA’s contractor would ensure that safety would not be compromised when
hauling the debris along the truck routes to the landfills. As a result, once the buildings collapse, the No
Action Alternative would result in only minor impact to safety during the removal, transport, and
disposal of the demolition debris and construction of the airfield concrete apron. By following
applicable regulations for packing and hauling hazardous materials and abiding by posted speed limits
and road weight limits, there would be no impacts to safety along the truck routes to the landfills. Once
the hangars are demolished and the airfield concrete apron is completed, the No Action Alternative
would result in long-term, beneficial impacts to safety.

Environmental Justice and Protection of Children

On February 11, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. Executive Order 12898
directs agencies to address environmental and human health conditions in minority and low-income
communities so as to avoid the disproportionate placement of any adverse effects from federal policies
and actions on these populations. The general purposes of this executive order are as follows:

3-52

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
•

Focus the attention of federal agencies on human health and environmental conditions in
minority communities and low-income communities with the goal of achieving environmental
justice.

•

Foster nondiscrimination in federal programs that substantially affect human health or the
environment.

•

Improve data collection efforts on the impacts of decisions that affect minority communities
and low-income communities and encourage more public participation in federal decision
making by ensuring documents are easily accessible (e.g., in multiple languages and readily
available).

As defined by the Environmental Justice Guidance Under NEPA (CEQ, 1997), “minority populations”
include persons who identify themselves as Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaskan
Native, Black (not of Hispanic origin), or Hispanic. Race refers to census respondents’ selfidentification of racial background. Hispanic origin refers to ethnicity and language, not race, and may
include persons whose heritage is Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, and Central or South American.
A minority population exists where the percentage of minorities in an affected area either exceeds 50
percent or is meaningfully greater than in the general population. Low-income populations are
identified using the U.S. Census Bureau’s statistical poverty threshold, which is based on income and
family size. The U.S. Census Bureau defines a “poverty area” as a census tract with 20 percent or more
of its residents below the poverty threshold and an “extreme poverty area” as one with 40 percent or
more below the poverty level. A census tract is a small geographic subdivision of a county and typically
contains between 2,500 and 8,000 persons (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2000).
Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health and Safety Risks, requires
federal agencies, to the extent permitted by law and mission, to identify and assess environmental
health and safety risks that might disproportionately affect children. This executive order, dated April
21, 1997, further requires federal agencies to ensure that their policies, programs, activities, and
standards address these disproportionate risks. Executive Order 13045 defines environmental health and
safety risks as “risks to health or to safety that are attributable to products or substances that the child is
likely to come in contact with or ingest (such as the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink
and use for recreation, the soil we live on and the products we use or are exposed to).”

Affected Environment

The ROI for the assessment of potential impacts to Environmental Justice populations and the
Protection of Children is defined as Hangars 2 and 3 and areas in the immediate vicinity (100 feet), as
well as the truck haul routes to and from the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfills. The Proposed Action
would occur on Fort Wainwright, Alaska, which is located within the City of Fairbanks, Alaska, and
within proximity to North Pole, Alaska, both of which are located within Fairbanks North Star
Borough, Alaska. Population statistics for areas outside of Fort Wainwright and the ROI are included
below because these are either areas that the ROI is partially located within or are shown for
comparison.

3.6.1.1

Environmental Justice

Race, ethnicity, household income, and poverty data are presented in Table 3-10 for the five census
tracts that reside within proximity to or encompass the ROI (see Figure 3-4). For the purposes of
comparison, all information in Table 3-10 is presented from the American Community Survey 2006–
2010 estimates. Among the five census tracts, Census Tracts 1 and 3 had the highest percentage of their
populations living below the poverty level at approximately 15 percent. In comparison, the borough as
whole had 7.6 percent, while the state had 9.5 percent of its population living below the poverty
threshold.
In 2010, Census Tracts 1 and 10 had 26 and 21 percent of their populations, respectively, identify
themselves as American Indian or Alaska Native. These percentages were at least 10 percent higher
than these same ethnicity/race percentages at either the state of Alaska or FNSB level. Census Tracts 3
and 11 had 16 and 13 percent of their populations, respectively, identify themselves as African
Americans. These percentages were at least 10 percent higher than these same ethnicity/race
percentages at either the state of Alaska or FNSB level. Therefore, Census Tracts 1, 3, 10, and 11 are
identified as potential Minority Areas since the percentage of the American Indian or Native Alaskan or
African American minority populations is meaningfully greater than the population of these same
ethnicities/races at either the state of Alaska or FNSB level. Environmental Justice Impacts to these
communities are determined based on the degree of impact that a proposed action has on each census
tract and whether or not a community has been identified as a Minority or Poverty Area (U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2010a,b). These impacts will be described in the Environmental
Consequences section below.

Protection of Children

Several facilities on Fort Wainwright are centers (i.e., schools, a daycare facility, and a recreation
center) in which a large number of children gather at some point during an average week; however,
none of these facilities are located within 100 feet of the hangars, and only two of these facilities—the
Outdoor Recreation Center, located northwest of the intersection of Glass Drive and Gaffney Road, and
the Child Development Center I, located southeast of the intersection of 600th Street and Gaffney
Road—are within 200 to 300 feet of the haul route that demolition trucks would take between the
project site and the FNSB landfill. In addition to these two facilities, children reside with their families
in on-post housing, use sidewalks, and possibly recreate within 200 to 300 feet of the proposed
demolition truck haul routes. Off-post, no facilities that host a large number of children during an
average week are known to be located within 200 to 300 feet of the truck haul route, but some children
may reside in off-post homes or use sidewalks and recreation areas that are located within 200 to 300
feet of the proposed truck haul routes.

3.6.2

Environmental Consequences

3.6.2.1

Significance Criteria

An environmental justice impact is considered to have occurred if the impact from an alternative
disproportionately and adversely affects a minority or low-income community. An impact to a
population of children is considered to have occurred if the impact from an alternative
disproportionately and adversely affects a population of children. The following are impact thresholds
for environmental justice impacts and impacts to children:
•

None—No activities would have an adverse and disproportionate impact on minorities, lowincome communities, or populations of children.

•

Minor to Moderate (not significant)—The degree to which activities disproportionately
impact minorities or low-income individuals, or result in health and safety risks for children.

•

Severe (significant)—Activities that adversely pose disproportionate adverse impacts to
minorities or low-income individuals or cause health or safety risks for children would
represent a significant impact.

3.6.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under this alternative, Hangars 2 and 3 would be demolished and concrete would be added to the
building footprints for future use as an airfield apron. It is estimated to take approximately six months
to complete the demolition of these hangars and would occur during the summer of 2014.

Environmental Justice
As noted in Table 3-10 in Section 3.6.1 above, the median household income in 2010 for FNSB was
higher than the median household income for the state and the nation. In 2010, approximately 7.6
percent of the population in the borough lived below the poverty threshold, which is lower than the state
and national figures. As described in Section 3.6.1, four of the census tracts that the ROI is located
within have relatively high minority populations. However, it is not anticipated that this project would
have an adverse or disproportionate impact on these populations because there is no housing located
close to Hangar 2 or Hangar 3. While it is anticipated that trucks hauling demolition debris to the
landfills would have a short-term, minor impact on traffic volume on the haul route roads, the roads to
be traveled are separated from the surrounding communities by trees, berms, landscaping buffers, or
fencing for most of their length, and these routes are currently heavily travelled by trucks. Therefore, no
environmental justice impacts are anticipated as a result of this alternative.

Protection of Children
Although the southern exterior sides of Hangars 2 and 3 are open to the post, the hangars are currently
kept locked as a result of their condemned status. During the demolition of these buildings, the
demolition contractor would be required to erect temporary project safety fencing around the entire
perimeter of the project site. Consequently, it is anticipated that these hangars would not pose harm to
children on the installation either before or during their demolition.
As described in Section 3.6.1.2, two on-post facilities—the Outdoor Recreation Center and the Child
Development Center I—have relatively high proportions of children and are located adjacent to the
potential route that demolition truck traffic would use to haul waste off-post to the FNSB landfill. The
potential routes for demolition trucks traveling both on- and off-post also pass within 200 to 300 feet of
some homes, recreation areas, and sidewalks that children could live in or use. However, the demolition
trucks would travel past these facilities, homes, recreation areas, and sidewalks only temporarily during
the demolition period, and these routes are already heavily travelled by trucks. Truck operators would
be expected to comply with all laws and regulations that govern the transportation of demolition and
hazardous material debris and to follow posted speed limits and other roadway safety measures. As a
result, adverse and disproportionate impacts on children either on or off the installation are not expected
3-58

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
to occur under Alternative 1. Because there would be no environmental justice or protection of children
impacts under Alternative 1, no mitigation measures have been identified or are needed.

3.6.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

Impacts resulting from the No Action Alternative would be similar to those described for Alternative 1;
however, most of these impacts would be expected to occur later in time. Under the No Action
Alternative, with no major rehabilitation effort or repair or replacement of major systems as they fail,
the hangars would continue to deteriorate, and it is assumed that the hangars would eventually collapse
from a catastrophic structural failure. It is not expected that a fence would be installed around Hangars
2 and 3 under this alternative; however, the hangars would remain locked. Because children do not
generally pass by these hangars, it is not expected that these structures would pose a risk to them.
Furthermore, no Family Housing is located within 100 feet of the hangars; therefore, no environmental
justice impacts or impacts to children are anticipated to occur as a result of housing being located in
proximity to the hangars. When the hangars do eventually collapse on their own, the USAG FWA
would remove the debris and dispose of it in the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfills (if they collapse
after September 2015 then all material would be disposed of in the FNSB landfill as the Fort
Wainwright landfill will be closing on that date and would no longer be able to accept ACBM). For the
same reasons as described under Alternative 1, disposing of the demolition debris and construction of
the airfield concrete apron in the footprint of the buildings and supporting infrastructure would result in
no environmental justice impacts, and there would be no adverse or disproportionate impacts on
children either on or off Fort Wainwright. Because there would be no environmental justice impacts
under the No Action Alternative, no mitigation measures have been identified or are needed.

3.7

Sustainability

The Army recognizes that training, equipping, and supporting Army operations requires land, resources
and people and that rising global demand for scarce resources, increasing regional unrest, and the
effects of climate change are just some of the trends that will affect our future environment.
Incorporating sustainability considerations into Army operations, acquisitions, and installations will
help meet current and future mission requirements worldwide, reduce resource demand and enhance the
natural environment, safeguard human health and improve the quality of life, preserve current and
future operational flexibility, and enhance mission capability and resilience (Army, 2004).
The term “sustainability” has many meanings in a number of different contexts. For the purpose of this
Proposed Action at Fort Wainwright, sustainability is focused on energy use, recycling/reuse, and

Chapter 3.0

3-59

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
embodied energy. 21 As part of the overarching Army definition of sustainability, as well as applicability
to Fort Wainwright and this project, the following goals and strategies have been adopted to achieve
sustainable operations, installations, systems, and communities.
•

Strengthen Army operations—The Army will employ sustainable practices, such as water
conservation, and fuel and energy efficiency, to minimize environmental impacts and increase
logistical efficiencies.

•

Minimize impacts and total ownership costs—The Army will integrate sustainability into all
activities by using the International Organization for Standardization 14001, Environmental
Management System Standard, as a framework to improve performance and compliance and
will leverage its purchasing power to favor environmentally sustainable products that lower
total ownership costs and employ other tools to continually improve effectiveness.

In addition, to the sustainability directive as developed by the Army, a number of federal statutes and
executive orders promote sustainable development and include:
•

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires a reduction of fossil fuel use in
new or renovated federal buildings by 55 percent by FY 10 and 100 percent by FY 30.

•

Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic
Performance, set a DoD goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHGs by 34 percent by FY 20 and to
reduce Scope 3 GHGs by 13.5 percent by FY 20. It also requires that at least 50 percent of solid
waste and 50 percent of C&D waste by FY 15 is diverted from landfills (i.e., either recycled or
reused). The executive order also requires that all new buildings that enter design in FY 20 and
after achieve net zero energy by FY 30.

•

Executive Order 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation
Management, states that all federal buildings will reduce energy consumption by 3 percent per
year to total of 30 percent by FY 15, based on the FY 03 baseline as well as requiring 50
percent of required annual renewable energy consumed from “new” renewable sources.

3.7.1

Affected Environment

Based on the relatively small scale of the Proposed Action, the ROI for sustainability is defined as
Hangars 2 and 3.

Embodied energy is the energy that is required to extract, process, manufacture, transport, and install building
materials.

3-60

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Current policies at Fort Wainwright fostering sustainability objectives include partnering with the local
community to provide for water reuse and increased efficiency in solid waste recycling (Hall, 2011);
requiring a solid waste management plan that details strategies for waste minimization and for C&D
debris to either be salvaged, reused, or recycled in line with specific goals for diversion stated in
Executive Order 13514 (USAEC, 2010); and requiring all new construction and renovations to attain
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification for green building (Siftar,
2012).
Hangars 2 and 3 were built between 1943 and 1944 during World War II prior to the development and
focus of modern Army and DoD sustainability initiatives. The hangars feature closed bowstring wood
trusses located 57 feet above an open hangar concrete floor, which is approximately 152 feet by 200
feet, and bare timber columns. Two-story side wings that are 25 feet wide are located on the north and
south sides of the hangar floor. The hangars have a barrel vault shaped roof and four stairwell towers at
each corner of the building. Major repairs and maintenance work that have occurred to the buildings
since construction and that have had the potential to impact the sustainability of the hangars by making
them more efficient from a heating point of view include (Design Alaska and JCA, 2012):
•

Upgrades to hardware and weather-stripping to hangar doors (1960, 1974, and 1977)

•

Roof repairs, including asphalt shingles at east-west overhangs and metal fascias (1968, 1991
and 1998) and repairs to roof trusses (1987)

•

Window replacement and the implementation of hot water base board heating at wing windows
(1971)

•

Replacement of roof/ceiling insulation in wings (1977)

•

Replacement of exterior wall insulation (R-19) and a vapor barrier (1985)

•

Replacement of heating system in hangar bays to glycol hydronic and new unit heaters (1993)

Typically, it is thought that the most sustainable building is one that has already been constructed
because the embodied energy required to construct a building has already taken place, the site has been
cleared, all building materials have been used, and all construction debris and procedures have taken
place (Preservation Green Lab, 2011). This does not mean that a building that has been constructed is
operationally sustainable. Buildings may be inefficient in energy or water use or may no longer serve
their intended functional purpose. Although the hangars are sustainable according to the viewpoint that
they have already been constructed, their overall sustainability has been greatly minimized by the fact
that they have outlived their intended lifespan, are inefficient to heat, and are unoccupied due to their
lack of structural integrity (Potschin and Haines-Young, no date).

Chapter 3.0

3-61

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
While the hangars are currently unoccupied, they continue to be heated to minimize the amount of snow
on the roofs. The hangars do not meet current snow load codes and a buildup of snow on the roofs
could result in a structural collapse. Despite the previous repairs and maintenance described above,
based on the deteriorated state of the hangars and the lack of insulation, both hangars are inefficient to
heat and lack the necessary equipment to help facilitate the melting of snow. Heat used at the hangars is
provided by a coal-fired power plant located on Fort Wainwright. Current coal use to heat and provide
electricity to the hangars is approximately 1,427 tons for Hangar 2 and 1,556 tons for Hangar 3
annually (approximately 1 percent of the fossil fuel use at Fort Wainwright) at an approximate annual
cost of $350,000 per hangar. By comparison, Hangar 6 at Fort Wainwright, which is similar in size to
Hangars 2 and 3, requires approximately 1,867 tons of coal annually for heat and electricity. However,
Hangar 6 is fully functional, and the majority of the 1,867 tons of coal is used for electricity because
Hangar 6 requires twice the amount of electricity compared to Hangar 2 or Hangar 3 and requires less
heating. Even though Hangar 6 has higher costs and usage, the costs and usage for Hangars 2 and 3 are
substantially high for buildings that are unoccupied, thus minimizing the current sustainability of
Hangars 2 and 3.
Sustainability also includes demolition activities. Sustainable reuse includes efforts to reduce the
environmental impact by reusing and recycling materials generated during building demolition. Typical
C&D materials include wood, drywall, cardboard, brick, concrete, metal, insulation, and glass.
Preliminary estimates from the USEPA show that the nation generated more than 160 million tons of
building-related C&D materials in 2003. Nearly 53 percent of all building-related C&D materials is the
result of demolition activities, 38 percent of the materials is produced by renovation activities, while
approximately 9 percent is the result of construction. Of the total amount of building-related C&D
materials generated, the USEPA estimates that only 40 percent was reused, recycled, or sent to wasteto-energy facilities, while the remaining 60 percent of the materials was sent to C&D landfills (USEPA,
2009). Previous waste diversion goals at Fort Wainwright have set goals that C&D projects shall
generate at least 50 percent less waste into landfills (American Mechanical Inc., 2011). For previous
projects at Fort Wainwright, the main materials disposed of in a landfill include concrete, metals,
asphalt, cardboard, and some wood, all of which were deemed unusable and/or non-recyclable
(American Mechanical Inc., 2011).

The following categories are used in assessing potential impacts to sustainability resulting from the
Proposed Action.

with the potential to threaten economic, environmental, and social resources.

3.7.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, the USAG FWA would demolish Hangar 2 and Hangar 3 and supporting
infrastructure, including the empty, small, open, flammable liquids storage facility located between
Hangars 2 and 3. Demolition would involve removal of the buildings, building slabs, and the
foundations and disposal of the materials in the Fort Wainwright landfill (ACBM only) and the FNSB
landfill (all other materials). Upon completion of demolition activities, concrete would be added to the
building and infrastructure footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield land use
designation as a parking apron. The existing asphalt-paved parking lot would be removed. Infiltration
areas, swales, and culverts would be installed as needed, to include the addition of topsoil and seeding,
creating a beneficial impact to stormwater management and, in turn, sustainable development at Fort
Wainwright. In compliance with the Army’s goal of not exceeding 50 percent of C&D materials being
disposed of in a landfill, non-hazardous materials would be diverted from the FNSB landfill to the
greatest extent possible through the reuse or recycling of materials. The remaining demolition debris
would be disposed of in the landfill in accordance with a solid waste management plan developed by
the contractor for the project.
Materials from the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would include: timber; drywall; metals; concrete;
asphalt; and functional building items, such as doors, door frames, windows, structural systems,
millwork, fixtures, and other materials. These materials would be disposed of in accordance with an
established solid waste management plan to be developed by the contractor for the hangars, and all
solid waste disposed of in landfills would be minimized. All existing timber at the site, minus the
timber severely burnt from fire, could be recycled. Recycling could include re-milling the wood into

Chapter 3.0

3-63

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
flooring, or chipping/grinding to make engineered board, boiler fuel, or mulch. Plywood, oriented
strand board, and particle board may be reused at Fort Wainwright as long as it is not a permanent
feature of the facility (i.e., formwork) because it is not structurally sound and otherwise may be
recycled. All drywall could be removed and recycled into new drywall, used in cement, or used for
agriculture purposes to provide a source of sulfur and calcium to crops and assist in the composting
process. Common metals available for recycling include steel, aluminum, and copper. Local metal scrap
yards or recyclers that accept metal materials are typically accessible and willing to take these
materials. Metals could be melted down and reformed into metal products in the well-established
market for metals. Upon the removal of the reinforcement bar, concrete could be recycled with future
uses including road base, general fill, pavement aggregate, and drainage media. Asphalt shingles and
pavement can be ground and reused in future asphalt mixes. Functional building items (i.e., bathroom
fixtures) could be recycled or salvaged in their current use with a number of markets currently existing.
In the event that most of the applicable materials stemming from demolition are recycled or reused,
long-term, beneficial impacts would occur.
It is expected that some materials would not be appropriate for reuse and would likely need to be
disposed of in a landfill; however, based on the relatively small scale of these materials compared to all
other materials transported daily to the FNSB landfill (298 tons per day), the impacts would be short
term and minor. All demolition activities would be carried out according to protocols stipulated in a
solid waste management plan that identifies waste minimization, collection, and disposal methods;
waste streams, and locations for solid waste diversion/disposal including clearing debris and C&D
waste that is diverted (salvaged, reused, or recycled). The construction of a concrete pad over the
previous building footprints would require new construction materials and construction emissions.
However, based on the relatively small scale of the project, it is expected that the materials needed and
emissions from construction equipment would not be substantial, resulting in short-term, minor
impacts.
With the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, all existing utility demands for both hangars would no longer
be required, reducing the use of fossil fuels for heat and electricity production. Because neither of the
hangars is functional, the fossil fuels currently used for heating are being wasted because the hangars do
not serve a functional military mission. The amount of fossil fuels used to provide energy for the two
hangars when compared to Fort Wainwright as a whole is relatively small, approximately one percent.
The demolition of both hangars would allow the “wasted” energy to be transferred to buildings that
serve the military mission at Fort Wainwright and would be financially sustainable by leading to a cost

3-64

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
savings of $700,000, which is currently being expended into the two condemned hangars, resulting in
long-term, beneficial impacts.
Demolition of the hangars would result in the loss of their remaining embodied energy; however,
because the hangars have surpassed their intended lifespan, are no longer useable, and do not support
the military mission at Fort Wainwright, demolition of the hangars would not be completely contrary to
the embodied energy concept and would result in only short-term, minor impacts.
Overall, impacts to sustainability as a result of Alternative 1 would be short term, and minor because of
the materials that could not be reused or recycled, the new materials and emissions that would be
generated from construction of the airfield apron, and the loss of embodied energy from demolition.
Reduced energy consumption, cost savings, and the ability to recycle materials not currently being used
would result in long-term, beneficial impacts to sustainability as a result of this alternative. Because
impacts are only temporary and minor, no mitigation measures for sustainability are identified or
needed under Alternative 1.

3.7.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, Hangars 2 and 3 would remain in their current condition, serving no
active military function. Existing energy demand requirements stemming from electricity and heating to
prevent snow buildup on the roofs would continue, and costs and energy demand are anticipated to be
similar to those currently being experienced: $350,000 per hangar and approximately 3,000 tons of coal
combined annually (approximately 1 percent of the fossil fuel use at Fort Wainwright). No large-scale
rehabilitation efforts for the hangars would occur, and as major systems fail they would not be repaired
or replaced (similar to what happened in late 2012 when the water pipes in Hangar 2 froze and burst
rendering the fire suppression system in the side offices inoperable); as a result the structural integrity
of the hangars would continue to deteriorate, and it is assumed that the hangars would eventually
collapse.
The fact that the hangars would remain intact for some duration of time does attribute some short-term,
beneficial impacts to sustainability because no demolition debris would be generated, no construction
emissions would occur, and no new materials would be needed. These short-term, beneficial impacts
though would be offset by the fact that the non-functionality of the hangars requires that activities set
forth for the hangars be carried out at other locations, resulting in minor impacts to sustainability
because Hangars 2 and 3 do not serve a functional purpose. In addition, the inefficiencies of the hangars
results in high annual utility costs and subsequent emissions, resulting in minor impacts.

Chapter 3.0

3-65

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
As mentioned above, it is assumed that under the No Action Alternative that the hangars would
eventually collapse due to their compromised structural integrity and their continued deterioration. In
the event of a complete failure, it would be more difficult to properly remediate hazardous materials
due to contamination of the debris by ACBM, LBP, and other hazardous materials in the buildings. As a
result, the amount of building materials that could be reused or recycled would be greatly reduced,
resulting in moderate impacts to sustainability.
Overall, when examining the Army sustainability directive, applicable federal statues and executive
orders, and the USAG FWA’s policies and objectives for Fort Wainwright, the current status and
operation of these building is not sustainable. Both Hangars 2 and 3 have outlived their expected
lifespan, are currently condemned, and continue to consume energy through heating from fossil fuels.
This results in a drain on sustainability efforts, as well as the inability for the Army to fully support its
mission at Fort Wainwright. While it is typically thought that a built building is more sustainable due to
the energy and materials required to construct a building already being used, in this instance that is not
the case, as the hangars are condemned, have outlived their expected lifespan and purpose, and will
likely collapse on their own in due time.

Transportation

This section describes the baseline conditions for the transportation system serving Fort Wainwright,
including regional and local roadways and parking. It also evaluates the potential environmental
impacts on the transportation system from implementing the alternatives. The baseline conditions for air
transportation, rail transportation, public transportation, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities are not
discussed because these elements would not be affected by the Proposed Action.

3.8.1

Affected Environment

The ROI for transportation includes the roadways connecting Hangars 2 and 3 to the gates serving the
Main Post and the proposed truck haul routes between the hangars and the Fort Wainwright and FNSB
landfills. In 2006, USKH conducted a traffic study on Fort Wainwright’s Main Post. Because the
projected population growth for the installation has increased since the 2006 traffic study, the Six-Year
Transportation Plan Update, April 2009 (USKH, 2009) was prepared to examine and evaluate year
2015 traffic conditions, assuming the full-projected occupancy and development of the installation. The
study included an analysis of current (2009) AM and PM peak hour traffic and safety conditions, and an
analysis of forecasted traffic conditions.

3.8.1.1

Roadways and Traffic Volumes

Hangars 2 and 3 are located north of Montgomery Road between Meridian Road and Santiago Avenue
on the southwest side of Ladd Army Airfield on Fort Wainwright. State and local roads, railway main
lines and spurs, Ladd Airfield, and Fairbanks International Airport provide access to Fort Wainwright
Main Post.

Area Roadways
The major state and local roads serving Fairbanks and the Main Post include Richardson Highway,
George Parks Highway, and Steese Highway (Figure 3-5). Within Fairbanks, Airport Way is the main
east-west arterial accessing the Main Post of the installation. At its eastern terminus, Airport Way enters
the cantonment area through the Main Gate, becoming Gaffney Road. On the west side of Fairbanks,
Airport Way connects to the Fairbanks International Airport and the George Parks Highway. College
Road and the Johansen Expressway/Geist Road also provide major east-west access to the Main Post
through the northern part of Fairbanks. Traffic levels on Airport Way, Richardson Highway, and Steese
Highway are generally moderate. However, noticeably heavier traffic during peak hours and the
summer tourist season can cause congestion at major arterial intersections. Peak hours for Fairbanks
(and Fort Wainwright) are typically 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM, and 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM (USACE, 2008).
The off-post roads likely to be used by trucks hauling demolition debris to the FNSB landfill from the
project site include Richardson Highway, Old Richardson Highway, Easy Street, and Badger Road.

Main Post Roadways
Main roads within the Main Post are shown on Figure 3-6. The Main Post contains approximately 30
miles of paved roads and 10 miles of gravel/clay unpaved roads. All of the paved and unpaved roads
serving the Main Post are in good condition (USACE, 2008). Gravel roads serve facilities, such as the
landfill, tank farm, northeast ammunition storage area, and training areas.
Three gates provide access to the Main Post, including the Main Gate on Gaffney Road, the terminus of
Airport Way; Trainor Gate, located about one mile north of the Main Gate off Steese Highway; and
Badger Gate to the east, on Badger Road, just north of Richardson Highway (USACE, 2008). The roads
on Fort Wainwright that would likely be used by trucks hauling demolition debris to the FNSB landfill
include Gaffney, Meridian, and Montgomery Roads, while the roads to get to the Fort Wainwright
landfill include, Montgomery, Meridian, and River Roads. The Six-Year Transportation Plan Update
examines traffic conditions for the primary roadways and key intersections within the installation.

These roadways support the majority of commuter traffic (work and school-related) on Fort
Wainwright, with the remaining secondary roadways supporting shorter trips within the installation,
i.e., local traffic. Gaffney Road, Montgomery Road, Neely Road, Rhineland Avenue, Trainor Gate
Road, and Alder Avenue are the primary east-west roadways evaluated in the Transportation Plan. The
primary north-south routes evaluated in this plan are 599th Street, 600th Street, 9th Street, Whidden
Road, Meridian Road, River Road, Santiago Avenue, Luzon Avenue, Apple Street, Marks Road, 102nd
Street, 6th Street, 103rd Street, and Ketcham Road.
Gaffney Road, which is the principal arterial on the installation, extends from the Main Gate to Marks
Road at the eastern portion of Fort Wainwright. The road is composed of a four-lane section to Marks
Road for directional traffic. The road then changes name to Ketcham Road, which is two lanes and
continues east to the Badger Road Gate entrance. Posted speeds range between 20 and 35 miles per
hour (mph). A separate pedestrian trail runs along the north side of Gaffney Road between the Trainor
Gate and Apple Street. Lane widths average about 11 feet along the roadway.
The remaining roadways addressed in the study consist mainly of two-lane roadways with either
adjacent paved shoulders or sidewalks. Posted speeds range from 20 mph (in school zones) to 25 mph
with Alder Avenue being the only two-lane roadway with a posted speed limit of 35 mph. The average
lane width along study roadways is 10 to 11 feet. Because the ROI is focused on the proposed truck
haul routes between the hangars and the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfills, Table 3-11 lists the Main
Post ROI study intersection control types.

Traffic Volumes
Traffic volumes were developed for 25 key intersections using 2005 and 2007 traffic count data as part
of the Six-Year Transportation Plan Update (USKH, 2009). The highest traffic volumes recorded on
the installation is on Gaffney Road west of Meridian Road. Traffic volumes range from 1,000 to 1,700
vehicles during the PM peak hour. The peak direction on Gaffney Road is eastbound entering the
installation in the morning and westbound exiting the installation during the evening. Montgomery
Road, Neely Road, Santiago Road, and Meridian Road carry more than 400 vehicles during the AM and
PM peak hours, depending on the location. The remaining study roadways carry fewer than 400
vehicles during the AM and PM peak hours (USKH, 2009).

Traffic Analysis
To estimate how well the existing infrastructure accommodates the current and future traffic demand, a
traffic analysis was conducted as part of the Six-Year Transportation Plan Update (USKH, 2009). The
capacity analysis methodology is based on the concepts and procedures in the Highway Capacity
Manual (Transportation Research Board, 2000) published by the Transportation Research Board,
National Research Council. The Synchro software (Version 7) was used to model the intersections
within the study area.
The primary performance indicator for intersections is level of service (LOS). LOS is a performance
measure that describes operational conditions and provides an index to the quality of traffic flow. LOS
is defined in letter designations from A (no congestion on the road) to F (roadways that are
overcapacity). LOS A represents the best operating condition, LOS C describes a stable flow condition,
and LOS F represents the worst operating condition and is generally considered “unacceptable” to most
drivers. Because the LOS of a traffic facility is a function of the traffic flows placed on it, the LOS of a
facility may vary greatly, depending on the time of day, day of week, or period of year. The LOS for
signalized and unsignalized intersections is defined in terms of average control delay, which is a
measure of driver discomfort, frustration, fuel consumption, and lost travel time (Table 3-12). The
average control delay represents the cumulative time decelerating, time spent queuing toward the
intersection, time stopped at the stop sign or traffic signal, and time accelerating to the original travel
speed.

The weekday peak hour data were analyzed to determine existing LOS at the 25 key intersections under
various traffic flow conditions. The Gaffney Road and 599th Street intersection currently operates at
LOS E during the AM peak hour, and the Gaffney Road and 10th Street intersection currently operates
at LOS D in the PM peak hour. The four intersections along Montgomery Road—at Meridian Road,
Santiago Avenue, Luzon Avenue, and Ketcham Road—operate at LOS C or better during both peak
hours. The remaining 19 intersections also operate at a LOS C or better during both peak hours (USKH,
2009).
The Six-Year Transportation Plan Update also projects the traffic volumes into the future to 2015 for
the same 25 intersections on the Main Post previously mentioned. The 2015 estimated turning
movement counts include proposed Main Post development expected to be complete and fully occupied
by 2015; therefore, these estimated counts provide a reasonable 2014 baseline condition. Since the
publication of the Six-Year Transportation Plan Update, the Montgomery Road at Meridian Road
intersection has been upgraded to a signalized intersection, a recommendation listed in the
Transportation Plan. The potential truck haul routes to the two landfills only potentially impact seven
intersections along Gaffney Road, four intersections along Montgomery Road, and one intersection
along Trainor Gate Road; therefore, the baseline conditions require the analysis of only 12 of the 25
Main Post intersections.

Based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, the same tool used by the Six-Year Transportation Plan
Update, the intersection analysis for the 12 intersections resulted in poor (LOS D), near failing (LOS
E), or failing (LOS F) operations for three intersections, all unsignalized intersections operating as twoway, STOP-controlled. The three intersections operating poorly (Gaffney Road at 599th Street, Gaffney
Street at 10th Street, and Montgomery Road at Santiago Avenue) would only represent the minor street
approaches (599th Street, 10th Street, and Santiago Avenue) because the major street would operate as
free flowing. The operations of the remaining intersections would operate at LOS C or better during
both peak hours. Table 3-13 shows the baseline intersection analysis.

In addition to conducting the Six-Year Transportation Plan Update, the USAG FWA is upgrading
Montgomery Road from the intersections of Meridian Road to Luzon Avenue to accommodate the
projected increase in traffic and pedestrians associated with the military construction projects related to
increasing the number of Soldiers and aviation assets stationed at Fort Wainwright (USAG FWA,

Chapter 3.0

3-73

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
2012b). The upgrades to this section of Montgomery Road will be complete by the end of 2013 and
include the following:
•

This section of Montgomery Road will be widened to a total of 56 feet. Montgomery Road will
have two 12-foot travel lanes with a 10-foot shoulder in the eastbound direction and one 12foot travel lane with a 10-foot shoulder in the westbound direction.

•

At the Montgomery Road and Luzon Avenue intersection, the Army will install a three-way
traffic signal with a pedestrian signal.

•

Four entrances drives with a minimum width of 24 feet will be built to provide access to
Hangars 2 and 3. Some parking spaces will be lost as a result of the construction of the
entrances drives.

•

Pedestrian crosswalks will be provided on Montgomery Road to adjacent builds, sidewalks, and
parking areas.

•

Parking spaces for Building 3010 will be relocated, and no parking spaces would be lost.

•

A 6-foot-wide bike path will be built along the south side of Montgomery Road between
Meridian Road and Santiago Avenue to connect with the existing bike path east of the
Montgomery Road and Santiago Avenue intersection.

3.8.1.2

Parking

Adequate parking exists in all active areas of the Main Post (USACE, 2008). The asphalt parking lot
between Hangars 2 and 3 and Montgomery Road has had multiple resurfacing and patch repairs
completed in the past. Many large cracks and puddles were observed on the parking surface. The
parking spaces paint lines are faded and nonexistent in many locations. The paved parking area is
approximately 140 feet by 1,200 feet and could accommodate approximately 200 vehicles for both
hangars. Vehicles can access the parking lot from Montgomery Road. No curb separates the parking lot
and Montgomery Road. Vehicles can enter the facilities from anywhere along Montgomery Road
(USACE, 2008).

Environmental Consequences

3.8.2.1

Significance Criteria

The following criteria have been developed to assess the transportation impacts for each of the
alternatives:
•

None—Current traffic patterns and trends would prevail. There would be no change to traffic
operations as a result of the action.

•

Minor to Moderate (not significant)—The degree to which activities result in increased use
of roads or interferes with the provision of services to the same, or intersection and gate delays

•

Severe (significant)—Activities that cause recurring traffic delays on roadways, cause
discernible degradation of existing roads, or result in intersections and gates reaching capacity
and developing extensive delays would represent a significant impact.

3.8.2.2

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, the building demolition and concrete apron construction activities would be
expected to last approximately six months beginning in spring 2014. No road closures or detours are
anticipated during construction periods; however, there would be short-term, minor impacts associated
with the increase in vehicles generated by construction workers and dump trucks during the demolition
and construction activities.
The dump trucks would transport the debris from the hangars to two different landfills, one located on
the Main Post and the other located south of the Main Post (the FNSB landfill), depending on the type
of debris. ACBM would be transported to the Fort Wainwright landfill, located on the Main Post along
River Road, east of Canal Service Road. The truck route between the hangars and the Fort Wainwright
landfill would follow Montgomery Road west to Meridian Road north to River Road east to the Fort
Wainwright landfill. The return route to the hangars would follow the reverse route along the same
roadways. The truck route between the hangars and the FNSB landfill would likely operate in a
counter-clockwise loop beginning at the hangars by following Montgomery Road west, to Meridian
Road north, to Gaffney Road west, to Richardson Highway south, to the Lakeview Drive exit, to Old
Richardson Highway west, to Easy Street south, to the FNSB landfill. The return route would follow
Easy Street north, to Old Richardson Highway east, to Richardson Highway east, to the Badger Road
exit, to Badger Road north, to Montgomery Road west, to the hangars. Figure 3-7 shows the proposed
landfill truck routes.

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Based on the USACE building demolition estimates (USACE, 2012d), 5,038 total projected truck trips
would be required to remove the debris from the demolition of the two hangars and supporting
infrastructure, i.e., 5,013 projected truck trips between the two hangars and FNSB landfill and
25 projected truck trips between the two hangars and Fort Wainwright landfill to dispose of ACBM. To
estimate the number of peak hour truck trips between the two hangars and FNSB landfill, a six-month
time frame and eight-hour workday were assumed. Based on these assumptions, there would be 5 trucks
per hour or the equivalent of 10 passenger cars per hour during both peak hours (7:00 AM to 8:00 AM
and 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM). The passenger car conversion provides an equivalent measure of vehicle
volume when analyzing the intersection operations because the length of one dump truck is
approximately equal to the length of two passenger vehicles. Using the same time-frame assumptions,
less than one truck per hour is projected to travel between the two hangars and Fort Wainwright landfill.
Table 3-14 summarizes the peak hour truck trip assumptions.

In addition to the truck trips, there would also be construction worker trips during the AM and PM peak
hours. To analyze the impact that the construction worker trips would have on traffic, an assumption
first had to be made about how the trips would be distributed among the three gates accessing Main
Post. Based on the USACE Economic Impact Forecast System, the demolition would require 32
projected construction workers (see Appendix F). Assuming one daily shift, the construction workers
would arrive at a similar start time during the AM peak hour and depart at a similar end time during the
PM peak hour. Therefore, there would be 32 projected inbound construction worker trips during the
AM peak hour and 32 projected outbound construction worker trips during the PM peak hour.

Chapter 3.0

3-77

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
To determine the distribution of the 32 AM peak hour inbound and PM peak hour outbound projected
construction work trips, the Six-Year Transportation Plan Update turning movement counts at the three
intersections closest to the three Main Post gates were used. The turning movement counts provided the
number of vehicles entering and exiting through the three gates during the AM and PM peak hours, this
number was then converted to a distribution percentage among the three gates. This distribution
percentage was then applied to the number of construction worker trips generated by the Proposed
Action (Table 3-15) and assigned along the most direct route between the two hangars and each gate as
described below:
•

To/from Main Gate: Gaffney Road to Meridian Road to Montgomery Road to the site

•

To/from Trainor Gate: Trainor Gate Road to River Road to Meridian Road to Montgomery
Road to the site

•

To/from Badger Gate: Montgomery Road to the site

Combining the projected construction worker and truck trips (using passenger car equivalents for truck
trips) would result in the following projected peak hour trips:
•

Main Gate would have 17 projected inbound trips (construction workers) and 10 projected
outbound trips (trucks) during the AM peak hour.

•

Trainor Gate would have 8 projected inbound trips during the AM peak hour (construction
workers).

•

Badger Gate would have 17 projected inbound trips (7 construction workers and 10 trucks)
during the AM peak hour.

•

Main Gate would have 28 projected outbound trips (18 construction workers and 10 trucks)
during the PM peak hour.

•

3-78

Trainor Gate would have 8 projected outbound trips during the AM peak hour.

•

Badger Gate would have 10 projected inbound trips (trucks) and 6 projected outbound trips
(construction workers) during the AM peak hour.

For this analysis, only the 12 key Main Post intersections directly affected by the Proposed Action have
been evaluated because the other key intersections identified in the Six-Year Transportation Plan
Update would not be affected. Specifically, a comparison between Alternative 1 and the baseline
condition was performed for each of the 12 intersections to determine what the traffic impact would be,
based on the addition of the temporary construction worker and truck trips. Figure 3-8 shows the
location of the analyzed intersections.
Based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, the same tool used by the Six-Year Transportation Plan
Update, the AM peak hour intersection analysis for the 12 intersections resulted in no change in the
LOS when comparing the baseline to Alternative 1. Two of the intersections that would operate at LOS
F for the baseline (Gaffney Road at 599th Street and Montgomery Road at Santiago Avenue) would
experience approximately a 15-second increase of the average control delay. The remaining
intersections would experience less than a 3-second average control delay difference between the
baseline and Alternative 1. Table 3-16 shows the AM peak hour analysis comparison between baseline
and Alternative 1.
The PM peak hour intersection analysis for the 12 intersections resulted in no change in the LOS when
comparing the baseline to Alternative 1. One of the intersections that would operate at LOS F for the
baseline (Montgomery Road at Santiago Avenue) would experience less than a 7-second average
control delay increase. The remaining intersections would experience less than a 4-second average
control delay increase between the baseline and Alternative 1, including Gaffney Road at 599th Street,
another intersection that would operate at LOS F for the baseline. Table 3-17 shows the PM peak hour
analysis comparison between baseline and Alternative 1.
The maximum number of trips (construction worker and truck trips combined) projected to be entering
or exiting the Main Gate would be 28 trips exiting the Main Gate. The second highest number of
projected trips would be 17 entering Badger Gate and the Main Gate. If 28 vehicles were added each
hour, the result would be the addition of approximately 1 vehicle every 2 minutes along Airport Way.

Based on turning movement counts provided by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public
Facilities for the Airport Way at Richardson Highway / Steese Highway and Montgomery Road at
Badger Road intersections (Anderson, 2013), the new construction worker and truck trips would result
in less than a half of a second average control delay increase per vehicle for both AM and PM peak
hours (using the Highway Capacity Manual [Transportation Research Board, 2000). The Airport Way
at Richardson Highway / Steese Highway intersection would increase by an average control delay of
0.2 seconds per vehicle during the AM peak hour and 0.3 seconds per vehicle during the PM peak hour.
The Montgomery Road at Badger Road intersection would not change during the AM peak hour and
would increase by an average control delay of 0.1 seconds per vehicle during the PM peak hour. Based
on these figures, there would be minor impacts to roadway operations on the off-post roadway network.
Once demolition of the hangars is complete, concrete would be added to the building footprints for
future use as an airfield apron. The asphalt paving on the existing parking lot would be removed and
replaced with grass. Although implementation of Alternative 1 would remove approximately 200
parking spaces, adequate parking would still exist in all active areas of the Main Post. Once demolition
activities are completed, there would be no further impact on the transportation infrastructure as a result
of this alternative.
Implementing Alternative 1 would result in short-term, minor impacts at two already failing
intersections as a result of temporary construction worker and truck trips. Alternative 1 would not result
in significant impacts to traffic or the transportation infrastructure; therefore, no mitigation measures
were identified or would be required; however, as standard practices, BMPs would be employed.
As a BMP during the demolition of the hangars, the Army’s contractor would provide a traffic control
plan and temporary signing plan to provide road access to adjacent occupied building parking lots and
entrances, as well as safety measures for pedestrians and occupants of adjacent buildings. The traffic

3-82

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
control plan would present the placement and times of use for any temporary traffic control devices in
relation to the project site and construction activities and would follow the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices standards. The Army’s contractor would also maintain and protect traffic on affected
on-post roads during the construction period. This would include implementing measures for the
protection and diversion of general traffic (watchman, flagmen, barricades, temporary lighting,
signing), minimizing interference with general traffic along the proposed truck haul route on post, and
investigating the adequacy of existing roads and bridge allowable limits.

3.8.2.3

Alternative 2: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, while Hangars 2 and 3 remain intact there would be no impact on
transportation since they would continue to remain vacant. Given the deteriorated nature of the hangars,
the fact that they would not be rehabilitated, and as future systems fail they will not be repaired or
replaced, it is assumed that they would eventually collapse on their own. When this occurs, the Army
would remove the debris, disposing of it in the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfill (if the buildings
collapse after September 2015 then all material would be disposed of at the FNSB landfill since the Fort
Wainwright landfill will close on that date and will no longer be able to accept ACBM) and place
airfield concrete apron within the footprints of the hangars after the debris is removed. These activities
would involve the same number of construction worker and truck trips as calculated and described
under Alternative 1, and would result in the same short-term, minor impacts as described under
Alternative 1 associated with the increase in temporary construction worker and truck trips during the
demolition of both hangars. Once the debris from the collapsed hangars is removed and the airfield
concrete apron is placed in the footprints of the buildings, there would be no long-term impacts on
traffic.
With no significant impacts under Alternative 2, no mitigation measures were identified or needed;
though the same BMPs identified under Alternative 1 also would be employed under Alternative 2
during the removal of the demolition debris.

3.9

Cumulative Effects

In addition to identifying the direct and indirect environmental impacts of their actions, the CEQ’s
NEPA regulations require federal agencies to address cumulative impacts related to their proposals. A
cumulative impact is defined in the CEQ regulations (40 CFR §1508.7) as “the impact on the
environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person

Chapter 3.0

3-83

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively
significant actions taking place over a period of time.” This section describes the process used to
identify potential cumulative impacts related to the Proposed Action at Fort Wainwright and discusses
those impacts for each of the resources addressed earlier in this chapter in Sections 3.2 through 3.8.

3.9.1

Approach for Assessing Cumulative Effects

Guidance used for preparing the cumulative effects analysis includes:
•

CEQ’s NEPA implementing regulations (40 CFR §1500–1508)

•

Environmental Analysis of Army Actions (32 CFR §651)

•

Considering Cumulative Effects under the National Environmental Policy Act, 1997

•

CEQ’s Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis, 2005

•

U.S. Army Environmental Command’s NEPA Analysis Guidance Manual, 2007

The process outlined by CEQ includes identifying significant cumulative effects issues, establishing the
relevant geographic and temporal (time frame) extent of the cumulative effects analysis, identifying
other actions affecting the resources of concern, establishing the cause-and-effect relationship between
the Proposed Action and the cumulative impacts, determining the magnitude and significance of the
cumulative effects, and identifying ways in which the agency’s proposal might be modified to avoid,
minimize, or mitigate significant cumulative impacts.
Issues to be addressed in the cumulative effects analysis were determined based on the identification of
resources that would be directly or indirectly affected by the alternatives being considered for
implementing the Proposed Action (see Table 3-18). These resources, discussed earlier in this chapter,
were identified based on information received during internal and public scoping or through the
analysis of direct and indirect effects that have the potential to combine with other past, present, or
reasonably foreseeable future actions to produce a larger impact. If the analysis demonstrated there
would be no direct or indirect impact to a resource, it was not included in the cumulative effects
analysis because the Proposed Action would not add to the cumulative impact.

CEQ regulations specify that cumulative effects analyses encompass past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions. Actions considered in this cumulative effects analysis are identified in
Section 3.9.2. As a practical matter, the impacts of past actions are already reflected in the conditions
that currently exist, as described earlier in this chapter in the Affected Environment section of each
resource area. For example, past actions on Fort Wainwright affecting the Ladd Field NHL and Cold
War Historic District are already considered in the Affected Environment section of Cultural Resources
in the discussion of the existing integrity of the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District.
Nevertheless, several past actions have occurred that could contribute to cumulative effects and whose
impacts are not reflected in the baseline described in the Affected Environment section of each resource
area. As a result, these additional past actions are included in the cumulative effects analysis and are
identified in Table 3-20, Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions, below. The

Chapter 3.0

3-85

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
projects are generally located outside of the ROIs analyzed in the Environmental Consequences section
of each resource area, but could still contribute to cumulative effects, particularly with respect to the
Ladd Field NHL. Present and reasonably foreseeable future actions are considered as those that
currently exist or are under construction, are the subject of an existing plan or proposal, or have
identified funding. Actions beyond that become increasingly speculative and difficult to assess.

3.9.2

Geographic Scope

In general, the geographic scope, or ROI, for direct and indirect impacts of the Proposed Action at Fort
Wainwright includes the installation itself as well as FNSB (see Table 3-19 below). Because of the
unique nature of World War II resources in Alaska, the geographic scope for the cumulative effects
analysis for cultural resources has been expanded to include World War II resources in Alaska, and
more specifically the World War II NHLs in Alaska.

Past Actions

In accordance with CEQ guidelines as outlined in a 2005 memorandum, the discussion of past actions
within this cumulative effects analysis focuses not on the historical details of individual past actions but
rather on the aggregate effects of past actions and how they relate to the potential impacts of the
Proposed Action.

Fort Wainwright
Residential Communities Initiative
Under the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI), the USAG FWA transferred responsibility for
providing Family Housing and ancillary supporting facilities to Army Alaska Family Housing, a limited
liability company composed of the Army and Actus Lend Lease. The USAG FWA conveyed, via lease,
all military Family Housing units and selected ancillary supporting facilities to Army Alaska Family
Housing. The USAG FWA also granted a 50-year ground lease (with an optional 25-year extension) for
the areas on which the housing and facilities are located and for additional non-housing areas. The
USAG FWA and Army Alaska Family Housing developed the Community Development and
Management Plan to implement the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (USACE, 2008). During
the first five years of the Community Development and Management Plan (2009–2013), Army Alaska
Family Housing constructed an estimated 524 units, demolished an estimated 685 units, and revitalized
an estimated 321 units. Because the RCI footprint is within an active NPL site, established under

3-88

Chapter 3.0

CERCLA, every parcel within the footprint is governed by the Fort Wainwright Federal Facility
Agreement and the institutional controls identified in related documents.

The Army is reorganizing and augmenting its aviation assets in Alaska to become a front line aviation
unit with an increased combat-readiness capacity. This includes stationing of additional Soldiers and
helicopters, construction of a number of facilities within the Fort Wainwright cantonment area, and
increased aviation training on Army lands and within airspace in Alaska. Existing USARAK aviation
assets will be converted into a Task Force consisting of approximately 1,200 personnel and 72
helicopters. An additional 710 Soldiers and 40 helicopters will augment USARAK’s existing aviation
assets of approximately 490 personnel and 32 helicopters. To accommodate the stationing and training
of new aviation assets new buildings, parking areas, and fencing will need to be constructed along with
the renovation or demolition of other structures.
New construction at Fort Wainwright will encompass approximately 2,379,159 square feet (54.6 acres),
focusing primarily around the existing active military runway and occurring within the boundaries of
already existing buildings. Most of the areas considered for new construction have been disturbed
previously by military activities. The new construction will support indoor storage of 100 percent of the
Task Force’s aviation inventory, as well as other required facilities. New construction is occurring in
phases and is described below. In addition to new construction, the demolition of three facilities will
also occur (approximately 47,675 square feet): Building 3475 (shipping and receiving and
administrative), Building 3477 (vehicle maintenance shop), and Building 3011 (water treatment
building). This is a four phase project.
•

Aviation Task Force Complex Phase 1—This phase of the standard design Aviation Task
Force Complex included constructing barracks, a consolidated vehicle maintenance facility,
aircraft parts storage building and vehicle parking. Supporting facilities include utilities;
electric service; water, sewer, steam connections, paving, walks, curbs and gutters; parking;
storm drainage; site improvements and information systems. Accessibility for individuals with
disabilities was provided in public areas. Anti-terrorism measures also were provided.

•

Aviation Task Force Complex Phase 2—This phase included constructing an OH-58D
aircraft maintenance hangar, a four-plex Company Operations Facility, rotary wing parking,
Organizational Unit storage, and a water deluge pump house. Intrusion Detection Systems,
Mass Notifications Systems, Energy Monitoring and Control Systems, Keyless Lock System,

electric service; water, sewer, and steam connections; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; parking;
storm drainage; site improvements and information systems. Accessibility for individuals with
disabilities will be provided for administrative facilities. AT/FP measures will be provided.
This phase also included the demolishing of three buildings totaling 41,639 square feet.

Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions

Fort Wainwright
DoD and Veterans Affairs Family Care and Behavioral Health Clinic (FY 17)
This project would construct a new DoD and Veterans Affairs Family Care and Behavioral Health
Clinic to replace the Kamish Troop Medical Clinic (TMC) (Building 3406). The new facility will house
the stationing actions for the Integrated Disability Evaluation System, along with several other health
care entities. Construction of the new facility will begin in 2017. In the interim, interior modifications
will be made to the Kamish TMC to support the Integrated Disability Evaluation System. The new
87,845-square-foot facility will be constructed at the southwestern corner of the intersection of Alder
Avenue and South Gate Road.
The building will be designed, by 2018, to serve approximately 25,768 DoD/Veterans Affairs personnel
and their dependents and accommodate 411 parking spaces. Fort Wainwright would gain approximately
12 personnel as a result of this new facility. The total project footprint is approximately 21 acres, of
which approximately half would be occupied by the new building, associated parking spaces, and
landscaping.

Army Force Structure Realignment 2020
The Army is proposing to conduct force reductions and realign existing forces from FY 13 through
FY 20 to shape a force of a size and configuration that is capable of meeting current and future national
security and defense requirements. The Army’s Active Duty end strength will decline from an
authorized FY 12 end strength of 562,000 to 490,000. Under Alternative 1 of the Army Force Structure
Realignment 2020, Fort Wainwright’s population could decrease by up to 4,900 personnel, while under
Alternative 2, Fort Wainwright’s population could increase by up to 1,000 personnel. No decision has
been made yet on this proposal.

Regional
Relocation of 18th Aggressor Squadron from Eielson Air Force Base to Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska
The Air Force is proposing to relocate the 18th Aggressor Squadron (18 AGRS) from Eielson AFB to
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER). The 18 AGRS consists of 18 assigned F-16 aircraft and 3
back-up F-16 aircraft. This proposed relocation includes removing 623 military personnel from Eielson
AFB, transferring approximately 542 positions to JBER, and eliminating 81 positions.
Eielson AFB will continue to host Red Flag and Distant Frontier training exercises with the 18 AGRS
operating out of JBER under one of two possible alternatives:
•

Alternative 1—The 18 AGRS would deploy to Eielson AFB for the duration of the Red Flag
exercises.

•

Alternative 2—The 18 AGRS F-16 aircraft would fly to and from the Joint Pacific Alaska
Range Complex Military Operations Areas in the vicinity of Eielson AFB on a daily basis
during exercises, requiring aerial refueling. The participating F-16 aircraft would not routinely
land at Eielson AFB for refueling.

Under both alternatives, aircraft would operate in the same air space as currently used for Red Flag and
Distant Frontier exercises. Transient aircraft and personnel from outside of Alaska participating in these
exercises would continue to deploy to and operate out of Eielson AFB. Keeping the 18 AGRS stationed
at Eielson AFB and not implementing this Proposed Action is also a possibility.

Cultural Resources—Actions Affecting World War II Resources in Alaska
World War II Resources in Alaska

Because of their significant role in World War II, specifically with regard to Lend-Lease Operations,
military build-up and support, and military actions in the North Pacific and Aleutian campaign, many of
Alaska’s World War II-era resources have been documented and studied in depth. In August 1984, as
part of its historic preservation compliance obligations under the Defense Environmental Restoration
Program, the USACE Alaska District entered into a Programmatic MOA with the ACHP, the NPS, and
the Alaska SHPO that stipulated the completion of a comprehensive study and plan for World War II
resources in Alaska. The report, World War II in Alaska: A Historic Resources and Management Plan,
provided a historic overview of World War II in Alaska, described significant associated events, and
presented a detailed bibliography of World War II sources. The report also identified resources for

3-92

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
preservation and developed a preservation plan for the resources (Envirosphere Company, 1988). The
report identified 135 sites associated with the World War II in an Alaska historic context (Envirosphere
Company, 1988).
The report also identified more than 50 World War II building and structure types constructed at Alaska
wartime installations, including housing and personnel facilities, industrial buildings, infrastructure,
docking facilities, artillery facilities, aircraft warning systems, and aircraft facilities. Among the seven
Army and Navy hangar types identified, Birchwood hangars were described as “constructed of 150’
bowstring trusses supported by timber columns, with 25’ wide lean-to on both sides; concrete floor and
foundations; overall dimension 202’ by either 200’ or 300’” (Envirosphere Company, 1988). Wartime
examples of these hangars were noted at Ladd Field, Nome, Galena, Mile 26 Air Field, Fort Glenn,
Amchitka, and Shemya.

3.9.4.2

Alaska’s World War II National Historic Landmarks

In 1984, the Secretary of the Interior took steps to acknowledge the importance of Alaska’s role in
World War II history by designating eight sites in the state as NHLs. Each of these NHLs was identified
through the NPS’ World War II in the Pacific initiative and includes former Army and Navy bases,
Aleutian battlefields, airfields, and an area on Kiska Island once occupied by the Japanese. The eight
World War II-related military sites in Alaska are NHLs:
•

Adak Army and Naval Operations Base, Adak Island

•

Attu Battlefield and Bases, Attu Island

•

Fort Glenn (Cape Field), Umnak Island

•

Dutch Harbor Naval Base and Fort Mears, U.S. Army, Unalaska Island

•

Japanese Occupation Site, Kiska Island

•

Kodiak Naval Operating Base and Forts Greely and Abercrombie, Kodiak Island

•

Ladd Field (Fort Wainwright), Fairbanks

•

Sitka Naval Base and U.S. Army Coastal Defenses, Sitka

Although several of the properties consisted of facilities related to aircraft function (hangars, runways,
servicing facilities), most of those resources were either non-extant at the time of the nomination, were
in a deteriorated state, or have been demolished since that time. The USFWS and the NPS, Alaska
Region jointly operate several of the NHLs, the Ounalashka Corporation owns most of the land in the
Dutch Harbor NHL on Amaknak Island, and some parcels are operated in conjunction with the NPS or
are privately held (Clemens, 2012).

Chapter 3.0

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
These NHL properties represent the most significant World War II sites in the state. The conditions at
Ladd Field have been noted above, while current conditions at the other NHLs vary in integrity. At the
Attu and Kiska NHLs, some building foundations are extant and wartime ammunition dumps and
airstrips still exist. Attu maintains its integrity as the site of the only World War II battle fought on the
North American continent and is largely interpreted as a battlefield site. At Adak, four Kodiak T-type
wartime hangars had been demolished at the time of its NHL nomination (1984), and the sole surviving
wooden hangar on the property (out of the original eight such hangars) was in such a dilapidated
condition that it was deemed “not worthy of preservation” (Thompson, 1984b). A commemorative
marker at Adak indicates the location of the last surviving wooden hangar that was flattened during a
strong wind in the winter of 1995 (Navy, 2012). A Birchwood hangar was completed in 1944 at Cape
Field, Fort Glenn, and housed the Air Base Headquarters. Although extant at the time of the NHL
nomination and the 1994 NHL update, the 1994 NHL update noted that the hangar was “greatly
deteriorated.” Vacant and open to destructive winds, large gaping holes in the wood and steel structure
were noted; no update on the hangar’s condition has been submitted since that time (Cook, 1994;
Clemens, 2012). The Naval Operating Base at Dutch Harbor built just south of Mount Ballyhoo was
intensely built up during World War II; however, the 1984 NHL nomination noted that although most
structures associated with the airfield remained (including a double hangar), they were fast deteriorating
and some were already in a ruinous condition (Thompson, 1984c). The 1984 nomination for the landplane airfield at the Naval Operating Base at Kodiak noted that nothing remained of 25 wartime hangars
constructed at the installation, although some of the seaplane hangars were still extant and at the time
used by the U.S. Coast Guard (Thompson, 1984d).

3.9.4.3

World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument

In 2008, President George W. Bush issued Presidential Proclamation 8327 that established the World
War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument (USFWS and NPS, 2010). The monument consists of
World War II battlefields, sites, and other historic features in Hawaii, Alaska, and California that
contribute to the broad story of World War II in the Pacific Region. The Alaska Unit of this monument
includes historic resources on Atka, Kiska, Little Kiska, and Attu islands. All sites in the monument are
on lands that the USFWS manages as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (formerly
the Aleutian Islands Reservation). Some of the land in the National Monument overlaps with two of
Alaska’s NHLs—the Attu Battlefield and the Army and Navy Airfields on Attu and the Japanese
Occupation Site on Kiska (USFWS and NPS, 2010). Designation of these sites as part of the National
Monument reaffirms their national significance (USFWS and NPS, 2010). The purpose of the Alaska
Unit of the National Monument is to honor Soldiers and civilians and their sacrifices by protecting

3-94

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
World War II landscapes, sites, and artifacts; to promote research; and to tell the stories of war in the
North Pacific (USFWS and NPS, 2010).

3.9.5

Methodology

A primary goal of this cumulative effects analysis is to provide the decision maker with an awareness
and functional view of the longer-term potential implications and consequences associated with
implementing the Proposed Action in combination with other past, present and reasonably foreseeable
future actions within the region. Each resource analyzed in detail in this Draft EIS was evaluated to
determine the appropriate level for cumulative effects analysis. A series of “quick look” questions was
developed based on CEQ and Army guidelines. The “quick look” questions facilitate orientation of the
issues, consider potential incremental effects of the proposed action, and identify those resources that
may be subject to cumulative effects. Based on the answers to these questions, each resource was then
placed in one of the three following analysis categories as shown in Table 3-21. See Appendix I for the
individual resource area quick look questions and answers.
•

Level 1: The Quick Look Level—If the quick look answers indicate that likely impacts are
quite small or can be mitigated and will be unlikely to contribute to significant direct or indirect
impacts on the resource, then the analysis does not need to be extensive and can be quite brief.

•

Level 2: The Analysis and Discussion Level—Additional analyses may be required to
thoroughly answer the questions and should be more thoroughly documented, though it still
should be “…in proportion to the nature and severity of the issues addressed; and they should
focus on those issues that interest the decision maker and the public” (32 CFR §651).

•

Level 3: The Detailed Analysis Level—If the analyses identify any potential direct or indirect
effects that cannot be mitigated or could contribute to the cumulative effects, a more rigorous
analysis is required and should be documented. Detailed analysis is required when the
likelihood of significant effects is greatly increased.

Based on the conclusions of the direct and indirect impact analysis conducted for Demolition of
Hangars 2 and 3 (Alternative 1) and the No Action Alternative (Alternative 2), answers to the quick
look questions (see Appendix I), and a review of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions and their associated potential impacts within the ROI, it was determined that a Level 1 analysis
would be appropriate for air quality, safety, environmental justice and protection of children,

Chapter 3.0

3-95

of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
sustainability, and transportation. Cultural resources and hazardous materials/hazardous waste were the
only resources determined to require a Level 2 analysis. No resources were determined to need a Level
3 analysis.

Cumulative Effects Analysis—Level 1: Quick Look

The proposed alternatives were determined to contribute minimally to cumulative effects on the
following resource areas within the geographic and temporal scope of analysis.

3.9.6.1

Air Quality

Both Alternative 1 and the No Action Alternative analyzed in this Draft EIS could have some adverse
effect on regional air quality if implemented, though very minor. These impacts include emissions of
criteria pollutants including fugitive dust, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide; all of
which would be emitted to varying degrees under each alternative. Overall, such emissions are minor
and temporary. Under both alternatives, there would be long-term, beneficial impacts from the
demolition/removal of both hangars and the reduction from the current heating and electrical load on
the CHPP; though the benefits under the No Action Alternative would be delayed compared to
Alternative 1.
Both alternatives would result in direct emissions of GHG. Direct emissions would be produced via
mobile sources, such as construction vehicles. CO2 resulting from burning fossil fuels in a vehicle
engine would be the primary GHG produced under each alternative; however, the amount of GHGs
produced from these vehicles would be short term and minor. In the long term, both alternatives would
result in the demolition of both hangars, which would reduce the heating demand on the CHPP and
result in fewer GHGs emitted from the facility. Consequently, on a project basis, impacts from GHG
emissions are expected to be minimal.

3-96

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Fort Wainwright is within the portion of FNSB that is in nonattainment for PM2.5 and maintenance for
CO. FNSB is in attainment for all other criteria pollutants. Past construction projects, including the RCI
initiative, resulted in short-term impacts during construction and increased the long-term load on the
CHPP. Similarly, ongoing and future projects that involve construction would be expected to contribute
short-term impacts during construction and long-term impacts from increased heating and electrical
demand, as well as any vehicle emissions from additional employees or residents. The increase in
aviation activities at Fort Wainwright would continue to contribute adverse impacts to air quality.
Because the addition of criteria pollutants associated with demolition and construction under both
alternatives is minor and short term, and long-term beneficial for two criteria pollutants and GHGs, no
regional changes to air quality attainment status are expected, even in combination with other local
activities.
Overall, when considered in combination with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions
(Table 3-20), effects of the proposed alternatives on regional air quality are expected to be minor.

3.9.6.2

Safety

Under Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, no cumulative impacts to safety would be
expected because as discussed in Section 3.5.2, the alternative would remove the risk of structural
failure of the buildings and the existing hazardous materials and hazardous waste, thereby avoiding the
risk of the buildings collapsing as well as exposure of the contaminants to the environment. The C&D
debris from the demolition would be removed and disposed of in compliance with applicable
regulations and requirements. Therefore, within the area that includes Hangars 2 and 3 and the
immediate vicinity, Alternative 1 would result in beneficial impacts to safety because of the removal of
the potential risks. By following applicable regulations for packing and hauling hazardous materials and
abiding by posted speed limits and road weight limits, Fort Wainwright contractor would ensure that
safety would not be compromised when hauling the debris along the truck routes to the Fort
Wainwright and FNSB landfills.
Under the No Action Alternative, the continued degradation of the hangars and potential structural
failure of the buildings would pose safety concerns within the area that includes Hangars 2 and 3 and
the immediate vicinity. These would result in long-term, moderate impacts on safety. Therefore, until
the buildings collapse and the debris is removed and disposed of, the No Action Alternative of the
Proposed Action contributes to overall safety concerns at Fort Wainwright. Of the past, present and
future projects included in this EIS for cumulative impacts analysis, the EIS for the Stationing and
Training of Increased Aviation Assets at Fort Wainwright identified less than significant impacts on

Chapter 3.0

3-97

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
safety. The combined cumulative impacts to safety would also be less than significant because each
project would result in less than significant impacts and because the safety concerns and impacts under
the No Action Alternative would be confined to a limited area. After the collapse of the buildings, the
C&D debris from the demolition would be removed and disposed of in compliance with applicable
regulations and requirements. Additionally, by following applicable regulations for packing and hauling
hazardous materials and abiding by posted speed limits and road weight limits, Fort Wainwright
contractors would ensure that safety would not be compromised when hauling the debris along the truck
routes to the Fort Wainwright and FNSB landfills. Therefore, short-term, minor impacts would be
anticipated under the No Action Alternative at that stage and would not be expected to contribute
significantly to cumulative impacts to safety at Fort Wainwright or along the haul routes to FNSB
landfill.

3.9.6.3

Environmental Justice and Protection of Children

As identified in Section 3.6.2, no environmental justice impacts or impacts to children are anticipated as
a result of Alternative 1 or the No Action Alternative. Implementation of these alternatives is not
expected to result in any disproportionately high and adverse impacts on the human health or
environment of minority or low-income populations or on children. Therefore, implementation of these
alternatives is not expected to contribute cumulatively to environmental justice impacts or impacts to
children when the impacts of these alternatives are considered along with the identified environmental
justice impacts and impacts to children of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.

3.9.6.4

Sustainability

The demolition of the hangars under Alternative 1 would have short-term, minor impacts on
sustainability from the loss of embodied energy within the hangars, the requirement of new materials
(e.g., new concrete for the aircraft parking apron), the generation of construction emissions, and the
inability to recycle or reuse all of the materials. Long-term, beneficial impacts under Alternative 1
would result from reduced energy consumption, cost savings, and the ability to recycle materials not
currently being used. Impacts under the No Action Alternative would be moderate and result from
wasted energy and funds being contributed to the unused hangars, the hangars having outlived their
intended lifespan, and their assumed eventual collapse, which would reduce the amount of material that
could be potentially recycled or reused.
The RCI involved the construction of an estimated 524 housing units, demolition of an estimated 685
units, and revitalization of an estimated 321 units. All new construction and renovated units adhered to

3-98

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
sustainable construction standards and were required to achieve a gold rating through the Sustainable
Project Rating Tool, which examines site, water, energy and overall building sustainability and work in
helping the Army meet its sustainability goals. While the development of these residential units leads to
an increase in demand for regional energy and utility resources, based on the relatively small scale of
units compared to the region as a whole, energy demand as a result of these units is considered minimal.
Activities associated with Phases 1 through 4 of the Stationing and Training of Increased Aviation
Assets, and the Golf Course Club House and Winter Activity Center have or will place additional
demands on energy resources through the construction and operation of new and proposed facilities.
These demands are not expected to have any significant impacts on energy demand, with impacts being
minor nor any impacts to the ability of utility providers to provide energy. All new associated
construction activities associated with DoD facilities are required to obtain LEED Silver status and,
therefore, they help the Army to meet its sustainability goals because they are required to adhere to
more sustainable construction practices and are in general more energy efficient. The proposed 87,845
DoD and Veteran Affairs Family Care and Behavioral Clinic and demolition of the Kamish TMC
would have some adverse impacts to sustainability. These impacts would stem from the demolition of
the Kamish TMC and the loss of embodied energy and of materials that could not be recycled. Impacts
would also come from new materials and construction emissions required to construct the new facility.
The facility would obtain LEED Silver status and likely be more efficient than the existing Kamish
TMC leading to some beneficial impacts. It is expected that the construction and operation of this
facility would have only minor impacts to energy demand or the utility provider’s ability to provide
energy and by obtaining LEED status would help the Army meet its sustainability goals.
Alternative 2 under the Army Force Structure Realignment 2020 proposes to increase the Fort
Wainwright population by up to 1,000 personnel. In the instance that Fort Wainwright does receive
more personnel, it is likely that additional facilities would be needed. These facilities would be required
to obtain LEED Silver status, helping contribute to the Army sustainability goals, and while putting
additional demand on regional utility and energy resources, it is not expected that this demand would be
significant. In the event that the population at Fort Wainwright is reduced under Army Force Structure
Realignment 2020, it is possible that some of the existing resources at Fort Wainwright would no longer
be needed. If existing resources/buildings are removed, it is expected that materials would be recycled
to the greatest extent possible and that energy resources would be used as efficiently as possible
resulting in no impacts to sustainability or Army sustainability goals.

Chapter 3.0

3-99

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Based on the above-mentioned cumulative impacts to sustainability in conjunction with the alternatives
of this Draft EIS it is expected that combined these actions would result in a minor impact to local
energy demand, would not impact the ability of regional utilities to provide energy, and would not be
significant in the context of sustainability. Overall impacts to sustainability as a result of new
construction and operation are expected to be minor and based on construction and operation
requirements at Fort Wainwright would work in helping the Army meet its sustainability goals.

3.9.6.5

Transportation

Alternative 1 would take place beginning in spring 2014 and last approximately six months. None of
the reasonably foreseeable future actions are expected to be under construction (heath clinic) or
implemented (changes in personnel at Fort Wainwright or Eielson AFB) during 2014. Therefore, there
would be short-term, minor, cumulative impacts associated with an increase in traffic generated by
construction workers and dump trucks during the Alternative 1 construction period, plus the additional
traffic caused by the past and present projects. This additional traffic volume would affect travel times
and intersection operations at Montgomery and Gaffney Roads, Luzon and Santiago Avenues, and
Main Post access control point delays during morning and evening peak hours. As discussed in Sections
3.8.3.2 and 3.8.3.3, Alternative 1 would have impacts at two already failing intersections. Potential
transportation impacts would be localized to the two intersections and would occur during AM and PM
peak hours only and would not result in a decrease in the level of service to the road system. These
impacts would start and end with the construction phase, lasting six-months, and would contribute only
slightly to cumulative impacts.
Because the No Action Alternative does not have a time frame, the cumulative impacts would differ
depending on the timing of the structural failure of Hangars 2 and 3. If the structural failure were to
occur prior to the implementation of any of the military staffing level change actions (Army Force
Structure Realignment 2020), there would be a short-term, minor contribution to cumulative impacts to
the roadway system. This would mainly impact roadways serving the airfield (Montgomery and
Gaffney Roads and Luzon and Santiago Avenues), affecting travel times and intersection operations
during morning and evening peak hours along the above-mentioned roadways and Main Post access
control points. If the structural failure were to occur during and after implementation of any of the
military staffing level change actions (Army Force Structure Realignment 2020), there would be either
no contribution to cumulative impacts if the full staff levels were to drop or a minor contribution to
cumulative impacts to the Main Post roadways serving the airfield (Gaffney and Montgomery Roads,
and Luzon and Santiago Avenues) if the staff levels were to increase. This would affect travel times and

3-100

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
intersection operations during morning and evening peak hours along the above-mentioned roadways
and Main Post access control point delays.
During the demolition of the hangars, the Army’s contractor would provide a traffic control plan and
temporary signing plan to provide road access to adjacent occupied building parking lots and entrances
as well as safety measures for pedestrians and occupants of adjacent buildings. The traffic control plan
would present the placement and times of use for temporary traffic control devices in relationship to the
project site and construction activities and should follow the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices standards. The Army’s contractor would also maintain and protect traffic on affected on-post
roads during the construction period. This would include implementing measures for the protection and
diversion of general traffic (watchman, flagmen, barricades, temporary lighting, signing), minimizing
interference with general traffic along the proposed truck haul route on post, and investigating the
adequacy of existing roads and bridge allowable limits.
The updated evaluation in the Six-Year Transportation Plan Update recommends roadway, intersection,
and pedestrian improvements necessary to maintain the efficient and safe function and operation of
installation roadways. Overall, the plan recommends improvements at seven locations due to safety and
capacity issues. These recommended improvements would result in intersection operations that comply
with the criteria of LOS C or better from the USAG FWA Directorate of Public Works through the
2015 analysis year.

3.9.7

Cumulative Effects Analysis—Level 2: Analysis and Discussion

Additional cumulative effects and analyses are required to thoroughly answer the Quick Look questions
and document geographic and temporal cumulative impacts of the proposed alternatives on the resource
areas presented below: cultural resources and hazardous materials and hazardous waste.

3.9.7.1

Cultural Resources

Geographic Scope, Time Frame, and Impact Criteria
Although Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing resources to both the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War
Historic District, they primarily derive their significance from their wartime construction and activities,
so any impacts to them would result in impacts to the larger collection of World War II-related historic
properties in Alaska. Because of the unique nature of World War II resources in Alaska, the USAG
FWA considered the cumulative effect of the action and no action alternatives on World War II-related
historic properties and NHLs in Alaska. The geographic scope for these analyses, therefore, extends to

Chapter 3.0

3-101

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
the state of Alaska. Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions date back to 1945 and the
end of World War II (when disposal of some military properties occurred) and extends to 2020 (when
the Army Force Structure Realignment 2020 is expected to be completed). The significance threshold
for any cumulative effects would be triggered by changes to historic resources that would diminish their
ability to convey their historical significance, as described in Section 3.3.2.1.
Although Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing resources to the Cold War Historic District, impacts to Cold
War resources are not evaluated for the cumulative effects analysis because the hangars primarily
possess significance as World War II-related aircraft buildings and as contributing resources to the
Ladd Field NHL. The hangars’ association with the Cold War Historic District is secondary to their
original period of significance and function. The greatest effects, therefore, would be impacts to World
War II-related resources.

Cause-and and-Effect Relationships
Section 3.3.2 describes the important cause-and-effect relationships affecting cultural resources. Both
alternatives would have the same impact on cultural resources—the physical loss of the hangars. The
impacts from Alternative 1 would occur immediately, while the impacts from the No Action Alternative
would occur later in time. This is a long-term, direct impact. Demolition or structural failure of Hangars
2 and 3, which are contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District,
would diminish the resources’ ability to convey their historical significance. The loss of these hangars
would reduce the number of extant, contributing resources within the two districts. Although this loss is
significant, the impact to the integrity of the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District is
moderate because the majority of intact contributing resources will remain and both districts will retain
sufficient integrity to convey their historic significance.

Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions
Past adverse effects on World War II resources in Alaska are difficult to quantify because official
records of such effects have not been maintained. Immediately following the end of the war, some of
the military facilities were turned over to the War Assets Administration for disposition. The War
Assets Administration transferred ownership of the facilities to local, state, or territorial entities; offered
the surplus facilities to private enterprises; or sold them as scrap. Items included real property,
buildings, equipment, aircraft, and airports.
The effects of time and the harsh Alaskan environment have taken a toll on the World War II resources
in the state. Many of the sites are abandoned or not inhabited and are therefore exposed to vandalism,

3-102

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
along with the slow ravages of time and weather. Some resources listed in or eligible for listing in the
National Register are in a deteriorated state or have been demolished due to deterioration. Some sites
remain active as military installations or as commercial airports; these continuing activities could result
in impacts to the wartime resources as military missions change and new, more modern facilities are
needed to replace aging structures. The remote location of many of the World War II resources,
however, limits their exposure to commercial development pressures.
The Alaska SHPO has provided information that indicates no ongoing list of adverse effects on World
War II resources is maintained in the state, although several examples of recent adverse effects on such
resources can be provided (Rickman, 2012). Some impacts include the demolition in 2011 of two
World War II-era Birchwood hangars at Eareckson Air Station on Shemya Island, which were part of a
World War II historic district. At Sitka, two areas of military support structures within the Sitka Navel
Operating Base World War II NHL have been destroyed. A World War II hangar at the Yakutat Air
Base, which is owned by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, has been
determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register; it is in very poor condition and the current
tenant has substantially altered it. In addition, a large portion of the Alaska Air Depot Historic District
at JBER has been demolished, altered, or is planned to be altered in the future (Rickman, 2012).
Future actions that would affect World War II resources in Alaska or World War II NHLs in Alaska
include the ongoing impacts of time and weather, as noted above. Resources located at active military
installations or active airports may also face impacts from changing military missions and facility
needs, such as the action at JBER (see Section 3.9.3.3). The only reasonably foreseeable future action
identified that could affect the Ladd Field NHL or the Cold War Historic District is the Army Force
Structure Realignment 2020. Whether Fort Wainwright’s personnel population decreases under
Alternative 1 of the proposed realignment or increases under Alternative 2, cultural resources could be
affected. Construction of new facilities and removal of older, less functional facilities could impact
resources in one or both historic districts.

Cumulative Effects of Actions
Alternative 1 would result in the immediate physical loss of Hangars 2 and 3, whereas the effects from
the No Action Alternative would occur later in time. Initially, the No Action Alternative would have no
impact because the hangars would remain physically intact and would receive baseline maintenance,
but they would serve no military function and would remain vacant because of their unsafe status.
Because no full-scale rehabilitation would take place under this alternative, it has the potential to result
indirectly in the structural failure of one or both hangars, which would be a significant impact because it

Chapter 3.0

3-103

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
would mean the loss of contributing resources within an NHL. The loss of the hangars, either through
the direct impact of demolition or the indirect impact of structural failure through no action, would be a
significant impact because two historic resources would be lost. The impact to the Ladd Field NHL and
the Cold War Historic District would be moderate because both would retain historical significance and
would retain their overall historic integrity.
Past adverse effects on World War II resources in Alaska and World War II NHLs in Alaska include
deterioration of resources due to environmental conditions, passage of time, and intentional demolition
of resources. The combined impact of these actions has resulted in a moderate impact to the state’s
collection of World War II resources.
The Proposed Action would result in the loss of two additional World War II buildings, which is a
moderate impact to cultural resources. Combined with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
future actions discussed above, the impacts from the Proposed Action would constitute a moderate
cumulative impact to cultural resources because it is unlikely to contribute significantly to cumulative
impacts to World War II resources in Alaska. Overall, the state’s collection of World War II resources,
including the Ladd Field NHL, would retain their historical significance despite the loss of the two
hangars. The impacts of the Proposed Action to the collection of extant World War II-period aviation
hangars would constitute a moderate cumulative impact to this resource pool. Many World War II
hangars already have been demolished or modified since the end of the war and the loss of Hangars 2
and 3 would contribute to the dwindling numbers of these buildings.

Mitigation
In November 2011, the USAG FWA initiated Section 106 consultation with the Alaska SHPO and
consulting parties to discuss impacts of the Proposed Action to implement a disposition for Hangars 2
and 3 and to determine appropriate mitigation for those impacts. Through this consultation, an MOA
(Appendix A) was drafted that specified the agreed upon mitigation. Because of the large amount of
previous mitigation associated with Hangars 2 and 3 (see Section 3.3.1.4), the Army has determined
that a reduced amount of additional mitigation is appropriate to compensate for the adverse effects of
the Proposed Action. The MOA for the preferred alternative focuses on using existing documentation to
further goals and objectives for public outreach concerning Fort Wainwright’s historic properties,
mainly the Ladd Field NHL and the Cold War Historic District.
Mitigation under the No Action Alternative would be the same as under Alternative 1, Demolition of
Hangars 2 and 3, except that the time frame for completing the stipulations would be based on the date

3-104

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
of execution of the MOA rather than on the demolition of the hangars. The mitigation measures, which
are fully described in the MOA (see Appendix A), are summarized below.
•

Public Outreach—In pursuit of more visibility and appreciation for the Ladd Field NHL, the
USAG FWA Cultural Resources staff would be available upon request to present lectures to
local Fairbanks groups (military and/or non-military) on Fort Wainwright’s World War II
history. The staff would engage the public through previously developed publications and
would submit articles on historic preservation efforts at Fort Wainwright in local and state
publications, websites, and newspapers. Starting six months after the execution of the MOA
and continuing for five years, the USAG FWA would update and seek input from consulting
parties on the public outreach projects.

•

Re-evaluation of the Ladd Field NHL—The USAG FWA would complete a re-evaluation of
the Ladd Field NHL through preparation of a revised draft NHL nomination, including an
analysis of cumulative effects on the Ladd Field NHL from previous demolitions and additions.
The USAG FWA would submit the appropriate documentation to the NPS, Alaska Region,
which would then coordinate with the NHL Program in Washington, D.C. If Alternative 1 were
selected, the USAG FWA would submit the re-evaluation documentation within five years after
demolition of the hangars. If the No Action Alternative were chosen, the USAG FWA would
submit the documentation within five years from the execution of the MOA.

•

Stewardship of the Ladd Field NHL—With the expected loss of Hangars 2 and 3, the USAG
FWA would refocus the efforts of its Public Works staff on effective stewardship through
focused and purposeful management of the remaining elements that comprise the Ladd Field
NHL. The USAG FWA would use existing and currently planned documentation to further
historic preservation objectives and goals including, but not limited to, using the already
developed Design Guidelines for the Ladd Field NHL, the educational PowerPoint
presentations on historic preservation subjects, and the currently planned, but not yet
developed, Historic Buildings Assessment Report. Within one year of completing the Historic
Buildings Assessment Report for the Ladd Field NHL, recommendations from the report would
be submitted for consideration in the Directorate of Public Works Annual Work Plan.

3.9.7.2

Hazardous Materials/Hazardous Waste

Geographic Scope, Time Frame, and Impact Criteria
The geographic scope for hazardous materials and hazardous waste includes the demolition footprint
for Hangars 2 and 3 and the aircraft apron construction footprint. The ROI also includes the Fort

Chapter 3.0

3-105

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
Wainwright and FNSB landfills because of the disposal of the demolition debris, which would include
hazardous materials and hazardous waste. The past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions
date as far back as 2009 and extend to 2020. The significance threshold for any cumulative effects
would be triggered by significant increase in the use of hazardous materials and/or generation of
hazardous waste.

Cause-and-Effect Relationships
The impacts from the increase in use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste would
increase the potential for environmental or human exposure to the toxic substances. Nevertheless,
compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements in the use, handling, removal, storage, and
disposal of the hazardous materials and hazardous waste would ensure that the potential for
environmental or human exposure to the toxic substances is avoided or minimized.

Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions
Under the past actions, the implementation of the RCI resulted in short-term impacts because of the
increase in use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste from the demolition and
construction activities. However, the substances were handled in a manner consistent with applicable
regulations and requirements. Additionally, long-term, minor beneficial impacts resulted from the
removal of lead contaminated soils from Family Housing areas. Phases 1 and 2 of the Stationing and
Training of Increased Aviation Assets included construction and demolition within contaminated areas
and the increase in use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste from the demolition
and construction activities and operations of the facilities. However, the substances were handled and
would continue to be handled in a manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements.
Under the current actions for the Golf Course Club House and Winter Activity Center, it is assumed
that there would be an increase in use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste from
construction activities and operation of the facilities. However, the substances would be handled in a
manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements. Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Stationing
and Training of Increased Aviation Assets includes construction and demolition of facilities within
contaminated areas and the increase in use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste
from the demolition and construction activities and operations of the facilities. However, the substances
have been and would be handled in a manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements.
The debris from the C&D activities would be disposed of in the Fort Wainwright (ACBM) and FNSB
(all other materials) landfills.

Under reasonably foreseeable future actions, three proposed actions are analyzed: DoD and Veterans
Affairs Family Care and Behavioral Health Clinic (FY 17), Army Force Structure Realignment 2020,
and Relocation of the 18 AGRS from Eielson AFB to JBER.
The implementation of the DoD and Veterans Affairs Family Care and Behavioral Health Clinic would
result in an increase in use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste from the
construction activities and operation of the facilities. However, the substances would be handled in a
manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements.
The proposed Army Force Structure Realignment 2020 has two action alternatives: Alternatives 1 and
2, under which Fort Wainwright would lose up to 4,900 or gain up to 1,000 personnel, respectively.
Under Alternative 1, older less efficient facilities may be demolished or renovated, therefore, resulting
in an increase in the short-term use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste from
demolition and construction activities. However, the loss of up to 4,900 personnel would result in longterm decrease in the use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste associated with the
operations of the facilities. Alternative 2 of the proposed Army Force Structure Realignment 2020
would result in an increase in short-term use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste
from the demolition and construction activities. The gain of up to 1,000 personnel would result in longterm increase in the use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste associated with the
operations of the facilities. Under either of the alternatives, the substances would be handled in a
manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements.
The Fort Wainwright landfill, which only accepts ACBM, is scheduled to close September 2015; for
installation projects occurring after that date, all C&D debris, including ACBM would be disposed of at
the FNSB landfill.
Relocation of the 18 AGRS from Eielson AFB to JBER is proposed to consolidate Eielson AFB
functions and operations to reduce energy and sustainment costs and vacate several facilities, making
them available for re-use or demolition. Therefore, it is likely that the proposed actions would result in
an increase in short-term use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste from the
demolition and construction activities. The substances would be handled in a manner consistent with
applicable regulations and requirements. The loss of personnel from relocation would likely result in a
long-term decrease in the use of hazardous materials and generation of hazardous waste associated with
the operations of the facilities. Because of compliance with applicable regulations and requirements and
sufficient capacity at the landfills, the past, present, and future of the projects did not or would not
result in significant impacts.

Chapter 3.0

3-107

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

Cumulative Effects of Actions
Alternative 1, Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3, would result in long-term, beneficial impacts because
hazardous materials, hazardous waste, and potentially contaminated soils associated with the hangars
would be removed and the risk of potential exposure to the environment would be avoided or
minimized. Short-term, minor impacts are anticipated during the demolition and construction activities
from an increase in the amount of hazardous materials used and hazardous waste generated. The
substances would be handled in a manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements. The
disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous waste would require space at the Fort Wainwright
landfill (for ACBM) and the FNSB landfill (for other hazardous materials and hazardous waste).
Sufficient capacity exists in the landfills for the amounts estimated under the Proposed Action during
the proposed time frame of summer 2014. Therefore, the contribution from Alternative 1 to cumulative
impacts at the installation or the landfills is not anticipated to be significant.
Under the No Action Alternative, moderate impacts related to hazardous materials, hazardous waste,
and potentially contaminated soils would be expected. Although the USAG FWA would continue to
follow its current procedures regarding the management of hazardous materials and hazardous waste on
Fort Wainwright, the continued degradation of the hangars would result in an increased risk of exposure
to the environment from potentially contaminated soils, hazardous materials, and hazardous waste.
These types of exposures could occur if the buildings deteriorate to the point where the interiors are
exposed to the elements or the buildings collapse. If the buildings collapse, the focused removal and
disposal of the hazardous materials and hazardous waste would be difficult and could result in
contaminating demolition debris that otherwise could be diverted from the landfills. This scenario could
result in approximately 25,216 cubic yards of C&D debris requiring disposal as ACBM or hazardous
materials and hazardous waste. However, the impacts to the FNSB landfill capacity is anticipated to be
minor and not significant because in FY 11, approximately 298 tons per day of refuse material was
taken to the landfill, and the landfill is projected to be operational until the year 2086. Additionally, the
substances would be handled in a manner consistent with applicable regulations and requirements.
Therefore, the contribution under the No Action Alternative to cumulative impacts at the installation or
the landfills is not anticipated to be significant.

Mitigation
Because of compliance with regulations for handling, removing, transporting, and disposing of
hazardous materials and hazardous waste for all of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future

3-108

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
actions, no cumulative, adverse impacts are anticipated; therefore, it is not anticipated that additional
mitigation would be required.

3.10 Summary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures
Table 3-22 summarizes the environmental impacts associated with each alternative for each resource
area evaluated in this Draft EIS. Mitigation measures are summarized following Table 3-22. In addition
to direct and indirect and cumulative impacts, CEQ’s NEPA regulation 40 CFR §1502.16 requires
identification of many irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources, adverse environmental
impacts that cannot be avoided, and the relationship between short-term uses of the environment and
the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, if an alternative is implemented.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
For all of the resource areas, except cultural resources, none of the effects of the Proposed Action
would result in significant impacts; therefore, no mitigation measures are needed and none were
identified. For cultural resources, the loss of the hangars as contributing resources to the Ladd Field
NHL and the Cold War Historic District, either through demolition under Alternative 1 or the likely
uncontrolled collapse of the buildings under the No Action Alternative, would be a severe impact.
Despite the physical loss of the hangars, the impact on the overall integrity of the Ladd Field NHL and
Cold War Historic District would be moderate. Because of the adverse impacts on the Ladd Field NHL
and the Cold War Historic District, mitigation measures were developed and agreed upon in an MOA
among the USAG FWA, the Alaska SHPO, and the ACHP through the Section 106 consultation
process. Because the end state of the hangars is anticipated to be the same under either alternative, the
same mitigation is proposed for both alternatives. The only difference is that under the No Action
Alternative, the time frame for completing the stipulations would be based on the date the MOA is
signed, not when demolition occurs. The mitigation measures are as follows:
•

Public Outreach—In pursuit of more visibility and appreciation for the NHL, the USAG FWA
Cultural Resources staff would be available upon request to present lectures to local Fairbanks
groups (military and/or non-military) on Fort Wainwright’s World War II history. The staff
would engage the public through previously developed publications, and submit articles on
historic preservation efforts at Fort Wainwright in local and state publications, websites, and
newspapers. Starting six months after the execution of the MOA and continuing for five years,
the USAG FWA would update and seek input from consulting parties on the public outreach
projects.

•

Re-evaluation of the Ladd Field NHL—The USAG FWA would complete a re-evaluation of
the Ladd Field NHL through preparation of a revised draft NHL nomination, including an
analysis of cumulative effects on the Ladd Field NHL from previous demolitions and additions.
The USAG FWA would submit the appropriate documentation to the NPS, Alaska Region,
which would then coordinate with the NHL Program in Washington, D.C. If Alternative 1 were
selected, the USAG FWA would submit the re-evaluation documentation within five years after
demolition of the hangars. If the No Action Alternative were chosen, the USAG FWA would
submit the documentation within five years from the execution of the MOA.

•

Stewardship of the Ladd Field NHL—With the expected loss of Hangars 2 and 3, the USAG
FWA would refocus the efforts of its Public Works staff on effective stewardship through
focused and purposeful management of the remaining elements that comprise the Ladd Field
NHL. The USAG FWA would use existing and currently planned documentation to further

3-110

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition

historic preservation objectives and goals including, but not limited to, using the already
developed Design Guidelines for the Ladd Field NHL, the educational PowerPoint
presentations on historic preservation subjects, and the currently planned, but not yet
developed, Historic Buildings Assessment Report. Within one year of completing the Historic
Buildings Assessment Report for the Ladd Field NHL, recommendations from the report would
be submitted for consideration in the Directorate of Public Works Annual Work Plan.
Though the Proposed Action would not result in significant impacts to any of the resource areas other
than cultural resource, there are a number of standard measures, including BMPs, that would be
employed to reduce or minimize potential impacts for air quality, hazardous materials and hazardous
waste, and transportation. Below is a summary of the BMPs as previously discussed in each of the
resource areas.

Air Quality


To help control fugitive dust from ground-disturbing activities, construction vehicles would
adhere to the following BMPs:
-

washing down all construction vehicles before leaving the project area and cleaning soil out
of tracked equipment before entering the roadway,

-

using a water truck to moisten soils before any grading,

-

minimizing areas of ground disturbance, and

-

avoiding activity during periods of high wind.

Hazardous Materials/Hazardous Waste


All projects on or near a current or past restoration site are required to comply with the Fort
Wainwright Land Use Institutional Controls. Any potentially contaminated soil, debris or
groundwater encountered during the action are required to be segregated, sampled, analyzed
and containerized in approved containers. Soil and groundwater are not to be removed from any
part of the installation or transported off the installation, regardless of whether it is clean or
contaminated, without written authorization from an appointed Fort Wainwright representative.



Projects involving excavation of soils in areas of known or suspected contamination are
required to adhere to a work plan approved by ADEC and USEPA, coordinated through the
Fort Wainwright Environmental Division prior to the start of work. Work plans typically
include field screening for petroleum products and/or other identified contaminants of concern.
Screened soils shall be managed in accordance with Fort Wainwright’s SOP on
Handling/Management of Contaminated Soil.

Chapter 3.0

3-111

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
•

Management of hazardous waste and materials are required to follow the instructions as per
USARAK Regulation 200-1 Pamphlet, Hazardous Materials and Regulated Waste
Management. The regulation applies to all military commands and units, civilian activities,
tenants, contractors, subcontractors, and consultants working at USARAK facilities, including
Fort Wainwright and the activities covered by this regulation include:

•

Hazardous materials storage,

•

Waste minimization and pollution prevention activities,

•

Activities of waste generators, and

•

Storage, describing, packaging, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous waste and
hazardous materials must be in accordance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

•

Storage, fueling and lubrication of equipment and motor vehicles must be conducted in a
manner that affords the maximum protection against spill and evaporation. Managing and
storing of fuel, lubricants and oil must be in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws
and regulations. Used lubricants and used oil to be discarded must be stored in marked
corrosion-resistant containers and recycled or disposed in accordance with federal, State, and
local laws and regulations. Storage of fuel on the project site is required to be in accordance
with all federal, State, and local laws and regulations.

Transportation
•

During demolition of the hangars, the Army’s contractor would provide a traffic control plan
and temporary signing plan to provide road access to adjacent occupied building parking lots
and entrances as well as safety measures for pedestrians and occupants of adjacent buildings.
The traffic control plan will present the placement and times of use for any temporary traffic
control devices in relation to the project site and construction activities and would follow the
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices standards.

•

The Army’s contractor would maintain and protect traffic on affected on-post roads during the
construction period. This would include implementing measures for the protection and
diversion of general traffic (watchman, flagmen, barricades, temporary lighting, signing),
minimizing interference with general traffic along the proposed truck haul route on post, and
investigating the adequacy of existing roads and bridge allowable limits.

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

3.10.1 Irreversible or Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
An irreversible commitment of resources is defined as the loss of future options. The term applies
primarily to the effects of using nonrenewable resources (such as minerals, fossil fuels, or cultural
resources) or to factors (such as soil productivity) that are renewable only over long periods. It could
also apply to the loss of an experience as an indirect effect of a “permanent” change in the nature or
character of the land.
An irretrievable commitment of resources refers to the loss of production or value of resources and
represents lost opportunities for the period when the resource cannot be used. For example, the
development of a vegetated area is an irretrievable action, but the action is not irreversible. If the area is
returned to vegetation, it is possible to resume production.

3.10.1.1

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would result in the irretrievable commitment of
cultural resources because the two historic hangars would be demolished. The fossil fuels required for
demolition activities under the Proposed Action also represent irretrievable commitments of resources.
The newly cleared space resulting from the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would be committed to a
new use (currently, an aircraft apron) but would remain as a developed area. As a result, the amount of
undeveloped land would not change or represent an irretrievable commitment of land for developed
use.

3.10.1.2

Alternative 2: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, use of energy at existing levels for electricity and heating would
continue to be required for Hangars 2 and 3 to prevent snow buildup on the roofs and for minimal
security measures (e.g., for the alarm installed to indicate loss of heat to the building). The fossil fuels
required for the continued maintenance of the hangars under the No Action Alternative represent nonrenewable and irreversible commitments of resources. This amounts to approximately 3,000 tons of
coal annually to provide utilities to the two hangars. Although energy conservation is a vital and critical
issue, the energy resource commitment under the No Action Alternative is not anticipated to be
excessive in terms of region-wide usage and would not have an adverse effect upon the continued
availability of energy resources. However, continued maintenance would require a substantial
expenditure of federal funds, approximately $350,000 per hangar annually, that would not be directly
retrievable.

Chapter 3.0

3-113

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK

3.10.2 Relationship between Short-term Use of the Environment and Long-term
Productivity
3.10.2.1

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, existing developed areas where the hangars are located would remain developed
with an impermeable surface. Implementing Alternative 1 would not result in any short-term use of the
environment because land disturbance would be temporary during demolition activities and would
occur on previously developed areas of the installation. Because no utilities would be needed to heat or
provide electricity to the buildings after they are demolished, eliminating the need to provide heat and
electricity to the hangars would be a beneficial impact and an improvement to the long-term
sustainability of fossil fuels.

3.10.2.2

Alternative 2: No Action

The No Action Alternative would not involve demolishing Hangars 2 or 3. The facilities would
continue to serve no active military function and would remain vacant while occupying space on Ladd
Airfield. In addition, electricity and heat would continue to be provided to the hangars from sources
derived from non-renewable fossil fuels, i.e., the coal-fired power plant located on Fort Wainwright.
Short-term use of these resources would continue, but there would be no long-term improvement in the
productivity of these non-renewable resources.

3.10.3 Unavoidable Adverse Effects
The environmental analysis of the alternatives includes the avoidance, minimization, or other mitigation
of potential adverse effects on natural, cultural, and environmental resources; however, all adverse
impacts may not be completely avoided and/or mitigated.

3.10.3.1

Alternative 1: Demolition of Hangars 2 and 3

Under Alternative 1, significant, long-term, and unavoidable impacts to cultural resources would result
from demolishing Hangars 2 and 3. The loss of the hangars as contributing resources to the Ladd Field
NHL and the Cold War Historic District would be a severe impact because the two resources would
lose their ability to convey their historic significance, while impacts to the overall integrity of the Ladd
Field NHL and Cold War Historic District would be moderate. Even with the loss of the two hangars,
the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District would continue to contain a large number of
original contributing resources and, thus, retain their overall integrity and continue to convey their

3-114

Chapter 3.0

Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition
of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, AK
historical significance. The mitigation measures agreed upon through Section 106 consultation would
compensate for the adverse effects of Alternative 1 (see Appendix A). Other adverse effects, however,
would be temporary in nature and less than significant. For example, the effects on air quality due to
emissions from construction equipment and increased traffic associated with construction vehicles
would only occur during the temporary period of demolition activities.

3.10.3.2

Alternative 2: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, significant, long-term, and unavoidable impacts to cultural resources
would be expected. Although the physical presence of the hangars would be retained initially and the
historic resource would be intact, over time the hangars would continue to deteriorate, further eroding
the structural integrity of the facilities. Continued deterioration of the hangars would likely result in the
hangars eventually suffering a catastrophic structural failure. Similar to Alternative 1, the loss of the
hangars as contributing resources to the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic District would be a
severe impact, while the impact on the overall integrity of the Ladd Field NHL and Cold War Historic
District would be moderate. Because the No Action Alternative would ultimately result in the physical
loss of the hangars, mitigation measures under this alternative would be the same as under Alternative 1
(see Appendix A). Other long-term effects resulting from the No Action Alternative would not be
significant but could be eliminated, such as utility and maintenance costs, and fossil fuel emissions
associated with producing electricity and heat for the facilities, if the hangars were demolished.

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation—An independent federal agency that promotes the
preservation, enhancement, and productive use of our nation's historic resources, and advises the
President and Congress on national historic preservation.
Affected Environment—The existing environment to be affected by a proposed action and
alternatives.
Ambient Air—Any unconfined portion of the atmosphere: open air, surrounding air.
Apron—A paved portion of the airfield that is provided for aircraft parking, servicing, and loading.
Attainment Area—An area considered to have air quality as good as or better than the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards as defined in the Clean Air Act. An area may be an attainment area for

traditional, religious, or other reason.
Cumulative Effects—Under National Environmental Policy Act regulations, the incremental
environmental impact or effect of an action together with the effects of past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions (40 CFR
§1508.7).
de minimis—Levels for annual criteria pollutant emissions that are set according to criteria pollutant
nonattainment area and maintenance area designations.

Endangered Species—“…any species (including subspecies or qualifying distinct population segment)
that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range” (ESA Section 3(6)).
The lead federal agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for the listing of a species as endangered is
responsible for reviewing the status of the species on a five-year basis.
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)—A document prepared to analyze the impacts on the
environment of a proposed project or action and released to the public for comment and review. EISs
are prepared when there is the potential for severe impacts on natural, cultural or socioeconomic

8-2

resources. An EIS must meet the requirements of National Environmental Policy Act, the CEQ, and the
directives of the agency responsible for the proposed project or action.
Executive Order—Official proclamation issued by the President that may set forth policy or direction
or establish specific duties in connection with the execution of federal laws and programs.
Historic Property—Any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in,
or eligible for inclusion on the National Register. The term includes artifacts, records, and remains
which are related to such district, site, building, structure, or object. 16 USC §470(w)(5).
Lend-Lease Operations—Under Public Law 77-11, the U.S. government assisted Allied forces during
the war by providing Lend-Lease deliveries of aircraft and war materiel. From 1942–1945, the U.S.
supplied the Soviet Union with more than 7,900 U.S.-built aircraft over the Alaska-Siberia, or ALSIB,
route. Pilots from the Air Transport Command flew aircraft from Great Falls, Montana, through Canada
and Alaska until they reached Ladd Field. At Ladd Field (the official transfer point), Soviet pilots took
over the ferrying operation, flying the aircraft to Nome, then across Siberia and on to the European war
front.
Level of Service (LOS)—A qualitative measure that describes operational conditions and provides an
index to the quality of traffic flow. LOS is defined in letter designations from A (no congestion on the
road) to F (roadways that are overcapacity).
Man Doors—Hinged doors that allow access into a building by turning a doorknob.
National Register of Historic Places (National Register)—A register of districts, sites, buildings,
structures, and objects of significant state, local, and national historic properties, maintained by the
Secretary of the Interior under authority of Section 2(b) of the Historic Sites Act of 1935 and Section
101(a)(1) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)—The Act establishes national environmental
policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and it provides a
process for implementing these goals within the federal agencies. It requires federal agencies to
integrate environmental values into their decision-making processes by considering the environmental
impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those actions.
National Historic Landmark—Nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of
the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage
of the United States. At present, there are only 2,500 properties with this distinction.

Chapter 8.0

National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as Amended (16 USC §470 et seq.)—An act to establish
a program for the preservation of historic properties throughout the nation, and for other purposes,
approved October 15, 1966 (PL 89-665; 80 Stat. 915; 16 USC §470 as amended by PL 91-243, PL 9354, PL 94-422, PL 94-458, PL 96-199, PL 96-244, PL 96-515, PL 98-483, PL 99-514, PL 100-127, and
PL 102-575). See Section 106 and National Register of Historic Places.
Record of Decision (ROD)—The ROD is the final step for agencies in the EIS process. It states what
the decision is; identifies the alternatives considered, including the environmentally preferred
alternative; and discusses mitigation plans, including any enforcement and monitoring commitments.
Region of Influence (ROI)—The geographic extent of potential effects from the alternatives on the
important elements of a resource.
Scoping—Scoping, as part of NEPA, requires examining a proposed action and its possible effects,
establishing the depth of environmental analysis needed, and determining analysis procedures, data
needed, and task assignments. The public is encouraged to participate and submit comments on
proposed projects during the scoping period.
Section 106—Section 106 of the NHPA, as Amended, and as implemented in 36 CFR §800, requires
federal agencies to consider the effects of federally funded, regulated, or licensed undertakings on
cultural resources listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. In addition, the federal
agency must afford the ACHP the opportunity to comment in the event that an undertaking will have an
adverse effect on a cultural resource that is eligible for or listed in the National Register.
Semi-permanent Structure—The military employed two general types of construction in the war
effort: temporary and permanent. These general types of World War II construction may be further
subdivided into four categories: (1) permanent; (2) semi-permanent; (3) temporary; and (4) theater-ofoperations. Permanent construction was intended for use after the war; it typically was built of masonry
(brick, tile, or concrete) and metal frame. Semi-permanent construction typically consisted of
cinderblock construction, wooden-frame construction clad with synthetic siding, or a mixture of
wooden frame and masonry. Semi-permanent construction often resulted from ad hoc compromises
between the desire for permanent construction and shortages of time and material.
State Historic Preservation Officer—The official appointed by the governor of a state or territory to
carry out the state’s responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act.

Take—From Section 3(18) of the Endangered Species Act, “take” means to “harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” Under
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, “take” is defined broadly and includes the removal of occupied nests.
Threatened species—Any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the
foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
Undertaking—A project, activity, or program funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect
jurisdiction of a federal agency, including: (a) those carried out by or on behalf of the agency; (b) those
carried out with federal financial assistance; (c) those requiring a federal permit, license, or approval;
and (d) those subject to state or local regulation administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a
federal agency.

Department of the Army, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the Alaska State
Historic Preservation Officer Regarding United States Army Alaska Demolition of Buildings in
the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark signed on 23 May 2001; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this previous mitigation for demolition, the Army determined that a
reduced amount of mitigation is appropriate to resolve adverse effects of this Undertaking and
consulted with the SHPO concerning this determination; and
WHEREAS, the USAG FWA reaffirms its responsibility to develop the Historic Buildings
Assessment Report and update of Historic American Building Survey Level 1 documentation

2

the Ladd Field NHL which is the submittal of the re-evaluation to the NPS Alaska Region; and
WHEREAS, outside of the responsibilities detailed in this MOA, it is the USAG FWA’s
long-term goal to officially submit the findings of the re-evaluation of the Ladd Field NHL to
the National Historic Landmarks Program for approval per 36 CFR § 65.8; and
WHEREAS, the USAG FWA completed in April 2012 the Reuse Study of FWA’s Hangars 2

Army, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the Alaska State Historic
Preservation Officer Regarding Aviation Stationing signed on 28 September 2009; and
WHEREAS, during the early stages of the Section 106 consultation, the USAG FWA
considered four possible disposition options: rehabilitation of one or both hangars, demolition
of one or both hangars, rehabilitation of one hangar and demolition of one, and no action (i.e.
maintaining the status quo) concerning both hangars; and
WHEREAS, on 23 May 2012, the USAG FWA Cultural Resources Manager, NPS Alaska
Region Historical Architect, SHPO Architectural Historian, and USAG FWA Structural and
Electrical Engineers met at Fort Wainwright for a site visit to discuss the NPS Alaska Region
and SHPO suggestions on ways to possibly reduce the rehabilitation costs of Hangars 2 and 3;
and
WHEREAS, through further analysis, the USAG FWA found that rehabilitation of one or both
hangars was not fiscally viable, and the Section 106 consultation and the NEPA EIS were
adjusted accordingly; and
WHEREAS, the USAG FWA reaffirms its desire to be a good steward of the Ladd Field
NHL, the Cold War Historic District, and all other historic properties under its care; and
NOW, THEREFORE, the USAG FWA, the SHPO, and the ACHP agree that the Undertaking
will be implemented in accordance with the following stipulations in order to take into account
the effect of the Undertaking on the historic properties.

Attachment B
POST REVIEW AND UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERIES PLAN
A. In the course of conducting approved activities, the USAG FWA and/or their
contractors shall not intentionally or knowingly affect (such as remove, disturb, or
cause to be removed or disturbed) any historic properties outside the approved scope of
work.
B. In the event that a previously unidentified archaeological site is discovered during the
execution of this undertaking, all ground disturbing activity shall immediately cease in
the area of the discovery until the USAG FWA archaeologist or other USAG FWA
personnel who meet The Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification
Standards for Archeologists can evaluate the archaeological site. Construction work
may continue in the project area outside the archaeological resource area. The USAG
FWA shall notify the SHPO and appropriate Alaska Native tribes within 3 business
days of discovery. The USAG FWA shall ensure that any archaeological work that
may be necessary shall be completed in accordance with the NHPA and the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act. The SHPO and/or the Alaska Native tribes,
if they so request, may immediately inspect the work site to determine the nature and
area of the affected archaeological site. Within 10 business days of the original
notification of the discovery, the USAG FWA, in consultation with the SHPO and
interested Alaska Native tribes, will determine the National Register eligibility of the
resource and will propose action to resolve possible adverse effects to any affected
National Register-eligible archaeological sites. Work may resume in affected areas
after approval by the USAG FWA Cultural Resources Manager and the SHPO.
C. If human remains are inadvertently discovered; the USAG FWA shall notify the SHPO
within 24 hours of discovery. The USAG FWA shall cease all work by their
contractors and ensure that the remains are secured from further disturbance or
vandalism until after the appropriate law enforcement authorities have ensured that the
remains are not related to any crime, and until a plan for treatment has been developed.
If the USAG FWA determines that the remains are Native American, the Garrison
Commander shall immediately undertake any actions necessary under the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, as amended. If the USAG FWA
determines that the remains are not Native American, and do not warrant criminal
investigation, the USAG FWA shall immediately notify the SHPO and consult with the
SHPO to identify descendants or other interested parties, if any. The USAG FWA, in
consultation with the SHPO and any interested parties, shall develop a plan for the
respectful treatment and disposition of the remains. Work may resume in affected areas
after approval by the USAG FWA Cultural Resources Manager and the SHPO.
D. If during the course of the undertaking there are any unforeseen or unanticipated effects
to historic properties other than the identification of a previously unknown
archaeological site, the USAG FWA shall initiate consultation pursuant to 36 C.F.R. §
800.13(b)(3) to resolve the unforeseen effects.

Notice of Intent.

AGENCY:
ACTION:

The Department of the Army
announces its intent to conduct public
scoping under the National
Environmental Policy Act to gather
information to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
related to the disposition of Hangars 2
and 3 at Fort Wainwright, Alaska.
Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing
elements to the Ladd Field World War
II National Historic Landmark (NHL).
The Department of the Army will use
the analysis in the EIS to determine
which alternative to implement. There
may be significant impacts to historic
properties.
ADDRESSES: Written comments should
be forwarded to Ms. Carrie McEnteer,
Directorate of Public Works, Attention:

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

Please contact Ms. Linda Douglass,
Public Affairs Office (PAO), IMPC–
FWA–PAO (Douglass), 1060 Gaffney
Road #5900, Fort Wainwright, AK
99703–5900; telephone (907) 353–6701,
email: linda.douglass@us.army.mil.
The
decision to be made by the Army is
regarding the disposition of two historic
aircraft hangars located at Fort
Wainwright. The EIS will assess the
direct, indirect, and cumulative
environmental impacts associated with
various proposed facility disposition
options to meet safety, funding,
facilities management, land use, and
cultural resources management
objectives. The condition of the
facilities warrants a decision on the
disposition that meets the
aforementioned management objectives.
The implementation of the proposed
action would determine the disposition
for the historic hangars. Based on the
decision, a management strategy would
be developed. A range of reasonable
alternatives, including a No Action
Alternative, will be developed and
analyzed in the EIS. Alternatives to be
considered include converting both
hangars to another use, demolishing
both hangars, demolishing one hangar
and retaining one hangar, indefinite
mothballing of the buildings, and
transferring facilities and management
responsibility to another agency. Other
reasonable alternatives raised during the
scoping process and capable of meeting
the project purpose and need and
criteria will be considered for
evaluation in the EIS.
Scoping and public comments: Native
Americans, Alaska Natives, federal,
state, and local agencies, organizations,
and the public are invited to be
involved in the scoping process for the
preparation of this EIS by participating
in scoping meetings and/or submitting
written comments. The scoping process
will help identify possible alternatives,
potential environmental impacts, and
key issues of concern to be analyzed in
the EIS. Written comments will be
accepted within 60 days of publication
of the Notice of Intent in the Federal
Register. Scoping meetings will be held
in Fairbanks, AK. Notification of the
times and locations for the scoping
meetings will be locally published.

Hi Carrie,
I saw the article about the Ft Wainwright hangar meeting in the News-Miner. Something to
think about would be to turn one of them into a Roller Rink. There are 3 Roller Derby teams
in the Fairbanks area that would love to see that happen.
Anyway just a thought.

Ms. McEnteer,
Good morning, my name is Joyce Whitehorn and I am President of the Tanana Valley State Fair Association. In reading
your article on the Army hangars that are being disposed of I would like to ask a few questions.
What size are the hangars?
Are they moveable in pieces?
Where are they located?
Would be allowed to inspect the hangars?

We are a non‐profit organization and would be interested in a possible donation of the buildings to the Fair Association,
where all the community would be able to have access to them for events throughout the year. It is a shame for
building to be destroyed when it could be put to use as an entertainment building, community event building or other
needs. I would be interested in any comment or idea you may have on helping us “reenergize” these hangers for the
community.
You may reach me at account@tananavalleyfair.org or call 907‐451‐5549.
Thank you for your consideration,
Joyce Whitehorn, President
Tanana Valley State Fair Association

Dear Mr. Swem :
The U.S. Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) is preparing an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the potential impacts upon the natural and man-made environment
associated with various proposed alternatives for the long-term disposition of Hangars 2 and 3,
located on the Main Post of USAG FWA. Alternatives to be considered include converting both
hangars to another use, demolishing both hangars , demolishing one hangar and retaining one hangar,
and transferring facilities and management responsibility to another agency. This action requires
environmental documentation that includes potential affects upon any organisms covered by the
Endangered Species Act (ESA).
The numerous biological surveys conducted on Fort Wainwright have never revealed the presence
of any federally listed threatened or endangered species . It is therefore our determination that USAG
FWA will not be required to have consultations under the ESA with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
for the long-term disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 on Fort Wainwright. Please inform us by letter within
30 days of receipt of this letter if you are not in agreement with this determination.

This communication responds to a letter from the Office of the Garrison
Commander, dated November 16, 2011, which transmitted the U.S. Army's
determination that no Federally endangered and threatened species occur on
U.S. Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, AK (USAG FWA). The Service concurs that
no listed species or designated critical habitats occur on or near USAG FWA
and therefore the proposed action will not affect listed species or critical
habitat. Further consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), is not required. This letter applies
only to endangered or threatened species under our jurisdiction. It does
not preclude the need to comply with other environmental legislation or
regulations such as the Clean Water Act. Thank you for your cooperation in
meeting our joint responsibilities under the ESA. If you need further

I wanted to send you a copy of the letter we mailed out yesterday. I
also included copies of all the other letters.
I know this letter is a bit redundant considering the first letter we
sent you. But I spoke with Doug last week and decided to send you this
one too being it has more info and is signed by Col. Johnson.
Also, I haven't seen a response to the first letter (date stamped Oct

Re:

EPA scoping comments for Environmental Impact Statement for Disposition of Hangars 2 and 3,
Fort Wainwright, Alaska, EPA Project # 11-4133-DOD.

Dear Ms. McEnteer:
We have reviewed the November 16,2011, Federal Register Notice of Intent (NOl) to prepare an
environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Disposition of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright in
Alaska. Our review of the NOr was conducted in accordance with our responsibilities under National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act. Thank you for the opportunity
to provide comments at this stage of the EIS development process.
Section 309 specifically directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review and
comment in writing on the environmental impacts associated with all major federal actions. Under our
Section 309 authority, our review of the draft EIS prepared for the proposed project will consider the
expected environmental impacts, and the adequacy of the EIS in meeting procedural and public
disclosure requirements of NEP A. A brochure further explaining the EPA's 309 review is enclosed.
By the nature of this project, we recognize that the potential for significant impacts from this project are
to historical resources, as Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing elements to the Ladd Field World War II
National Historic Landmark, as opposed to traditional environmental resources. We also acknowledge
that as currently identified in the NOI, the purpose and need for the project, and the range of alternatives
for further development in the EIS, seem adequate and appropriate. As such, we have limited our
scoping comments helow to those environmental concerns regarding issues that may arise in this project
depending on the selected alternative. In providing these comments, it is our goal to have these issues
addressed in the draft EIS.
HazaJ-doliS Material Removal and Disposal
Given the age and type of structures proposed for demolition, it is likely that the structures or their
components contain lead-based paint or asbestos. ConmlOn renovation activities like sanding, cutting,
and demolition can create hazardous lead dust and airborne asbestos fibers, which can be harmful to
human health. The EPA is very concerned about such contamination and regulates the management and
disposal of certain materials containing these hazardous substances. The regulations covering asbestos
can be found in 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart M - National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
for Asbestos (the asbestos NESHAP).

In general, asbestos workers and/or contractors must be EPA-certified and disposal of asbestos mu st
occur at facilities certified for the disposal of asbestos. In Alaska, landfill permits are issued by the
Alask a Department of Environmental Conservation. Also, with regard to regulated asbestos, contractors
must provide a 10-day notice prior to starting work to the EPA. The EPA Notification of Demolition and
Renovation form can be accessed at: http://www.epa.gov/region 1O/pdf/asbestos/demolition-renovationnoti fi cation-form_fil Iable. pd f.
For materials containing lead-based paint, testing (such as a Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure,
or TCLP), may need to be conducted to determine the extent of lead content. Also, a faci lity approved
for the disposal of hazardous waste materials may need to be utilized. Work must be completed in
compliance with applicable RCRA regulations under 40 CFR Parts 261-265, in addition to any
applicable local and state requirements.
For general questions regarding lead-based paint and asbestos-containing waste material handling and
disposa l, please contact Maria Tartaglia at (206) 553-1128 or tartaglia.maria@epa.gov. Asbestos
notification forms can be submitted to Ms. Tartaglia via email or by U.S. mail at:
Maria Tartaglia
EPA Region 10
1200 Sixth Avenue, Suite 900, AWT-128
Seattle, WA 98101-3140
In addition, questions concerning asbestos in Alaska can be directed to John Pavitt here in the EPA
Alaska Operations Office (AOO) at (907) 271-3688. Questions concerning the disposal of RCRAregulated wastes can be directed to Jon Jones, also here in AOO, at (907) 271-6329.
Finally, although not identified in the NOI, if any ground disturbing activities will be conducted, the
DOD should ensure that adequate sampling and analysis is undertaken to identify any current or hi storic
contamination and required cleanup activities.
Again , we appreciate the opportunity to participate early in the planning process for this project and are
available to discuss issues or answer questions that arise while you develop the draft EIS. Should you
have any questions regarding our comments please contact me at (907) 271-6324 or by electronic mail at

EPA's Section 309 Review:
The Clean Air Act and NEPA
Office of Federal Activities (2251A)

Quick Reference Brochure

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND THE CLEAN AIR ACT
The Clean Air Act, a law to prevent pollution of a single environmental medium, contains an
unusual provision. That provision is Section 309. which authorizes the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to review certain proposed actions of other federal agencies in accordance with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and to make those reviews public. If the proposing agency
(the "lead' agency) does not make sufficient revisions and the project remains environmentally
unsatisfactory, EPA may refer the matter to the President's Council on Environmental Qualiry for
mediation. (See Highlight A.)

HIGHLIGHT A: Section 309 of the Clean Air Act
(a) The Administrator shall review and corwnent in writing on the environmenca1 impact of any maner
relating to duties and responsibilities granted pursuant to this Act or other provisions of the authoricy of the
Administrator. contained in any (1) legislation proposed by any Federal department or agency, (2) newly
authorized Federal projects for constrUction and any major Federal agency action (other than a project for
constrUction) to which Section 102(2)(C) of Public Law 91-190 [oJ applies, and (3) proposed regulations
published by any department or agency of the Federal government. Such wrinen corwnent shall be made
public at the conclusion of any such review.
(b) In the event the Administrator determines that any such legislation, action, or regulation is
unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health or welfare or environmenca1 qualicy, he shall publish his
determination and the matter shall be referred to the Council on Environmenca1 QUality.
[OJ NEPA (42 USC 4332(2)(C) et seq.)

Section 309 originated in 1970, the year in which landmark national legislation created new
agencies and new requirements for restoring and protecting the environment. Besides NEPA and its
creation of CEQ, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA were
established, and, at the end of 1970, the Clean Air Act was passed . At that time. many issues of
environmental consequence were brewing (see Highlight B), one of which-the proposed supersonic
transport aircraft (SST)--became a crucial test of NEPA . (See The National Environmental Policy
Act section, below .)

The lead agency for the SST project, the Deparnnent of
Transportation (DOT), chose not to disclose EPA's
comments 00 the NEPA-required environmental impact
statement (EIS) before having issued its final decision,
construing NEPA to contain 00 explicit public disclosure
requirements. Although later CEQ regulations under the Act
would clarify this ambiguity, the Congress had a vehicle at
hand in which to make its point: the draft Clean Air Act.
Senator Edmund Muskie, sponsor of Section 309, said to
the Senate when submitting the conference report, that as
soon as EPA has completed its review of a proposed action,
it must make its written comments public, and "not when the
environmental impact agency decides the public should be
informed.« (116 Cong, Rec. S-20602, Dec . 18, 1970)

HIGHLIGHT B: When NEPA
Was New: 1970-1971 Issues
o Trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the
North Slope-Valdez route
o Supersonic transport aircraft
o Cross-Aorida Barge Canal
o Clearcutting "areas of scenic
beauty" in national foreslS
o Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway
o Dredging and flliing in wetlands .
o Calvert Cliffs (MD) nuclear
power plant

To correct another ambiguity of NEPA, Section 309 places the requirement to review EISs upon
EPA because NEPA "does not assure that Federal environmental agencies will effectively participate
in the decision-making process. It is essential that mission-oriented Federal agencies have access to
environmental expertise in order to give adequate consideration to environmental factors.« (Sen. Rept.
No. 91-1196. 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 43. 1970) Consequently, EPA has reviewed most of the
approximately 25,000 draft and fmal EISs produced since the passage of NEPA.

Section 309 confers upon EPA broad review
responsibilities for proposed federal actions . (See Highlight
C .) .The EPA Administrator has delegated responsibility of
national program manager to the Office of Federal Activities
(OFA), and to the ten EPA Regional Administrators for
review of regional specific actions. OFA has developed a
set of criteria for rating draft EISs. The rating system
provides a basis upon which EPA makes recommendations
to the lead agency for improving the draft. If improvements
are not made in the froal EIS, EPA may refer the froal EIS to
CEQ. (See sections on The National Environmental Policy
Act and Referrals, below.)

Figure 1: EPA's Criteria for Sec. 309 Review of Impact Statements
Rating Envirorunental lmoacts:
LO-Lack of Objections
EC--Environmental Concerns-Impacts identified that should be avoided. Mitigation measures may be
required.
EO--Environmental Objections-Significant impacts identified. Corrective measures may require
substantial changes to the proposed action or consideration of another alternative, including any that
was either previously unaddressed or eliminated from the study, or the no-action alternative) .
Reasons can include:
o violation of a federal environmental standard;
o violation of the federal agency's own environmental standard;
a violation of an EPA policy declaration ;
o potential for significant environmental degradation; or,
a precedent-serting for future actions that collectively could result in significant environmental
impacts.
EU- Environmentally Unsatisfactory-Impacts identified are so severe that the action must not proceed as
proposed . If these deficiencies are not corrected in the fwal EIS, EPA may refer the EIS to CEQ
Reasons, in addition to impacts identified, can include :
o subStantial violation of a federal environmental standard;
o severity, duration, or geographical e~tent of impacts that warrants special attention; or,
o national imponance, due to threat to national envirorunental resources or poliCies.
Rating Adequacy of the Impact Statement:
1 (Adequate)--No further information is reqUired for review .
2 (Insufficient Information)--Either more information is needed for review, or other alternatives should
be evaluated. The identified additional information or analysis should be included in the fmal EIS .
3 (Inadequate)--Seriously lacking in information or analysis to address potentially significant
environmental impacts. The draft EIS does not meet NEPA andlor Section 309 requirements . If
not revised or supplemented and provided again as a draft EIS for public comment, EPA may refer
the EIS to CEQ.
(See Selected Publications, below: EPA's Policy and Procedures/or the Review of Federo! Actions
Impacting the Environment.)

Annually, OFA and its regional counterparts review about 500 EISs and some 2000 other actions
(see Figures 1 and 2). Among the variety of proposed actions that may be reviewed, besides that for
which an agency provides an impact statement, are: legislation proposed by a federal agency; a
proposed agency regulation; the renewal of an action originally approved before the enactment of
NEPA; a proposal for which an agency has determined that no impact statement is needed, whether or
not the agency has published a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONS!) ; and , an action that is
actually a segment of either a program or a reasonably expected succession of acti.ons that could result
in a cumulative negative impact on human health or welfare or the environment.
In addition t.o conducting environmental reviews, OFA develops guidance materials and provides
training courses on NEPA and Section 309 requirements fo r EPA regi.onal staff. and promotes
coordination between EPA offices and other federal agencies .

THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT AND CEQ
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA, 42 USC 4321 et seq .) was enacted on January I,
1970 in recognition of the widening influence on the human and natural environment that individual
federal agency actions can exert. With its stated purpose (see Highlight D) and with heightened public
awareness of enviionmental quality questions, NEPA makes its goals and policies "supplemental to
those set forth in existing authorities of Federal agencies" (NEPA. Section 105). In this way, the
agencies' authorizing statutes were amended to include NEPA requirements .
Title I of NEPA requires the federal
government to use all practicable means to
preserve and maintain conditions under which
human beings can coexist with the natural world
in productive harmony. Section 102 directs
federal agencies to lend appropriate support to
initiative5 and programs meant to anticipate and
prevent .degradation of world environmental
quality . Further, this section requires federal
agencies to incorporate environmental
considerations in their decision-making, using a
systematic. interdisciplinary approach.

HIGHLIGHT 0: The Purposes of NEPA

The purposes of this Act are: To declare a
national policy which will encourage productive
and enjoyable harmony between man and his
environment; to promote efforts which will
prevent or eliminate damage to the environment
and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare
'of man; to enrich the understanding of the
ecological systems and naiural resources
important to the Nation; and to establish a Council
on Environmental Quality.

Title II of NEPA establishes the Council on
(PL 91-190, 42 USC 4321 et seq.)
Environmental QUality (CEQ. or the Council) .
Two months after enacanent of NEPA, the
President issued Executive Order 11514 authorizing CEQ to guide the Sec. 102 process. Under this
order. the Council immediately published guidelines. followed in 1978 by regulations (40 CFR PartS
1500-1508) requiring all Federal agencies to issue NEPA regulations consistent with CEQ's. Advisory
to the President, CEQ conducts studies. prepares the annual Environmental Quality Report to
Congress. and reviews EISs. Moreover, CEQ mediates interagency disputes concerning environmental
analyses of matters of national importance. (See Referrals section, below.)
As evidence of compliance with the NEPA Section 102 provisions for a proposed major action that
could significantly affect the environment. CEQ requires the lead agency to prepare a detailed written
statement addressing NEPA concerns, i.e .• an EIS (40 CFR Part 1501). The lead agency may first
prepare an environmental assessment (EA), which is a concise public document (40 CFR Part 1501.3)
that determines whether an EIS or a FONSI (40 CFR Part 1501.4(e)) should be prepared. An EA is
not necessary. however. if the agency has decided at the outset to prepare an EIS.
For review, the lead agency provides the EIS to those federal agencies having statutory jurisdiction
or special expertise, as well as to appropriate other federal, state. and local agencies; Indian tribes,
when the proposed action might impact tribal lands; and, the interested or affected public (40 CFR Part
1503.1). Once the EIS is final, the lead agency must file it fonnally. simultaneously making it
available to the public. together with the reviewers' comments and the lead agency's responses to those
comments (40 CFR Part 1506.9) . The CEQ regulations designate EPA the official recipient of all final
EISs, which responsibility the EPA Administrator delegates to OFA .

4

REFERRALS TO THE COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
The "predecision referrals" provision (40 CFR Part 1504)
enables any federal agency under NEPA to refer another agency 's
fUlal EIS to CEQ during the 30-day waiting period before a lead
agency can proceed with the action, On the other hand, Section 309
authorizes EPA to refer to CEQ a broader range of federal activities.
not only actions for which EISs are prepared. The CEQ regulations
(40 CFR 1504.1(b» implement Section 309 of the Clean Air Act.
acknowledging that EPA has been assigned more extensive review
and referral authority than the other agencies (see Highlight C).
Within 25 days after the lead agency has made the [mal EIS
available to the public. the referring agency must provide early
.notification to that agency about its intention. and make its referral in
writing to CEQ. The lead agency. once it has received written
notification from CEQ. is to respond in writing within 25 days.
During that same period. other agencies and the public may submit
written comments to CEQ. Then CEQ may publish Findings and
Recommendations; mediate between the disputing agencies; hold
public meetings or hearings; refer irreconcilable disputes to the
Executive Office of the President for action; or. conclude either that
the issue is not of national importance or that insufficient information
has been submitted upon which to base a decision.
in the time since the referral process was formally established in
1973. agencies have referred a total of 24 proposed federal actions
to CEQ. Of these , EPA was responsible for 15 . of which one was
referred jointly with the Deparunent' of the Interior (DOl). (See
Figure 2 for EPA regional environmental review offices.) So far. in
no case has CEQ made a formal referral to the Office of the
President, Most often. CEQ has issued Findings and
Recommendations. In a few cases the lead agency has withdrawn
the proposal. and in three cases CEQ determined that the issue was
not a matter of national importance.

Comments on Draft Environmental impact Statement tor the Disposition of Hangers
2 and 3 at US Anny Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska

Dear Ms. McEnteer:
This letter is in regards to your proposed facility disposition options for Hangers 2 and 3, located
on the Main Post ofUSAG FWA. This proposed project is located in a nonattainment area for
particulate matter (PM25 ) and carbon monoxide for air quality control under the Clean Air Act.
Therefore, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has concerns regarding
the following:
I. A project receiving federal funds or approvals do require an applicability analysis under
General Confonnity regulations for PM2.5 and carbon monoxide emissions. Factors such as
the type of project, either it is exempt or one that falls under de minimis needs to be
considered prior to determining if a demonstration of confonnity is required.
An interagency consultation though not required is recommended to avoid potential pitfalis
before an applicability analysis is prepared to determine if your project exceeds the de
minimis thresholds; contact Cindy Heil at ADEC (907) 269-7579 to detennine which
procedures and factors need to be addressed in the analysis, if desired.
Here is the link to Division of Air Quality's web page that provides additional infonnation
on confonnity issues: http://w\v\v.dec.state.ak.us/air/anpms/contl confilome.htm .

2. Should the preferred method be demolition; particular attention should be given during the
demolition/disposition activities to take reasonable precaution per 18 AAC 50.0475(d) to
prevent fugitive dust.

·elcu/I ,ji,."

SEAN PARNELL, GOVERNOR

DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

3. If the preferred method for disposal of debris is by open burning, the USAG or their
contractor must use "reasonable procedures to minimize adverse environmental effects and
limit the amount of smoke generated" as well as get any applicable permits. A complete
description of the open burn guidance policy can be found at
htlp:llwww.dec.state.ak.us/air/Opcll%20Burn/Docs/obrguide.pdf. Also, note that Fairbanks
North Star Borough (FNSB) has their own ordinance regarding Air Quality and should be
consulted prior to any open burning activities within their jurisdiction. FNSB can be
contacted at 907-459-1005 or bye-mail at airquality@co.fairbanks.ak.lls.
A general requirement of the Air Quality Control Regulations is that wastes should be
burned in a manner that does not cause a pub lic health, safety or welfare threat, an
environmental problem or a nuisance.
4. In addition, federal regulations require the removal of all asbestos-containing materials and
hazardous or toxic materials prior to beginning a building demolition or renovation.
Certified building inspectors will be required to assess the project for presence of asbestos.
The U.S Environmental protection Agency (EPA) regulates the abatement and disposal of
asbestos containing material and needs to be notified before any asbestos removal or
building demolition begins. You can contact EPA at the Alaska office at 907-27 1-3688 or
800-78 1-0983 for additional clarification and ass istance.
Thank you for contacting us about your project and for the opportunity to comment on the EIS. If
you have further questions or concerns about air quality issues, you may contact me at (907) 2697579 or bye-mai l at cindy.heil@alaska.gov.

SUBJECT: Offer of Government-to-Government Consultation on the Disposition of
Hangars 2 and 3, U.S. Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska

William Miller, President
Village of Dot Lake
P.O. Box 2279
DotLake, AK 99737
Dear President Miller:
The U.S . Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) is preparing an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to assess the potential impacts upon the natural
and man-made environment associated with various proposed facility disposition
options for Hangars 2 and 3, located on the Main Post of Fort Wainwright and
contributing elements to the Ladd Field World War II National Historic Landmark.
Options currently being considered include converting use of both hangars to another
purpose, demolishing both hangars, demolishing one hangar and retaining one hangar,
indefinite "mothballing" of the buildings , and transferring facilities and management
responsibilities to another agency. The condition of the facilities and the relocation of
their maintenance functions warrant a decision on their future disposition that meets
safety, funding , facilities management, land use, and cultural resources management
objectives.
A public scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday, December 14, 2011 at the
Noel Wien Library, 1215 Cowles Street, Fairbanks from 5 - 8 p.m. with a presentation
given at 6:30 p.m . If tribal representatives believe that a tribe-specific scoping meeting
is warranted for this National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) action, one will be
scheduled . Written comments for inclusion into the draft EIS will also be accepted until
January 17, 2012 .
If you wish to enter into government-to-government consultation because you feel
this proposed activity may significantly affect tribal rights or protected resources, please
advise Ms. Elizabeth A. Cook in writing by December 7, 2011. Please consider this
letter our notification in accordance with the Department of Defense (000) Instruction
Number 4710 .02 : 000 Interactions with Federally Recognized Tribes and the
Department of Defense (000) American Indian and Alaska Native Policy.
USAG FWA is concurrently conducting National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
Section 106 consultation on the disposition of the hangars. If you feel that this
undertaking is of interest to your tribal government interests, you are invited to become

a consulting party in the Section 106 process and your response to this offer is
requested by December 7, 2011 . The initial Section 106 meeting will be held on
December 15, 2011 at Fort Wainwright.
Requests for government-to-government consultation or responses for inclusion in
the NEPA or Section 106 processes should be directed to Ms. Elizabeth Cook, USAG
FWA Native Liaison, at ATTN : IMPC-FWA-PWE (Cook), 1060 Gaffney Rd #4500 , Fort
Wainwright, AK 99703-4500 . If you need additional information to make this
determination, please contact Ms. Cook at elizabeth.a.cook80.ctr@mai/.mi/or (907)

Lisa and Carrie-I have confirmation from Village of Dot Lake (verbal), Native Village of

I have received no response from Northway Village and consider that
non-interest. So far our contact with Northway has included a mailed
letter, an email, two messages left with office staff, and three unanswered
phone calls. Based on the feelings from others in the region, I say the
assumption is safe that consultation will not be requested by Northway.

Dear Mr. Nelson:
The US Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) is initiating efforts to prepare
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) related to the future disposition of Hangars 2 and 3
(Buildings 3008 and 3005) , located at USAG FWA.
Hangars 2 and 3 are contributing elements to the Ladd Field World War" National Historic
Landmark. An internal review of environmental issues related to this undertaking has
determined that possible adverse impacts to cultural resources will be an important
consideration for this EIS. Inasmuch as the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)
has both special expertise and regulatory authority with respect to the Ladd Field World War"
National Historic Landmark, it is believed that your cooperation in our National Environmental
Policy Act analysis would be helpful in ensuring a thorough review of potential impacts to
cultural resources and development of reasonable mitigation measures.
We are writing to ask for your participation as a Cooperating Agency in the EIS process. A
range of reasonable alternatives have been identified, including demolition , reuse, and
transferring of the property and all management responsibilities, to include funding, repair,
management, operations (to include utilities) and maintenance, from the US Army to another
agency. Based on the decision, a future management strategy would be developed. USAG
FWA hopes that the ACHP is able to provide support for our EIS efforts as a formal Cooperating
Agency and looks forward to discussing the possibility.
If you have any questions, please contact Mr. Clifford Seibel, Environmental Division Chief,
Directorate of Public Works, USAG FWA at (907) 361-6220.

Lisa:
I have been able to talk to staff about Army's offer about serving as a Cooperation Agency in
the Hanger Disposition NEPA process and as I said over the phone we would not have the
necessary staff and travel resources to fulfill that role at the expected level. I had
meetings with Grant, Janet, and Darrell and all agree. Grant whose time would most be drawn
upon was particularly wary of us signing up as a "Cooperator".
We hope to be heavily involved to the in the Section 106 consultation process and we will be
available to offer what technical advice we can into the NEPA process. We are very
interested in the future preservation of Hangars 2 and 3 for they were closely associated to
the lend‐lease effort and they serve as important structural touchstone's to WWII in Alaska.
If I remember correctly, we will be getting a formal written invitation to serve as a
Cooperator, to which we must reply in turn in writing. The purpose of this email is to let
you know informally what our position must be.

Future Disposition ofHangars 2 and 3 (Buildings 3008 and 3005)
Ladd Field World War II National Historic Landmark
Fort Wainwright, Fairbanks North Star, Alaska

Dear Mr. Seibel:
On October 4,2011, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) received your notification
for the development of an Environmental hnpact Statement for the referenced proj eet. This notification
also included a request for the ACHP to become a Cooperating Agency in Fort Wainwright's compliance
with the National Environmental Policy Act. We have no comments or plans to become a Cooperating
Agency pursuant to NEP A, at this time.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act instructs the federal agency to take into account the
effect of an undertaking on any property that is eligible for or listed in the National Register of Historic
Places "prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the
issuance of any license." 16 U.S.C. § 470f(emphasis added). This statutory language makes it clear that a
federal agency must complete its Section 106 responsibilities before ("prior to") reaching its [mal
decision ("approval," "issuance") on an undertaking.
According to the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations, a Record of Decision (ROD) "shall
state ... what the decision was ... [and] ... whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize
environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not." 40
C.F.R. § 1502.2 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the issuance ofaROD conveys the agency's final
decision on an undertaking and details the nature of that decision.
In order to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements of the Section 106 process, the ROD should be
issued concurrent with or after the completion of the Section 106 process. As you know, the execution of
a Section 106 program alternative, such as a Programmatic Agreement, in accordance with the Section
106 regulations indicates that an agency has completed this process.

ill order to ensure compliance with Section 106, the ACHP encourages Fort Wainwright to initiate the
Section 106 process by notifYing, at your earliest convenience, the Alaska State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO), the Secretary of the illterior (per 36 CFR § 800.l0(c)), illdian tribes, and other consulting
parties pursuant to our regulations, "Protection of Historic Properties" (36 CFR Part 800). Through early
consultation your agency will be able to determine the appropriate strategy to ensure Section 106
compliance for this undertaking.
Fort Wainwright should continue consultation with the SHPO, the Secretary of the illterior, illdian tribes,
and other consulting parties to identify and evaluate historic properties and to assess any potential adverse
effects on those historic properties. If you determine, through consultation with the consulting parties, that
the undertaking will adversely affect historic properties, or that the development of a Programmatic
Agreement is necessary, Fort Wainwright must notify the ACHP and provide the documentation detailed
at 36 CFR § 800.ll(e).
Should you have any questions as to how your agency should comply with the requirements of Section
106, please contact Ms. Katharine R. Kerr by telephone at (202) 606-8534 or bye-mail at

As part of the scoping process, USAG FWA is considering a range of reasonable alternatives including
converting both hangars to another use, demolishing both hangars, demolishing one hangar and retaining
one hangar, indefinite "mothballing" of the buildings, and transferring facilities and management
responsibility to another agency. Other reasonable alternatives Ihat were raised during the EIS scoping
process and capable of meeting the project purpose, need and criteria will be considered for evaluation in
the EIS .
As a federal entity that has both special expertise and regulatory authority with respect to the Ladd
Field World War II National Historic Landmark, your agency may have an increased interest in developing
a funding partnership with USAG FWA in rehabilitation of Hangars 2 and 3 in exchange for shared facility
use. A recent study was completed that investigated possible reuse scenarios for Hangars 2 and 3. The
study outlined the basic stabilization and repair efforts required to support a new use. Cost estimates
ranging from $32 to $38 million per hangar were identified.
The opportunity may exist for USAG FWA and the National Park Service (NPS) to develop a unique
partnership that will further the cultural resource preservation goals of both organizations while offering
NPS an opportunity to utilize the hangars to further their own historic preservation and outreach goals for
the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark. We look forward to discussing the feasibility of this
partnership.
The USAG FWA has also contacted the Bureau of Land Management with a similar inquiry.

Dear Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert:
The US Army Garrison Fort Wainwright, Alaska (USAG FWA) is initiating efforts to prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) related to the future disposition of Hangars 2 and 3, located at USAG FWA. The two hangars
are contributing elements to the Ladd Field Wand War II National Historic Landmark; however, the current condition
of the hangars warrants a decision on the disposition of the facilities that meets safety, funding, facilities
management, land use and cultural resources management objectives.

As part of the scoping process, USAG FWA is considering a range of reasonable alternatives including converting
both hangars to another use, demolishing both hangars, demolishing one hangar and retaining one hangar, indefinite
"mothballing" of the buildings, and transferring facilities and management responsibility to another agency. Other
reasonable alternatives were raised during the scoping process and capable of meeting the project purpose and need
and criteria will be considered for evaluation in the EIS .
As one of the users of the Fort Wainwright Ladd Army Airfield, your agency may have an increased interest in
developing a funding partnership with USAG FWA in rehabilitation of Hangars 2 and 3 in exchange for shared facility
use. A recent study was completed that investigated possible reuse scenarios for Hangars 2 and 3. The study
outlined the basic stabilization and repair efforts required to support a new use. Cost estimates ranging from $32 to
$38 million per hangar were identified.
The opportunity may exist for USAG FWA and the Alaska Army National Guard to develop a unique partnership
that will further the cultural resource preservation goals of the Army while offering the Alaska Army National Guard
additional space to conduct airfield operations on Fort Wainwright. We look forward to discussing the feasibility of this
partnership.
USAG FW A has also contacted the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Department of the
Interior, and Alaska State Division of Forestry with a similar inquiry.
If you have questions, please contact Mr. Clifford Seibel, USAG FWA, Directorate of Public Works Environmental
Division at (907) 361-6220 or at clifford .a.seibel.civ@mail.mil

Dear Colonel Johnson:
This letter is in response to your December 6, 2011, inquiry regarding the possibility of a funding
partnership with U.S. Army Garrison Fort Wainwright (USAG FWA) to rehabilitate Hangars 2
and 3 at Ladd Field World War II National Historic Landmark (NHL).
The Alaska Region of the National Park Service does not have a need for a storage facility to
support our operations in Fairbanks, but we are encouraged by the breadth of reuse oplions being
considered by the U.S. Army to preserve the ·two historic hangars, both of which are integral to
the significance of the Ladd Field NHL. Partnering with other Federal agencies to rehabilitate
the two hangars is a sound approach which illustrates the Army's interest in preserving our
nation's cultural heritage.
Although the National Park Service does not have a programmatic need to partner with the Army
to rehabilitate the hangars, we are available to provide your agency with technical assi~tance
with matters related to historic preservation.
Our cultural resources team has carefully reviewed the November 2011 Reuse Srudy ofFWA's
Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, and they are 'encouraged by the six alternatives for
adaptive reuse. Our team is surprised at the $32 million cost estimate associated with ~tabi1izing
each building prior to a final build-out for a new use. We believe there may be options thut have
a much more reasonable price tag that will successfully stabilize the structures while maintaining
the functionality of the reuse options and the exterior character of each hangar. For iqstance,
thoughtfully designed alternatives, including, but not limited to, installation of additiollal interior
supports or a steel superstructure to suppon the existing structure, may be acceptable to the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and align with the rehabilitation treatment defin~d by The

Secretary of the ITuerior's Standards for the Trea1menr ofHistoric ProperIies.

As contributing elements to the Ladd Field NHL, Hangars 2 & 3 are important featur~ of the
historic airfield. We applaud the Army's interest in attempting to preserve the unique ,clear Span
configuration of each hangar in addition to the historic fabric. This approach, however, likely
contributes to the high stabilization costs. The hangars' overall exterior appearance, including
form, scale and view shed characteristics, are more critical than the interior spaces. Considering
options that do not include maintaining the clear span may result in designs that are considerably
less costly.
Our National Register Team Historical Architect is available to consult on-site with your cultural
resource and design team to discuss alternatives which may reduce the stabilization and
operational costs. In order to effectively assist the Army in exploring alternate approaches to
rehabilitation for contemporary use, we will need to review the structural engineer's analysis and
supporting calculations that document the lack of structural integrity of the hangars. At the
present time, we do not have access to the detailed information that would enable us to
understand the extent of the structural threats to the buildings. It seems there are more efficient
options than to completely deconstruct both buildings in order to perform a detailed condition
assessment for the stabilization effort and we are willing and able to partner with the Army to
explore those options.
Please contact Debora Cooper, Associate Regional Director for Resources, Alaska Regional
Office, at (907) 644-3505 or via email [debora_cooper@nps.gov] if you are interested in our
technical assistance in historical architecture.

Setting Description:
Cantonment, southwest corner of airfield. Hangars 2 and 3 (Buildings 3008 and 3005) are a pair of Birchwood hangars placed in close
proximity, with Building 3008 on the west and Building 3005 on the east. With their massing, height and appearance, they dominate
the setting at this end of the airfield. An aircraft apron and the western end of the airfield are both located to the north of the hangars.
Two small warehouses are located to the west (Buildings 3033 and 3031). Beyond Meridian Road is the western Montgomery Road
engineering/industrial support area. The hangars are bordered by parking areas on the south. Across Montgomery Road, there are 2
Cold War-era support buildings, and farther to the south, Cold War-era barracks on Neely Road. To the east is a Cold War-era fire
station (Building 3004), a 1988 flight simulatorbuilding (Building 3000) and beyond, a blend of small Cold War-era buildings and the
recent Stryker complex.
Architectural Description:
Building 3008 is a two-story, wood-frame, Birchwood hangar on a concrete foundation, oriented east/west. The barreled truss roof is
finished in polyurethane, and the exterior is clad in corrugated metal. The hanger is square and measures 200 feet long by 200 feet
wide, with the hangar bay situated between a pair of two-story administrative areas. The east and west elevation are virtually identical.
Both elevations feature two hanger door openings covered by fabric curtain doors, a pair of steel slab personnel doors with vision
lights, and a pair of steel slab personnel doors that allow access to the office areas. The roof features two, rectangular roof access
elements; a gable-roofed structure with single fixed-sash windows on its east and west elevations, and a shed-roofed structure with a
single metal personnel door. The south elevation has a single steel slab personnel door with a gable-roofed portico on the east end of
the elevation. Fenestration on the north and south elevations consists of evenly spaced awning- vinyl windows on the first and second
stories. On the north elevation is a gable-roofed portico covering a centrally located, steel double personnel door with vision light.

Building Evaluation
Criteria Evaluations
Individual NRHP Listing Criteria Evaluation:
Building 3008 does not have any individual associations with significant events or trends in US or Alaska history. It is not associated with
significant persons and it does not exemplify a type, period, or method of construction. Therefore, this building is ineligible for individual
listing on the NRHP under any criterion.

NHL Criteria Evaluation:
The Ladd Field National Historic Landmark is listed on the NRHP under Criterion A for its role as an aircraft supply and repair depot and
as a cargo and passenger flight hub for the Air Transport Command missions of WWII. Ladd Field is significant on the national level for
its association with aviation and the changing role of the US in the world community during WWII. Building 3008 is a contributing
structure to the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark.

NRHP Cold War Historic District Criteria Evaluation:
Cold War Historic District is eligible for the NRHP under Criterion A for its association with the strategic aerial reconnaissance, air
defense, and Arctic research missions of the Cold War. Building 3008 is a contributing element of the Ladd AFB Cold War Historic
District due to its association with the air defense mission of the Cold War because of its use by the Fighter Intercept Squadrons.

Description of Integrity:
Building 3008 maintains integrity of location, feeling, association, and setting.

Statement of Significance:
Ladd Field NHL is nationally significant for its association with the themes of Expanding Science and Technology and the Changing Role
of the US in the World. Construction began on the military post in 1938. Located near Fairbanks, Ladd Field was the first US Army
airfield in Alaska and was a part of the defense build-up for WWII in the territory. The military post is associated with the development of
cold weather aviation technology and played a supporting role in the Aleutian Campaign of WWII in the Pacific. Ladd Field was also the
Alaskan headquarters for the Alaska-Siberia (ALSIB) Lend-Lease route over which the US sent thousands of military aircraft to the
Soviet Union for use in the Eastern Front of the war in Europe. The period of significance begins in 1940 when the airfield became
operational and extends to late 1945 when WWII ended. Ladd Field, originally established as an Army Air Corps cold weather testing
station, began operations in 1940. From 1942 to 1945, in a unique high priority mission, the airfield was the transfer point for over 7,900
Lend-Lease aircraft bound for the USSR on the ALSIB route. After WWII, the alliance between the US and the USSR rapidly ended. The
Cold War standoff took its place, re-shaping the mission and infrastructure of Ladd Field. The Ladd Field National Historic Landmark is
listed on the NRHP under Criterion A for its role as an aircraft supply and repair depot and as a cargo and passenger flight hub for the
Air Transport Command missions of WWII. Ladd Field is significant on the national level for its association with aviation and the
changing role of the US in the world community during WWII. Building 3008 was considered a contributing element of the Ladd Field
NHL as a part of the NHL listing.
From 1946 to 1949, during the earliest years of the Cold War, Ladd Air Force Base (Ladd AFB) hosted some of the United States Air
Force’s (USAF) first long-range strategic aerial reconnaissance units. From 1950 until 1960, Ladd AFB hosted Fighter Interceptor
Squadrons as part of the Aircraft Control and Warning System. Throughout this period (1946 to 1960), the USAF constructed over 300
new facilities on the installation to support its Cold War missions and personnel. The majority of these facilities were family housing,
barracks, support facilities, and utility infrastructure, which were largely built to replace the many temporary World War II buildings on the
installation. Mission related construction included hangars, ammo storage facilities, maintenance shops, communications facilities, and
airfield improvements. During the period of significance, 1945 to 1960, Ladd AFB was a vital part of the US Cold War mission. The Ladd
AFB Cold War Historic District is eligible for the NRHP under Criterion A for its association with the strategic aerial reconnaissance, air
defense, and Arctic research missions of the Cold War. Building 3008 is a contributing element of the Ladd AFB Cold War Historic
District due to its association with the air defense mission of the Cold War because of its use by the Fighter Intercept Squadrons.
Building 3008 does not have any individual associations with significant events or trends in US or Alaska history. It is not associated with
significant persons and it does not exemplify a type, period, or method of construction. This resource does not appear to be eligible for
individual listing in the NRHP under any criterion.

Setting Description:
Cantonment, southwest corner of airfield. Hangars 2 and 3 (Buildings 3008 and 3005) are a pair of Birchwood hangars placed in close
proximity, with Building 3008 on the west and Building 3005 on the east. With their massing, height and appearance, they dominate
the setting at this end of the airfield. An aircraft apron and the western end of the airfield are both north of the hangars. Two small
warehouses are located to the west (Buildings 3033 and 3031). Beyond Meridian Road is the western Montgomery Road
engineering/industrial support area. The hangars are bordered by parking areas on the south. Across Montgomery Road, there are
two Cold War-era support buildings and farther to the south, Cold War-era barracks on Neely Road. To the east is a Cold War-era fire
station (Building 3004), a 1988 flight simulator building (Building 3000) and beyond, a blend of small Cold War-era buildings and the
recent Stryker complex.
Architectural Description:
Building 3005 is a two-story, wood-frame, Birchwood hangar on a concrete foundation, oriented east/west. The barreled truss roof is
finished in polyurethane, and the exterior is clad in corrugated metal. The hanger is square and measures 200 feet long by 200 feet
wide, with the hangar bay situated between a pair of two-story administrative areas. The east and west elevation are virtually identical.
Both elevations feature: two hanger door openings covered by fabric curtain doors, a pair of steel slab personnel doors with vision
lights, and a pair of steel slab personnel doors allow access to the office area on the north and south ends of both elevations. The roof
features two, rectangular roof access elements; a gable-roofed structure with single fixed-sash windows on its east and west
elevations and a shed-roofed structure with a single metal personnel door. The south elevation has two steel slab personnel doors
with gable-roofed porticos on the east end of the elevation. Fenestration on the north and south elevations consists of evenly spaced
awning vinyl windows on the first and second stories. On the north elevation is a gable-roofed portico covering a centrally located,
steel double personnel door with a vision light.

Building Evaluation
Criteria Evaluations
Individual NRHP Listing Criteria Evaluation:
Building 3005 does not have any individual associations with significant events or trends in US or Alaska history. It is not associated with
significant persons and it does not exemplify a type, period, or method of construction. Therefore, this building is ineligible for individual
listing on the NRHP under any criterion.

NHL Criteria Evaluation:
The Ladd Field National Historic Landmark is listed on the NRHP under Criterion A for its role as an aircraft supply and repair depot and
as a cargo and passenger flight hub for the Air Transport Command missions of WWII. Ladd Field is significant on the national level for
its association with aviation and the changing role of the US in the world community during WWII. Building 3005 is a contributing
structure in the Ladd Field National Historic Landmark.

NRHP Cold War Historic District Criteria Evaluation:
Cold War Historic District is eligible for the NRHP under Criterion A for its association with the strategic aerial reconnaissance, air
defense, and Arctic research missions of the Cold War. Building 3005 is a contributing element of the Ladd AFB Cold War Historic
District due to its association with the air defense mission of the Cold War because of its use by the Fighter Intercept Squadrons.

Description of Integrity:
Building 3005 maintains integrity of location, feeling, association, and setting.

Statement of Significance:
Ladd Field NHL is nationally significant for its association with the themes of Expanding Science and Technology and the Changing Role
of the US in the World. Construction began on the military post in 1938. Located near Fairbanks, Ladd Field was the first US Army
airfield in Alaska and was a part of the defense build-up for WWII in the territory. The military post is associated with the development of
cold weather aviation technology and played a supporting role in the Aleutian Campaign of WWII in the Pacific. Ladd Field was also the
Alaskan headquarters for the Alaska-Siberia (ALSIB) Lend-Lease route over which the US sent thousands of military aircraft to the
Soviet Union for use in the Eastern Front of the war in Europe. The period of significance begins in 1940 when the airfield became
operational and extends to late 1945 when WWII ended. Ladd Field, originally established as an Army Air Corps cold weather testing
station, began operations in 1940. From 1942 to 1945, in a unique high priority mission, the airfield was the transfer point for over 7,900
Lend-Lease aircraft bound for the USSR on the ALSIB route. After WWII, the alliance between the US and the USSR rapidly ended. The
Cold War standoff took its place, re-shaping the mission and infrastructure of Ladd Field. The Ladd Field National Historic Landmark is
listed on the NRHP under Criterion A for its role as an aircraft supply and repair depot and as a cargo and passenger flight hub for the
Air Transport Command missions of WWII. Ladd Field is significant on the national level for its association with aviation and the
changing role of the US in the world community during WWII. Building 3005 was considered a contributing element of the Ladd Field
NHL as a part of the NHL listing.
From 1946 to 1949, during the earliest years of the Cold War, Ladd Air Force Base (Ladd AFB) hosted some of the United States Air
Force’s (USAF) first long-range strategic aerial reconnaissance units. From 1950 to 1960 Ladd AFB hosted Fighter Interceptor
Squadrons as part of the Aircraft Control and Warning System. Throughout this period (1946 to 1960), the USAF constructed over 300
new facilities on the installation to support its Cold War missions and personnel. The majority of these facilities were family housing,
barracks, support facilities, and utility infrastructure, which were largely built to replace the many temporary World War II buildings on the
installation. Mission related construction included hangars, ammo storage facilities, maintenance shops, communications facilities, and
airfield improvements. During the period of significance, 1945 to 1960, Ladd AFB was a vital part of the US Cold War mission. The Ladd
AFB Cold War Historic District is eligible for the NRHP under Criterion A for its association with the strategic aerial reconnaissance, air
defense, and Arctic research missions of the Cold War. Building 3005 is a contributing element of the Ladd AFB Cold War Historic
District due to its association with the (air defense mission of the Cold War because of its use by the Fighter Intercept Squadrons.
Building 3005 does not have any individual associations with significant events or trends in US or Alaska history. It is not associated with
significant persons and it does not exemplify a type, period, or method of construction. This resource does not appear to be eligible for
individual listing in the NRHP under any criterion.

Dear Ms. Bittner:
The US Army Garrison Fort Wa inwright (USAG FWA) requests your concurrence with the
determination of Historic Properties Adversely Affected for the future disposition plans of
Hangars 2 and 3. The hangars are contributing elements to the Ladd Field National Historic
Landmark (NHL ). The condition of the facilities and the relocation of their maintenance
functions warrant a decision on their future disposition that meets safety, funding , facilities
management, land use, and cultural resources management objectives. Options currently being
considered include converting use of both hangars to another purpose, demolishing both
hangars, demolishing one and retaining one , no action , and transferring facilities and
management responsibilities to another agency.
A number of documents have been supplied to your office and other consulting parties to give
background information and context for this current undertaking . The documentation includes:
•

Also , in previous correspondence and/or during the December 15, 2011 meeting, USAG FWA
has:
•
•

•

•
•
•

Determined that the proposed Army action is an undertaking as defined in 36 CFR Part
800 .16 (y) and that it has the potential to cause effects on historic properties
Notified the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and consulted with
the SHPO on plans to involve the public and establish the process by which USAG FWA
plans to identify additional consulting parties
Invited local governments, tribes, interested parties, and the public to consult
Held public meetings and met with interested consulting parties (SHPO, National Park
Service, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Tanana Yukon Historical Society,
Fairbanks North Star Borough Historic Preservation Commission and Bureau of Land
Management)
Notified the consulting parties that USAG FW A will be pursuing a Programmatic
Agreement pursuant to 36 CFR 800 .14(b)3
Defined the Area of Potential Effect (Hangar 2 and 3, surround ing viewshed , and the
NHL and historic district)
Indentified and evaluated the historic significance of the affected historic properties
(Hangars 2 and 3, NHL, and the historic district)

The results of the identification process and evaluation of the potential effects is that USAG
FWA finds that future disposition plans of Hangars 2 and 3 will Adversely Affect Historic
Properties . All options for the future disposition could adversely affect the hangars and, in so
doing, the whole NHL and historic district. The most severe potential adverse affects are
associated with demolition of the facilities and the no-action option. The no-action option would
effectively lead to demolition being no rehabilitation of the facilities would take place. Demolition
of the facilities would not only destroy the individual properties but would also affect the NHL,
possibly causing the boundary of the district to be reduced as these facilities are the only
contributing elements of the NHL south of the airfield.
Copies of this letter will be sent to the National Park Service, AdviSOry Council on Historic
Preservation, Tanana Yukon Historical Society, Fairbanks North Star Borough Historic
Preservation Commission and Bureau of Land Management.
USAG FW A requests your concurrence with this finding and looks forward to developing a
ProgrammatiC Agreement with your office and other consulting parties. Thank you for your
participation thus far in this consultation process. If you have any questions, please contact Ms.
Lisa Graham , USAG FWA Cultural Resources Manager, at (907) 361-3002 or

APPENDIX F: ECONONIC IMPACT FORECAST MODEL
1.0

Socioeconomic Impact Assessment

Socioeconomic impacts are linked through cause-and-effect relationships. Military payrolls and local
procurement contribute to the economic base for the region of influence (ROI). In this regard, the
proposed demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 under Alternative 1would have a multiplier effect on the local
and regional economy. With Alternative 1, direct jobs would be created, generating new income and
increasing personal spending. This spending generally creates secondary jobs, increases business
volume, and increases revenues for schools and other social services.
Under Alternative 2, the No Action Alternative, no planned demolition, construction, or renovation
would occur. Given that no large-scale rehabilitation efforts would be undertaken for the hangars and
as systems fail they would not be repaired or replaced, their structural integrity would continue to
deteriorate, most likely resulting in structural failure (an uncontrolled collapse) or total loss of one or
both hangars by fire. When this occurs, the No Action Alternative also would have the same multiplier
effect on the local and regional economy from debris removal activities as Alternative 1. Therefore,
impacts under the No Action Alternative are not analyzed separately from Alternative 1.

2.0

Economic Impact Forecast System

The Army, with the assistance of many academic and professional economists and regional scientists,
developed the Economic Impact Forecast System (EIFS) to address the economic impacts of the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)-requiring actions and to measure their significance. As a
result of its designed applicability, and in the interest of uniformity, EIFS should be used in NEPA
assessments for the proposed action. The entire system is designed for the scrutiny of a populace
affected by the actions being studied. The algorithms in the EIFS model are simple and easy to
understand, but still have firm, defensible bases in regional economic theory.
EIFS was developed under a joint project of the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE); the Army
Environmental Policy Institute; and the Computer and Information Science Department of Clark
Atlanta University, Georgia. EIFS is an on-line system, and the EIFS Web application is hosted by
USACE, Mobile District. The system is available to anyone with an approved user-id and password.
University staff and the staff of USACE, Mobile District, are available to assist with the use of EIFS.

Appendix F

F-1

The databases in EIFS are national in scope and cover the approximately 3,700 counties, parishes, and
independent cities that are recognized as reporting units by federal agencies. EIFS allows the user to
define an economic ROI by identifying the counties, parishes, or cities to be analyzed. Once the ROI is
defined, the system aggregates the data, calculates multipliers and other variables used in the various
models in EIFS, and prompts the user for forecast input data.

3.0

Economic Impact Forecast System Model

The basis of the EIFS analytical capabilities is the calculation of multipliers that are used to estimate the
impacts resulting from military-related changes in local expenditures or employment. In calculating the
multipliers, EIFS uses the economic base model approach, which relies on the ratio of total economic
activity to basic economic activity. Basic, in this context, is defined as the production or employment
engaged to supply goods and services outside the ROI or by federal activities (such as military
installations and their employees). According to economic base theory, the ratio of total income to basic
income is measurable (as the multiplier) and sufficiently stable so that future changes in economic
activity can be forecast. This technique is especially appropriate for estimating aggregate impacts and
makes the economic base model ideal for the environmental assessment and environmental impact
statement (EIS) process.
The multiplier is interpreted as the total impact on the economy of the region resulting from a unit
change in its base sector; for example, a dollar increase in local expenditures due to an expansion of its
military installation. EIFS estimates its multipliers using a location quotient approach based on the
concentration of industries within the region relative to the industrial concentrations for the nation.
The user inputs into the model the data elements that describe the Army action: the change in
expenditures, or dollar volume of the construction project(s); change in civilian or military
employment; average annual income of affected civilian or military employees; the percent of civilians
expected to relocate due to the Army’s action; and the percent of military living on-post. Once these are
entered into the EIFS model, a projection of changes in the local economy is provided. These are
projected changes in sales volume, income, employment, and population. These four indicator variables
are used to measure and evaluate socioeconomic impacts. Sales volume is the direct and indirect change
in local business activity and sales (total retail and wholesale trade sales, total selected service receipts,
and value-added by manufacturing). Employment is the total change in local employment due to the
proposed action, including not only the direct and secondary changes in local employment, but also
those personnel who are initially affected by the military action. Income is the total change in local
wages and salaries due to the proposed action, which includes the sum of the direct and indirect wages
F-2

Appendix F

and salaries, plus the income of the civilian and military personnel affected by the proposed action.
Population is the increase or decrease in the local population as a result of the proposed action.

4.0

The Significance of Socioeconomic Impacts

Once model projections are obtained, the rational threshold value (RTV) profile allows the user to
evaluate the significance of the impacts. This analytical tool reviews the historical trends for the defined
region and develops measures of local historical fluctuations in sales volume, income, employment, and
population. These evaluations identify the positive and negative changes within which a project can
affect the local economy without creating a significant impact. The greatest historical changes define
the boundaries that provide a basis for comparing an action’s impact on the historical fluctuation in a
particular area. Specifically, EIFS sets the boundaries by multiplying the maximum historical deviation
of the following variables: the sales volume, income, employment, and population (Table 4-1).

These boundaries determine the amount of change that will affect an area. The percentage allowances
are arbitrary, but sensible. The maximum positive historical fluctuation is allowed with expansion
because economic growth is beneficial. While cases of damaging economic growth have been cited,
and although the zero-growth concept is being accepted by many local planning groups, military base
reductions and closures generally are more injurious to local economics than are expansion actions.
The major strengths of the RTV are its specificity to the region under analysis and its basis on actual
historical data for the region. The EIFS impact model, in combination with the RTV, has proven
successful in addressing perceived socioeconomic impacts. The EIFS model and the RTV technique for
measuring the intensity of impacts have been reviewed by economic experts and have been deemed
theoretically sound.
The following are the EIFS inputs and output data and the RTVs for the ROI.

4.1

Summary of Assumptions

For this analysis, it was assumed that no civilian personnel would permanently relocate to the ROI as a
result of the Proposed Action. Therefore, only demolition costs were used to determine the impact of
the Proposed Action on the ROI and only demolition cost, not civilian or military employment,
estimates were inserted into Table 4-2 below. The total project cost for the demolition of Hangars 2 and
3 is estimated to be $6,376,300 (USACE, 2012).
Demolition spending associated with Alternative 1 would generate sales of approximately $6,822,640
in 2014, which represents a less than one percent deviation of sales volume change over time in the
ROI. Direct and induced income is estimated to be $1,302,319, which represents a negligible deviation
from the average rate of income change over time in the ROI. Based on demolition spending, during the
six-month period this project would be underway, approximately 32 persons would be directly
employed and would support an additional 36 jobs indirectly through demolition-related spending for a
total of 68 jobs, which represents a negligible deviation from the average rate of employment change
over time in the ROI. This is because employment numbers output by the model are full-time
equivalent (FTE) numbers and, as this project is only expected to take 6 months, the employment
numbers shown in this paragraph are twice those shown below. None of the forecasted sales, income, or
employment estimates has a deviation from the average rate of change greater than their respective
historic extreme deviations; therefore, the anticipated economic changes in these indicators are
expected to have less than a significant effect on the ROI’s economy (USACE, 2013).

APPENDIX G: AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS
1.0

Introduction

This air quality applicability analysis was conducted to identify potential increases or decreases in
criteria air pollutant emissions associated with the proposed demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort
Wainwright, Fairbanks, Alaska. The project site is designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) as in nonattainment for particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to
nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) and maintenance for carbon monoxide (CO) and is subject to the
federal conformity requirements. The purpose of the analysis is to apply the Federal General
Conformity Rule established in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §93, Determining Conformity of
Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans, to the Proposed Action to determine any
effect on air quality.
The federal conformity rules were established to ensure that federal activities do not hamper local
efforts to control air pollution. In particular, Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) prohibits
federal agencies, departments, or instrumentalities from engaging in, supporting, licensing, or
approving any action, in an area that is in nonattainment or maintenance of the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS), which does not conform to an approved state or federal implementation
plan.

2.0

Project Description

Under Alternative 1, the United States (U.S.) Department of the Army (Army) would demolish two
52,000-square-foot hangars and supporting infrastructure beginning in the spring of 2014. Demolition
would involve removal of the hangars, totaling 24,016 cubic yards of non-hazardous debris; demolition
of existing and abandoned utilities not belonging to Doyon Utilities (the current utility provider for the
installation), totaling approximately 2,680 linear feet; demolition of existing privately owned vehicle
parking areas, lighting, head bolt outlets and power source, encompassing an area of approximately 3.3
acres; and demolition of the concrete building slabs and foundations within 5 feet of the building, to a
depth of eight inches, totaling approximately 2,075 cubic yards of debris. In addition, a small (200square-foot), open, flammable liquids storage facility located between Hangars 2 and 3, which is
currently empty, would be demolished, totaling approximately 91 cubic yards of debris.
Prior to demolition, the Army would conduct hazardous material surveys of the buildings and their
supporting infrastructure, including surveys for soil contamination. The Army would properly remove
and dispose of any hazardous materials found. Any asbestos containing building materials would be
Appendix G

G-1

disposed of in the Fort Wainwright landfill, while all other hazardous materials would be disposed of
properly in accordance with applicable federal and state regulations off-post in the Fairbanks North Star
Borough (FNSB) landfill. Non-hazardous demolition debris would be disposed of in the FNSB landfill;
however, the Army would divert (i.e., salvage, recycle, or reuse) non-hazardous materials from being
placed in the landfill to the maximum extent practicable. Once demolition of the hangars is complete,
approximately 13,625 square yards of concrete would be added to the building and infrastructure
footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield, which is designated as an aircraft parking
apron. The Army would construct two asphalt access roads to the new apron to facilitate potential
future access by emergency and maintenance vehicles. Infiltration areas, swales, and culverts for
stormwater would be installed as needed, to include the addition of topsoil and seeding. Security
fencing, compatible with existing design, would also be installed. The total area encompassed by this
project is approximately 10 acres.
Under Alternative 2, the No Action Alternative, no demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 would occur.
Because there would be no large-scale rehabilitation efforts and the likelihood that future system failure
would not result in replacement or repair, the structural integrity of the hangars would continue to
deteriorate over time. The eventual uncontrolled collapse of the buildings or perhaps the total loss of
one or both hangars by fire is most likely. At such time the buildings do collapse, all debris would be
treated as waste and disposed of in the FNSB landfill. Any follow-on actions associated with the
location would be subject to funding, but the current preference would be that concrete is added to the
building footprints to maintain consistency with the adjacent airfield as an aircraft parking apron. When
collapse of the buildings occurs, there would be temporary emissions similar to those described under
Alternative 1 within this conformity applicability analysis. Therefore, demolition and construction
impacts under the No Action Alternative are not analyzed separately from Alternative 1.

3.0

Meteorology/Climate

Temperature is a parameter used in calculating emissions for air quality applicability. The climate in
Fairbanks, Alaska, ranges from 72 degrees Fahrenheit in July to an average of –20 degrees Fahrenheit
in January. Fairbanks receives an average of 11.3 inches of precipitation annually. April is the driest
month (The Weather Channel, 2012). During the winter months, low temperatures and calm winds
combined with high emissions in Fairbanks create surface based inversions. Surface-based inversions
result in poor dispersion of air pollutants, namely PM2.5 and create unhealthy air quality conditions.

G-2

Appendix G

4.0

Current Ambient Air Quality Conditions

The USEPA has classified the area of the Proposed Action, FNSB, Alaska, as in nonattainment for
PM2.5. Only a portion of the FNSB is classified as nonattainment; however, the nonattainment portion
includes Fort Wainwright. The region is also in maintenance for CO.

5.0

Air Quality Regulatory Requirements

5.1

General Conformity Applicability Analysis

The USEPA defines ambient air in 40 CFR §50 as “that portion of the atmosphere, external to
buildings, to which the general public has access.” In compliance with the 1970 CAA and the 1977 and
1990 CAA Amendments, the USEPA has promulgated the NAAQS. The NAAQS were enacted for the
protection of the public health and welfare, allowing for an adequate margin of safety. To date, the
USEPA has issued NAAQS for six criteria pollutants: CO, sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter
(particles with a diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM10) and particles with a
diameter less than or equal to nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
and lead (Pb). Federal regulations designate Air Quality Control Regions in violation of the NAAQS as
nonattainment areas. According to the severity of the pollution problem, nonattainment areas can be
categorized as marginal, moderate, serious, severe, or extreme.
The NAAQS for PM2.5 and CO are listed in Table G-1.

Federal primary and secondary standards for this pollutant are identical.

To regulate the emission levels resulting from a project, federal actions located in nonattainment or
maintenance areas are required to demonstrate compliance with the general conformity rule established
in 40 CFR §93 Determining Conformity of Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans

Appendix G

G-3

(the Rule). The project area is located within a nonattainment area and maintenance area; therefore, a
General Conformity Rule applicability analysis is warranted.
Section 93.153 of the Rule sets applicability requirements for projects subject to the Rule through
establishment of de minimis levels for annual criteria pollutant emissions. These de minimis levels are
set according to criteria pollutant nonattainment area designations. For projects below the de minimis
levels, a conformity determination is not required. Those at or above the levels are required to perform
a conformity analysis as established in the Rule. The de minimis levels apply to emissions that can
occur during the construction and operation phases of the action.
On July 11, 2006, the USEPA established de minimis levels for PM2.5. The final rule established 100
tons per year (TPY) as the de minimis emission level under nonattainment for directly emitted PM2.5
and each of the precursors that form it (SO2, NOx, volatile organic compounds [VOCs], and ammonia).
This 100 TPY threshold applies separately to each precursor. This means that if an action’s direct or
indirect emissions of PM2.5, SO2, NOx, VOC, or ammonia exceed 100 TPY, a General Conformity
determination would be required. Under the current USEPA policy for addressing PM2.5 precursors,
only PM2.5 and SO2 must be evaluated in all regions. States are not required to evaluate VOC, NOx, or
ammonia unless the state or the USEPA makes a technical demonstration that those particular
emissions from sources within the state significantly contribute to PM2.5 concentrations in a given
nonattainment area (USEPA, 2007). Neither USEPA nor Alaska has found PM2.5 problems in Fairbanks
to be caused by NOx, VOC, or ammonia; therefore, these pollutants are not examined further in this
analysis.
The U.S. Army Garrison Fort Wainwright (USAG FWA) has completed a General Conformity Rule
applicability analysis in order to analyze any impact to air quality. Emissions have been estimated for
PM2.5 with its precursor SO2, and CO. Annual emissions for these compounds were estimated for the
demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 to determine if they would be below or above the de minimis levels
established in the Rule. The de minimis for PM2.5 nonattainment areas is 100 TPY for PM2.5 and SO2.
The maintenance de minimis level for CO is 100 TPY.
Sources of PM2.5, SO2, and CO associated with the Proposed Action would include emissions from
demolition equipment, fugitive dust (PM2.5), and the change in emissions from the reduced demand on
the central heating and power plant.

6.0

Conformity Applicability Analysis

This project construction- and operations-related General Conformity analysis was performed for the
Proposed Action at Fort Wainwright. This conformity analysis and air emissions evaluation will follow
G-4

Appendix G

the criteria regulated in 40 CFR §93, Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or
Federal Implementation Plans; Final Rule (November 30, 1993), as revised 5 April 2010. The
emissions evaluation will also follow all National Environmental Policy Act-related criteria regulated in
40 CFR §6.

6.1

Construction Phase Emissions

The Proposed Action would require the operation of heavy equipment and dump trucks for demolition
activities.

6.1.1

Emissions from Heavy Equipment

Annual emissions were calculated for various types of diesel construction vehicles using model
emission rate input for the year 2014 in USEPA’s Nonroad2008a Emission Inventory Model: Diesel
Construction Equipment, Fairbanks, Alaska (USEPA, 2008). Truck emission levels were calculated
using USEPA’s MOVES model for conditions in summer 2014 (USEPA, 2010). The total annual
emissions in TPY were determined for each vehicle based on the number of vehicles used and the
number of operating hours per year. As noted above, if demolition of the buildings occurs, it would
begin in the spring of 2014. So for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that any demolition and
construction activities would be completed in a one year timeframe (i.e., during 2014). If demolition
occurs later than 2014, it would be expected that newer, cleaner heavy equipment would be used,
resulting in fewer emissions.
It was assumed that dump trucks would travel 14 miles per trip to the local landfill, with the exception
of the asbestos-containing material, which would have a round trip haul of 5 miles to the Fort
Wainwright landfill.

6.1.2

Calculations for Construction Emissions

Using the emissions factors in Table G-2, construction emissions were calculated for the proposed
demolition of both Hangars 2 and 3 at Fort Wainwright. Using the assumptions described above, the
emissions in tons of PM2.5, SO2, and CO for construction equipment emissions were calculated for each
vehicle type using the appropriate equations shown in Table G-3.
Emissions factors used for construction vehicles are shown in Table G-2.

All demolition would be expected to occur on paved surfaces. Therefore, the quantification of dust

Practices would be implemented to limit fugitive dust from unpaved surfaces, including moistening soil
with a water tanker and washing down vehicles before the exit the project area.

Operations Emissions

6.2.1

Heating and Electrical Source Emissions

Hangars 2 and 3 are currently powered by the central heating and power plant. The existing hangars
utilize approximately 3,000 tons of coal for heat and electricity (1,426 – Hangar 2 and 1,556.03 –
Hangar 3), or about 1 percent of the overall 300,000 tons of coal burned by the central heating and
power plan annually. Under Alternative 1, approximately 3,000 tons of coal would no longer need to
burned, resulting in a reduction of emissions.
According to the USAG FWA, the central heating and power plant accounts for 90 percent of all
emissions at Fort Wainwright. Using the potential to emit limitations under the Title V permit for
Doyon Utilities, it can be determined that 300,000 tons of coal produces approximately 2,354.3 TPY
Appendix G

G-7

SO2, 0.81 TPY PM2.5 and 847.6 TPY CO. This assumption equates to 0.007 tons SO2 per ton of coal,
0.0000027 tons of PM2.5 per ton of coal, and 0.0028 tons CO per ton of coal. Therefore, a reduction in
3,000 tons of coal annually would eliminate 23.543 tons of SO2, 0.0081 tons of PM2.5 and 8.476 tons of
CO.
There would be no additional generators or daily commuters on Fort Wainwright resulting from the
Alternative 1; therefore, there would be no operational emissions to consider in this analysis from these
sources.

6.3

Summary of Construction and Operations Emissions

Total emissions were summed by combining the total emissions for demolition, construction and
operational reductions to determine whether emissions exceed the de minimis values presented in the
following Table G-5. Negative total emissions demonstrate an overall reduction in annual emissions
due to a decrease in baseline emissions (the reduced load on the central heating and power plant).

Under Alternative 1, the total emissions resulting from the demolition of Hangars 2 and 3 and the
reduced operational demand on the central heating and power plant would not exceed the de minimis
threshold for any of the pollutants analyzed. Therefore, a conformity determination is not required. A
Record of Non-Applicability has been prepared and is attached to this appendix.
