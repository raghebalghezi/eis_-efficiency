Tahoe National Forest; the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA); and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) are preparing a joint environmental document for the California Pacific Electric Company (CalPeco) 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project. The document is an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S. Code 4321-4347), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulations 1500-1508), Forest Service Manual 1950, and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15; an EIS for TRPA pursuant to the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551), Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure; and an environmental impact report (EIR) for CPUC pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations Section 15000 et seq.). All three agencies have determined that an EIS/EIS/EIR is needed to effectively analyze the proposal and evaluate impacts. In addition, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as a federal cooperating agency, will be responsible for the scope and content of the NEPA portion of the environmental document as it pertains to lands within its jurisdictional boundaries in Martis Valley. CalPeco is the project applicant. The proposed 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project would consist primarily of an upgrade of CalPeco’s existing 625 and 650 electrical power lines and associated substations from 60 kilovolt (kV) to 120 kV to allow the entire North Lake Tahoe Transmission System to operate at 120 kV. The project would include six primary components: 1) removal of the existing 625 Line and construction of a new, rerouted 625 Line; 2) rebuild of the existing 650 Line with potential for realignments based on the action alternatives considered; 3) realignment of two short segments of the 650 Line and removal of the replaced segments; 4) rebuild of the Northstar Tap into a fold (a “fold” allows for service to be maintained at a substation in the event of an interruption in service on either side of the power line feeding it); 5) rebuild of a 1.6-mile long section of the existing 132 Line in the Town of Truckee; and 6) upgrade, modification, and/or decommissioning of six substations. These improvements would increase the ability to maintain the current maximum system loads during an outage on any one of the four sections of the system (described in detail in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives), and decrease reliance on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. In addition, rebuilding and realigning the power lines would reduce the likelihood of outages associated with high winds, downed trees, snow loading, and forest fires, and would improve access to the lines for maintenance, emergency outage response, and repair activities. This EIS/EIS/EIR does not make a recommendation regarding the approval or denial of the project. The analysis included in this EIS/EIS/EIR is purely informational in content, and will be used by the USFS, TRPA, and CPUC to render decisions regarding approval of project elements within their jurisdiction and selection of an alternative. ES.1.1 PROJECT AREA The project features and proposed activities are predominantly located on lands managed by the USFS; these lands are located in the LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest. Portions of the project are also located in the Town of Truckee and the unincorporated Placer County communities of Kings Beach and Tahoe City, on lands within the Martis Creek Lake Recreation Area and Burton Creek State Park, and on private lands. ES.1.2 PURPOSE, NEED, AND OBJECTIVES National and state electric reliability standards require that CalPeco ensure that the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System perform safely under normal and contingency conditions. For example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Reliability Standard TPL-002-0b requires that CalPeco’s transmission system have the capability to supply peak loads at adequate voltage levels without overloading the system components with any one component out of service. The CPUC regulations related to system reliability are contained in California Public Utilities Code Section 399, which implements the California Legislature’s “Reliable Electric Service Investments Act,” stating that it is the policy of the state, and the intent of the Legislature, that each electrical corporation operate its electric distribution grid in its service in a safe, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective manner [399.2(a)(1)] and that prudent investments continue to be made to protect the integrity of the electric distribution grid [399(c)(1)]. The system cannot currently provide single-contingency reliability during peak loads, even with use of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station, and is experiencing peak demands in excess of design capacity. The proposed project ensures that the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System complies with national and state electric reliability regulations as well as safety standards. The 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project is designed to fulfill five primary purposes. 1. Provide normal capacity for current and projected loads. 2. Provide reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages. 3. Reduce dependence on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. 4. Reduce the risk of fire hazards and outage durations associated with wooden poles and encroaching vegetation. 5. Provide more reliable access to the 625 Line for operation and maintenance activities. Addressing normal and projected loads, providing single-contingency reliability, and reducing dependence on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station would be achieved by upgrading the 625 and 650 Lines and associated facilities (e.g., substations) from 60 kV to 120 kV. Reducing the risk of wildfire hazard would be achieved by replacing existing wooden poles with the proposed steel poles, which are stronger and more resistant to wildfire. In addition, raising the elevation of the lines and widening the vegetation management corridor, both regulatory requirements when converting from the current 60 kV configuration to 120 kV, would reduce wildfire risk and risk of damage from encroaching vegetation. Increased access to the 625 Line for inspection, maintenance, and repairs would be achieved by re-routing the line to a less remote location with existing access roads, and creating new overland travel ways where needed. Improving truck access to the 625 Line for inspections and maintenance would also increase the lines’ resilience to outages.  ES.2  SUMMARY OF PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT The environmental review process for the CalPeco 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project began with a public scoping period. A Notice of Intent (NOI) and Notice of Preparation (NOP) was issued to inform agencies and the public that a Draft EIS/EIS/EIR would be prepared for the project, and to solicit views of agencies and the public as to the scope and content of the EIS/EIS/EIR. The NOP/NOI was distributed on March 26, 2012 and the scoping period concluded on April 25, 2012. Scoping notices were mailed to governmental agencies, landowners within 300 feet of the project boundaries, interested individuals, and community organizations. Additionally, public notices were placed in both the Tahoe Daily Tribune and the Nevada Appeal on March 28, 2012. Two scoping meetings were held to allow oral expression of opinion regarding the content of the EIS/EIS/EIR, as listed below.   April 17, 2012. Public scoping meeting beginning at 6:00 p.m. at the North Tahoe Event Center, Kings Beach, California.   April 19, 2012. Public scoping meeting beginning at 6:00 p.m. at the USFS Tahoe National Forest Offices, Truckee, California. Scoping comments received are summarized in Appendix A, Notice of Preparation and Scoping Summary Report. ES.2.1 AREAS OF CONTROVERSY AND ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED Areas of controversy include: purpose and need for the project; impacts to scenic quality; impacts to the recreation experience and access to USFS roads; impacts to forest resources, and maintenance and restoration of access ways and staging areas; effects on water quality; effects on air quality; impacts to public health safety; the effects of helicopter use; and the potential for increases in system capacity to support future development. Additional project details requested by commenters and an assessment of suggested alternatives to the project are included in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. PURPOSE AND NEED Commenters questioned the need to increase the voltage of the power lines (from 60 kV to 120 kV) and the methodology used to estimate future demand. Commenters also questioned the purpose of the Northstar Tap. The planning and design processes are described in detail in Chapter 2, Purpose and Need, and Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. SCENIC RESOURCES Commenters were concerned about the scenic consequences of the new, steel poles and larger right of way (ROW). Commenters also requested analysis of the potential aesthetic impacts relative to Truckee's historic district, Truckee's Interstate 80 (I-80) designated scenic corridor, and the Truckee River and Legacy Trail. Section 4.4, Scenic Resources, includes analysis of potential visual impacts of the project, as well as a contour map of viewsheds and visual simulations. RECREATION Due to proximity to recreational resources, including the Tahoe Rim Trail, commenters requested analysis of impacts to hiking, camping, and day use. Commenters were also concerned with changes to the USFS roadway network, which is currently used for recreation. Recreational resources are addressed in Section 4.8, Recreation. FOREST RESOURCES AND RESTORATION OF TEMPORARY WORK AREAS Commenters requested details regarding the number of trees that would be removed and the treatment of hazard trees. The restoration of current and temporary easements that would be abandoned, staging areas, stringing sites, and other temporary disturbance areas were also topics of comments received. Proposed restoration and maintenance activities are addressed in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. Details specific to management of forest resources are included in Section 4.3, Forest Resources. WATER QUALITY Commenters expressed concern about the potential for construction and maintenance of power poles near the Truckee River, Trout Creek, wetlands, and other stream environment zones (SEZs) to affect surface water quality. Commenters requested a discussion of effects to drainage patterns and identification of project components within the 50- and 100-year floodplains. Potential disturbance areas and environmental effects of construction and maintenance of the project alternatives are discussed in Section 4.6, Hydrology and Water Quality.  AIR QUALITY Commenters requested that analysis of potential adverse impacts to air quality from all phases of the project be evaluated. This analysis is contained in Section 4.13, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Climate Change.  PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY Comments were received on the issue of electromagnetic fields, which are addressed in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, and Section 4.10, Hazards and Hazardous Materials. Commenters also expressed concern that locating the power lines in remote areas would increase the risk of wildland fire. See Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, for a discussion of fire potential, which is anticipated to decrease with the use of new, stronger, fire-resistant poles. HELICOPTER USE Helicopters are proposed for use during construction. Commenters requested a full analysis of this project element. Staging areas that may include helicopter landing pads are identified in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. Chapter 4, Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Mitigation Measures, includes a full analysis of this project element, specifically in Section 4.13, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Climate Change and Section 4.14, Noise. POTENTIAL FOR INCREASES IN SYSTEM CAPACITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT General concern has been expressed that increasing the capacity of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System for system reliability would promote, though infrastructure availability, expanded development of the Lake Tahoe region. The necessity of the proposed upgrades to serve existing demand is discussed in Chapter 2, Purpose and Need. See Chapter 5, Other NEPA, TRPA, and CEQA Mandated Sections, for evaluation of the potential for growth as a result of the increased availability of electrical power.  ES.3  SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVES Through public scoping and agency coordination, four action alternatives were identified for detailed analysis in the EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in Chapter 2, Purpose and Need, the applicant has determined that improved system reliability and resilience to outages would be achieved through upgrade of the existing 625 and 650 Lines and associated substations from 60 kV to 120 kV, which would permit the entire system to operate at 120 kV. The four action alternatives considered in this EIS/EIS/EIR are variations on addressing the following six key project components:  rebuild of the existing 650 Line (with potential for realignments based on alternative);  removal and realignment of two short segments of the 650 Line to straighten the line and remove angle points (simplifying line construction and maintenance);   rebuild of a 1.6-mile section of the existing 132 Line;  rebuild of the Northstar Tap into the Northstar Fold (a “fold” allows for service to be maintained at a substation in the event of an interruption in service on the power lines feeding into either side of substation; for this project, this means that the Northstar Substation could be fed from the 650 Line to the north or south, whereas currently it is a single source feed);   upgrade, modification, and/or decommission of six substations; and  removal of the existing 625 Line and construction of a new, rerouted 625 Line.  These improvements would increase the ability to maintain the current maximum system loads during an outage on any one of the four legs of the system (i.e., 625 Line, 650 Line, 609 Line, and 629 Line), and decrease reliance on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. In addition, rebuilding and realigning the power lines would reduce the likelihood of outages associated with high winds, felled trees, snow loading, and forest fires and improve access to the lines for maintenance and repair activities. ES.3.1 ALTERNATIVE 1: PEA ALTERNATIVE Alternative 1 was developed in the Proponent’s Environmental Assessment (PEA) prepared by the project applicant (Sierra Pacific Power Company at that time) as part of the original permit application submitted to the CPUC in 2010. Generally, Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would locate the 625 Line closer to the Fiberboard Freeway (a paved road between the Mount Watson area north of Tahoe City and the Brockway Summit area) to improve access. ES.3.2 ALTERNATIVE 2: MODIFIED ALTERNATIVE Alternative 2 is a modified alternative, which is similar to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), but includes rerouting of some portions of the alignment based on public and agency input received during scoping, additional information gathered during detailed field reviews, and further progress on project engineering and design. The intent of the segment reroutes is to avoid or minimize effects on biological, visual, or cultural resources. ES.3.3 ALTERNATIVE 3: ROAD FOCUSED ALTERNATIVE Alternative 3 is a road focused alternative, which re-routes the 625 Line to more closely follow the Fiberboard Freeway and other area roadways and places more of the 650 Line along State Route (SR) 267. Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) includes a double-circuit option segment option that is referred to as Alternative 3A. Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) is intended to maximize the proximity of project facilities to existing roadways in order to minimize the need for new access ways, ground disturbance, and associated environmental effects. ES.3.4 ALTERNATIVE 4: PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) is a combination of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) for the 625 Line improvements and elements of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) for the 650 Line improvements. Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) allows facilities to be in proximity to existing roadways, while maximizing the use of the already upgraded portion of the 650 Line in Segment 650-5. ES.3.5 ALTERNATIVE 5: NO ACTION/NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), no upgrade of the existing power lines would occur. This alternative would be associated with increased maintenance activities, including some deferred items, such as ROW maintenance and replacement of existing wooden poles. Lines would be operated close to or above their ratings, which would put the line conductor at high risk of annealing (excessive heating and cooling of a conductor that results in decreased tensile strength). The Kings Beach diesel generators would be used when needed, but because the permit for the generators limits the annual operating hours, use would have to be judicious so that hours could be retained throughout the year.  ES.4  COMPARATIVE FEATURES OF THE ALTERNATIVES Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, provides a detailed description of each of the alternatives under consideration. Tables ES-1a through ES-1c provide a side-by-side comparison of major characteristics and potential effects of each alternative, including miles of new power line, miles of new access ways, acreage of disturbance, trees to be removed, and other features. ES.5  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION  Chapter 4, Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Mitigation Measures, of this Draft EIS/EIS/EIR describes in detail the environmental effects that would result from implementation of the project alternatives. Impacts are determined to be: 1) no impact; 2) less than significant (adverse or potentially adverse effects that are not substantial); 3) significant or potentially significant (substantial or potentially substantial adverse changes in the environment, for which mitigation measures are required); and 4) significant and unavoidable (substantial or potentially substantial adverse changes in the environment that cannot be feasibly reduced to a less-than-significant levels with mitigation measures). The project includes applicant proposed measures (APMs) developed to avoid, minimize, or compensate for the impacts of the project. These APMs were originally proposed in the June 2010 PEA, and have been modified by the applicant during project development and in response to environmental review. These measures are listed in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. CalPeco has committed to implementing these measures to reduce the potential direct and indirect impacts that could result from the action alternatives. Therefore, the APMs are considered part of the project description. Where impacts are identified that are not addressed by these APMs, or where the APMs are not adequate to reduce impacts to less than significant levels, the EIS/EIS/EIR recommends additional mitigation measures. APMs will be incorporated into the Mitigation Monitoring, Compliance, and Reporting Program developed for this proposed project, and implementation of the APMs will be monitored in the same fashion as the mitigation measures developed in this EIS/EIS/EIR. Table ES-2 (at the end of this chapter) summarizes the potential environmental effects that would result from implementation of the alternatives; describes mitigation measures to address significant and potentially significant environmental effects; and identifies the significance of impacts both before and after mitigation. Based solely on impact significance conclusions, there is not a clear distinction in the level of impact among the four action alternatives. As described in the various impact discussions in Chapter 4, Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Mitigation Measures, where there are differences in environmental effects among the action alternatives, it is often a matter of some degree of more or less effect among the alternatives rather than one or more of the alternatives generating an environmental effect that the others do not. For example, the reduced project footprint resulting from double-circuit segments in Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) is anticipated to result in reduced ground disturbance relative to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), and therefore lesser potential for effects such as discovery of currently undocumented subsurface cultural resources, removal of habitat, and generation of erosion and siltation, but does not remove the potential for these effects all together. All significant and potentially significant impacts related to these issues would be reduced to less than significant levels with mitigation for all action alternatives; however, Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would initially result in less effect, or less potential for effect, relative to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Similarly, whereas poles constructed under all four action alternatives could potentially generate conflicts with safe operation of the Truckee Tahoe Airport, Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would have the greatest potential for significant impacts because its alignment is closest to the airport runway; Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would be less likely to result in significant impacts because its alignment would be farther from the airport runway, and Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would be less likely still to generate significant impacts because the alignment would be farthest from the airport runway. However, for all action alternatives, if a significant impact related to airport safety were to occur, the impact could be reduced to a less than significant level with mitigation. The mitigation could consist of placing the line underground, which would generate its own environmental impacts (e.g., additional soil disturbance from excavation) as described in Section 4.10, Hazards and Hazardous Materials.  In many instances, each alternative would result in environmental trade-offs, reducing effects for one environmental issue area, but increasing environmental effects for another. For example, Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) reduce the amount of vegetation removal relative to other alternatives by placing the power line closer to the Fiberboard Freeway in Segments 625-3 through 625-8 between Tahoe City and Brockway Summit. However, by placing the power line closer to the road, it becomes more visible to recreationists and others using the Fiberboard Freeway, increasing the scenic effects. Conversely, the double-circuit segments (Segments 625-9 and 625-10) under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) minimize the visibility of the power line by keeping it in a remote location, but result in increased vegetation removal, both due to the location of the power line alignment and the need to create more permanent access ways to the line. The numeric information for each alternative provided in Tables ES-1a through ES-1c provides an indication of the scope of activity and relative potential for effects under each of the action alternatives. This information may guide the determination of the environmentally preferable or environmentally superior alternative. When considering the 625 and 650 Lines combined, Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double-Circuit Option) would have the least impacts in more categories than any of the other action alternatives, including in areas related to access way requirements, disturbance of SEZ (i.e., areas determined by TRPA to generally owe their biological and physical characteristics to the presence of surface or groundwater) and Protected Activity Centers (PACs) for northern goshawk and California spotted owl, and potential for tree removal. Implementation of Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double-Circuit Option), however, would result in unmitigable scenic effects along SR 267, and, as a result, is considered infeasible. The measure adopted to address the impact to scenic resources along SR 267 (APM SCE-7) for the other action alternatives is a setback of the power line. This would not be feasible in Segment D-C OH-1A/650-1 for Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double-Circuit Option) because there are residences in the setback area. Second to Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double-Circuit Option), Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would have the lowest, or the second lowest, values in many categories, including total number of poles required and the acreage of permanent disturbance. Because Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would have the second lowest potential for project effects, based on relatively low values in the key issue areas identified in Table ES-1c, and would not result in unmitigable scenic impacts, this alternative is considered the environmentally preferable/environmentally superior alternative.    This page intentionally left blank.  Table ES-1a

See Table ES-1B.  1 Values of zero are provided because in these Segments the 625 Line is placed on the same poles as the 650 Line in a double-circuit configuration. Project features and impacts are attributed to the 650 Line for these Segments under RF and PA Alternative. 2 Many of the new access ways would consist of short spur roads connecting existing roadways to nearby portions of the power line ROW, but are included in the mileage calculations.  3 Sensitive habitat types include montane riparian, wet montane meadow, seasonal wetland, fresh emergent wetland, and open water.  4 Where the new power line corridor would follow and expand the width of the existing 625 Line corridor, acreages include only areas within the newly-disturbed expansion area (i.e., the acreages do not include the existing disturbed/managed corridor). 5 This value accounts for SEZ in the permanent ROW. Due to the limited footprint of the power poles and the ability to span most sensitive habitats, much of this acreage may not be impacted. SEZ refers to areas mapped specifically as SEZ by TRPA within the Tahoe Basin portion of the ROW.  SEZ acreage in the ROW includes all of the sensitive habitat acreages that occur within the Tahoe Basin portion of the ROW (montane riparian, open water, wet montane meadow, and seasonal wetland), plus additional area not mapped and quantified as one of the habitats types.    6 Data source: Calpeco 925 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project: Supplemental Forestry and Vegetation Management Report, Forester’s Co-Op, May 2013.

Introduce uses not listed as permissible in the Plan Area Statement (PAS) or Community Plan, or expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that substantial land use conflicts or incompatibility would occur. All components of the action alternatives are listed as permissible in the applicable PASs and Community Plans, except the existing distribution underbuild on the 625 Line within the Lower Truckee (003) PAS and the proposed upgrade of the Kings Beach Substation in the Martis Peak (019) PAS. The existing distribution underbuild in the Lower Truckee (003) PAS is a non-conforming use, but the relocation of the underbuild to the upgraded power poles would neither expand nor intensify this use because the distribution underbuild would simply be moved to the new poles—the capacity, conductor, and related infrastructure would not be altered. The proposed amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS would add “Public Utility Center” to the list of permissible uses, would accommodate the expanded substation in the most appropriate location (in the location of the existing substation and more distant from the residential area than would otherwise be allowed), and would allow the decommissioning of the Brockway Substation. The proposed access ways would be accessory to the power lines. The action alternatives would include uses that are listed as both “allowable” and “special” by TRPA Code. The findings in Subsection 21.2.1 of the TRPA Code can be made for those project components defined as special uses in the applicable PAS/Community Plan. Therefore, because the action alternatives would be permissible with the adoption of the amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS and necessary special use findings could be made, they would not expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.2-2.

Disturbance or loss of special-status plants. Implementing the action alternatives would result in direct removal and disturbance of Plumas ivesia and habitat that could be occupied by other special-status plant species. Special-status plants that are not directly removed or physically damaged could be adversely affected by habitat modification or degradation. APMs included in the project design would minimize, and in some instances, avoid potential adverse effects on special-status plants. Through implementation of APMs, the action alternatives would not substantially affect the abundance or distribution of any special-status species (either directly or through habitat modifications).  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.7-4. Tree removal and loss of late seral/old growth forest.

Loss of habitat for USFS management indicator species. Implementation of the action alternatives could affect habitat for nine USFS Management Indicator Species (MIS). With integration of APMs into project design to minimize, avoid, and compensate for impacts to biological resources, the project would not result in a substantial loss of habitat for any MIS, alter existing trends in any MIS habitat, or lead to a change in distribution of an MIS across the Sierra Nevada bioregion.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.8 Recreation        4.8-1. Result in a substantial decrease or loss of public access to any lake, waterway, or public lands. Construction would require temporary trail closures and access restrictions in some portions of the project area during the spring and summer, including on public lands used for recreation, to ensure public safety. Construction activities would not occur in winter months and would not affect winter recreation activities in the project area. Temporary closures may also be necessary on an infrequent basis during project operation for facility maintenance. The applicant has committed to avoidance of construction during known, permitted recreation events in the project area; advance notification of all construction activities to the public, USFS, and other agencies with jurisdiction over project area lands; and provision of adequate signage and alternate routes for any longer term closures, estimated to be up to one day in any given location. Construction is projected to occur in such a manner that closures would be short-term and of limited duration while numerous other facilities and trails in the region would remain open for use.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.8-2.

However, APMs (see Chapter 3, Project Alternatives) are included as part of the project. Appendix G of this document contains an analysis of the consistency of the project with all applicable policies adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect, and references specific APMs, impact analyses, and mitigation measures that would preclude any policy conflicts and reduce plan consistency impacts to less-than-significant levels.  4.3 Forestry Resources        4.3-1. Conflict with or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or timberland production zone (TPZ). Implementation of the action alternatives would not result in a conflict with existing Placer County forest land/timberland-related zoning or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ located in the project footprint (i.e., FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ). Electric lines are allowed as proposed without land use permit approval under the Placer Zoning Ordinance.   NI (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  NI (Alts. 1-4)  4.3-2. Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses or loss of forest land. Implementation of the action alternatives would result in the removal of between approximately 47,100 (Alt. 4) and 58,000 (Alt. 1) trees in up to 219.8 acres of forest land plus hazard tree border zones as part of project construction and long-term vegetation management in the power line ROW and in new access ways. Considering forest regeneration on land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW, overall permanent forest land impact would be between 66.1 acres (Alt. 4) and 107.0 acres (Alt. 2). Tree removal would not result in substantial changes to adjacent stand structure or regional forest land composition or distribution. Forest land would not be lost or converted to a non-forest use as project-related activities are compatible uses with forest land zoning designations in the project area.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  loaders, chain saws, chippers, and helicopters. Such activity has the potential to create air emissions, dust, noise, objectionable odors, and visual impacts that could diminish the quality of the recreation experience for users in the vicinity. Permanent project elements (e.g., steel poles, conductor, new and expanded access ways, vegetation management areas) would also be visible in portions of the project area used for recreation and could contribute to diminished quality of recreation experience. As elements of the project, the applicant has committed to implement APMs relative to recreation, scenic, noise, and air quality to reduce or avoid potential adverse impacts in these areas. Construction activities would be temporary, limited to smaller areas of active construction at any given time, and would implement APMs in a variety of technical areas.   4.8-3. Adverse effects associated with new or expanded recreation facilities. The project does not propose new recreation facilities or require the construction or expansion of recreation facilities. The new access ways would not be designated or intended for use as recreational facilities and barriers to access by motorized recreational vehicles would be placed at the entrance to the access ways. However, due to unrestricted public access on USFS land, it is possible that unsanctioned use of the access ways for hiking or skiing could occur. Such use would likely be opportunistic and therefore limited in numbers, and signage and barriers would be in place to discourage unauthorized use.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.9 Heritage, Cultural, and Paleontological Resources        4.9-1.

Change in existing environment that could result in conversion of forest land to non-forest use. Project activities are compatible with Placer County zoning and do not result in zoning changes that could promote growth. Although the proposed project responds to growth planned/authorized by others, it does not itself promote development that could result in forest land conversion. Implementation of the action alternatives would not involve additional changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could temporarily or permanently result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use.   NI (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  NI (Alts. 1-4)  4.4 Scenic Resources        4.4-1. Cause inconsistency with adopted plans. The Tahoe City Community Plan (1994) suggests relocation of the Tahoe City Substation to a specific site known as “the Chimneys” as a means of removing it from public view and thereby improving scenic quality. This action is also defined as Scenic Program Project #135 in the Scenic Quality Improvement Program. Although the Roadway Travel Unit was not in attainment of scenic thresholds at the time substation relocation was recommended, it is now in attainment and has been since 2006. The action alternatives propose to rebuild the Tahoe City Substation in its current location and screen the facility from public view.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.4-2. Create views of rebuilt power lines or other project components from sensitive locations. The existing 625 and 650 Lines would be rebuilt using larger poles that would be more conspicuous than the existing line in views from certain public recreation areas, bike trails, and scenic roadway corridors. Implementation of proposed APMs would minimize scenic effects during construction through specific screening and management practices; require use of specific materials, colors, and textures for project elements; and modify power pole and line placement such that views from sensitive locations and scenic resources would be  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  substantial adverse change in the significance of one or more of these resources.   4.9-2. Damage to or destruction of undocumented significant heritage and cultural resources. Most of the APE has been intensively surveyed for heritage and cultural resources. However, there are portions of the APE where surveys have not yet been completed. In areas that have been surveyed, there also remains a potential for unanticipated, previously unidentified subsurface resources to be discovered during construction. Newly discovered heritage and cultural resources could be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or California Register of Historical Resources and could be adversely affected during project construction.   PS (Alts. 1-4)  No feasible mitigation has been identified.  SU (Alts. 1-4)  4.9-3. Unanticipated discovery of human remains during construction. One historic cemetery is located within the APE for the existing and proposed 650 Line. Although there is a low potential for human remains to be discovered during ground disturbance for the project, construction activities would have the potential to disturb human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries.   PS (Alts. 1-4)  No feasible mitigation has been identified.  SU (Alts. 1-4)  4.9-4. Discovery of paleontological resources during construction. Due to the known presence of paleontological resources in the region, construction activities in the Mehrten Formation geologic unit have the potential to disturb or destroy newly discovered paleontological resources. However, implementation APMs would prevent substantial damage to important paleontological resources.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.10 Hazards and Hazardous Materials        4.10-1.

However, implementation of design features, proposed APMs, and permit conditions would reduce the potential for impact.  4.5-3. Other soil hazards. Construction of the action alternatives could occur in expansive or unstable soils. Also, because of the variable and steep topography across the study area, construction of the action alternatives could create slope instability. Expansive soils can change in volume, causing damage to structures or foundations. The Natural Resource Conservation Service soil surveys indicate that some moderately expansive soils may exist in the study area. Also, because portions of the study area are located on sloping ground and installation of poles and access ways would require excavations, there is a potential for these activities to create slope instability. Because a geotechnical study of the project area would be completed and recommendations from a resulting Geotechnical Engineering Report (APM SOILS-2) would be implemented prior to construction, potentially expansive or unstable soils and slope instability would be identified and avoided, or mitigated through specialized construction methods.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.5-4. Loss of availability of a known mineral resource or locally important mineral resource recovery site. The existing 132/650 Line (Segment 650-6) crosses an important mineral resource area. The action alternatives would involve replacing the existing wood poles along this segment with steel poles.

During operations of the project, the potential would exist that a transformer could fail, resulting in a spill of mineral oil. However, use of hazardous materials at the site for construction, operation, and maintenance would be in compliance with multiple federal, state, and local regulations, including federal regulations as outlined in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 112, which require implementation of a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan.   4.10-2. Create a significant hazard to the public as a result of blasting activities. Blasting could be conducted as part of project construction to remove or break up rock outcrops. If not conducted properly, blasting could create a hazard to construction personnel and the public.   PS (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.10-2 (Alts. 1-4): Implement Blasting Safety Measures. If blasting is required as part of project construction, CalPeco shall hire a blasting contractor licensed by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and who possesses all other necessary licenses and certifications applicable to blasting in the project area. Prior to construction activities that require the use of explosives, the blasting contractor shall prepare and submit a Blasting Safety Plan (or similar document as required) to the Placer County Engineering and Surveying Division and the local fire protection district or department in which the blasting activity will take place. The plan shall, at a minimum, address the following. 〉 Evidence of licensing as required by the US Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, experience, and qualifications of all members of the blasting team. 〉 Pre-blast notifications to the local fire department, residents, landowners, land management agencies, utilities, and others potentially affected by blasting operations. 〉 The means for safe transportation and on-site storage and security of explosives in accordance with local, state and federal regulations. 〉 The minimum acceptable weather conditions for blasting. 〉 Minimum clearance distances between blasting and nearby land  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  action alternatives, in accordance with the TRPA land classification system and land coverage requirements. The applicant would secure the purchase or transfer of all required coverage and resolve any excess coverage mitigation requirements prior to groundbreaking and acknowledgement of the TRPA permit.   4.6 Hydrology and Water Quality        4.6-1. Violate any federal, state, regional, or TRPA water quality standards or waste discharge requirements, or otherwise substantially degrade surface or groundwater quality. Construction of the action alternatives would result in temporary soil disturbance along the upgraded utility alignment, new access ways and improved road sections, and staging areas. Soil disturbance associated with these construction activities could cause accelerated soil erosion and sediment loss that could be transported to nearby water bodies. Use of hazardous materials during construction (e.g., fuels, lubricants) could result in the release of these materials into nearby water bodies. Construction dewatering could also provide a mechanism for contaminant discharges. These short-term construction impacts would be avoided or minimized through adherence to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and programs which require implementation and continual monitoring and maintenance of best management practices (BMPs) to protect water quality during construction. Various measures included as part of the proposed project would further reduce the risk of water quality degradation.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.6-2.

Potential human health hazards from exposure to existing on-site hazardous materials. Construction could expose workers and the public to hazardous materials currently in the construction zone, and hazardous materials currently onsite could create environmental health hazards if left in place.   PS (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.10-3 (Alts. 1-4): Prepare and Implement a Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan. A hazardous materials contingency plan shall be prepared that describes the necessary actions that would be taken if evidence of contaminated soil or groundwater is encountered during construction. The contingency plan shall identify evidence that could indicate potential hazardous materials contamination, including soil discoloration, petroleum or chemical odors, presence of USTs, or buried building material. The plan shall include  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  foundation installations and upgrading of two substations. Any increase in impervious surfaces associated with these activities would be relatively small and only a small portion would occur in areas currently served by existing or planned stormwater facilities. There is little potential to increase the amount or rate of stormwater runoff in locations served by drainage infrastructure in a manner that would exceed the capacity of those existing or planned stormwater facilities or cause detrimental flooding to property or infrastructure. In addition, all installations of the action alternatives would need to comply with stringent requirements for stormwater and erosion control contained in the Lahontan Water Quality Control Plan, the Lake Tahoe Total Maximum Daily Load Program, and existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits. Therefore, if adverse increases in runoff were possible in a particular area, compliance with these plans and programs would ensure that adverse effects were avoided.   4.6-3. Substantially alter existing drainage patterns or alter the course or direction of any water body in a manner that may result in detrimental flooding to property or infrastructure or substantial erosion or siltation that may be carried to surface waters. Although some temporary access ways required for implementation of the action alternatives may cross creeks and drainages, the crossings would only be temporary and would be required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits and stormwater pollution prevention plan to install and remove temporary bridges or adequate diversions that would maintain conveyance of anticipated flows without causing aggravated erosion or siltation within the waterway.  A portion of the proposed access ways would occur in mountainous terrain resulting in steep grades that could intercept and redirect natural drainages or instigate accelerated erosion and rilling. Without adequate erosion control and drainage  S (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.6-3a (Alts. 1-4): Follow USFS Guidance on Locating and Designing Roads to Protect Water Quality and Incorporate Erosion Control BMPs for all New Access Ways or Improvements to Existing Roads.

The plan shall also identify legal and regulatory processes and thresholds for cleanup of contamination. The project applicant shall retain the services of a qualified environmental contractor to prepare the contingency plan. The plan, and obligations to abide by and implement the plan, shall be incorporated into the construction and contract specifications of the project. The requirements of the plan shall be incorporated in the APM and work practices training that would be implemented as part of APM HAZ-1.   4.10-4. Produce hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within 0.25 mile of an existing or proposed school. Construction and ongoing operations would require the use of certain materials such as fuels, oils, solvents, and other chemical products that, in larger quantities, could pose a potential hazard to the public or the environment if improperly used or inadvertently released. Six schools are located within 0.25 mile of the project. However, use of hazardous materials at the site would be in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.10-5. Conflict with an airport land use plan and potentially generate a safety hazard for people residing or working in the project area. Helicopters would be used for construction, but must follow Federal Aviation Administration regulatory requirements that would prevent conflicts with the Truckee Tahoe Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) and generation of safety hazards.  Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative), portions of  PS (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.10-5 (Alts. 1-4): Power Line Shall be Installed in Compliance with Height Requirements Approved by the Foothill Airport Land Use Commission.  If, as part of ALUC height review, any proposed power poles are classified as a hazard to flight by the ALUC, the pole heights shall be adjusted to conform with ALUC height requirements, as long as heights do not violate design and safety standards.

Most new, taller power poles would replace existing poles; no new poles would be placed within different or more sensitive Compatibility Zones. Portions of Segments 650-3 through 650-7 under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) occur in ALUCP Compatibility Zones B1, C, D, and E, and in Height Review Overlay Zones. New poles in Segment 650-4B would be placed within a more sensitive Compatibility Zone. Depending on site specific conditions, such as proximity to the runway and topography at the pole site, installing power poles that are taller than the existing poles could generate a safety hazard for aircraft entering or leaving the runways, which could also present a hazard to people residing or working in the project area.   requirements.  If a sufficient height reduction cannot be achieved, the power line in this area shall be installed underground.  4.10-6. Impair implementation or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan. Construction would create temporary construction-related traffic on local roadways and would require temporary lane/shoulder closures in work zones, resulting in traffic delays that could impair implementation of an emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan. However, implementation of APMs would reduce the potential for conflicts with implementation of emergency response plans and allow evacuation plans to be implemented if necessary.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.10-7. Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildland fires. The amount of human activity in the project area would increase during the construction period. The increase in human presence during fire season could result in an increased risk of fire. However, with integration of APMs as a part of project design that require the implementation of a Construction Fire Prevention and Suppression Plan and include other measures to minimize fire risk, project effects would be less than significant.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  eliminated or minimized.  4.4-3. Compliance with USFS Visual Quality Objectives. The 625 Line would be constructed within a new alignment on USFS lands within a ROW, and these areas would require new access. The visual effect of the newly cleared ROW, new access ways, and rebuilt power line would meet management goals for visual quality on USFS lands during construction and operation of the project.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.4-4. Result in adverse effects with respect to lighting or glare. The upgraded substations and conductors could introduce additional sources of lighting and glare that are more conspicuous than existing structures. Because substations would be rebuilt in the locations of existing substations (i.e., no new substations) and APMs would provide for: 1) use of non-specular conductor that is mechanically or chemically treated to reduce reflectivity, 2) use of non-reflective finishes on substation structures, and 3) screening of the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation through landscaping and other means, no substantial increase in lighting or glare is anticipated.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.5 Geology, Soils, Land Capability and Coverage        4.5-1. Exposure of people or structures to seismic hazards. The study area is not located within or adjacent to an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone. However, several faults are located in the project area that could subject project components to ground shaking and ground failure. Structures proposed as part of the action alternatives would be designed and constructed in accordance with the current minimum seismic safety and structural design requirements set forth in the California Building Code. Therefore, there would be no substantial increased risk of loss, injury, or death or property damage from strong ground shaking alone.   NI (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  NI (Alts. 1-4)  4.5-2.

Create the need for new or physically altered government facilities to maintain adequate law enforcement response times. During construction, potential theft and vandalism at construction sites may increase demand for law enforcement services. However, it is standard practice for contractors to provide nighttime lighting for security at staging and material storage areas, and to employ security staff if needed. Therefore, no substantial increase in demand for law enforcement would occur during construction that would alter government services or create the need for additional government facilities that could cause significant impacts. Operations and maintenance of the upgraded lines would not generate a demand for law enforcement services appreciably different from existing conditions.   NI (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  NI (Alts. 1-4)  4.11-2. Create the need for new or physically altered governmental facilities to maintain adequate fire protection response times. During construction, there would be a temporary increase in fire risk as a result of construction activities, which have the potential to ignite dry vegetation. A fire protection plan would be in place and a water truck would be available at all construction sites. Therefore, no substantial increase in demand for fire protection services would occur during construction that would alter government services or create the need for additional government facilities. Operations and maintenance of the upgraded lines would not result in increased demand for fire protection services, and because line access and monitoring ability would be improved in its new location, demand could be less.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.11-3.

Place structures within a 100-year flood hazard area that would impede or redirect flood flows. There are two locations where the action alternatives would place facilities within a 100-year flood hazard area.

Intercept or alter the direction or rate of flow of groundwater or degrade groundwater quality. The action alternatives involve the subsurface installation of steel poles and self-supporting poles with concrete foundations that have the potential to intercept groundwater flows. Given the small diameter and large spacing of the single poles, it is unlikely that they would have an impact to groundwater direction or rate of flow; however the temporary interception of groundwater during pole excavation and dewatering activities could create the potential to introduce contaminants.   S (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.6-5 (Alts. 1-4): Prepare and Implement a Dewatering and Discharge Plan. A dewatering and discharge plan shall be developed, submitted to TRPA and the LRWQCB for approval and implemented prior to initiating any excavation activities to protect groundwater resources in addition to surface waters in the event that groundwater is intercepted during project activities. The dewatering and discharge plan shall provide methods to protect groundwater during excavations from potential contaminant releases during equipment use and refueling, such as specific spill control and clean up and response measures in the vicinity of excavations. Additionally the dewatering and discharge plan shall include methods to collect and treat the sediment-laden water prior to releasing directly to a surface or groundwater source or demonstrate that it can be used to irrigate or applied as dust control without short-circuiting directly to surface waters.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.7 Biological Resources        4.7-1.

The action alternatives would generate solid waste during the construction phase. Some waste would be reused or recycled, while other waste would be taken to a landfill, and treated wood poles and other hazardous wastes would be transported to an approved facility, such as the US Ecology Nevada, Inc. treatment and disposal facility in Beatty, Nevada.

Conflict with an applicable congestion management program, including, but not limited to level of service standards and travel demand measures or generate 100 or more new daily vehicle trip ends (DVTE) in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Construction would temporarily add traffic to the area roadway network. The amount of additional temporary traffic may exceed 100 new DVTE in the Lake Tahoe Basin during construction; however, these DVTE would be generated on a short term and temporary basis, and would be spread over different locations and times of day.

Construction-generated emissions in Placer County would exceed Placer County Air Pollution Control District (PCAPCD) significance thresholds for NOX and PM10. Construction-generated emissions in Nevada County would exceed Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District significance thresholds for NOX. Construction activity would also generate substantial levels of PM2.5.

The restoration plan for SEZs shall include the following: o identification of compensatory mitigation sites and criteria for selecting these mitigation sites; o complete assessment of the existing biological resources in the restoration areas; o in kind reference habitats for comparison with compensatory SEZs (using performance and success criteria) to document success; o monitoring protocol, including schedule and annual report requirements (Compensatory habitat shall be monitored for a minimum of five years from completion of mitigation, or human intervention (including recontouring and grading), or until the success criteria identified in the approved mitigation plan have been met, whichever is longer.); o ecological performance standards, based on the best available science and including specifications for native plant densities, species composition, amount of dead woody vegetation gaps and bare ground, and survivorship; at a minimum, compensatory mitigation planting sites must achieve 80 percent survival of planted vegetation by the end of the five-year maintenance and monitoring period or dead and dying plants shall be replaced and monitoring continued  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  shall be updated and submitted monthly throughout the duration of the project, except that an inventory shall not be required for any 30-day period in which no construction activity occurs in the respective air district. At least 48 hours before the use of heavy duty off-road equipment, the applicant shall provide the respective air district with the anticipated construction timeline including start date, and name and phone number of the project manager and on-site foreman. The applicant shall use Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District’s Construction Mitigation Calculator (SMAQMD 2012), which is approved by PCAPCD and NSAQMD, to identify an equipment fleet that achieves this reduction. This measure does not apply to the use of a helicopter during construction activity because there are no state or federal emissions standards for helicopters and, therefore, no established set of state-wide emission rates. Also, the availability of a more emissions-efficient helicopter suitable for the project is unknown. Mitigation Measure 4.13-1b (Alts. 1-4): Pay Off-Site Mitigation Fee to PCAPCD to Off-Set NOX Emissions Generated by Construction Activity in Placer County.  The applicant shall pay an off-site mitigation fee into PCAPCD’s Clean Air Grants Program for the purpose of reducing NOX emitted by project construction activities in Placer County to a less-than-significant level (i.e., less than 82 lb/day). The applicant shall provide a detailed construction schedule to PCAPCD before each construction season (i.e., May through October) that identifies when construction activities at different portions of the project site in Placer County may occur. The applicant shall calculate the fees associated with each construction phase in consultation with PCAPCD staff and the applicant shall pay the specific fee amounts to PCAPCD before each construction phase. The calculation of daily NOX emissions shall be based on the cost rate established by PCAPCD’s Clean Air Grants Program at the time each calculation and payment is made. PCAPCD’s Clean Air Grants Program is part of ARB’s statewide Carl  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  removal permit. The plan shall comply with the minimum standards for tree removal, as described under TRPA Code 61.1.6 and with CAL FIRE timber harvesting plan standards, as applicable, under the Forest Practice Act. Before implementing any project activities that involve tree removal, the timber harvest plan shall be submitted to CAL FIRE for review and approval. Once approved, the plan shall be incorporated into the project design and all conditions of approval shall be implemented. CalPeco shall obtain a tree removal permit from TRPA for tree removal within the Lake Tahoe Basin.  For construction on non-Federal lands within Placer County, CalPeco will implement APM BIO-36 and APM BIO-37 to restore vegetation disturbed by the project and offset the loss of trees in the new 625 Line; however, this may not be sufficient to fully offset the loss of trees resulting from project implementation. If it is determined that the loss of trees protected under County ordinance cannot be fully offset through implementation of APM BIO-37, CalPeco shall either replace trees at an offsite location or contribute to the County’s Tree Preservation Fund; as determined in coordination with the County and in accordance with the Placer County Tree Ordinance (12.16.080 Replacement program and penalties). Before Improvement Plans are approved, the applicant shall provide proof to the County that one, or a combination, of the mitigation options described above has been completed and/or funded. Proof of mitigation fulfillment will also be provided to CDFW. CalPeco shall avoid loss of old growth forest to the extent feasible. If loss of late seral/old growth forest is unavoidable, CalPeco shall compensate for the loss of late seral/old growth forest through the development and implementation of a forest management plan, prepared by a RPF, to facilitate establishment of late seral/old growth forest stands and enhance existing late seral/old growth forest stands. The forest management plan shall include management actions, such as fuels and vegetation treatments, to facilitate and enhance old-growth development within the existing  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment Program. The program provides grant funding for cleaner-than-required engines and equipment. Grants are administered by PCAPCD to support reductions in emissions of key pollutants which are necessary to meet clean air commitments under regulatory requirements. Eligible projects include cleaner on-road, off-road, locomotive, lawn & garden, light duty passenger vehicles being scrapped and agricultural equipment (ARB 2012; PCAPCD 2012). At the time of writing this EIS/EIS/EIR the cost rate is $17,080 to reduce 1 ton of NOX (ARB 2011; Kuklo, pers. comm., 2013).   4.13-2. Contribution of ozone precursors to the Sacramento Federal Ozone Nonattainment Area. Construction-generated emissions of ozone precursors (i.e., reactive organic gases and NOX) in the Sacramento Federal Ozone Nonattainment Area would not exceed the de minimis levels. Therefore, the General Conformity would not apply to the proposed project.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.13-3. Exposure of sensitive receptors to toxic air contaminants (TACs). Some TAC-emitting construction activities would be located approximately 50 feet from existing sensitive receptors that are located adjacent to the power line ROW; however, exposure to sensitive receptors from construction-generated TACs would not be substantial because the duration of construction activity at any one location would be limited. Short-term construction and long-term operation of the proposed project would not result in the exposure of sensitive receptors to substantial TAC concentrations.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.13-4. Exposure of sensitive receptors to odors. The type of proposed land use is not commonly considered a source of odors. While construction of the proposed project could result in temporary emissions of odorous diesel exhaust, it is not anticipated that this release would be excessive, nor would it affect a substantial number of receptors.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  625 Line to be removed and/or other potential treatment areas.

The forest management plan shall be approved by TRPA before removal of any forest stands identified as late seral/old growth forest.  4.7-5. Introduction and spread of invasive weeds. Project construction could result in the introduction or spread of invasive plant species through seed mixes, equipment, and other materials. Areas disturbed during construction can provide ideal conditions for weed establishment.   PS (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.7-5 (Alts. 1-4): Utilize Local Native Seed and Notify Noxious Weed Coordinator. CalPeco shall utilize locally collected native seed sources for revegetation when possible. Plant and seed material shall be collected from or near the project area, from within the same watershed, and at a similar elevation when possible and with approval of the USFS botanist. Persistent nonnatives such as cultivated timothy (Phleum pretense), orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata), or ryegrass (Lolium spp.) shall not be used. After the project is completed, the USFS noxious weed coordinator shall be notified so that the project area can be monitored by the USFS if desired. Monitoring could be for up to three years (as funding allows) subsequent to project implementation to ensure additional nonnative invasive species do not become established in the areas affected by the project and to ensure that known nonnative invasive species do not spread.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.7-6. Disturbance or loss of special-status wildlife species and habitats. Implementation of the action alternatives could disturb the foraging and movement patterns of individuals, affect breeding activities and reproductive success, cause direct mortality, and disturb or remove suitable habitat for special-status wildlife species.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHG emissions associated with the proposed project would result in less-than-cumulatively considerable GHG emissions and would have a less-than-significant impact on climate change.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.13-6. Impacts of climate change on the project. Climate change is expected to result in a variety of effects in the project area, including changes to timing and intensity of precipitation resulting in increased risk of landslides associated with ground saturation and increased stormwater runoff. Climate change could also result in increased temperatures, leading to increased wildland fire in the project vicinity. However, there are numerous programs and policies in place to protect against and respond to wildland fire. Moreover, implementation of the proposed project would increase the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System’s resilience to disturbance.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.14 Noise        4.14-1. Short-term construction noise impacts. Existing noise-sensitive receptors are located in close proximity to proposed construction areas. However, most construction activities would be limited to the less noise-sensitive hours of the day, as permitted by each local jurisdiction. Helicopters would be used for certain construction activities and could exceed noise standards of applicable local jurisdictions if used during the more sensitive times of the day as defined by each jurisdiction. Further, construction activity would be required at night in order to install power lines across I-80, as well as for other activities such as delivery of substation transformers, filling of substation transformers, system transfers, and pouring of foundations. Helicopter use or construction during the more sensitive times of the day could result in temporary increases in construction noise at nearby sensitive receptors (e.g., residences approximately 250 feet to the south of I-80 in the Town of Truckee) and exceed local  S (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.14-1 (Alts. 1-4): Potential Construction Activities Outside Allowable Timeframes. For all construction activity that is to take place outside of allowable timeframes (typically nighttime construction) within 700 feet of any sensitive land use (e.g., houses, schools, churches, hospitals), the construction contractor shall ensure that noise levels at the nearest sensitive receptors do not exceed 45 dBA Leq in Placer County, 50 dBA Leq in the Town of Truckee, and applicable CNEL standards for TRPA PASs as shown in Table 4.14-3. To achieve compliance with these standards, the applicant shall: 〉 Install temporary noise curtains that meet the following parameters: o Install temporary noise curtains as close as possible to the boundary of the construction site within the direct line of sight path of the nearby sensitive receptor(s).  o Temporary noise curtains shall consist of durable, flexible  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  are not expected to substantially affect the distribution, breeding productivity, viability, or the regional population of any special-status species.  However, vegetation removal under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would result in permanent habitat loss within TRPA-designated disturbance zones around northern goshawk nests, which is prohibited by TRPA.   4.7-7. Effects on aquatic habitat. Construction activities such as vegetation clearing, pole installation, pole removal, creation of access ways, and staging near aquatic habitats could temporarily result in adverse impacts to aquatic habitat, including through removal of riparian vegetation; accidental spill and contamination from construction chemicals, fuels, or other hazardous materials; increased erosion, downstream sedimentation, and turbidity; small amounts of fill placed in aquatic habitats; and direct mortality or injury of fish and other aquatic species caused by equipment passing through aquatic habitats. The project’s design, construction methods, and incorporation of several APMs designed to protect aquatic resources would minimize, avoid, and partially compensate for these potential impacts to aquatic habitats. However, even with integration of the APMs into project design, project construction could result in loss or degradation of stream or riparian habitat protected under Section 1602 of the Fish and Game Code. Any unavoidable disturbance to the bed and bank of a waterway that provides habitat functions would require a Streambed Alteration Agreement from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  PS (Alts. 1-4)  Mitigation Measure 4.7-2a (Alts. 1-4): Compensate for Unavoidable Loss of Stream and Riparian Habitat. The following measures would be implemented to avoid or compensate for the loss or degradation of stream or riparian habitat, ensure consistency with Fish and Game Code Section 1602, and further reduce potential adverse effects on riparian habitats: 〉 CalPeco shall compensate for permanent riparian habitat impacts at a minimum of a 1:1 ratio through contributions to a CDFW approved wetland mitigation bank or through the development and implementation of a Compensatory Stream and Riparian Mitigation and Monitoring Plan aimed at creating or restoring in-kind habitat in the surrounding area. If mitigation credits are not available, stream and riparian habitat compensation shall include establishment of riparian vegetation on currently unvegetated bank portions of streams affected by the project and enhancement of existing riparian habitat through removal of nonnative species, where appropriate, and planting additional native riparian plants to increase cover, continuity, and width of the existing riparian corridor along streams in the project site and surrounding areas. Construction activities and compensatory mitigation shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of a streambed alteration agreement as required under Section 1602 of the Fish and Game Code. 〉 The Compensatory Stream and Riparian Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall include the following:  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  Resource Topics/Impacts  Level of Significance  before Mitigation (by Alternative)  Mitigation Measures  Level of Significance  after Mitigation (by Alternative)  nighttime noise standards.   composite material featuring a noise barrier layer bounded to sound-absorptive material on one side.

Existing noise-sensitive receptors are located in close proximity to proposed construction areas (e.g., residences in the Kings Beach area and Town of Truckee). Blasting could be required if a rock outcropping were encountered that could not be avoided. For safety reasons, blasting would only take place in remote locations away from residents and occupied buildings. With implementation of APMs NOI-4 and NOI-5, blasting would not result in structural damage to existing buildings or vibration impacts to sensitive receptors.   LTS (Alts. 1-4)  No mitigation is required for any of the alternatives.  LTS (Alts. 1-4)  4.14-3. Long-term increases in operational noise.

The document is an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S. Code 4321-4347), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations Implementing NEPA (40 Code of Federal Regulation [CFR] 1500-1508), Forest Service Manual 1950, and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15; an EIS for TRPA pursuant to the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact (Public Law 96-551), Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure; and an environmental impact report (EIR) for CPUC pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations Section 15000 et seq.). All three agencies have determined that an EIS/EIS/EIR is needed to effectively analyze the proposal and evaluate impacts. In addition, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as a federal cooperating agency, will be responsible for the scope and content of the NEPA portion of the environmental document as it pertains to lands within its jurisdictional boundaries in Martis Valley. CalPeco is the project applicant.  PROJECT REQUIRING ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS 1.1The proposed 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project would consist primarily of an upgrade of CalPeco’s existing 625 and 650 electrical power lines and associated substations from 60 kilovolt (kV) to 120 kV to allow the entire North Lake Tahoe Transmission System to operate at 120 kV. The project would consist of six primary components: 1) removal of the existing 625 Line and construction of a new, rerouted 625 Line; 2) rebuild of the existing 650 Line with potential for realignments based on the action alternatives considered; 3) realignment of two short segments of the 650 Line and removal of the replaced segments; 4) rebuild of the Northstar Tap into a fold (a “fold” allows for service to be maintained at a substation in the event of an interruption in service on either side of the power line feeding it); 5) rebuild of a 1.6-mile long section of the existing 132 Line in the Town of Truckee; and 6) upgrade, modification, and/or decommissioning of six substations. These improvements would increase the ability to maintain the current maximum system loads during an outage on any one of the four sections of the system (described in detail in Chapter 3), and decrease reliance on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. In addition, rebuilding and realigning the power lines would reduce the likelihood of outages associated with high winds, downed trees, snow loading, and forest fires, and would improve access to the lines for maintenance, emergency outage response, and repair activities. The project features and proposed activities are predominantly located on lands managed by the USFS; these lands are located in the LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest. Portions of the project are also located in the Town of Truckee and the unincorporated Placer County communities of Kings Beach and Tahoe City, on lands within the Martis Creek Lake Recreation Area, managed by the USACE, and on private lands. Through public scoping and agency coordination, four action alternatives were identified for detailed analysis in the EIS/EIS/EIR. Several additional alternatives were considered but determined to be infeasible and rejected from detailed consideration. The four action alternatives define different approaches to implementing the project in various segments along the 625 Line and 650 Line alignments. The analysis included in this EIS/EIS/EIR will be used by the USFS, TRPA, and CPUC to render a decision and select an alternative.   INTENDED USES OF THE EIS/EIS/EIR AND REGULATORY 1.2DECISION FRAMEWORK On May 18, 2011, the USFS LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest, TRPA, CPUC, and the USACE entered into a memorandum of understanding for the preparation of this EIS/EIS/EIR. TRPA, USFS, and CPUC will use the EIS/EIS/EIR to consider the environmental effects, mitigation measures, and action alternatives, when reviewing the project for approval. The EIS/EIS/EIR will serve as the USFS’s NEPA compliance document; TRPA’s compliance document with respect to its Compact, Code of Ordinances, and Rules of Procedure; and as CPUC’s CEQA compliance document. Federal cooperating agencies, including the USACE, and state responsible and trustee agencies (discussed below) may also use this EIS/EIS/EIR for subsequent discretionary actions. 1.2.1 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT NEPA provides an interdisciplinary framework for federal agencies to develop information that will help them to take environmental factors into account in their decision-making (42 USC 4321, 40 CFR 1500.1). NEPA requires preparation of an EIS whenever a proposed major federal action (e.g., a proposal for legislation or an activity financed, assisted, conducted, or approved by a federal agency) would significantly affect the human environment. The principle objectives of NEPA and the CEQ regulations is for the federal government, and those regulated by federal agencies, to design, locate, and operate projects in ways that reduce adverse environmental impacts for existing and succeeding generations. NEPA requires that a lead agency “include (in an EIS) appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives (40 CFR 1502.14[f]).” An EIS shall also include discussions of “means to mitigate adverse environmental impacts (if not fully covered under Section 1502.14[f]).” In preparing a record of decision under 40 CFR 1505.2, a lead agency is required to, “[s]tate whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted and summarized where applicable for any mitigation.” CalPeco is seeking to obtain a Special Use Authorization from the USFS for construction of the project on National Forest System land. The USFS is also the lead federal agency for compliance with NEPA and will be responsible for compliance with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.  1.2.2 TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING COMPACT, REGIONAL PLAN, AND CODE OF ORDINANCES TRPA is a bi-state regional planning agency created in 1969 by federal law, the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, to oversee development on both the California and Nevada sides of Lake Tahoe. Under the Compact, an EIS is an informational document used in the planning and decision-making process for a proposed project. The purpose of an EIS is not to recommend either approval or denial of the project, but to disclose objective information that can be used in rendering an informed decision. Article VII of the Compact presents important TRPA policies relevant to the preparation and use of an EIS. Key provisions of the article are presented below:  Article VII (a) (2) states that when acting upon matters that have a significant effect on the environment, TRPA shall “prepare and consider a detailed environmental impact statement before deciding to approve or carry out any project.”  Article VII (a) (3) states that the EIS shall “study, develop and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action for any project which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.”  Article VII (a) (5) requires TRPA to “initiate and utilize ecological information in the planning and development of resource-oriented projects.” TRPA is the lead agency under TRPA laws and regulations. Section 6.16 of the TRPA Rules of Procedure require that an EIS is certified to be in compliance, procedurally and substantively, with Article VII of the Compact, Chapter 3 of the Code, and the Rules of Procedure before a project may be approved.  1.2.3 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT In accordance with the State CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR Section 15064[f][1]), preparation of an EIR is required whenever a project may result in a potentially significant environmental impact. An EIR is an informational document used to inform public agency decision-makers and the general public of the significant environmental effects of a project, identify possible ways to minimize the significant effects, and describe reasonable alternatives to the project that could feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project while substantially lessening or avoiding any of the significant environmental impacts.  CEQA requires that state and local government agencies consider the environmental effects of projects over which they have discretionary authority before taking action on those projects (PRC Section 21000 et seq.). CEQA also requires that each public agency avoid or mitigate to less-than-significant levels, wherever feasible, the significant environmental effects of a project. If a project would result in significant and unavoidable environmental impacts that cannot be feasibly mitigated to less-than-significant levels, the project can still be approved, but the lead agency decision-makers must issue a “statement of overriding considerations” explaining in writing the specific economic, social, or other considerations that they believe make those significant effects acceptable.  The CPUC is the lead agency for compliance with CEQA for this project. CalPeco must comply with CPUC General Order 131-D, which contains the permitting requirements for the construction, replacement, and maintenance of facilities for the generation of electricity; transmission, power, and distribution line facilities; and substations. CalPeco is seeking to obtain a Permit to Construct (PTC) from the CPUC for this project.   SCOPE AND FOCUS OF THE EIS/EIS/EIR 1.3Pursuant to NEPA, TRPA regulations, and CEQA, the discussion of potential effects on the environment is focused on those impacts that are potentially significant. The LTBMU Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines, TRPA’s Initial Environmental Checklist, and the State CEQA Guidelines Appendix G Initial Study Checklist were used, in part, to determine the scope and focus of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  On March 26, 2012, the USFS, TRPA, and CPUC issued a Notice of Intent (NOI)/Notice of Preparation (NOP). The NOI was published in the Federal Register Volume 77 Issue 69, on April 10, 2012. The NOI/NOP was also sent to the California State Clearinghouse, Nevada State Clearinghouse, cooperating agencies, California responsible and trustee agencies, other interested public agencies, interested parties and organizations and affected property owners (within 300 feet of the project boundaries). The NOI/NOP was used to solicit views of interested persons, organizations, and agencies as they relate to the scope and content of the information to be included and analyzed in the EIS/EIS/EIR, and provide information on the dates and times of public scoping meeting. There is no defined circulation period under NEPA or TRPA regulations; however, CEQA requires a minimum scoping period of 30 days. Accordingly, a public scoping period was set for a 30-day period, between March 26, 2012 and April 25, 2012. Because the NOI was published in the Federal Register after release of the NOP/NOI, the comment period was extended to May 10, 2012.  Two public scoping meetings were conducted to provide interested parties with the opportunity to learn more about the project and to express their views on the content of the EIS/EIS/EIR. The scoping meetings were held on April 17, 2012 at the North Tahoe Event Center, 8313 North Lake Boulevard, Kings Beach, California; and, on April 19, 2012 at the Truckee Ranger District, 10811 Stockrest Springs Road, Truckee, California. The April 17, 2012 meeting was held before the TRPA Hearings Officer. Appendix A, Notice of Preparation and Scoping Summary Report, of this draft EIS/EIS/EIR contains the Scoping Summary Report with a table listing the substantive comments on the NOI/NOP as well as copies of the comment letters.  Based on a review of the project and the input received during the scoping process, this draft EIS/EIS/EIR includes an evaluation of the following environmental issue areas:  Land Use  Forestry Resources  Scenic Resources  Geology, Soils, and Land Capability and Coverage  Hydrology and Water Quality  Biological Resources  Recreation  Heritage and Cultural Resources  Hazards and Hazardous Materials  Public Services and Utilities  Traffic and Transportation  Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Climate Change  Noise  Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice  Growth Inducing Impacts In addition, in accordance with the Compact, TRPA has adopted environmental quality standards, or “environmental threshold carrying capacities,” which were initially adopted by the TRPA Governing Board in 1982 (TRPA Resolution 82-11). This draft EIS/EIS/EIR provides an evaluation of the project alternatives in the context of TRPA’s environmental threshold standards and the ability to achieve and maintain such standards to protect the unique values of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The nine resource areas for which threshold standards were adopted by TRPA are:  Water Quality  Air Quality  Scenic Resources  Soil Conservation  Fish Habitat  Vegetation  Wildlife Habitat  Noise   Recreation Because the action alternatives would not affect any lands used for agricultural production, zoned for agriculture, or considered important farmland, this issue is not discussed in detail in the EIS/EIS/EIR. Housing is not discussed in detail in this EIS/EIS/EIR as the proposed project does not include construction of housing as part of the project, would not displace existing housing, and would not generate demand for new housing (i.e., no increase in year-round employees that seek housing). Potential project effects on population and employment are addressed in Section 5.5, Growth-Inducing Impacts of the Proposed Project, and Section 5.6, Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice.  USE OF THIS DOCUMENT BY OTHER AGENCIES 1.4Other federal, state, regional, and local agencies are involved in the review and approval of the project, including cooperating federal agencies under NEPA and trustee and responsible agencies under CEQA. Under NEPA, a cooperating agency can be any other federal agency that has jurisdiction by law, or other federal agency that has special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved in an action (CFR Section 1501.6). Cooperating agencies are designated by agreement between the NEPA lead agency and the cooperating agency, and are encouraged to actively participate in the NEPA process of the lead agency, review and comment on the NEPA document, and use the document in project decision-making. The USACE will be a cooperating agency responsible for ensuring compliance with the scope and content of the NEPA portion of this joint EIS/EIS/EIR as it pertains to lands within the jurisdictional boundaries of the agency, specifically in Martis Valley. Under CEQA, a responsible agency is an agency other than the lead agency that has legal responsibility for carrying out or approving a project or elements of a project (PRC Section 21069). A trustee agency is a state agency that has jurisdiction by law over natural resources that are held in trust for the people of the State of California (PRC Section 21070). Responsible and trustee agencies are consulted by the CEQA lead agency to ensure the opportunity for input and also review and comment on the draft document. Responsible agencies also use the CEQA document in their decision-making. For the purposes of this EIS/EIS/EIR document, responsible agencies include the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, California Department of Transportation, California Department of State Parks, Placer County Air Pollution Control District, Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District, Placer County, and the Town of Truckee. CDFW would also be a trustee agency for the review of this document.  ORGANIZATION OF THIS EIS/EIS/EIR 1.5This draft EIS/EIS/EIR is organized into the following chapters so that readers can easily obtain information about the project and its specific environmental issues. The cover sheet identifies the lead agencies, contact information, contact persons, the title of the project and its location, a brief description of the project, a brief abstract, and comment submission information. The Executive Summary presents an overview of the project alternatives, a listing of significant environmental impacts, and a description of areas of controversy and issues to be resolved. Chapter 1, Introduction provides a brief project summary; describes the intended uses of the EIS/EIS/EIR and the regulatory framework; describes the focus and scope of the EIS/EIS/EIR; identifies lead, cooperating, responsible, and trustee agencies that may have discretionary authority or other jurisdiction related to the project; outlines the organization of the document; and provides information on public participation and terminology used in the EIS/EIS/EIR. Chapter 2, Purpose and Need describes the need for the project, project objectives and purpose, and background information relative to the purpose and need. Chapter 3, Project Alternatives provides a description of the existing North Lake Tahoe Transmission System and information on the need for improvement, describes the action alternatives and elements that are consistent across all action alternatives, and provides details for each action alternative.

This proposed decision would be circulated to the Commission where an alternative decision could be drafted. The Commission would vote on which decision to approve. If the CPUC were to approve a project with significant unavoidable environmental impacts, it must state why in a Statement of Overriding Considerations, which would be included in the CPUC’s decision on the application.   Terminology Used in the EIS/EIS/EIR 1.7The EIS/EIS/EIR uses the following terminology to denote the significance of potential environmental impacts of the project: No Impact: Actions that result in no changes to the physical or human environment. This impact level does not require mitigation. Direct and Indirect Effects: In accordance with NEPA, direct effects are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place, and indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but still reasonably foreseeable. Beneficial Effect: An effect that would result in an improvement or favorable change in the physical or human environment. This impact level does not require mitigation. Less-than-Significant Impact: An impact that would not result in a substantial adverse change in the physical or human environment. This impact level does not require mitigation. Significant Impact: A substantial adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected by the project. Feasible mitigation measures or alternatives must be considered in an attempt to reduce significant impacts.  Potentially Significant Impact: An impact that would be considered a significant impact as described above if it were to occur; however, the certainty of the impact cannot be immediately determined. For example, although the EIS/EIS/EIR may identify that buried archaeological resources could be found in a particular location, the actual discovery cannot be determined until the time of project construction. For purposes of this EIS/EIS/EIR, a potentially significant impact is treated the same as a significant impact (i.e., it requires consideration of feasible mitigation measures and alternatives). Cumulative Impact: An impact on the environment that results from the incremental effect of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Significance Criteria: A criterion established to define at what level an impact would be considered significant (i.e., if an impact exceeds a standard of significance, it would be considered significant). Significance criteria may consider scientific and factual data relative to the lead agency, expert opinion based on facts, and other factors. Applicant Proposed Measure: An element incorporated into a project by the applicant for the purpose of lessening or avoiding a potential environmental impact. Mitigation Measure: An action that could feasibly reduce a significant environmental effect. Mitigation measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally binding instruments.  In addition, because this environmental document serves three lead agencies, it is useful to identify other terms used herein that are defined by different agencies, and to clarify their meaning in the context of this EIS/EIS/EIR. Transmission Line: CPUC defines “transmission line” as an electrical line that transmits electricity at high voltages, 200 kV or greater. While TRPA regulations do not include a specific definition for transmission lines, its planning documents use the term “transmission facilities” “power transmission” to mean electrical conveyance at any voltage. For purposes of this document, the term “transmission line” is used in accordance with the CPUC definition. Power Line: CPUC defines “power line” as an electrical line that transmits electricity at lower voltages, between 50 kV and 200 kV. TRPA regulations and planning documents include no reference to “power lines.” For purposes of this document, the term “power line” is used to describe the existing and proposed upgraded lines. Road: The criterion for defining a road varies by the agency with jurisdiction. Each land manager or owner may have different requirements for design, construction, maintenance, and use. For the purposes of this document, the term “road”, “roadway” or “accessway” are used in a general context to identify the route within the project area that is required for construction and/or operation of the project. TRPA Road Definition: TRPA Code defines “road” as a smooth or paved surface designed for travel by motor vehicles. In general, the impacts are assessed based on the coverage of the road surface.  National Forest System Road: Roads on National Forest System lands described in this project are either temporary or permanent. Temporary Roads are built as proposed to facilitate the construction of the project. They are completely restored at the conclusion of construction and no longer used or open to vehicles. Permanent Roads are included as part of the National Forest Road System. They are classified in five levels from Maintenance Level 1 (basic custodial care, closed to vehicles) to Maintenance Level 5 (high comfort, passenger car). This project includes roads that are already included in the National Forest System (e.g., Fiberboard Freeway) and new roads. New roads may be both completely new construction or may utilize portions of old legacy roadways. For this project new roads, which include any road not previously part of the National Forest System, are assumed for analysis to be Maintenance Level 2, to facilitate the long term operational and maintenance needs of the project.  Access Way: The term “access way” is not specifically defined by any of the lead agencies, but is used herein to describe a route within the project area (that may or may not require widening or clearing), that is required for construction and/or operation of the project. For purposes of this document, access ways include several categories of routes, including existing dirt roads, National Forest System roads, existing roads that are not part of a formal designated travel system, new dirt roads constructed as part of the project, and existing and new “two-track” pathways intended for power line operations and maintenance access. Definitions for other industry terms used in this document are provided in Chapter 9, Acronyms and Glossary.    This page intentionally left blank.  2 PURPOSE AND NEED National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations 1502.13) require that an environmental impact statement contain a statement of the purpose and need that briefly specifies the underlying purpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives, including the proposed action. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, Section 15124(b), requires that the project description contain a clear statement of the project objectives, including the underlying purpose of the project. There are no requirements specifically addressing the description of a project’s purpose and need in the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Compact, Rules of Procedure, or Code of Ordinances.  This chapter describes the purpose and need and project objectives for the California Pacific Electric Company (CalPeco) 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project in terms of its ability to address system inadequacies, reliability requirements, and federal and state standards. 2.1 BACKGROUND 2.1.1 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS State and federal regulations govern the provision of safe and reliable electric service by public utilities. California Public Utilities Commission regulations for system reliability are contained in California Public Utilities Code Section 399, which implements the California Legislature’s Reliable Electric Service Investments Act (the Act). The Act states that each electrical corporation must operate its electric distribution grid in its service in a safe, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective manner [399.2(a)(1)] and that prudent investments continue to be made to protect the integrity of the electric distribution grid [399(c)(1)].  Federal requirements include the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standard TPL-002-0b. This NERC standard requires transmission systems have the capability to supply peak loads at adequate voltage levels without overloading the system components with any one component out of service. This is known as “single contingency reliability” or “N-1 contingency.” The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System does not currently meet this federal standard. 2.1.2 EXISTING ELECTRIC SERVICE SYSTEM On January 1, 2011, CalPeco purchased the Sierra Pacific Power Company’s (Sierra Pacific’s) California electric service territory. The physical boundaries of the service territory include the California portion of the Lake Tahoe Basin and extend north to Portola and Loyalton and south to Walker in Mono County. The service territory includes the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System, which is a loop that runs from the substations of Truckee to Squaw Valley to Tahoe City to Kings Beach and then back to Truckee. The following lines comprise this loop:  one 60 kilovolt (kV) power line(the 609 Line) and one 120 kV power line (the 132 Line) from Truckee to Squaw Valley;  one 60 kV power line from Tahoe City to Squaw Valley (the 629 Line);  one 60 kV power line from Kings Beach to Tahoe City, (the 625 Line); and  one 60 kV power line from Truckee to Kings Beach, (the 650 Line). The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is described in detail in Section 3.2, Existing Transmission System.  In addition to these transmission facilities, the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station provides up to 12 mega volt-amperes (MVA) of additional system capacity during power outages and peak demand periods. (MVA is a measure of electrical power capacity that considers voltage and amperes, similar to a watt). However, the air quality permit for the diesel generation station limits operation to a total of 721 hours per year (taking into account all six generators), providing an operational limit on the degree to which the system can rely on diesel generation of power.  2.1.3 SYSTEM CAPACITY DEMANDS The CalPeco customers served by the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System reside in unincorporated communities along the north shore of Lake Tahoe (i.e., from Tahoe City to Kings Beach), the Northstar community located north of the Lake Tahoe Basin along State Route 267, and the Squaw Valley community located north of the Lake Tahoe Basin along State Route 89. A portion of the system (i.e., the NV Energy-owned section of the 132 Line between North Truckee Substation and Martis Valley Substation) also serves Truckee Donner Public Utility District customers in the Town of Truckee area (i.e., at the Truckee Donner Public Utility District-owned Martis Valley Substation). A resident population of approximately 28,000 is served by the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System (US Census Bureau 2010), but the number of connections and potential demand is actually much higher because the resident population does not reflect that many of the electric customers are second home owners. Approximately half of the electricity load that CalPeco delivers to residential customers is to second homes or rentals (Sierra Pacific 2010: p. 2-3). Tourist and recreation-related facilities are also significant sources of electrical demand in the system area, including ski resorts, hotels, and condominiums.  Seasonal, economic, and demographic characteristics of the region lend themselves to wide swings in electrical demand. Demand in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is greatest during the winter months, and typically peaks in late December and January as a result of electric heating of homes, businesses, and tourist accommodations, and ski resort loads, including ski lifts and snow-making. The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is designed to supply a maximum of 88 MVA under ideal conditions with no lines out of service. In the event of a line loss, the system is only capable of supplying approximately 80 percent of maximum capacity with the Kings Beach diesel generators running at full capacity. Because of stresses on system facilities, peak electrical demand should not exceed the maximum capacity of the system. However, this condition recently occurred during peak periods resulting in line stress, potential damage to system facilities, risk of extended outages, and the potential need for load shedding (i.e., rolling blackouts). Specifically, a conductor (power line) has a thermal rating that reflects the maximum amount of power that it can safely transmit. When a conductor is forced to transmit in excess of its design capacity thermal rating, the conductor becomes overheated and damaged, leading to risk of electrical fires. At a minimum, such lines experience severe wear, which requires more frequent replacement.  Recently, favorable winter conditions and high levels of tourist activity in the months of December 2012 and January 2013 generated very high electrical demand. On December 30, 2012, in particular, peak demand was extremely high (which is not uncommon in favorable winter conditions) and the system was stressed beyond its design capacity. Accordingly, the power flowing through the lines put the lines in danger of exceeding their thermal rating. Diesel generators were required to provide supplemental power until passage of the peak. In the event of a line loss during this peak period, there would have likely been an extended outage. 2.1.4 SYSTEM RELIABILITY The current North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is exposed to potential outages, most commonly caused by high winds that blow down power line poles, trees that fall onto the power lines, and snow load that causes line failure. While electrical outages can be commonplace in areas with such hazards as extreme weather and dense forest (in which falling trees can damage lines), a highly reliable electrical system is one that has the ability to respond quickly to such hazards; that is, that adequate power is available and can be redirected from other portions of the system if any one segment is interrupted, and that lines are accessible for repair within a reasonable timeframe.  The reliability of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is not adequate and is in need of upgrade. Electricity within the system is provided to end users along a loop of power lines, most of which are 60 kV and, as described above, have recently operated at maximum capacity or excess of maximum capacity during peak periods. Because the lines run so close to capacity during such a period, the ability of the system to reliably redirect power if any one segment is interrupted (single contingency reliability) is limited. This is unacceptable from the standpoint of utility operations, and inadequate to meet federal and state requirements.  Under peak demand conditions, the system cannot currently withstand the loss of a single line segment without overloading other portions of the system, even with the Kings Beach diesel generators operating at full capacity. With the 625 Line rated at 60 kV, the system is unable to maintain the necessary capacity to power Kings Beach under peak demand conditions if the 650 Line is damaged. Likewise, the system is unable to maintain necessary capacity to Tahoe City under peak demand conditions if the 629 Line or 132 Line is damaged. In such circumstances, line losses associated with transmitting electricity around the remaining two legs in the circuit—the 609 and 625 Lines—result in significant voltage drops that can lead to brownouts or blackouts, and overloading that subjects the facilities to potential damage. Increasing the voltage of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System to 120 kV would provide sufficient reliability and capacity in each critical line of the system to carry maximum system loads during single-contingency outages, so that if one line in the system were not functioning, power could be re-routed and delivered to customers using the other lines in the system. It would also preserve the limited allowable use of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station for potential multiple contingency failures (i.e., two or more parts of the system out of service simultaneously). Additional information on system reliability, operation, and capacity is presented in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives (Section 3.2.4).  As noted above, another aspect of system reliability is ready access to the lines to effect repairs in the event of an outage. Currently, the 625 Line experiences the most outages in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System, with the primary causes being snow loading and downed trees. With respect to access, the 625 Line represents a severe challenge due to its remote location and lack of adequate roadways. Inspections and maintenance are often deferred to the winter months because trucks cannot reach much of the alignment and over-snow vehicles must be used for access. The lack of vehicle access also slows repair response time, resulting in longer outages than if the line were more accessible.  With any one component out of service, the system does not currently have the capability to supply peak loads at adequate voltage levels without overloading the system components. As described above, such an overloaded situation has the potential to result in severe damage to system facilities, even with the Kings Beach diesel generators operating at full capacity. This condition does not meet federal and state reliability requirements.  2.1.5 PROJECT PLANNING HISTORY The need for the project has long been known. Sierra Pacific (prior owner of the electrical lines) had been studying and planning the 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project for several years when the system was purchased by CalPeco. The original planning assumptions, project scope, and schedule established by Sierra Pacific were based on a 1996 study of the system needs. Before proceeding with the application, CalPeco believed it necessary to update the assumptions and recommendations of the 1996 study. One of the key factors that supported the need for updated data was the assumed load growth. The annual load growth projected in the Sierra Pacific study was 3 percent, which included 1 percent for normal population and technology growth factors (i.e., increased electrical usage from high-end televisions, computers, and other devices) and an additional 2 percent for large, sporadic load increases caused by additions or expansions at ski resorts, commercial facilities, or other developments. As Sierra Pacific monitored growth, it adjusted the planned implementation of the 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project on an annual basis in response to the fact that actual growth rates were less than the original 3 percent projection.  Although the level of load growth in the North Lake Tahoe area remains uncertain, CalPeco revised the Sierra Pacific estimate of 3 percent load growth downward to 1 percent to account for the recent economic downturn and the limited growth potential in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System service area. The Lake Tahoe Basin portion of the service area is nearing a buildout condition; approximately 90 percent of privately-owned parcels in the Region have been developed (TRPA 2012). The amount of growth attributable to new development under the recently adopted Regional Plan Update would be limited by the small number of residential development rights and allocations available in the Region, and other growth management regulations that are in effect. For the portions of the project area outside the Lake Tahoe Basin, growth is planned and regulated by the general plans and zoning codes of Placer County, Nevada County, and the Town of Truckee (see also Chapter 5, Other NEPA, TRPA, and CEQA Mandated Sections).  2.2 PURPOSE AND NEED AND PROJECT OBJECTIVES The proposed project would result in an essential increase in reliability of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System through improved capacity, line accessibility, ability to re-route and redirect power so as to continue electrical service during a single-contingency outage, and minimizing the use of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. Planned conversion of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System from its current 60 kV loop with 88 MVA of capacity to a 120 kV loop with 114 MVA of capacity (without use of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station) is needed to provide single-contingency reliability in accordance with federal and state requirements.  2.2.1 PURPOSE AND NEED The project is needed to provide reliable power to the North Lake Tahoe area, to meet federal and state requirements of electrical utilities, and ultimately, to support public health and safety. The project would provide the necessary power to support residential and commercial operations in the service area, reduce potential for extended outages, and reduce fire risk. The current North Lake Tahoe Electric Transmission System has a normal capacity of 88 MVA. The Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station is capable of providing 12 MVA of additional (or back-up) capacity to the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System during outages or high demand and is currently the only source of supplemental power to maintain the current maximum system loads in the event of an outage on any one of the four legs of the system (single-contingency reliability).  The current system, even with the Kings Beach Diesel generators operating at full capacity, is unable to function with an N-1 contingency as is required by the federal agencies that regulate power supply and the associated facilities. This means that during the coincident peak load, even with the diesel generators in operation, if one of the critical line segments is lost, CalPeco would need to implement a load shedding plan. Load shedding is a process that is used to reduce load in the event of an emergency by requiring customer load to be dropped. This is typically handled through an established plan that rolls the blackout to balance the load reduction. Once the peak demand has passed, the system is then restored to normal operation. Use of rolling blackouts as a method of routine operation is unacceptable; for purposes of public health and safety, load shedding must only be used in the event of an emergency. The reason for this is that such an approach does not meet acceptable health and safety response to services such as street lights and traffic control, hospital and medical care, home health care for individuals on medical machines or equipment, fire threat due to line overloading and other critical services for which consistent, reliable power is essential. The proposed project would meet NERC regulations to provide N-1 contingency and address the existing system limitations. Load shedding, or outages that result from downed lines wherein the utility is unable to reroute the power, affects a large sphere. These impacts such as loss of power to medical facilities, or home health care, or street and highway traffic control can result in severe impacts to the health and safety of individuals and businesses. The Tahoe system has historically experienced outages from the current system limitations.  The need for the proposed 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project has been confirmed both from a transmission planning perspective and from known operational shortcomings. Federal and state electric reliability standards require CalPeco to ensure that the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System performs safely under normal and contingency conditions. The current system does not perform adequately under contingency conditions, and without the proposed upgrades, will continue to fall short of federal reliability requirements.  Although the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System does not incur peak load levels at all times, of course, it must be capable of meeting the maximum demand when it does occur. The system cannot currently provide single-contingency reliability during peak loads, even with use of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station, and is experiencing peak demands in excess of design capacity. The proposed project would ensure that the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System complies with federal and state electric reliability regulations and safety standards. Addressing normal and projected loads, providing single-contingency reliability, and reducing dependence on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station would be achieved by upgrading the 625 and 650 Lines and associated facilities (e.g., substations) from 60 kV to 120 kV. Reducing the risk of wildfire hazard would be achieved by replacing existing wooden poles with the proposed steel poles, which are stronger and more resistant to wildfire (see Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, for more details on the proposed project elements). In addition, raising the elevation of the lines and widening the vegetation management corridor, both regulatory requirements when converting from the current 60 kV configuration to 120 kV, would reduce wildfire risk and risk of damage from encroaching vegetation. Increased access to the 625 Line for inspection, maintenance, and repairs would be achieved by re-routing the line to a less remote location with existing access roads, and creating new overland travel ways where needed. Improving truck access to the 625 Line for inspections and maintenance would also increase the lines’ resilience to outages.  2.2.2 PROJECT OBJECTIVES The CEQA objectives for the 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project mirror those described above for the NEPA purpose and need, and those identified by Sierra Pacific in its 2010 California Public Utilities Commission application. In summary, the objectives of the project are to: 1. Provide normal capacity for current and projected loads. 2. Provide reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages. 3. Reduce dependence on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. 4. Reduce the risk of fire hazards and outage durations associated with wooden poles and encroaching vegetation. 5. Provide more reliable access to the 625 Line for operation and maintenance activities.     This page intentionally left blank.   3 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES This chapter describes a reasonable range of project alternatives consistent with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) ordinances and procedures, and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The action alternatives carried forward for detailed evaluation and consideration in this joint Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIS/EIR) have each been formulated to accomplish most of the basic objectives of the project discussed in Chapter 2, Purpose and Need.  REQUIREMENTS FOR ALTERNATIVES 3.1Consideration of alternatives that would achieve the basic objectives of a project is required under NEPA, TRPA, and CEQA regulations. To aid informed decision-making and public participation, four action alternatives were developed that comply with the specific requirements of these regulations and meet the underlying purpose and objectives of the project (described in Section 2.2, Purpose and Need and Project Objectives). This Draft EIS/EIS/EIR also describes and evaluates the No Project/No Action alternative (Alternative 5) to provide the decision-makers and the public with an overview of what could reasonably be expected to occur if none of the action alternatives were approved and implemented. This chapter also describes various alternatives that were considered but eliminated from detailed evaluation because they are either infeasible, do not meet most of the basic project objectives, or do not avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the potentially significant effects of other alternatives (see Section 3.5, Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Evaluation, below). 3.1.1 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT REQUIREMENTS The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing NEPA Section 1502.14 require that an EIS:  explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives,  discuss reasons for eliminating considered alternatives,  consider each alternative in a level of detail that allows for comparative evaluation,  include reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency,  analyze the no action alternative,  identify the lead agency’s preferred alternative, and  include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.  3.1.2 TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY Environmental Impact Statements are addressed in Article VII of the TRPA Compact, which requires that TRPA prepare and consider a detailed EIS before deciding to approve or carry out a project. The EIS must study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to the recommended courses of action for any project that involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative use of available resources.  3.1.3 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT In accordance with Section 15126.6 of the State CEQA Guidelines, the alternatives analysis must:   describe a range of reasonable alternatives for the project that could feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project, but would substantially lessen or avoid any of the significant effects of the project;   focus on alternatives capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any of the significant environmental impacts of the project, even if they may be more costly or could otherwise impede some of the project’s objectives; and   evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.  In addition to the guiding principles for selection of alternatives set forth above, the State CEQA Guidelines require that the environmental document evaluate a no project alternative (that is, the consequences of taking no action); identify alternatives that were initially considered but then eliminated from detailed evaluation and provide the reasoning for their dismissal; and identify the “environmentally superior alternative.” In addition, CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(f)(2)(A) requires that the analysis of alternatives identify whether any of the potentially significant effects of the project would be avoided or substantially lessened by placing the project in another feasible location. Accordingly, this document includes a discussion of potential off-site alternatives that were considered but rejected for detailed evaluation and the reasons for their rejection (see Section 3.5, Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Evaluation, below).  This document provides comparable detail in the analysis of the alternatives. A full range of reasonable alternatives (including the applicant’s preferred alternative, identified as the Proposed Alternative) is presented for public review. The alternatives described and evaluated in detail in this document include variations on alignments and single circuit versus double-circuit configurations (a double circuit would put portions of the 625 and 650 Lines on the same poles) to provide flexibility to the US Forest Service (USFS), TRPA, and the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in selecting the alternative that best meets the basic project objectives while taking into account the significant or potentially significant impacts on the human and physical environments. The Proposed Alternative was identified only after public scoping comments were received, environmental studies were completed, and input from the lead and cooperating agencies was considered.   EXISTING ELECTRICAL SYSTEM 3.23.2.1 LOCATION The existing North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is located in northeastern Placer County and southeastern Nevada County, California (see Exhibit 3-1). The project components are predominantly located on lands managed by the US Department of Agriculture, USFS; these lands are located in the Tahoe National Forest and in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU). The project area also includes the Town of Truckee and the unincorporated communities of Kings Beach and Tahoe City, as well as the Martis Creek Lake Recreation area managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and Burton Creek State Park. The project area is predominantly forested, with segments of residential, industrial, and tourism-related land uses where the project components enter more developed communities. 3.2.2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW The electrical lines and associated infrastructure are owned by the California Pacific Electric Company (CalPeco), the applicant. The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System (so named by CalPeco although the loop includes components both within and outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin) is a loop comprised of 60 kilovolt (kV) and 120 kV electrical lines connecting Truckee, Squaw Valley, Tahoe City, and Kings Beach. As depicted in Exhibit 3-2, the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System currently consists of:  one 60 kV power line (609 Line) and one 120-kV power line (132 Line) from Truckee to Squaw Valley,  one 120 kV power line (currently operating at 60-kV) from Squaw Valley to Tahoe City (629 Line),  one 60 kV power line from Tahoe City to Kings Beach (625 Line), and  one power line from Kings Beach to Truckee (650 Line) that is 60 kV except for a segment (650-5) near the Placer/Nevada county line that was previously upgraded to 120 kV, but is currently operating at 60 kV.   Source: Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-1 Regional Location   Typically, a 30-foot wide access/operations/maintenance right-of-way (ROW) easement is held for the existing lines and associated facilities, although the width of the easement may vary based on the needs for system operations and maintenance, the line voltage, negotiations with landowners, and other factors. The 60 kV loop serves four substations, and the single 120 kV circuit serves two substations. The 60 kV loop is fed from the Truckee Substation and the 120 kV circuit is fed from North Truckee Substation. See Exhibit 3-3, which depicts the current configuration of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System.  3.2.3 SYSTEM ELEMENTS PROPOSED FOR MODIFICATION The following is a detailed description of the components of the existing electrical system that are being considered for upgrade or modification as part of the 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project. Exhibit 3-2 includes numbered segments to orient the reader to the respective sections of existing power line described, by segment, in the sections below. 625 LINE The existing 60 kV 625 Line generally runs in a northeast-southwest direction between the communities of Kings Beach and Tahoe City. The alignment is set back from (typically by a mile or more), but roughly parallel to, Lake Tahoe’s northwest shoreline. Most of the 625 Line is located on land managed by the LTBMU and is within TRPA’s planning area.  SEGMENT 625-1 Segment 625-1 ties into the Tahoe City Substation south of the Truckee River and west of State Route (SR) 89. It is a double-circuit line that also includes the 60 kV 629 Line. The lines share tangent poles (poles used for straight lines), but are split onto separate poles at angle points (where the power line conductor [i.e., cable] changes direction in less than a 30 degree angle) so that guy wires can be used to anchor the poles. The line parallels the southern bank of the Truckee River for over 1,000 feet. Existing power poles are located in the riparian area north of the Tahoe Rim Tail and adjacent to the river. The power line crosses the Truckee River and SR 89 north of the California Department of Transportation’s (Caltrans’) Tahoe City Maintenance Station and approximately 0.25 mile west of the intersection of SR 89 and SR 28. At the crossing, there is a wooden power pole adjacent to the southbound lane of SR 89. The line continues northwest for approximately 1,000 feet on the north side on SR 89 before splitting into the 629 Line and Segment 625-2 of the 625 Line. The existing 625 Line contains distribution underbuild (smaller electrical distribution lines on the same pole, below the larger electrical line) near the Tahoe City Substation (the locations and fate of underbuild is described in more detail later in this chapter). SEGMENT 625-2 The 625 Line trends north for approximately 1.25 miles through LTBMU land. The line then turns west for approximately 0.5 mile and follows the southern border of Burton Creek State Park. A portion of the line ROW encroaches into Burton Creek State Park and there are several poles just within the park boundaries.  SEGMENTS 625-3, 625-4, 625-5, 625-6, 625-7, AND 625-8 These segments generally follow, but are typically set back from, the Fiberboard Freeway through land managed by the LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest for approximately 9.5 miles to SR 267 at Brockway Summit. These segments span a relatively remote area between the shoreline of Lake Tahoe and the Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort, and, as such, access to these electrical structures is limited.   Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-2 Existing Electrical System  Source: Received from Sierra Pacific 2010; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-3 Existing Electrical System Schematic SEGMENT 625-9 East of SR 267, Segment 625-9 roughly follows the southeast trajectory of SR 267 through USFS land for approximately 2.25 miles, offset to the northeast of the highway by over 0.5 mile. SEGMENT 625-10 Segment 625-10 extends over 1 mile south to the Kings Beach Substation, which is located within the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station that is situated north of the intersection of Deer Street and Speckled Street in Kings Beach.  650 LINE The 650 Line spans approximately 14 miles between the Truckee Substation, and the Brockway Substation in Kings Beach. This power line is primarily 60 kV, but facilities have been upgraded to accommodate 120 kV near the Tahoe Truckee Airport and the Placer/Nevada county line.  SEGMENT 650-1 From the Brockway Substation, Segment 650-1 parallels the southern side of Speckled Street for approximately 150 feet to the west side of Deer Street. It parallels the western side of Deer Street for over 200 feet, and continues approximately 650 feet north to the Kings Beach Substation. From the Kings Beach Substation, the alignment is the same as Segment 625-10 for over 0.5 mile, with poles for the 650 Line side-by-side with poles for the 625 Line, to north of Canterbury Drive. At this point, Segment 650-1 heads west for over 0.5 mile to the eastern side of SR 267. SEGMENTS 650-2 AND 650-3  Segments 650-2 and 650-3 are 60 kV power line segments that parallel SR 267 for approximately 6 miles. The divide between the segments is located where the 625 Line crosses Brockway Summit (SR 267). The alignment is adjacent to the eastern side of the highway, except for a stretch of less than 0.5 mile south of Highlands View Road where the alignment switches to the western side of the highway.  Northstar Tap Within Segment 650-3, the 0.5 mile long Northstar Tap runs east-west between the Northstar Substation , located at the intersection of Stable Road and Highlands Valley Road, and the 650 Line east of SR 267.  SEGMENT 650-4 Segment 650-4 spans Martis Valley south of SR 267 through an approximately 40-acre National Forest System (NFS) parcel managed by the Tahoe National Forest, and the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area managed by the USACE. SEGMENT 650-5 Segment 650-5 is approximately 3 miles in length. In the 1990s, this segment was upgraded to 120 kV capacity and portions of the segment were converted from an overhead to an underground configuration. The undergrounding was financed by property owners in the vicinity. SEGMENT 650-6 In Segment 650-6, the 60 kV electrical line is on a double circuit with the 120 kV 132 Line (i.e., the lines currently share poles). The line heads north, crossing Brockway Road, Estates Drive, the Truckee River, and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks to the north side of Glenshire Drive. The alignment parallels the north side of Glenshire Drive for approximately 0.5 mile to the intersection of Donner Pass Road.  Between the Truckee Donner Public Utility District’s Martis Substation (located between the Truckee River and Estates Drive) and the North Truckee Substation, the 132 Line is owned by NV Energy.  SEGMENT 650-7 Segment 650-7 spans between the North Truckee Substation and the Truckee Substation. From the North Truckee Substation, the power line crosses Comstock Driver and parallels the northern side of Comstock Drive for less than 1,000 feet to the east before turning south to the north side of Donner Pass Road, crossing Interstate 80 (I-80) and East Main Street. This portion of Segment 650-7 is underbuilt with the 60 kV 132 Line. Segment 650-7 then parallels the north side of Donner Pass Road for less than 600 feet before turning south, crossing over Trout Creek Road, Donner Pass Road, and East Keiser Avenue to reach the Truckee Substation. This portion of the segment is configured with a distribution line underbuild.  SUBSTATIONS  Substations are high-voltage electric facilities that contain equipment used to regulate and distribute electrical energy. These facilities receive power from power lines and can perform various functions including regulation and distribution of energy, stepping voltage up and down, limiting power surges, and converting power from direct current to alternating current or vice versa. These facilities are also used to switch high-voltage power into different routes (cables and lines) or, as loading changes, into different transformers. The following facilities are part of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System. BROCKWAY SUBSTATION The Brockway Substation is located in Kings Beach, at the southeast corner of the intersection of Speckled Street and Deer Street. This substation is one terminus of the 650 Line.  KINGS BEACH SUBSTATION AND DIESEL GENERATION SITE The Kings Beach Substation is located within the Kings Beach Public Utility Center, which includes the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station and is just north of the intersection of Speckled Street and Deer Street in Kings Beach. Currently, the existing 650 Line intercepts the Kings Beach facility before terminating at the Brockway Substation. The Kings Beach facility is one terminus of the 625 Line.  NORTHSTAR SUBSTATION The Northstar Substation is located near the intersection of Stables Road and Northstar Drive in Placer County. This substation is the termination point for the Northstar Tap. The existing substation operates at 60 kV (though currently constructed at 120 kV) and serves the electrical demands from the Northstar area.  SQUAW VALLEY SUBSTATION The Squaw Valley Substation is located at the intersection of Squaw Valley Road and SR 89 in Placer County. The 132, 609, and 629 Lines connect to the Squaw Valley Substation.  TAHOE CITY SUBSTATION The Tahoe City Substation is located west of SR 89 and south of the Truckee River. This substation is the termination point for the existing 625 Line and 629 Line. TRUCKEE SUBSTATION  The Truckee Substation is one terminus of the 650 Line and is located near the intersection of Donner Pass Road and East Church Street in Truckee. The 60 kV 607, 608, 609, 619, and 621 Lines also connect to this substation.  NORTH TRUCKEE SUBSTATION The North Truckee facility is located on Pioneer Trail Road just south of Comstock Drive. NV Energy owns the North Truckee Substation. The 120 kV 133, 132, and 101 Lines connect to this substation. 3.2.4 SYSTEM RELIABILITY, OPERATION, AND CAPACITY System capacity can be quantified in terms of megavolt amperes (MVA), which is a measure of electrical power that considers voltage and amperes, similar to a watt. The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System has a normal capacity of 88 MVA. The Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station is capable of providing 11 MVA of additional (or back-up) capacity. Electrical demand on the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is the greatest during the winter months, and typically peaks during the week between the Christmas and New Year holidays as a result of electric heating and ski resort loads. Coincident peak demand is the electrical demand at the time when system-wide customer use is expected to be highest. Coincident peak loading of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System has remained relatively stable over the last six years, between 79 and 88 MVA (see Table 3-1). Table 3-1 North Lake Tahoe Transmission System Coincident Peak Demand 2007 – 2012  Year  Coincident Peak  2007  86.7 MVA  2008  82.9 MVA  2009  78.6 MVA  2010  86.0 MVA  2011  85.9 MVA  2012  88.4 MVA  MVA= megavolt-amperes. Source: Schlichting 2013  Electrical systems have reduced operating capacity when an element of the system fails (often due to external circumstances, such as weather). These events are referred to as contingencies. Failure of either a single element, or multiple elements that are physically or electronically linked and fail together as one, is referred to as a single contingency outage. System reliability is influenced by the likelihood and consequences of a contingency. In general, five principle mechanisms could be responsible for outages associated with the power lines in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System:   high winds blowing poles over,  trees falling onto the lines,  snow loading,  forest fires, and   equipment failures. Customer demand in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is essentially at the system’s capacity, and there are circumstances where the system load has exceeded its current capacity. For example, on December 30, 2012 the North Tahoe area experienced extremely heavy tourism and ski resort activity. The result was an extremely large electric demand peak. The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System was forced to run at an overloaded capacity. Where the system is designed to supply a maximum of 88 MVA of electricity to the north Lake Tahoe area, on December 30, 2012 there was a system peak of 88.4 MVA. During this event, the Kings Beach diesel generators were run to provide sufficient power and the system operators were monitoring the line temperature and other elements of the system. This exceedence of design capacity resulted in a risk of damage to the line conductors. In addition, had one of the lines or other parts of the system gone out of service, there would have been blackouts over a significant area.  During outages or high demand, the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station is currently the only source of the system’s ability to maintain the current maximum system loads. However, even with the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station in operation, the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is not able to remain fully functional with a single contingency outage. Under the existing conditions, damage to some portion of the system could result in substantial voltage drops to other parts of the circuit. Potential scenarios affecting voltage in the system include: damage to the 650 Line, resulting in insufficient capacity to power Kings Beach; damage to the 629 Line or 132 Line, affecting capacity to Tahoe City; and, reduction in the overall system capacity from 88 MVA to 61 MVA, as a result of an outage of the 132 Line (99 MVA to 70 MVA if using backup supplies from the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station). If a single contingency outage occurs during the coincident peak load, customer demand must be forcibly reduced through a process known as load shedding. This is typically handled through an established plan of rolling blackouts that balances the load reduction. Once the peak demand has passed, the system is restored to normal operation. It is important to note that, from a regulatory standpoint, utilities are only able to do this in an emergency situation and are not permitted to use rolling blackout as a planning tool or regular mode of operation because they are obligated to provide reliable service under the Public Utilities Code. Due to the large area that can be affected during load shedding, it is not possible to avoid blackouts at critical facilities, including those for police/sheriff, fire, medical, and home care facilities. In addition, operation of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station is limited by its Placer County Air Pollution Control District permit to 721 hours per year. As a result, the facility’s operating hours are generally reserved for multiple-contingency events (outages on multiple elements of the system).  It should be noted that the operation of the diesel generation facility at Kings Beach is necessary as emergency back-up and as offset when loads approach peak, and is not designed or intended to support normal base load. While the proposed project would help reduce the emergency dependency on the diesel generators, it would not provide back-up power such that the diesel generators could be removed. Alternatively, it is also important to understand that running the diesel generators at full operation would not replace the need for the proposed system upgrades. It would be inefficient and contrary to the system design for CalPeco to operate the diesel generators for any other reasons than anticipated or current emergencies. These units are expensive to operate, have greater air emissions than other power sources, and have limited annual hours of operation permitted by regulatory agencies. In the planning of this project, the diesel units are not considered as a single contingency facility. Instead, they are in place for emergency situations, which can regularly occur in the Tahoe area due to storms and other events. Using the diesel generation facility in this manner is consistent with the regulations of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, and is an approved and warranted component of the system as emergency back-up.   ACTION ALTERNATIVES 3.3As described in Chapter 2, Purpose and Need, the applicant has determined that improved system reliability and resilience to outages would be achieved through upgrade of the existing 625 and 650 Lines and associated substations from 60 kV to 120 kV, which would permit the entire system to operate at 120 kV. The four action alternatives considered in this EIS/EIS/EIR are variations on addressing six key project components:  rebuild of the existing 650 line (with potential for realignments based on alternative);  removal and realignment of two short segments of the 650 Line to straighten the line and remove angle points (simplifying line construction and maintenance);   rebuild a 1.6-mile section of the existing 132 Line;  rebuild of the Northstar Tap into the Northstar Fold (a “fold” allows for service to be maintained at a substation in the event of an interruption in service on the power lines feeding into either side of substation; for this project, this means that the Northstar Substation could be fed from the 650 Line to the north or south, whereas currently it is a single source feed);   upgrade, modification, and/or decommission of six substations; and  removal of the existing 625 Line and construction of a new, rerouted 625 Line.  These improvements would increase the ability to maintain the current maximum system loads during an outage on any one of the four legs of the system (i.e., 625 Line, 650 Line, 609 Line, and 629 Line), and decrease reliance on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. In addition, rebuilding and realigning the power lines would reduce the likelihood of outages associated with high winds, felled trees, snow loading, and forest fires, as well as improve access to the lines for maintenance and repair activities. Section 3.3.1, below, describes the features common to all action alternatives. This includes the primary project components (including power lines and substations), new conductors and power poles, ROW requirements, and general construction activities. Sections 3.3.2 through 3.3.5 describe the identified action alternatives. Section 3.3.6 describes the common project implementation processes of the action alternatives (e.g., phasing and schedule). Overviews of Alternatives 1 through 4 are depicted in Exhibits 3-4a through 3-4d, respectively. Detailed maps are provided in Appendix B. Alternative 1 was developed in the Proponent’s Environmental Assessment (PEA) prepared by the project applicant (Sierra Pacific Power Company at that time) as part of the original permit application submitted to the CPUC in 2010. Alternative 2 is a modified alternative, which is similar to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), but includes rerouting of some portions of the alignment based on public and agency input received during scoping, additional information gathered during detailed field reviews, and further progress on project engineering and design. The intent of the segment reroutes was to avoid or minimize effects on biological, visual, or cultural resources. Alternative 3 is a road focused alternative, which re-routes the 625 Line to more closely follow the Fiberboard Freeway (paved road between the Mount Watson area north of Tahoe City and the Brockway Summit area) and other area roadways and places more of the 650 Line alignment along SR 267. Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) includes a double-circuit option segment alternative that is referred to as Alternative 3A. One intent of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) is to maximize the proximity of project facilities to existing roadways in order to minimize the need for new access ways and otherwise minimize ground disturbance and environmental effects. Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) is a combination of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) for the 625 Line improvements and   Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-4a PEA Alternative  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-4b Modified Alternative  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-4c Road Focused Alternative Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-4d Proposed Alternative elements of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) for the 650 Line improvements. Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) allows facilities to be in proximity to existing roadways, while maximizing the use of the already upgraded portion of the 650 Line in Segment 650-5. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 all contain double-circuit segments that place both the 625 and 650 Lines on the same poles, which could minimize the project footprint. Alternative 5 is the No Project/No Action Alternative.  3.3.1 COMMON PROJECT FEATURES OF THE ACTION ALTERNATIVES PRIMARY PROJECT COMPONENTS  Upon completion of the following six project components common to all of the action alternatives, the upgraded system (120 kV for the entire loop) would be capable of 114 MVA versus the current 88 MVA. This would better accommodate peak loads identified in Table 3-1, North Lake Tahoe Transmission System Non-Coincident Peak 2006 – 2008, and allow continuation of service during a broader range of line interruption scenarios without use of the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station. REBUILD OF THE EXISTING 650 LINE Approximately 10 miles of the existing 650 Line would be rebuilt. Various segments would either be rebuilt in the existing ROW and alignment, or constructed along a new alignment, depending on the alternative being considered. Where the existing alignment would be followed, new poles would generally be placed 10 feet from the existing poles (which would be removed as part of the project), but in some areas new poles could be farther from existing poles to best support the system design. The 650 Line would be reconductored (i.e., old electrical line would be replaced with new line) with 397.5 thousand circular mil (MCM) all aluminum (AA) conductor (non-specular material) to allow transmission at 120 kV.  REALIGNMENT OF 650 LINE SEGMENTS As stated above, various segments of the 650 Line could be relocated based on the alternative considered. However, for all action alternatives two short segments of the 650 Line would be removed; the segment originating at the Truckee Substation to the point where the 650 Line connects with the 132 Line in the Town of Truckee, and the segment that currently connects the Brockway Substation with the Kings Beach Substation. In both of these instances, the existing poles with telecommunications/cable lines would be left in place and the power line components would be removed. The poles would be topped (i.e., the extra height that accommodated the 60 kV line would no longer be needed and would be cut from the top of the pole). The current distribution lines coming out of Brockway Substation would either be extended (underground) to the Kings Beach Substation and the 60 kV tie would be eliminated, or, if Brockway is to remain in its current state, these lines would remain as they are now. (See description of the subalternatives of upgrade, modification, and/or decommissioning of substations below.) REBUILD A 1.6-MILE SECTION OF THE EXISTING 132 LINE The 132 Line is an existing 120 kV line that extends from Truckee to Squaw Valley. In the Town of Truckee, approximately 32 poles would be replaced and the line would be modified to allow a double-circuit configuration with the 650 Line and operation at 120 kV. The new steel poles would generally be placed 10 feet from the current wood pole locations.  REBUILD OF THE NORTHSTAR TAP INTO A FOLD The existing 60 kV Northstar Tap would be rebuilt into a line fold that would operate at 120 kV, tying into the existing terminals. This activity would require replacement of approximately 14 wood poles with 11 steel poles and approximately 0.5 miles of 397.5 MCM AA conductor (non-specular material). The existing Northstar Tap contains a distribution underbuild along its entire length; this distribution circuit would be transferred to the poles associated with the Northstar Fold.  UPGRADE, MODIFICATION, AND/OR DECOMMISSIONING OF SUBSTATIONS The Northstar, Squaw Valley, Kings Beach, Tahoe City, and North Truckee substations would be modified to accommodate the new 120 kV loop system, and the Brockway Substation would be decommissioned and the equipment would be removed. The future use of vacated Brockway Substation land is unknown at this time. All substation improvements would take place within parcels owned by CalPeco. See Appendix C, Substation Plot Plans and Elevation Drawings, for graphical representations of proposed changes to the substations. Kings Beach and Brockway Substations The existing 60 kV Kings Beach Substation is proposed to be reconstructed as a 120 kV substation to accommodate the upgraded 650 and 625 lines. The substation rebuild would include 120 kV switches, two 120 kV/14.4 kV transformers, and 14.4 kV switchgear, plus the four relocated 14.4 kV distribution feeders which are currently above ground and would be placed underground, as described below. To facilitate the upgrade of this facility, some activities would occur outside of the existing facility’s fence line; however, all work would occur within the larger CalPeco-owned parcel that houses the Kings Beach Utility Center.  Four new underground 14.4 kV distribution feeders at the Kings Beach Substation would be installed that would connect to the existing overhead distribution lines to maintain distribution service in the project area. Three distribution feeders would exit the Kings Beach Substation to the south via three underground duct packages, totaling approximately 500 feet in length. The feeders would be installed within the access road for the Kings Beach Substation and would continue within Deer Street to the intersection with Speckled Street. At this point, one of the feeders would head east, intersecting an existing distribution pole at the northeast corner of Deer Street and Speckled Street. The remaining two feeders would continue south, crossing Speckled Street to the intersection with Cutthroat Avenue, where the second feeder would head east and the third feeder would head west within Cutthroat Avenue until they intersect existing distribution poles. Sectionalizing switches would be installed on the existing overhead distribution lines on Deer Street and Cutthroat Avenue. The remaining distribution feeder would also exit the substation underground and travel west to a point approximately 25 feet beyond the fence line where it would intersect with the existing 650 Line poles that lead to the Brockway Substation. These poles would be topped, leaving the distribution circuit intact. New risers (i.e., conduits that house a power line vertically on a pole) would be installed at the termination of the underground portions of these four feeders to facilitate the conversion to an aboveground facility. The underground distribution facilities would be installed in a duct bank (where there are multiple conduits in one trench) comprised of two 6-inch-diameter polyvinylchloride (PVC) conduits. Approximately nine underground splice vaults (i.e., buried compartments typically accessed by a man-hole on the surface) measuring approximately 12 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 8 feet deep would be installed in line with the duct bank to facilitate pulling the conductor during construction, and access during inspection and maintenance activities. New lighting would be installed at the Kings Beach Substation in accordance with TRPA outdoor lighting codes. The lighting would be used on an as-needed basis during the operation and maintenance of the substation. The proposed substation rebuild, with these elements, would allow removal of the existing equipment at the Brockway Substation, located within the residential neighborhood between Speckled Avenue and Cutthroat Avenue, just east of Deer Street. The determination of future site use has not yet been determined, but ownership would remain with CalPeco. Amendment of Plan Area Statement 019, Martis Peak Electrical substations are defined as Public Utility Centers in Table 21.4-A of the TRPA Code. Although the expanded substation rebuild is proposed on a parcel with an existing Public Utility Center, this use is not permissible on the subject property, which is located in Plan Area 019 – Martis Peak, a Conservation Plan Area, as defined in the Plan Area Statement (PAS). Therefore, the existing Public Utility Center (including the existing Kings Beach Substation and the proposed, new substation) is an approved nonconforming use, by definition, in the TRPA Code (Section 21.2.3). Although the project, as proposed, would allow the decommissioning of the Brockway Substation, the rebuild of the Kings Beach Substation would constitute expansion, intensification, and/or modification of a nonconforming use as defined in the TRPA Code (see TRPA Code Sections 21.2.3 and 21.5). To facilitate the proposed expanded substation in the most appropriate location (the site of the existing substation), TRPA proposes to address the nonconforming use through a staff-initiated amendment to PAS 019, Martis Peak, by adding Public Utility Centers as a special use within a new Special Area 1 of the PAS. In accordance with TRPA Code, such a PAS amendment is considered a project, a Regional Plan amendment, and a Plan Area amendment, subject to specific findings requirements, as described below.  To approve any project, TRPA must find, in accordance with Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the TRPA Code, that:   the project is consistent with, and will not adversely affect implementation of the Regional Plan, including all applicable Goals and Policies, PASs and Maps, Code and other TRPA plans and programs;  the project will not cause the environmental threshold carrying capacities to be exceeded; and,  wherever federal, state, or local air and water quality standards are applicable for the region, whichever are strictest must be attained and maintained pursuant to Article V (d) of the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact. To amend the Regional Plan, including PASs and Maps, TRPA must find, in accordance with Sections 4.5 of the TRPA Code, that the Regional Plan, as amended, achieves and maintains the thresholds. Finally, to approve any Plan Area Amendment, TRPA must make the following findings in accordance with Section 11.8.4 of the TRPA Code.  The amendment is substantially consistent with the plan area designation criteria in subsections 11.6.2 and 11.6.3.  If the amendment is to expand an existing urban plan area boundary or to add residential, tourist accommodation, commercial, or public service as permissible uses to a non-urban plan area, TRPA shall find that the amendment will make the plan area statement consistent with an adopted policy or standard of the Regional Plan, and that the amendment will satisfy one or more of the following criteria.  The amendment corrects an error that occurred at the time of adoption, including but not limited to a mapping error, an editing error, or an error based on erroneous information.  The amendment enables TRPA to make progress toward one or more environmental thresholds without degradation to other thresholds as measured by the Chapter 16: Regional Plan and Environmental Threshold Review, indicators.  The amendment is needed to protect public health and safety and there is no reasonable alternative. TRPA’s findings in support of the staff-initiated PAS amendment are detailed in a separate findings document, and are summarized as follows.  Adding public utility centers as a permissible use in PAS 019 would make the existing substation located on the diesel generator property a conforming use, and would allow transfer of the functions currently provided by the Brockway Substation in the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan to this property, thereby allowing its decommissioning.  Reconstruction of the substation would result in the consolidation of electrical facilities within one secure compound area, out of view from the general public.  The proposed PAS amendment is consistent with the goals of the Land Use and other elements of the TRPA Goals and Policies Plan which does not contain any specific restrictions on placement of public utility centers in conservation plan areas, such as PAS 019. A similar public utility center facility (a substation) exists in PAS 095 (Trout/Cold Creek) located on the south shore of Lake Tahoe near the old Meyers landfill site. PAS 095 is also a Conservation Plan Area, and Public Utility Centers are listed as a special use in PAS 095.  Based on the Initial Environmental Checklist prepared for the plan area statement amendment, there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the new land use, and no impacts that would exceed environmental threshold carrying capacities.  Adding a new public service land use to the Plan Area would not diminish the standards for air and water quality because the amendment only affects an electrical distribution facility where water quality and air quality standards are currently applicable. There are no additional impacts to air or water quality associated with the proposed amendment, and all future projects will be required to meet appropriate air and water quality development standards.  The proposed PAS amendment would not affect the ability of the Regional Plan to achieve and maintain the thresholds, as documented in the Initial Environmental Checklist and this EIS/EIS/EIR.  The proposed amendment would be limited to developed, private property, which contains existing regional-serving electrical facilities within a secure, fenced compound. Most of the area affected by the amendment is high capability land and the proposed plan area amendment would prohibit new or expanded public utility center facilities on low capability land. The affected property is immediately adjacent to the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area and is not isolated from other development. For security and public safety reasons, the affected property is closed to the public and is not suitable for recreation, non-intensive agricultural, or resource management uses for this reason.  The proposed PAS amendment would add a new public service use (public utility centers) to a Conservation Plan Area and would not expand an urban boundary.  The proposed amendment corrects an error that occurred at the time of adoption; specifically, the adopted PAS does not identify the existing, extensive, and essential regional electrical distribution system that exists within the boundaries of the Plan Area.  The amendment is a public health and safety measure and there is no reasonable alternative to plan area amendment because: 1) it would consolidate electrical facilities onto one property, reducing the potential for trespass and vandalism; 2) the electrical compound would be much less visible to the public and less of a potentially attractive hazard; and 3) the construction of an expanded Kings Beach Substation within the boundaries of the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan (and therefore in close proximity to nearby residences) is unreasonable because a superior, more secure site is available that would consolidate electrical facilities onto one secure property, thereby improving efficiency. As described above, one of the findings necessary to support a proposed PAS amendment include a finding that there are no reasonable alternatives. Consistent with this requirement, two alternative configurations for the Kings Beach Substation that would not require amendment of the Martis Peak (019) PAS were considered. These two configurations would involve locating the Kings Beach Substation within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area, where “Public Utility Center”—the use category that includes substations—is a permissible use under the special use provisions of the community plan (Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and Placer County 1996). The Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area is generally bounded by the northern boundary of the block of parcels north of Speckled Avenue, Cutthroat Avenue to the south, Secline Street to the west, and a few parcels of Coon Street to the east. It includes the southernmost portion of the Kings Beach Substation area, within the fence line at the northern terminus of Deer Street. Under the first alternative configuration (Option 1, for purposes of this discussion), the Kings Beach Substation facilities would be located in the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan and a new access way would be located in the Martis Peak Plan Area. The substation rebuild, including the 120 kV switches, two 120 kV/14.4 kV transformers, and 14.4 kV switchgear would be constructed on parcel 090-041-006 (refer to Exhibit 4.2-7). This parcel is owned by CalPeco and is within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area. The parcel would require alteration and upgrade of the access roads to allow adequate access to the facility. With this option, the Brockway substation would be decommissioned. To accommodate this, the footprint of the substation would be larger to accommodate the distribution functions that would be redirected from Brockway. Because of parcel size limitations and the addition of the functions currently served by Brockway, the substation layout would require the needed access way improvements to be outside the parcel, within the Martis Peak Plan Area (on parcel 090-090-029) and subject to the Martis Peak PAS. Although the new access road might be permissible as an accessory use, the Martis Peak PAS does not otherwise permit the construction of new roads. A second alternative configuration (Option 2, for purposes of this discussion) also considered constructing the substation on parcel 090-041-006, but without an access road through the Martis Peak Plan Area (refer to Exhibit 4.2-8). Instead, the access way would be completely within the same parcel, within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area. With this configuration, there would not be sufficient space for the additional equipment that would be required to allow for the decommissioning of the Brockway Substation, as under the first option. Under this option, the Kings Beach Substation would include the 120 kV switches and one 120/60 kV transformer, but the parcel would not accommodate the 14.4 kV switchgear. As such, the Brockway Substation would need to remain operational in its current location to accommodate this function and the existing distribution feeders would remain in their current overhead state. The existing 60 kV overhead line from the Kings Beach facility to Brockway Substation would remain primarily in its existing route but would need to have a new termination into the relocated substation site. The purpose of this configuration is to address the TRPA PAS compliance, which would require all modifications to occur within the Kings Beach Industrial Plan area.  Northstar Substation To accommodate the upgrade of the existing 60 kV tap, a new 120/60/14.4 kV transformer (to accompany the existing 120/60/14.4 kV model already on site) would be installed. Once the North Lake Tahoe 120 kV system is completed, both transformers would be tapped at 120 kV and the substation would operate at 120 kV. In addition, all line terminals would be upgraded with new breaker switches. All work would occur within the existing substation fence line.  Squaw Valley Substation A minor 120 kV electrical transfer equipment upgrade and the installation of a new 120 kV circuit breaker at the Squaw Valley Substation would be necessary to operate the previously upgraded 629 Line. Work at this substation would occur within the existing substation fence line. Tahoe City Substation The Tahoe City Substation would be rebuilt from 60 kV to 120 kV. This substation would be one terminus of the new 625 Line. The 120/60/14.4 kV transformer would be relocated and a new 120/14.4 kV transformer and two new 120 kV breakers would be installed. These new components would be installed within the existing substation fence line. To upgrade the substation while maintaining distribution capabilities, portable (temporary) transformers would be required during construction and would be connected to the 625 Line or 629 Line using temporary poles. These transformers would be located on the 64-acre parcel managed by the USFS immediately to the south of the Tahoe City Substation. The portable transformers would be mounted on two trailers, measuring 8 feet wide by 40 feet long. To ensure that the temporary transformers would not interfere with operation of the Tahoe City Transit Center, CalPeco would coordinate with the USFS and Placer County well in advance of construction to obtain permission to use the parcel. CalPeco would work to site the temporary transformers in undeveloped areas or in area designated for parking and restrict the public from this area. Temporary power poles would be similar to the existing 60 kV poles and would be required to maintain distribution capabilities. Upon completion of the Tahoe City Substation upgrade, these temporary poles and transformers would be removed and the 625 and 629 Lines would be connected to the permanent, new transformers. A stormwater infiltration trench would also be installed at the Tahoe City Substation. This trench would be 2 feet wide by 20 feet long, approximately 8 feet deep, and backfilled with drainage rock. All stormwater, including stormwater collected by secondary containment basins, would be directed toward the trench either by grading or with pumps and piping. New lighting would be installed at the Tahoe City Substation, in accordance with the TRPA outdoor lighting requirements, for use on an as-needed basis. Lighting would consist of one downward directed lamp with a 500-watt halogen bulb, located at the control building.  North Truckee Substation Upon completion of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System upgrade, the northern terminus of the 650 Line would be relocated from the Truckee Substation to the North Truckee Substation after the installation of a new 120 kV bay. Work would occur within the existing facility fences. REMOVAL AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EXISTING 625 LINE  As part of the upgrade to 120 kV for the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System, CalPeco is proposing to “reconductor” and reroute the 625 Line with the objective that the new conductor could accommodate 120 kV, and to align more closely with the existing roadways in the area. The removal of the existing 625 Line would involve approximately 15 miles of conductor and 341 wooden poles. The new 120 kV 625 Line would use 397.5 MCM AA conductor (non-specular material) within a new 40-foot-wide permanent ROW.  POWER POLES As part of the upgrade of the 625 and 650 Lines, the existing wooden poles would be replaced by steel poles. The new steel poles would be approximately 7 to 12 feet taller than the existing wooden poles, which are between 48 and 80 feet above ground surface. On average, pole spacing would be 300 feet apart. The diameter of the existing wooden poles ranges from 13 inches to 16 inches. The diameter of the new poles would range from 15 inches to 19 inches at the base for poles buried in the ground. Poles would be buried 7 to 10 feet deep, depending on height. Guy wires may be connected to the poles in areas that need additional stability. Self-supporting poles may be used where there would not be the option to use guy-wires (e.g., where there are existing structures next to the site) or where conditions would not be suitable to adequately burying the pole base. The diameter of the self-supporting poles would vary based on whether the alternative calls for a single circuit, double circuit, if there is underbuild, and other factors. Self-supporting poles would be mounted on a concrete foundation, which would have a 3 to 6 foot diameter. These foundations typically extend above the ground surface to a height of 6 to 12 inches, but there could be site-specific circumstances where up to 2 feet of height would be required. The diameter of the self-supporting poles could be as much as 4.5 feet at the base where they are attached to the concrete foundations. ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD MANAGEMENT Electric and magnetic field (EMF) levels from power lines or related facilities, such as substations, are not presently regulated at the federal, state, or local level. However, the CPUC has implemented a decision (D.06-01-042) requiring utilities to incorporate “low cost” (up to approximately 4 percent of total project cost) or “no-cost” measures for managing EMF from power lines. The applicant has incorporated the following low-cost and no-cost measures to reduce EMF levels along the power line corridor and at substations. Low-cost measures for all of the sections would include a standardized ROW width of 40-feet (which provides additional distance from the circuits to the ROW edge in some cases). Where feasible in light of other environmental constraints and permitting, all circuits would either maintain an attachment height at the power pole of 40.5-feet or have their present attachment height increased to 40.5-feet above ground level by the use of taller poles. For all sections, the phasing of the power line circuits would be arranged to maximize magnetic field reduction due to field cancellation (using reverse or unlike phasing arrangements). For lines 625 and 650, locations where these two circuits are individual single circuit configurations would be combined onto a common pole as a double circuit configuration, resulting in a more compact phase configuration and allowing the application of reverse or unlike phasing to increase magnetic field cancellation for both circuits. Finally, the loading on those circuits being upgraded from 60 kV to 120 kV operation would typically be reduced by 50 percent; which would reduce the associated magnetic field as well, since magnetic field levels are a function of loading. For the substations, high current devices associated with the project upgrade would be centrally located towards the interior of the substation and away from the property line boundaries. For more information on EMF, see Appendix D. RIGHT-OF-WAY REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMANENT RIGHTS-OF-WAY CalPeco currently holds easements from the USFS, USACE, the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Placer County, other public entities, and various private landowners that own properties that are crossed by the existing 650 Line, 625 Line, 132 Line, and Northstar Fold. The widths of the existing easements vary, but average approximately 30 feet. The easement for the proposed Northstar Fold would widen from approximately 40 feet to 95 feet between the westernmost pole and the Northstar Substation due to the divergence of the separate circuits. As part of project implementation, CalPeco would negotiate with the existing landowners to obtain a permanent easement of 40 feet for single-circuit options (one line on each pole) for the new 625 and 650 Lines for operation and maintenance purposes. For segments of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) where a double-circuit option is being considered, a permanent easement of 65 feet would be pursued. The wider easement and associated vegetation management is desired for double-circuit options because equipment damage from tree fall, wildfire, or other events could cause failure in two lines simultaneously and significantly affect service in the whole North Lake Tahoe Transmission System.  REQUIREMENTS FOR TEMPORARY RIGHTS-OF-WAY To accommodate construction, a temporary ROW width of 65 feet would be established for the new 625 Line and 650 Line (single-circuit options), the Northstar Fold, and the 132 Line. All disturbances outside of the permanent 40-foot wide easement described above would be temporary and the land would be restored to its original condition following construction, unless otherwise requested by the landowner or land management agency. For double-circuit options, all construction activity would occur within the 65-foot permanent easement. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ACCESS The electrical line ROWs would primarily be accessed through the use of existing, paved municipal roadways and paved and dirt USFS system roads. However, additional access ways would need to be developed to facilitate access from existing roads to the power line ROWs for construction and later inspections, maintenance, and repairs. For the purpose of this assessment, all roads used to access the site are termed “access ways.”1 Access ways include existing paved roads, existing dirt roads, and new dirt roads and “two-track” pathways that would be developed for the project. Where access ways would be on slopes greater than 20 percent, a wider access way would require grading, as discussed below. Exhibits 3-4a through 3-4d show existing and proposed access ways that would be used for project construction and operation. Roads on Exhibits 3-4a through 3-4d labeled as “Access – Dirt Road (No Improvement Needed) and “Access – Paved Road” are existing dirt and paved roads that would be used to access the power line ROWs during project construction and operation and maintenance activities. These roads would be used as they currently exist and no changes or modifications are proposed. If these roads are damaged during construction, they would be restored to pre-project conditions. 1  The criterion for defining a road varies by the agency with jurisdiction. Each land manager or owner may have different requirements for design, construction, maintenance, and use. TRPA Code defines “road” as a smooth or paved surface designed for travel by motor vehicles. In general, the impacts are assessed based on the coverage of the road surface. The project does not include the construction of any new paved roads. Roads on NFS lands described for this project are either temporary or permanent. Temporary Roads are built to facilitate the construction of the project. They are completely restored at the conclusion of construction and no longer used or open to vehicles. Permanent Roads would be included as part of the National Forest road system. They are classified in five levels from Maintenance Level 1 (basic custodial care, closed to vehicles) to Maintenance Level 5 (high comfort; passenger car). This project includes the use of roads that are already included in the NF (e.g., Fiberboard Freeway) and construction of new roads. New roads may be both completely new construction or may utilize portions of old legacy roadways. For this project, new roads, which include any road not previously part of the National Forest road system, are assumed for analysis to be Maintenance Level 2, to facilitate the long term operational and maintenance needs of the project. Given the different uses and definitions of the term “road”, the term “access way” is used in this document to encompass the various types of facilities that may provide vehicle access. The term “access way” is not specifically defined by any of the lead agencies, but is used herein to describe a route within the project area (that may or may not require widening or clearing), which is required for construction and /or operation of the project. For the purpose of this document, access ways include several categories of routes, including existing dirt roads, NFS roads, existing roads and trails that are not part of a formal designated travel system, new dirt roads constructed as part of the project, and existing and new “two-track” pathways intended for power line operations and maintenance access.  The category of “Access – Dirt Road (Needs Improvement)” represents existing dirt roads that would require some modification to support their use during project construction. In most instances, the improvement or modification would consist of removing rocks and logs that may have fallen onto the road and trimming brush, branches, and other vegetation encroaching on the roadway to provide sufficient width and clearance to allow construction vehicles (e.g., cable trucks, tensioning trucks) to pass. In some instances, water bars (an interceptor dyke that is used to prevent erosion on sloping roads) and other features that might obstruct use by construction vehicles would be removed and then replaced after the construction process is complete. After completion of construction, no further work on these existing dirt roads is proposed. If the roads were damaged during construction (e.g., if deep ruts or potholes were created), they would be repaired to pre-project conditions prior to project completion.  The category of “new access ways” indicates a location where a new vehicle travel pathway would be created where one does not currently exist. A majority of the mileage of new access ways would be within the power line ROWs providing “centerline access routes” (see Table 3-2, New and Improved Access Ways Required under the Action Alternatives). The Centerline Access Routes are not shown in Exhibits 3-4a through 3-4d as they would be located immediately under, or next to, the lines showing the power line routes. The centerline access routes would be approximately 10-feet wide, and although “centerline” is in the category title, in reality the route would move back and forth within the power line ROW, going on either side of power poles, avoiding boulders and other barriers, and responding to topography. In addition, turnouts (30-feet wide) would be needed approximately every 1,000 feet for vehicle passing. The power line ROWs would initially be cleared of trees and shrubs as part of project construction. After completion of construction, the centerline access routes would be maintained in low growing vegetation for erosion control while allowing over-land vehicle travel by line trucks and inspection trucks (i.e., pickup trucks).  Table 3-2 New and Improved Access Ways Required for the Action Alternatives  Road Type  Alternative 1:  PEA Alternative   Alternative 2: Modified Alternative   Alternative 3: Road Focused Alternative (Alternative 3A: Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option)  Alternative 4: Proposed Alternative   Miles of New Access Way within New Power Line ROW  5.9  5.8  1.5 (1.5)  1.5  Within Tahoe Basin  5.4  4.7  1.3 (1.3)  1.3  Outside Tahoe Basin  0.5  1.1  0.2 (0.2)  0.2  Miles of New Access Way within Existing Power Line ROW  9.4  7.3  8.2 (7.0)  8.2  Within Tahoe Basin  4.7  2.6  3.5 (2.3)  3.5  Outside Tahoe Basin  4.7  4.7  4.7 (4.7)  4.7  Miles of New Access Way outside Power Line ROW  8.9  7.7  2.1 (2.0)  2.0  Within Tahoe Basin  7.3  6.1  2.1 (2.0)  2.0  Outside Tahoe Basin  1.6  1.6  0 (0)  0  Miles of Dirt Road that Needs Improvement  1.2  1.2  0.7 (0.7)  0.7  Within Tahoe Basin  1.2  1.2  0.7 (0.7)  0.7  Outside Tahoe Basin  0  0  0 (0)  0  Total  25.4  22.7  12.5 (11.2)  12.4  Total Within Tahoe Basin  18.6  14.6  7.6 (6.3)  7.5  Total Outside Tahoe Basin  6.8  8.1  4.9 (4.9)  4.9  New access ways outside the power line ROW would be similar to centerline access routes in all respects except for location. They would first be developed during project construction to support construction vehicle access to the ROW. Many of the new access ways would consist of short spur roads connecting existing roadways to nearby portions of the power line ROW. Given the map scale of Exhibits 3-4a through 3-4d, these short spur roads are not visible, although they are included in the mileage calculations in Table 3-2, New and Improved Access Ways Required under the Action Alternatives. In instances where existing topography and vegetation allow vehicle access to the ROW without development of a spur road/new access way, no travel way would be developed and inspection and maintenance vehicles would drive over the existing ground surface. Trees and shrubs would be removed during construction to create an approximately 10-foot wide access way. After completion of construction, the new access way would be maintained in low growing vegetation to allow over-land vehicle travel for inspection and maintenance (Road Maintenance Level 2 per the Forest Service Handbook 7709.58, 10, 12.3). Exhibits 3-4a through 3-4d also identify areas where grading would be required for a new access way. These are locations where the slope is estimated to be greater than 20 percent and it is assumed that some grading would be necessary to create a suitable access way (either within or outside the power line ROW) that can be traveled by maintenance and inspection vehicles. In particularly steep areas, the new access way would likely require switch back roadways to provide moderate grades and generally level cross-slopes, and would result in a noticeable change in the topography. New access ways requiring grading/earth moving due to terrain would be approximately 10 feet wide for straight sections and up to 25-feet wide at curves to safely allow the movement of construction equipment and vehicles to each site. Cut and fill slopes, would disturb a wider area. Typically, each access way requiring grading/earth moving would first be cleared of vegetation and graded by a bulldozer. A motor grader would then level the access way in accordance with the engineered specification. Erosion control best management practices (BMPs) (e.g., water bars) would also be installed to address erosion control and water quality protection concerns. Gravel would not typically be placed on these roadways. However, it may be applied where a dirt access way intersects a paved public road to minimize the potential for dirt and mud being tracked onto public roadway. Gravel may also be applied as an erosion control BMP if appropriate. The new access way would then be revegetated with low growing vegetation and maintained as described above for other access ways, except where BMPs would not allow for revegetation. Exhibit 3-5 shows a typical schematic cross section of three different scenarios. This graphic shows the pre-construction condition, the condition during construction, and a projection of how the access way would be maintained after vegetation growth returns.  The new access ways would not be intended for public access. Where new access ways connect to, or cross, existing roads or trails, barriers to access, such as boulders or gates would be placed at the entrance to the access way. During maintenance and inspection activities any evidence of public use would be noted, and public access barriers could be adjusted, if needed.  TRUCK TRIPS Table 3-3, Estimated Truck Trips, provides the estimated number of truck trips associated with each project component. These would be one-way truck trips on and off the construction site and encompass all classes of trucks (e.g., material transport and delivery trucks, line tensioning trucks, cement trucks, crew trucks, cherry pickers, fuel trucks) except for employees driving to the job site in personal vehicles. Trip lengths would vary substantially based on the type of truck and the specific purpose (e.g., delivering materials to a staging area, moving materials from a staging area to the construction site, moving logs from the alignment to a staging or processing area, removing processed logs from the job site).  Table 3-3 Estimated Truck Trips   Component  Approximate Number of Truck Trips (one-way)  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  Phase 1          Northstar Substation  55  55  55  55  650 Line Upgrade  4,825  4,050  4,970  4,905  Phase 2          King Beach, Northstar, North Truckee, and Brockway Substations  880  880  880  880  650 Line Upgrade  1,260  1,260  1,325  1,260  Phase 3          Tahoe City, Squaw Valley, and King Beach Substations  1,065  1,065  1,065  1,065  625 Line Upgrade  6,580  6,710  5,330  5,330  Total Estimated Vehicle Trips  14,665  14,020  13,625  12,495   Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-5 Example Access Way Cross Sections HELICOPTER ACCESS Helicopters would be used to deliver and remove construction material from areas with rugged terrain and where ground access would not safely accommodate the required construction equipment and vehicles. Helicopter landing areas identified for possible use include the Tahoe City Staging Area, the Kings Beach Staging Area, one of the Airport or the USACE Staging Areas, and one of the Northstar Parking Staging Areas, discussed below. These sites would be used for both helicopter landing and for equipment and material storage. The landing zone would be accessed using existing paved and dirt access roads. Because this landing zone would be located in previously disturbed area, no additional grading would be required. However, some vegetation clearing may be required to provide a safe operating environment. The staging areas would be watered for dust control, as needed. A Kaman K-Max K-1200 or similarly equipped helicopter would be used for tree removal and material delivery and removal activities in remote areas. Helicopters would typically be used during daylight hours between 6:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., or as allowed by local noise restrictions, to deliver and remove materials. Helicopters would not be used at night. Helicopters could also be used to remove materials and construction spoils from the ROW. The helicopters’ flight paths would follow the ROW to the extent practical and would be coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration and with permitting agencies. A “no-fly” zone may be enforced over USFS designated Protected Activity Centers (PACs) for certain wildlife species during the breeding season (typically May 1 to August 15). STAGING AREAS Multiple staging areas would be required to store, stage, and distribute construction equipment and materials. A variety of potential staging areas have been included for study as part of this EIS/EIS/EIR (see Table 3-4, Staging Area Summary, below). The same staging areas are being considered for each action alternative, and all of the staging areas evaluated may not be required. The Tahoe City, Northstar Parking Lot, Northstar Golf Course and Sierra Pacific Industries (SPI) staging areas would only be used if an agreement can be reached with the landowner. Additionally, only one of the Airport 1, Airport 2, Airport 3, and USACE staging areas would be used, if an agreement can be reached with a landowner. All four are evaluated because it is unclear at this time which, if any, might ultimately become available. Table 3-4 Staging Area Summary  Staging Area  Purpose  Required Improvements  Approximate Area (acres)  Tahoe City  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Installation of temporary construction fencing   9.1  Fiberboard Freeway  Material and equipment storage, and staging and logging activities  Vegetation clearing, tree removal, and installation of temporary construction fencing  1.9  Former Batch Plant  Material and equipment storage, and staging and potentially logging activities  Vegetation clearing, tree removal, and installation of temporary construction fencing  0.2  Kings Beach  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Vegetation clearing, minor access improvements, tree removal, and installation of temporary construction fencing  2.9  SPI  Material and equipment storage and staging  Vegetation clearing, improvement to existing dirt access road and new access way, and installation of temporary construction fencing  0.6  Table 3-4 Staging Area Summary  Staging Area  Purpose  Required Improvements  Approximate Area (acres)  Northstar Parking 1  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Installation of temporary construction fencing  3.5  Northstar Parking 2  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Installation of temporary construction fencing  7.1  Northstar Golf Course  Material and equipment storage and staging  Vegetation clearing, minor access improvements, and installation of temporary construction fencing  5.1  Airport 1  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Vegetation clearing, improvements to dirt access ways, installation of temporary construction fencing  4.1  Airport 2  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Vegetation clearing and installation of temporary construction fencing  8.2  Airport 3  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Vegetation clearing and installation of temporary construction fencing  7.6  USACE  Material and equipment storage and staging, and helicopter landing  Improvement to existing dirt access road and installation of temporary construction fencing  1.8   The staging areas considered in this EIS/EIS/EIR are generally situated in areas with pre-existing soil disturbance; however, some sites may require minimal vegetation removal and grading. There are existing paved or dirt access roads for all of the staging areas; only access to the SPI staging area would require new, temporary disturbance. Temporary chain-link fencing would be installed around the perimeter of the staging areas and security personnel would be posted, as needed. Typically, grid power is not available at these sites and a 5.5 kilowatt diesel-powered generator would be temporarily installed to provide power on an as-needed basis. During each phase of construction, one of the staging areas would also house office trailers to support the construction crew. The staging areas currently being considered are shown in Exhibits 3-4a, 3-4b, 3-4c, and 3-4d, their characteristics are summarized in Table 3-4, Staging Area Summary, and they are described in the following subsections. Tahoe City The Tahoe City Staging Area would be located approximately 1 mile north of the Tahoe City Substation and would be accessed by an existing dirt road from Jackpine Street in Tahoe City. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and staging. The staging area has previously been partially developed; approximately half of the area of potential disturbance is conifer and chaparral habitat. The site was used as a staging area and helicopter landing zone for the recent 629 Line upgrade (line extending along SR 89 from Squaw Valley to Tahoe City). Use of the site for staging would require installation of temporary fencing, but no other improvements would be required to prepare this staging area for use. Fiberboard Freeway The Fiberboard Freeway Staging Area would be located east of Segment 625-3, and would be accessed from the Fiberboard Freeway. This staging area would be used to store and stage material and equipment, and for logging activities related to the project. This approximately 2-acre area has been previously disturbed, but has some vegetative cover. The vegetation on site is dominated by mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus) with scattered pines (Pinus sp.). Vegetation and brush would be cleared and approximately five trees would be removed to prepare this staging area for use. Former Batch Plant The Former Batch Plant Staging Area would be located just off the Fiberboard Freeway (near Segment 625-4). This staging area would be used to store and stage material and equipment, and could also be used for logging activities related to the project. This approximately 0.2-acre area has been previously disturbed and supports little natural vegetation. The primary surrounding habitat is red fir forest. Vegetation and brush would be cleared and approximately 30 trees would be removed to prepare this staging area for use. Kings Beach The Kings Beach Staging Area would be located just north of the Kings Beach Substation on NFS land, and would be accessed by an existing dirt road located at the end of Canterbury Drive. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. This site was formerly used as a landfill and, as a result, has a previously-disturbed area that measures approximately 300 feet by 300 feet. Activity at this location would be focused in this previously-disturbed area (based on USFS review and authorization). The vegetation within the planned staging area mainly consists of bunch grasses and scattered Jeffrey pines (Pinus jeffreyi) under 10 feet in height. Minor improvements to the access road—including the removal of approximately 10 trees—would be required and a temporary fence would be installed around its perimeter. SPI The SPI Staging Area would be located near the 625 Line east of SR 267. The staging area would be accessed off of Martis Peak Road and existing dirt access roads that would require limited improvements (e.g., trimming of vegetation encroaching on the road, minor grading). This staging area would also require approximately 0.3 acres of new disturbance for temporary access ways. Most of the staging area site has been previously disturbed.  Northstar Parking 1 The Northstar Parking 1 Staging Area would be located in Northstar-at-Tahoe’s Castle Peak Park and Ride lot off of Northstar Drive. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. The lot and access ways are paved and no ground disturbance or vegetation removal would be required. Northstar Parking 2 The Northstar Parking 2 Staging Area would also be located in Northstar-at-Tahoe’s Castle Peak Park and Ride lot, east of the Northstar Parking 1 Staging Area. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. This 7-acre site and all access ways are paved and no ground disturbance or vegetation removal would be required.  Northstar Golf Course The Northstar Golf Course Staging Area would be located just north of SR 267, where the highway passes the Northstar Golf Course, and would be accessed by an existing dirt road located approximately 1.4 miles southeast of Martis Creek Road. The name, “Northstar Golf Course” was established when the PEA was prepared due to the proximity to the golf course and not land ownership. The land is owned by the Truckee Tahoe Airport District. This approximately 5 acre staging area would be used for material storage and equipment staging. The eastern and western sides of the small access road from SR 267 support different primary vegetation types. To the west of the access road, vegetation is primarily big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), low sage, lupine (Lupinus spp.), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), and Plumas ivesia (Ivesia sericoleuca). To the east of the access road, the primary vegetation types include those more typical of wet meadow habitat, including bentgrass (Agrostis spp.) and sedges (Carex spp.), with scattered low sage. To prepare this staging area, vegetation within the staging area footprint would be cleared and minor improvements would be made to the access road. A recorded cultural resources site is located next to this staging area. The boundary of the staging area would be adjusted, if needed, to avoid encroaching on this site. Signage would be placed on the perimeter fencing identifying the presence of a sensitive environmental resource and that all activities and personnel must stay within the defined boundary of the staging area.  Airport 1 This approximately 4 acre staging area would be located on airport property in Nevada County, immediately west of Martis Creek Road. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. Most of the site is currently sagebrush scrub habitat.  Airport 2 This approximately 8 acre staging area would be partially located on airport property in the Town of Truckee. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. Most of the site is currently sagebrush scrub habitat. Access to the site would be via existing paved access ways (Truckee Tahoe Airport Road and Soaring Way).  Airport 3 The Airport 3 Staging Area would be located on airport property in Nevada County. Most of the site is currently sagebrush scrub habitat. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. Access to the site would be via existing paved access ways (Truckee Tahoe Airport Road and Soaring Way). USACE The USACE staging area would be located on less than 2 acres in Nevada County. The entire site has been previously disturbed. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. Access to the site would be via existing paved (Martis Creek Road) and dirt access ways. POWER LINE CONSTRUCTION METHODS Stringing Site Preparation Multiple stringing sites would be required during the removal and installation of the conductors. In general, stringing sites would be approximately 300 feet in diameter (approximately 1.6 acres) and would be spaced at distances between approximately 500 feet and 8,000 feet apart depending on the terrain and surface conditions along the ROW, as well as the placement of angle structures. On average, they would be located approximately 2,500 feet (approximately 0.5 mile) apart. Table 3-5, Estimated Number of Stringing Sites Required Under the Action Alternatives, shows the approximate number of stringing sites that required within and outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Stringing sites would require a relatively flat surface; therefore, they would need to be cleared and could need to be graded to allow for safe equipment operation. Site preparation would require heavy equipment for removing obstacles (e.g., large rocks, trees, brush). Vegetation would be removed, as necessary, to provide safe and efficient work areas. Mowing or grubbing would be the preferred method for clearing vegetation.  Table 3-5 Estimated Number of Stringing Sites Required Under the Action Alternatives  Road Type  Alternative 1:  PEA Alternative   Alternative 2: Modified Alternative   Alternative 3: Road Focused Alternative (Alternative 3A: Road Focused Alternative with Double-Circuit Option)  Alternative 4: Proposed Alternative   Number or Stringing Sites Within the Basin  44  39  45 (43)  45  Number of Stringing Sites Outside of the Basin  27  27  25 (25)  24  Total  71  66  70 (68)  69   Pole Installation Excavation Prior to excavation, topsoil would be salvaged from the area to be excavated and from any areas that would be used for spoil storage. Topsoil would be stored adjacent to the pole, kept separate from spoil material, and respread following pole installation to facilitate revegetation of the work site. Pole installation would begin by preparing a hole by auger or track-mounted backhoe, approximately 3 feet in diameter, in which the new pole would be buried. The depth of the hole would be determined by the height of the pole. As a general rule, 10 percent of the pole height plus 2 additional feet are buried below ground. The poles would range in height from approximately 50 to 80 feet, requiring holes between 7 and 10 feet deep. Where self-supporting steel poles would be used, larger holes between 6 and 8 feet in diameter and 20 to 30 feet deep would be excavated, and concrete foundations would be poured. The permanent footprint of angle and tangent poles (poles where there is a turn in the line) would be approximately 2 square feet, while the total permanent footprint of self-supporting structures would be approximately 50.2 square feet and would displace up to 55.9 cubic yards (CY) of soil. Blasting (outside of developed areas) or soundless chemical demolition agents (typically materials that expand in rock fissures to split larger rocks) may be required in rocky areas where normal excavation methods are unable to meet project excavation specifications. As a safety precaution, excavations would be covered, flagged, or temporarily fenced during periods of inactivity. Up to 1 CY of soil would be mounded around the base of the newly installed poles. Any remaining excavated spoil would be removed from the ROW by dump truck and stored at the staging areas. Excess spoil not used for backfilling or restoration efforts would be removed from the project site and sent to an approved landfill for reuse or disposal. Additionally, holes for guy wire anchors would be excavated at pole sites, where required. The anchor would be a 2-foot-diameter disk attached to a steel rod with an eye at the top. The disk would be bolted perpendicular to the rod, requiring a 2-foot-diameter hole between 4 and 8 feet deep. Anchors would typically be located at a distance equal to the total pole height away from the pole’s base. After installation, each anchor would be compacted and tested using a large bulldozer and winch lines, or with specific anchor testing equipment.  An additional temporary work area would be required for each anchor being installed outside of the temporary ROW. In these instances, a 15-foot by 50-foot work area, extending from the ROW to the anchor location, would be established to provide access for the track-mounted equipment. Disturbance would include vegetation removal, rock and downed tree relocation, and overland travel. To facilitate the installation of the anchor, an approximately 4-foot by 6-foot area surrounding the anchor location would be cleared of existing brush. A track-mounted backhoe would then be used to excavate a 2-foot-diameter hole, and the excavated soil stockpiled for backfilling after completion of the anchor installation. It is anticipated that all of the soil removed from the hole would be used for backfill, unless deemed unsuitable, in which case it would be hauled off site. Assembly and Erection Once excavation activities for the poles have begun, materials, including poles, insulators, and hardware, would be delivered to the site, assembled, and attached to the new poles to form a complete unit. Direct-buried poles would be buried in the ground, and native soil would be used to fill the holes (imported soil and in some cases concrete would be used if native material is unsuitable for compaction or could not support the pole). Concrete would be sourced from the nearest commercial batch plant. Up to 1 CY of soil would be mounded around the base of the newly installed poles. Self-supporting steel poles would be placed onto concrete foundations using cranes and would be secured using the appropriate hardware.  Helicopters may be used to deliver material to the ROW and install poles, as necessary, in areas of rough terrain or in areas otherwise inaccessible to ground crews and other construction equipment. If poles are to be installed using helicopters, they would be assembled at one of the staging areas prior to delivery to the ROW. The assembled poles would then be placed into the excavated holes using cranes. Poles to be placed by helicopters would be assembled at the helicopter landing zone, transported, and placed in the excavated holes with assistance from ground crews. Conductor Removal and Installation The following steps describe the construction techniques for removing and installing conductor. Exhibit 3-6 is a graphical representation of the conductor installation process. In most areas where reconductoring is proposed (i.e., old electrical line would be replaced with new line), the new conductor (i.e., electrical cable) would be of the same type as the existing conductor; specifically, 397.5 MCM AA conductor (non-specular material that reduces light reflection off the metal). An approximately 8.8-mile section of the 650 Line between Kings Beach and Martis Valley currently has aluminum core steel reinforced conductor. Conductor Removal The conductor would be removed by sectioning the conductor at dead-end poles. If feasible, the conductor would be spliced together in areas with multiple dead-end poles prior to removal. A heavy reel puller would be staged at stringing sites or various intersections of existing access roads, and the conductor would be pulled through the ROW to the reel puller. The conductor would be pulled under a controlled tension to keep it elevated and away from obstacles. Two crew members would walk the ROW as the conductor is being pulled and assist if the conductor snags. During the pull, the conductor forces at the poles located at each end of the pull sections would be transferred to trucks, tensioners, and pullers. The existing conductor would be placed in a hoist and attached at one end to the pole to support the down-strain load, removing load on the existing insulator. The removed conductor would be spooled onto reel trucks in 25,000 pound sections and taken along with related hardware to an existing CalPeco storage facility for reuse, or would be recycled or disposed of at an appropriate landfill. Helicopters are not anticipated to be used during conductor removal. Conductor Installation The new conductor would be attached to the sock line (i.e., a light rope or cable use to pull the conductor) and pulled back through each pole to the next conductor pulling site. After the conductor reaches the pulling site, it would be sagged and tensioned to design specifications. The 120 kV line would be installed with a minimum ground clearance of 25 feet where there are no obstructions, 30 feet where the line crosses roads, and 34 feet for any railroad crossings. The new conductor would then be clipped into the end of each insulator on each pole, any travelers (temporary rollers or pulleys hung from the poles to assist with line pulling) would be removed, and vibration dampers and other hardware would be installed. Highway and River Crossings At highway and river crossings, temporary clearance structures, which consist of vertical wood poles with netting strung between them to suspend any conductor that accidentally falls, would be erected prior to conductor removal and installation. An auger or backhoe would excavate the holes in which the poles for crossing structures would be installed, and a crane would lift the structure elements into place. The total temporary disturbance associated with the installation and removal of each crossing structure would be approximately 0.25 acre (100 feet by 100 feet). The temporary clearance structures would be removed after the completion of conductor stringing, and the holes would be backfilled with the excavated soils.  Construction of power lines across I-80, SR 267, and SR 89 would require an encroachment permit (TR-0100) from Caltrans. In conjunction with this permit, traffic control would be implemented. For I-80, rolling breaks (i.e., Highway Patrol vehicles slowing traffic behind them to provide a break in traffic ahead of them where work could be conducted) of durations sufficient for construction personnel to install pull rope and string conductors across the freeway would be used. Whether rolling breaks or a traditional road closures are used, I-80 is the only crossing location where nighttime construction could be required. This option would only be used if a temporary daytime shutdown of all travel lanes as the cable is strung across the highway would not be permitted by Caltrans during daylight hours. At crossings with SR 267, SR 89, and local roadways, flaggers may temporarily hold traffic during stringing activities and reconductoring work.  Source: Received from Sierra Pacific 2010; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-6 Conductor Installation The power line would span all waterways. No construction would occur in the Truckee River channel; although some pole installations and removals may be required below the ordinary high water mark. Work would only occur on the river banks and would be scheduled during low-flow conditions. Underground Distribution Duct Package and Cable Installation New underground distribution feeders would be installed at the Kings Beach Substation in order to maintain distribution service in the project area. Each distribution feeder would leave the Kings Beach Substation via an underground duct package and intercept the overhead distribution lines via new risers. The underground power facilities would be installed in a duct bank comprised of two 6-inch-diameter PVC conduits. Approximately nine underground splice vaults would be installed in line with the duct bank at intervals of approximately 900 feet or where the line must turn a corner. Two to 14 days prior to trenching, CalPeco would notify other utility companies (via Underground Service Alert) and request that they locate and mark existing underground utilities along the proposed underground alignment. Exploratory excavations (potholing) would also be conducted to verify the locations of existing facilities in the field, if necessary. One short trench and three generally parallel trenches, measuring approximately 2 feet wide and 5 feet deep and separated by 5 feet, would be excavated using a backhoe. One approximately 25 foot long trench would exit the substation and head west. The remaining three trenches, approximately 980, 1,160, and 1,360 feet long, would head south. To accommodate the installation of the underground splice vaults, an approximately 14-foot long segment of trench would be expanded at splice vault locations to approximately 8-feet wide by 9-feet deep. Upon completion of trench excavation, the underground splice vaults and 6-inch-diameter PVC conduits would be lowered into the trench. The conduits would be encased in at least 24 inches of compacted sand. The trench would then be backfilled using Type II aggregate base and compacted according to engineering specifications. The top of the duct package would be approximately 4 feet below the ground surface. Upon completion of the installation of the duct bank, the three conductors would be installed in one of the PVC conduits, leaving the other empty for future use.  The approximately 3,525 feet of trenches and underground splice vaults would result in the excavation of approximately 1,306 CY and 252 CY of material, respectively. After installation of the duct bank and underground splice vaults, approximately 1,340 CY of sand and aggregate would be used to backfill the trench. The excavated material would be incorporated into the Kings Beach Substation grading or disposed of at an appropriate facility. After the conductor has been installed, the ground surface would be restored to near pre-construction conditions, and vegetation would be replanted or the streets would be repaved, as appropriate. Individual lanes of traffic could be closed for a period of up to one week during trench excavation, duct bank and vault installation, and pulling activities. Because Deer Street, Speckled Street, and Cutthroat Avenue are all two-lane roads, two-way traffic would continue and would be controlled using flaggers. The intersection of Deer Street and Speckled Street would be closed for up to one day during construction. Pole Removal Following installation of the new steel poles and removal of the conductor, the hardware on the old poles would be dismantled using cranes and bucket trucks. The old poles would then be cut off at ground level and transported off site by truck for disposal at an approved facility. Crews would use existing access roads, new spur roads, and the power line ROW to access pole work areas by truck. In areas where the terrain is too rugged for truck access, crews would use all-terrain vehicles or would hike in on foot to access the poles.  In areas with rough terrain or limited access, the poles would be cut off at ground level and transported to the nearest suitable staging area by helicopter. Poles that have not been treated may be repurposed or recycled (e.g., chipped and used at biomass energy facilities, or in landscaping or soil stabilization projects), or taken to an appropriate landfill if no other use can be found. Repurposing may include chipping for use as biomass, groundcover, or other use. Poles that have been treated, or are otherwise unacceptable for biomass or other uses, would be disposed of at an appropriate disposal site. The existing pole work areas would then be restored. Underbuild The existing power line poles that would be affected by the proposed project are at heights between 48 and 80 feet above ground surface (Sierra Pacific 2010; Attachment 3-B). Sections of both of the 625 and 650 Lines include poles that accommodate the existing power line at the top of the pole, as well as existing electrical distribution lines and/or communication lines (such as cable and telephone) on the lower portion of the pole. The existing electrical distribution lines and/or communication lines that share the power poles are referred to as underbuild. Exhibit 3-6 shows the locations along the existing 625 and 650 Lines affected by the project where there is existing underbuild. Exhibit 3-6 also illustrates the different types of underbuild along these lines; the categories of underbuild are: (1) distribution underbuild only, (2) communication underbuild only, and (3) both distribution and communication underbuild. As shown in Exhibit 3-6, the existing 625 Line has a limited amount of underbuild—only two short sections of electrical distribution line, one in Tahoe City and the other just east of SR 267 at Brockway Summit. Conversely, almost the entire portion of the 650 Line affected by the project includes underbuild.  As part of all of the action alternatives, existing underbuild would be transferred to the new power poles to the extent feasible. Where the underbuild is not transferred to the new power poles, the existing poles would remain in place, the existing powerline and related equipment would be removed, and the poles topped. Generally, remaining poles that accommodate distribution only or distribution and communication underbuild would be topped to a height of about 40 feet above ground surface (+/- 5 feet) (Bengochea, pers. comm., 2012). If the remaining poles would support communication underbuild only, the remaining poles would be topped to a height of about 30 feet above ground surface (+/- 5 feet). Instances where existing poles would remain in place would typically occur in urbanized or developed areas where buildings are currently served by electrical distribution and/or communication lines. Under action alternatives where these buildings could not be adequately served by distribution or communication lines attached to new 625 or 650 Line poles (e.g., 625 or 650 Line would be moved to a new route), existing poles would remain to support the underbuild facilities.  Where transfer of the underbuild to new poles would be feasible, CalPeco would be responsible for transferring the distribution underbuild. This would occur simultaneously with new power pole construction. CalPeco does not have the authority to transfer the communication lines. In accordance with the Joint Pole Agreements established between CalPeco and communication providers, owners of the communication underbuild would be responsible for transfer of these lines to the new poles generally within 60 days following construction of the new poles. Under rare circumstances (such as new power poles being constructed late in the fall and weather precluding relocation to the new poles in the same season), the relocation of the communication underbuild could extend beyond 60 days. In these instances there would be two sets of parallel lines for a period until the communication underbuild could be relocated. After all facilities have been moved from existing poles to new poles, CalPeco lineman would remove the poles (cutting them to ground surface) (Bengochea, pers. comm., 2012). Each of the action alternatives evaluated in this EIS/EIS/EIR involves some locations where power lines along the 625 and/or 650 Lines would be removed, but some poles would remain and be topped only. Common to all of the action alternatives, the section of the 650 Line that currently connects to the Truckee Substation would be removed. In this instance, the poles with existing distribution would remain in place and would be topped to a height of approximately 40 feet above ground surface to accommodate the remaining distribution underbuild. The extent to which alternatives would involve rerouting portions of the power lines to locations where transferring the underbuild to the newly rerouted line would not be feasible because of the need to maintain service to uses along the existing line varies by alternative and is described for each action alternative below and depicted in Exhibits 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, and 3-10.  SUBSTATION CONSTRUCTION METHODS To accommodate the upgrade to 120 kV, modification or reconstruction of the existing substations would be required. All of the proposed modifications would take place within CalPeco-owned parcels. Existing facilities not proposed for major changes—Squaw Valley Substation, North Truckee Substation, and the Northstar Substation—would not require extensive site grading or excavation. Construction activities at the Tahoe City Substation would require more extensive excavation and the upgrade at the Kings Beach Substation would require the import of 5,000 CY of engineered fill to build up the substation pad so it is level with the existing substation and grading.  Substation equipment would be removed by hand or by crane and recycled, reused, or disposed of at an appropriate landfill. Necessary equipment would include a crew truck, a small crane, a backhoe, a flatbed truck, and a dump truck. Foundations would be removed where they interfere with the installation, operation, or maintenance of the new equipment, and as necessary to meet land coverage requirements and in areas that are to be restored. Foundations would be dug up and larger slabs would be broken apart for loading into a dump truck to be hauled away. An auger would be used for excavations for deep footings, rather than a backhoe or excavator, to minimize soil removal. The volume of soil that would be excavated at each substation is as follows.  Squaw Valley Substation: Seven new footings totaling approximately 22 CY.  North Truckee Subtation: Five new footings totaling approximately 18 CY.  Northstar Substation: One new transformer and regulator oil containment basin (transformer and regulator footings are contained inside the basin) totaling approximately 140 CY.  Tahoe City Substation: 20 new footings, two transformer oil containment basins, and one switchgear building footing totaling approximately 400 CY.  Kings Beach Substation: 16 new footings, two transformer oil containment basins, and one switchgear building foundation totaling approximately 285 CY. Once excavations are complete, cranes or similar equipment would be used to install the new hardware. After installation of new equipment, it would be connected to the existing equipment and upgraded power lines. Because the substations are existing facilities (except for the Kings Beach Substation) with landscaping already in place, and all new equipment would be installed within the facilities’ existing outer fence lines and at similar heights to existing equipment, additional landscaping or landscape plans are not proposed. The proposed Kings Beach Substation is within a portion of the CalPeco-owned parcel next to the existing substation and diesel generating facility, which is fenced and not visible from nearby residential areas or public travelways. CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE AND EQUIPMENT During construction, up to 50 workers, one helicopter crew of five personnel, and five construction inspectors would be actively working at various locations along the project site. Additionally, between one and three environmental monitors would be working with the crews to monitor implementation of the project consistent with the project description and applicant proposed measures (APMS), and adherence to mitigation measures and any additional regulatory permit conditions. Environmental monitors would be independent auditors, and would report directly to the USFS, TRPA, or other agreed upon agency. In total, approximately 65 people are anticipated to be on the project at any one time during pole removal and installation. The specific number of personnel and construction equipment anticipated on site for each project component during peak construction conditions is shown in Appendix E, Construction Personnel and Equipment on Table E-1, Peak Construction Personnel. Table E-2, Typical Major Construction Equipment, also includes an estimated quantity for each equipment type and approximate duration of use for each project component. Table E-3, Access Road Construction Equipment, lists the types of equipment required to construct access roads.  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-7 Locations of Existing Distribution and Communication Underbuild  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-8 PEA Alternative - Locations Where Existing Poles Supporting Underbuild Would Remain (Topped Only)  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-9 Modified Alternative - Locations Where Existing Poles Supporting Underbuild Would Remain (Topped Only)  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-10 Road Focused Alternative - Locations Where Existing Poles Supporting Underbuild Would Remain (Topped Only) CLEAN-UP AND POST-CONSTRUCTION RESTORATION Surplus material, equipment, and construction debris would be removed at the completion of construction activities. All man-made construction debris would be removed and recycled or disposed of at permitted landfill sites, as appropriate. Cleared vegetation would either be chipped and stored on the ROW for later use during reclamation or disposed of off-site, depending on landowner and agency agreements and requirements. In some instances, agencies have historically requested that some wood poles be left on site for a specific purpose such as raptor perching and nesting, trail alignment borders, or for erosion control in areas of steep terrain. If this occurs, CalPeco will comply with the requests. Areas of temporary disturbance around each pole, as well as areas used for conductor stringing and staging, would be restored to preconstruction conditions, to the extent feasible, following construction. This would include returning areas to their original contours and reseeding in accordance with USFS guidelines, USACE guidelines, and/or prearranged landowner/manager/agency agreements and requirements. CalPeco would attempt to close or restrict vehicle access to areas that would not remain open to the public or that were seeded until the reclamation success criteria were achieved. Boulders removed during access would be redistributed over the ROW to resemble adjacent site conditions. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE Operations and maintenance of the action alternatives would be the same as under existing conditions (i.e., no change in baseline conditions), which would be equivalent to Alternative 5 (No Project/No Action Alternative). The CalPeco North Lake Tahoe District Office operations personnel would patrol the lines on an annual basis. Separately from these yearly patrols, CalPeco vegetation management staff would conduct an annual hazard tree inspection, in conjunction with a California Registered Forester. As needed, CalPeco operations staff would also patrol the lines in the event of unexplained outages or significant natural incidents, such as fire, flood, or electrical storms, to inspect and repair damage. Inspections would be conducted using helicopters, all-terrain vehicles, and/or line trucks. The typical inspections would involve a visual review of the line along a path that is roughly parallel to the centerline and along existing dirt access roads. Vegetation management activities would include tree and vegetation trimming or removal to maintain the 40-foot or 65-foot wide easement in accordance with CPUC General Order (GO) 95, Rule 35 and California Public Resources Code Section 4293. Hazard trees (i.e., dead, dying, diseased, decaying, or bug-infested trees) would also be removed as part of these vegetation management activities. In addition to the annual inspections, CalPeco operation and maintenance personnel would conduct pole-climbing inspections every five years. These inspections would include accessing each power pole site using four-wheel-drive vehicles on existing dirt access roads. CalPeco personnel would climb each pole to inspect the integrity and condition of the hardware and insulators. Quarterly inspections would be conducted for each substation to record operation counters in the breakers, transformers, and regulators, and to address discrepancies. The electrical line would be accessed via the centerline access routes established during construction. After completion of construction, the centerline access routes would be maintained in low growing vegetation that provides erosion control while allowing over-land vehicle travel by line trucks and inspection trucks (i.e., pickup trucks). Line trucks would access the power line ROW using the centerline access routes several times per year for routine maintenance, while inspection trucks would access the ROW one to two times per year. Vehicles would also travel on the centerline access routes as needed to perform repairs. If any of the existing access roads become impassable, CalPeco would contact the property owner prior to use or conducting any potential improvements.  3.3.2 ALTERNATIVE 1: PROPONENT’S ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT ALTERNATIVE 650 LINE Approximately 10 miles of the existing 650 Line would be rebuilt as part of this alternative, and two portions would be removed (parts of Segment 650-7 and Segment 650-1, described below).  REBUILD Segment 650-1 From the Kings Beach Substation, Segment 650-1 of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would run north, generally to the east of the residences off of Commonwealth Drive. The alignment would span over 0.5 mile to north of the Commonwealth Drive/Cantebury Lane intersection before turning west for just over 0.5 mile to SR 267. The line would then parallel the east side of SR 267.  Segment 650-2 The 650 Line would continue northwest for approximately 2 miles to cross the 625 Line near Brockway Summit.  Segment 650-3 The 650 Line would parallel the east side of SR 267 for approximately 4 miles from the existing and new 625 Line near Brockway Summit to south of the Truckee town limits. Segment 650-4 The line would turn south for approximately 0.25 mile and cross SR 267. Segment 650-4 would then trend west across the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area, crossing an approximately 40-acre NFS parcel managed by the USFS Tahoe National Forest, and continuing west through the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area for approximately 0.5 mile to intersect with the previously upgraded portion of the 650 Line (See Exhibit 3-4a, Segment 650-5).  REMOVAL Segment 650-1 The portion of Segment 650-1 that would be removed is located between the existing Kings Beach Substation and Brockway Substation. From the Kings Beach Substation, the segment trends in a generally southeast direction for approximately 0.2 mile, crosses Speckled Street, crosses Deer Street, and terminates at the Brockway Substation. This segment is configured with a distribution line underbuild, which would remain in place upon completion of the project. Segment 650-7 The portion of the 650 Line proposed for removal originates at the Truckee Substation and heads north, crossing over Trout Creek Road, Donner Pass Road, and East Keiser Avenue. The segment then turns east until intersecting with the existing 132 Line. This segment is approximately 0.2 mile long and is configured with a distribution line underbuild, which would remain in place upon completion of the project. 132 LINE  Segments 650-6 and 650-7 The portion of the 132 Line associated with this alternative extends from the North Truckee Substation to a recently upgraded portion of the 650 Line (shown as Segment 650-5 in Exhibit 3-4a), just south of SR 267 in Truckee. This section of the 132 Line would be rebuilt to accommodate a double-circuit with the 650 Line. The distribution underbuild associated with the existing 650 Line would be transferred to the new 132/650 Line double-circuit. Throughout Segment 650-7 (between the North Truckee Substation and the portion of the 650 Line to that would be removed), a second distribution circuit would be underbuilt. This distribution line would continue to the Truckee Substation. On the 132 Line, approximately 32 poles would be replaced and the line would be reconfigured to allow a double-circuit configuration with the 650 Line and operation at 120 kV.  625 LINE Implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would include reconductoring and rerouting the 625 Line with the objective that the new conductor would accommodate 120 kV. Implementation would require the removal of approximately 15 miles of conductor and 341 wooden poles associated with the existing 625 Line. The new 120 kV 625 Line would consist of approximately 16 miles of new conductor within a new 40-foot-wide permanent ROW (See Exhibit 3-4a). Segment 625-1 From the Tahoe City Substation, this route would follow the alignment of the existing 625 Line, heading southwest to parallel the south side of the Truckee River before turning northwest and spanning the river and SR 89.  Segment 625-2 The new 625 Line would turn to the north and continue through NFS lands managed by the USFS LTBMU for over 1 mile. The alignment would then turn west for approximately 0.5 mile and run adjacent to the southern border of Burton Creek State Park (with a portion of the 40-foot wide operations/maintenance/ access easement crossing over the park boundary).  Segments 625-3, 625-4, 625-5, 625-6, 625-7, and 625-8  The new 625 Line alignment would generally follow the route of the Fiberboard Freeway across lands managed by the USFS LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest for approximately 10 miles.  Segment 625-9 The line would turn east for approximately 2.25 miles and span SR 267 to connect to Lake Vista Road. Segment 625-10 The line would then turn south for approximately 1 mile, spanning an unpaved portion of Lake Vista Road. It would then turn southeast and span over 1,000 feet to connect to the Kings Beach Substation. 629 LINE The portion of the 629 Line from its intersection with the existing 625 Line to the Tahoe City Substation would be rebuilt with the double circuit configuration maintained. This double-circuit portion would be upgraded and reconductored as a result of this project. The angle poles would be replaced with single self-supporting steel poles (i.e., no guying). Once the remainder of the project has been completed and would be ready for operation at 120 kV, the 629 Line would have the capability to be operated in its entirety at 120 kV. UNDERBUILD Under this alternative, nearly all of the underbuild would be transferred to new power poles (Exhibit 3-7). The exception would be the portion of the 650 Line in the Town of Truckee connecting to the Truckee Substation and between the Kings Beach Substation and Brockway Substation site, where the poles and distribution underbuild would remain (as described above), all underbuild on the 625 and 650 Lines would be transferred to the new power poles. 3.3.3 ALTERNATIVE 2: MODIFIED ALTERNATIVE 650 LINE Approximately 8 miles of the existing 650 Line would be rebuilt from Segment 650-3 through Segment 650-7. The same two portions of the existing 650 Line would be removed as in Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Segment 625-9 and Segment 625-10 would be built as a double circuit of the 625 and 650 Line, with an approximate 4-mile length.  Segment 650-1 Replaced by Segment 625-10 D-C OH-3  Segment 650-1 would not be included in this alternative because this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 625 Line along the new alignment of the 625 Line. See the description below for Segment 625-10 D-C OH-3, below.  Segment 650-2 Replaced by Segment 625-9 D-C OH-4  Segment 650-2 would not be included in this alternative because this segment would be constructed as a double circuit with the 625 Line along the new alignment of the 625 Line. See the description for Segment 625-9 D-C OH-4, below.  Segment 650-3 This segment follows the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), above.  Segment 650-4A This segment alignment deviates from Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). The segment would be moved north to avoid sensitive cultural resources areas in the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area. As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this segment would connect to the existing upgraded portion of the 650 Line. Segments 650-5, 650-6 and 650-7 These segments follow the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), discussed above.  132 LINE  Segments 650-6 and 650-7 These segments follow the same alignment and have the same characteristics as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), discussed above.  625 LINE As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) includes reconductoring and rerouting the 625 Line with the objective that the new conductor could accommodate 120 kV. Approximately 15 miles of conductor and 341 wooden poles would be removed. The new 120 kV 625 Line would consist of approximately 12 miles of new conductor on a single circuit (Segment 625-1A through Segment 625-8), and approximately 4 miles of new conductor on a double circuit with the 650 Line (Segment 625-9 and 625-10). The single circuit line would be within a new 40-foot-wide permanent ROW, and the double circuit line would be in a 65-foot-wide permanent ROW (See Exhibit 3-4b). Segment 625-1A This segment would cross the Truckee River at a different location than Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would move this segment of the line to the opposite side of a stand of trees along the river and farther from the viewshed of the Truckee River corridor. As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the line would terminate at the Tahoe City Substation.  Segments 625-2 and 625-3 These segments follow the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), above.  Segment 625-4 This segment alignment would be moved upslope of the Fiberboard Freeway as compared to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) to reduce visibility of the line from panoramic views seen by recreational users along the road. Segment 625-5 This segment would follow the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), described above. Segment 625-6A This segment would be oriented farther east than the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) alignment. The segment would follow Mt. Watson Road along the outer edge of an existing Goshawk PAC to avoid this sensitive biological resources area. Segment 625-7 This segment would follow the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), described above.  Segment 625-8A This segment would deviate from the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) alignment, following the existing 625 Line route more closely in order to utilize some portion of the existing line where it could be at a distance from the Fiberboard Freeway (a recreational use road where no utility lines are currently located) and to place the line outside the boundary of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Segment 625-9 D-C OH-4 This segment would follow the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) for Segment 625-9. However, under this alternative, this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 650 Line, eliminating Segment 650-2 from this alternative. (Note: The use of “D-C” in this and other segment titles indicates a “double circuit” option and the “OH” stands for an “overhead” line.) Segment 625-10 D-C OH-3 This segment follows the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) for Segment 625-10. However, under this alternative, this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 650 Line, eliminating Segment 650-1 from this alternative. 629 LINE The 629 line would be rebuilt in the same manner as described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative).  UNDERBUILD Similar to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this Modified Alternative would transfer most of the underbuild to the new power lines (Exhibit 3-8). Of the action alternatives, this alternative would have the greatest number of existing poles that would remain in place to support existing underbuild. As with the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the poles and distribution underbuild along the portion of the 650 Line in the Town of Truckee connecting to the Truckee Substation and between the Kings Beach Substation and Brockway Substation site would remain with Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). The majority of the underbuild on poles in the Martis Creek Lake Recreation Area would be transferred to the new poles; two or three of the existing poles in this area would be topped and remain in place creating a lateral to feed the existing pump house at the Northstar Golf Course.  The most important difference between this Modified Alternative and the other action alternatives relates to the stretch of the 650 Line within the Lake Tahoe Basin. This Modified Alternative proposes a double-circuit line extending along the existing 625 Line route between Kings Beach and the Brockway Summit, which would result in removal of the power line along SR 267. However, the existing poles along SR 267 leading up to a point just north of Stewart Way would be topped to a height of approximately 40 feet and would remain in place to continue providing electrical distribution and communication service to existing development.  3.3.4 ALTERNATIVE 3: ROAD FOCUSED ALTERNATIVE 650 LINE Approximately 9 miles of the existing 650 Line would be rebuilt from Segment 650-3 through Segment 650-7. The same two portions of the existing 650 Line would be removed as in the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and the Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). Segment 650-1 and Segment 650-2 would be built as a double circuit of the 625 and 650 Lines, with a length of approximately 3 miles.  Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1  This segment follows the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) for Segment 650-1. However, under this alternative, this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 625 Line, eliminating Segment 625-10 from this alternative. Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1A (Alternative 3A) Under Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option), Segment 650-1 would deviate from the alignment of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) to instead follow along SR 267. The double-circuit option would realign the power line along SR 267 to Speckled Street and then along Speckled Street. With this subalternative (Exhibit 3-10, inset map), the existing, unrelated distribution and communication lines that run along SR 267 in Kings Beach, between Commonwealth Drive and Speckled Street and between Speckled Street and Deer Street, would be transferred to the double circuit poles to the extent feasible. It is expected that most, if not all, of these poles could be removed. Some poles may be associated with service drops or communication taps, in which case specific poles may need to remain in place. Similarly, with this option existing underbuild on the stretch of the 650 Line leading away from SR 267 and to the Kings Beach Substation would remain (Exhibit 3-9, inset map) and the poles would be topped to a height of about 40 feet above ground surface. Segment 650-2 D-C OH-2  This segment follows the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) for Segment 650-2. However, under this alternative, this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 625 Line, eliminating Segment 625-9 from this alternative.  Segment 650-3 This segment follows the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), above.  Segments 650-4B and 650-5 This segment would deviate from Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). This alternative would use Alignment 650-4B along SR 267, Schaffer Mill Road, and a small segment of existing dirt road to connect to the existing, previously upgraded portion of the 650 Line (i.e., Segment 650-5). This alternative would connect to the middle of Segment 650-5 rather than at the southern terminus, making much of the southern portion of the previously upgraded line in Segment 650-5 no longer necessary. This alternative would not include removal of the southern portion of the existing upgraded line in Segment 650-5. At this time, it is assumed that the line would remain in place after project completion. Segments 650-6 and 650-7 These segments follow the same alignment and would have the same characteristics as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), above.  132 LINE  Segments 650-6 and 650-7 These segments follow the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), above.  625 LINE As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) includes reconductoring and rerouting the 625 Line with the objective that the new conductor could accommodate 120 kV. Implementation would require the removal of approximately 15 miles of conductor and 341 wooden poles associated with the existing 625 Line. The new 120 kV 625 Line would consist of approximately 13 miles of new conductor on a single circuit (Segment 625-1 through Segment 625-8), and approximately 3 miles of new conductor on a double circuit with the 650 Line (Segments 650-1 D-C OH-1/1A and 650-2 D-C OH-2). The single circuit line would be within a new 40-foot-wide permanent ROW, and the double circuit line would be in a 65-foot-wide permanent ROW. Project components associated with the 625 Line are intended to increase access for construction and maintenance activities (See Exhibit 3-4c). Segment 625-1 This segment follows the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), above.  Segment 625-2  This segment follows the same alignment as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), above.  Segments 625-3, 625-5, 625-6, 625-6, 625-7, and 625-8 These segments would deviate from the alignments for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) to follow the Fiberboard Freeway along the entire route.  Segment 625-9 Replaced by Segment 650-2 D-C OH-2 Segment 625-9 is not included in this alternative because this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 650 Line along the new alignment of the 650 Line. See the description for Segment 650-2 D-C OH-2, above. Segment 625-10 Replaced by Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1/1A Segment 625-10 is not included in this alternative because this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 650 Line along the new alignment of the 650 Line. See the description for Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1/1A, above. 629 LINE The 629 Line would be rebuilt in the same manner as described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative).  UNDERBUILD Similar to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this road focused alternative would transfer most of the underbuild to the new power poles (Exhibit 3-9). As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the poles and distribution underbuild along the portion of the 650 Line in the Town of Truckee connecting to the Truckee Substation, and between the Kings Beach Substation and Brockway Substation site would remain in place.  One important difference between the alternatives involves the stretch of the 650 Line that crosses the Martis Creek Lake Recreation Area. With this Road Focused Alternative, the power line would be rerouted along SR 267. In this case, the existing poles that cross Martis Creek Lake Recreation Area would remain in place to support the distribution and communication underbuild that exists today. Additionally, a short stretch of existing poles along the 625 Line just east of SR 267 at Brockway Summit would remain in place. In both instances, the poles would be topped to a height of approximately 40 feet above ground surface.  3.3.5 ALTERNATIVE 4: PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE 650 LINE Approximately 10 miles of the existing 650 Line would be rebuilt as part of this alternative, and two portions would be removed (i.e., Segments 650-7 and 650-1, described below) (See Exhibit 3-4d). REBUILD Segment 650-3 The line would parallel the east side of SR 267 for approximately 4 miles from the existing and new 625 Line near Brockway Summit to south of the Truckee town limits. Segment 650-4 The line would turn south for approximately 0.25 mile and cross SR 267. The Proposed Alternative would then trend west across the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area, crossing an approximately 40-acre NFS parcel managed by the USFS Tahoe National Forest, and continue west through the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area for approximately 0.5 mile to intersect with the previously upgraded portion of the 650 Line (Segment 650-5).  REMOVAL Segment 650-1 The portion of Segment 650-1 that would be removed is located between the existing Kings Beach Substation and Brockway Substation. From the Kings Beach Substation, the segment trends in a generally southeast direction for approximately 0.2 mile, crosses Speckled Street, crosses Deer Street, and terminates at the Brockway Substation. This segment is configured with a distribution line underbuild that would remain in place upon completion of the project. Segment 650-7 The portion of the 650 Line proposed for removal originates at the Truckee Substation and heads north, crossing over Trout Creek Road, Donner Pass Road, and East Keiser Avenue. The segment then turns east until its intersection with the existing 132 Line. This segment is approximately 0.2 mile long and is configured with a distribution line underbuild, which would remain in place upon completion of the project. 132 LINE  Segments 650-6 and 650-7 The portion of the 132 Line associated with this alternative extends from the North Truckee Substation to a recently upgraded portion of the 650 Line (shown as Segment 650-5 in Exhibit 3-4d) just south of SR 267 in Truckee. This section of the 132 Line would be rebuilt to accommodate a double-circuit with the 650 Line. The distribution underbuild associated with the existing 650 Line would be transferred to the new 132/650 Line double-circuit. A second distribution line would be underbuilt between the North Truckee Substation and the Truckee Substation. On the 132 Line, approximately 32 poles would be replaced and the line would be reconfigured to allow a double-circuit configuration with the 650 Line and operation at 120 kV. 625 LINE To achieve 120 kV, Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would include reconductoring and rerouting the 625 line. The existing 15 miles of conductor would be replaced with approximately 13 miles of new conductor on a single circuit (Segment 625-1 through Segment 625-8), and approximately 3 miles of new conductor on a double circuit with the 650 Line (Segments 650-1 D-C OH-1/1A and 650-2 D-C OH-2) (See Exhibit 3-4d). Segment 625-1 This segment follows the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), above.  Segment 625-2  This segment follows the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), and Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative).  Segments 625-3, 625-5, 625-6, 625-6, 625-7, and 625-8 These segments would follow the Fiberboard Freeway along the entire route, as described above for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative).  Segment 625-9 Replaced by Segment 650-2 D-C OH-2 Segment 625-9 is not included in this alternative because this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 650 Line.  Segment 625-10 Replaced by Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1/1A Segment 625-10 is not included in this alternative because this segment would be built as a double circuit with the 650 Line.  629 LINE The 629 Line would be rebuilt in the same manner as described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative).  UNDERBUILD Similar to the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the Proposed Alternative would transfer most of the underbuild to the new power poles (Exhibit 3-11). In Tahoe City, between the Tahoe City Substation and the Truckee River crossing, the existing underbuild would be transferred to new poles. The existing underbuild would also be transferred along the 650 Line between Kings Beach and Martis Valley (segments 650-1 to 650-4). On the 625 Line, approximately three poles immediately east of the 650 Line would be topped to continue to support underbuild. Poles would also be topped and left in place to support underbuild between the Truckee Substation and Segment 650-7. 3.3.6 COMMON PROCESSES OF THE ACTION ALTERNATIVES PHASING AND SCHEDULE The proposed project would be constructed in three phases over five construction seasons between 2013 and 2019. Rebuild and upgrade of the 650 Line, which would include the Northstar Fold, would be completed in the first phase. This is the most critical project component, and is planned to be in service prior to the 2014 season peak in December. The second phase would occur in 2016 and would consist of substation upgrades. Upgrade of the 625 Line and additional modifications to the substations would occur in the third phase. After completion of this phase, the entire North Lake Tahoe Transmission System would operate at 120 kV. The third phase is planned for construction in 2018 and 2019; however, implementation would be based on peak demand and could begin sooner. The annual construction season in the project area is generally May through November, weather permitting. The project is anticipated to result in a total of 14 months of activity spread over a five year period. Outside of the general construction season, limited activities could occur, including maintenance and inspection of erosion control measures and other BMPs, material deliveries to staging areas, vegetation management, and staging area maintenance.  PHASE 1: 650 LINE REBUILD Phase 1 would include rebuilding/reconductoring the 650 Line, 132/650 Line double-circuit, and upgrading the structures and conductor to 120 kV capacity from Truckee to Northstar, and Northstar to Kings Beach. Phase 1 would also involve rebuilding the existing 60 kV Northstar Tap into a line fold tying into the existing terminals, and the installation of a transfer trip on the 609 Line and the installation of capacitor banks at the Northstar Substation to address the immediate issue of low-voltage conditions. The 650 Line would continue to operate at 60 kV until the second phase is completed. This phase is the most critical for system reliability and construction of elements of this phase could begin as early as fall of 2013 (if all agency approvals have been achieved) with the improvements completed and in operation in 2014. PHASE 2: UPGRADE THE 650 LINE TERMINATIONS TO 120 KV OPERATION Phase 2 would include improvements to the North Truckee, Northstar, and Kings Beach substations. This phase would also include the decommissioning the Brockway Substation with re-routing of the 14.4 kV distribution feeders to the Kings Beach Substation. Construction of this phase is proposed for 2016 and, once completed, would allow the applicant to operate the 650 Line at 120 kV. PHASE 3: 625 LINE RECONDUCTOR AND RELOCATION Phase 3 would involve the rebuild of the 625 Line and improvements to complete the 120 kV loop. Phase 3 would include improvements to the Tahoe City, Kings Beach, and Squaw Valley substations. Completion of Phase 3 would allow for the entire loop to operate at 120 kV, including the 629 Line between Truckee and Tahoe City that has previously been upgraded with 120 kV facilities. The construction of this final phase is planned to begin in 2018, with completion and operation anticipated for the following year, but construction could commence sooner based on need.  Source: Data received from TriSage 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 3-11 Proposed Alternative - Locations Where Existing Poles Supporting Underbuild Would Remain (Topped Only) CONSTRUCTION HOURS Construction hours would generally be between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., six days per week, with adjustments made to respond to applicable local agency noise control requirements. As further described in Table 3-8, Applicant Proposed Measures (at the end of this section), NOI-4, construction activities would occur during the times established by local ordinances, with the exception of certain activities where nighttime construction would be necessary, such as delivery of substation transformers, filling of substation transformers, and pulling of the conductor across major roadways (including I-80) which must occur during off-peak hours in accordance with agency requirements. In Placer County, allowable construction hours are 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. In the Town of Truckee, allowable construction hours are 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Sunday. TRPA identifies allowable construction hours as 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. seven days a week. The applicant may obtain waivers from local agencies to work outside of these limitations if necessary. TEMPORARY WORK AREAS Power line construction would require the use of various temporary work areas. For example, construction at the Tahoe City Substation would require a temporary work area outside of the existing fence line on an adjacent USFS-owned parcel. Staging areas would be considered temporary work areas, as well as work areas at road crossings, both of which have been described previously. During pole installation, each angle pole would require an approximately 0.5-acre work area measuring approximately 65 feet by 335 feet and each tangent pole would require an approximately 0.25-acre work area measuring approximately 65 feet by 170 feet. Pole work areas would typically be accessed by truck using existing access roads or new spur roads and the power line ROW. In areas where the terrain is too rugged for truck access, crews would use all-terrain vehicles or would hike in by foot to access the pole sites. An additional temporary work area may be required in instances where guy wire anchors would be installed outside of the temporary ROW. In these instances, a work area up to 15 feet wide and 50 feet long, extending from the ROW to the anchor location, would be established to provide access for the construction equipment and crew. Some vegetation removal and grading may be required at various temporary work areas to accommodate equipment and materials, and to provide level areas to help ensure safe equipment operation. Where topsoil is present, it would be salvaged from areas to be graded whenever possible. Following construction, each temporary work site would be restored to preconstruction conditions to the extent practical, and revegetated.  EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL AND POLLUTION PREVENTION A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) would be prepared and implemented as part of the project. This plan would detail the BMPs that would be implemented to minimize erosion, reduce sediment transport, and control stormwater flow from the project area. In addition, the SWPPP would generally describe the terrain type and slope at temporary construction areas, and would address grading and slope stabilization methods, as well as construction waste disposal methods.  DUST SUPPRESSION Pre-construction activities would include vegetation clearing, and access and spur road construction. Water application would be required for dust abatement to work areas and unpaved access and spur roads. The volume of water required for dust abatement over the five season construction window is estimated to be 8,016,000 gallons (Sierra Pacific 2010: pp. 4.8-21). Water required for project construction would likely be obtained from the various utilities serving the region, including North Tahoe PUD, Tahoe City PUD, Northstar CSD, and Truckee Donner PUD. Non-potable water would be obtained through permit(s), metered, and extracted from designated wells or existing hydrants in the public ROW. VEGETATION CLEARING  BRUSH CLEARING To prepare the ROW and work areas for construction activities, existing native vegetation would need to be cleared. All treatment on state and privately owned lands would be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Forest Practice Rules Chapter 4 Article 7 “Hazard Reduction” for the “North Forest District” outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin and for the “Southern Forest High Use Subdistrict” within the basin. Mowers, excavators, front-end loaders, and bulldozers would be used. During clearing activities, vegetation would be mowed or grubbed, leaving root systems intact wherever possible to encourage resprouting and minimize erosion. Where it would not impede construction, a post-treatment residual vegetative cover consisting of a mosaic of live brush, grasses, and forbs would be retained throughout the ROW. For ground-based construction, cleared vegetation may either be removed or chipped and spread onsite. Where sensitive resource limitations do not exist, all slash (woody debris remaining after tree removal) generated from the creation of new ROWs, staging areas, roads, and pulling sites would be removed for utilization off-site. A minor component of biomass chips may be utilized on site for soil stabilization. Brush and shrubs that must be removed would be placed at the edge of the ROW or moved to an approved staging area. During reclamation activities, salvaged brush could be respread in disturbed areas after seeding to encourage revegetation, where approved by landowner and agency agreements.  All vegetation removal would be conducted in a manner consistent with USFS and CalFire standards. Residual post-treatment surface fuel loads left onsite would be maintained at levels equal to or less than 10 tons per acre for areas outside of sensitive environment zones (SEZs). Within SEZs or PACs, residual post treatment surface fuel loads would be treated by hand work to not exceed levels of 15 tons per acre. Where chip material must be left onsite, chip depth would not exceed 4 inches and would be evenly dispersed across the forest floor. This activity would be limited to areas where activity fuels are lightly distributed across the landscape and retention activity fuels do no exceed the tons per acre standards for acceptable fuel loading. Slash depth from lop and scatter activities would not exceed 18 inches in height and would be spread on a non-contiguous manner not exceeding fuel load specifications. Where feasible, all harvest slash material located within 150 feet of a high public use and travel areas would be removed. Chip material would not be left within SEZs. TREE REMOVAL Due to the importance of maintaining electric reliability on key system lines, regulatory standards for tree trimming and removal are greater on double circuit electrical lines than on single circuit lines. Timber removal would be required to gain access to the project footprint during construction and to maintain system reliability during operation. The number of trees (over 1 inch diameter at breast height) that would require removal would vary between 42,494 for Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option) and 55,188 for the PEA Alternative (refer to Section 4.3, Forestry Resources, for a detailed assessment of tree removal). Consistent with state-mandated vegetation management requirements for conductor clearance, the action alternatives would include:  removal of all branches that overhang the electrical conductors;   removal of all trees within the 40-foot ROW for the single circuit segments, and within the 65-foot ROW for the double circuit segments; and  removal of hazard trees (e.g., severely damaged or diseased trees, or dead trees) outside the 40-foot or 65-foot ROW but within a 150-foot buffer of the project centerline that could damage the conductor if they were to fall into the ROW. Where hazard trees are located outside of the temporary ROW, additional workspace would be required to access the tree removal locations. A Timberland Conversion Permit would not be required for the area between the ROW and the 150-foot buffer because this area would remain forested. Slash from hazard trees would be either processed at a landing if a whole tree yarding is possible or lopped and scattered on site per the California Forest Practice Rules, USFS specifications, and the TRPA Code of Ordinances. The Hazard Tree Guidance for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific Southwest Region would be used as the standard for hazard tree identification.  All hazard tree removal and vegetation fuels management would be completed prior to the start of any on-the-ground construction activities. Timber would be harvested via tractor or helicopter. Helicopters would only be used where ground-based operations would not meet the requirements of TRPA and USFS disturbance regulations. Ground-based log skidding (haul by dragging) would be focused within the designated ROW, and would use the roads and other infrastructure identified in this EIS/EIS/EIR to the maximum extend feasible.  Trees removed from the ROW and hazard trees would be felled and delimbed, skidded to the nearest access road, and loaded onto trailers for further processing (reduced in size or chipped) at the nearest staging area where log processing is established. Trees removed from areas without suitable road access could be transported by helicopter to a processing/landing area.  Chain-saws and other mechanized tree clearing equipment would be used to fell and delimb trees. Log loaders, log trailers, chippers, and chip vans would be used to transport and process cleared trees. Excess slash would be chipped and either stored on the ROW to be re-spread during reclamation, or blown into trucks where it would be transported to an appropriate facility, such as a cogeneration plant (if a local plant is operational at the time of tree clearing) or landfill, or made available for an appropriate use. Wood chips could be spread out in disturbed areas for erosion control purposes to a maximum depth of 3 inches. All tree removal activities on USFS-managed land, including the felling and skidding of trees, would be performed in accordance with a Timber Sale Contract to be established with the USFS. This contract would include details about the tree removal activities, including which trees would be removed, the price paid for the trees, and the timeframe for the forestry activities. Tree removal on USFS land would be coordinated with any ongoing fuels management projects. Logs removed from federal land would be kept separate from those removed from private lands. All relevant Occupational Health and Safety Administration requirements would be adhered to during timber removal. Where public recreation trails are within clearance areas, temporary trail or recreation area closures would be required during active timber operations to maintain public safety. Public notice would be given prior to closure of trail heads, and signage would include specific locations of trail closures. Active onsite patrols would be employed to restrict unauthorized public access during active timber operations. It is expected that these restrictions would only be in place for one day per specific crossing location. Weekends and holidays would be avoided, and there could be restricted hours of timber harvest to accommodate recreation. Helicopter flight paths may also follow these restrictions, depending on proximity to trails or recreational use areas.  ROAD DECOMMISSIONING To optimize the network of forest roads, the USFS LTBMU reviews proposed projects in the context of the existing roadway network and to identify appropriate response actions (including constructing, reconstructing, or decommissioning roads). Since the action alternatives would result in the relocation of portions of the 625 Line and 650 Line, it may be appropriate to decommission USFS roads no longer necessary for access. Decommissioning would likely include decompaction to a depth of 10-inches with winged rippers or a subsoiler. Once this is completed, the area would be covered with 2 to 4 inches of native mulch or wood chips. Other options for decommissioning would include blocking road access throughout the length of the decommissioned segment with rocks and logs, placing materials in clumps and at irregular spacing and burying rocks out to the widest dimension for natural appearance. Road intersections may also be disguised, and recontouring may be completed where roads intersect to prevent user-created roads from developing. Decommissioning roads would generally reduce the net increase in access way mileage and land coverage; however, since the particulars of which roads would be determined at a later date by the USFS, the potential benefits of roadway decommissioning are not included in this analysis. The roads proposed for closure under each of the action alternatives are provided in Appendix F.  NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE 3.43.4.1 ALTERNATIVE 5: NO ACTION/NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE As discussed above, in Section 2.1, NEPA, TRPA, and CEQA Requirements, NEPA and CEQA regulations require analysis of a no action alternative (CFR 1502.14[d]) and a no project alternative (California Code of Regulations Section 15126.6[e]), respectively. While NEPA requires that the no action alternative is analyzed at a comparable level to the proposed project, CEQA only requires a discussion of reasonably foreseeable consequences of not approving the project. This document analyzes Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), at an equal level of detail to the action alternatives. Chapter 4, Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences, and Mitigation Measures provides an analysis of the environmental impacts resulting from not approving an action alternative (i.e., implementing the No Action/No Project Alternative).  Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), CalPeco would be forced to implement a load shedding plan to address events when the system reaches a stressed condition. In this scenario, lines would be operated close to or above their ratings, which would put the line conductor at high risk of annealing (excessive heating and cooling of a conductor that results in decreased tensile strength). The Kings Beach Diesel Generators would be used when needed, but because the permit for the generators limits the total number of operating hours each year, use would have to be judicious so that hours could be retained throughout the year to ensure sufficient operation during emergency scenarios throughout the year and into the heavy snow periods. To avoid risk of fire resulting from the overheated lines, additional vegetation management would be conducted. This would be evaluated based on the surrounding area and density of trees, but most likely clearing outside of the ROW would be necessary. Additionally, each pole would be evaluated and any compromised poles would be replaced. All of this would be completed under the existing ROW, permits, and easement agreements with no additional environmental study. Due to the remote locations of several segments of the 625 Line, roadway access could be bladed into the areas during emergency outages. CalPeco would also seek additional wider easements to allow for a safer vegetation management to address the anticipated overstressed/overheated operation of the conductor.  POWER LINES Under Alternative 5 (No Project/No Action Alternative), additional inspections and maintenance may be needed along the line routes due to the stressed operation of the conductor. Damaged conductor would be replaced as necessary and could likely result in pole replacements as overheated conductor can damage multiple aspects of the poles, equipment, hardware and conductor. This would be completed in addition to the normal inspection and maintenance that would occur, as described above for the action alternatives. In addition, these lines would immediately be investigated upon project denial, and all poles that are compromised would be replaced. Additionally, a new Timber Harvest Plan would be developed to address the vegetation management requirements associated with the risk of fire during normal operations. This would include all necessary roadway access to be completed to support the on-going operation of the existing lines. Supplemental risk assessments would be conducted on approximately a 10 year rotation. All additional work would be completed under an emergency scenario to minimize, among other issues, risk of line arcing (the flow of electricity through the air from one conductor to another, often as a result of snow bending tree branches near the power line, a voltage surge due to lightening, or sagging lines as a result of heavy electrical loads or warm weather) or annealing. The USFS would be notified of the critical operation of the lines and the additional fire risk resulting from the high temperature operation. While the work would originally be completed within the existing ROW, CalPeco could seek additional ROW to allow for further tree/vegetation management to help reduce the increased risk of fire from the overheated line operation.  SUBSTATIONS CalPeco crews maintain a minimum quarterly inspection schedule of each substation within CalPeco’s service territory. During these inspections the crews record all operation counters in the breakers, transformers, and regulators. The inspectors also record any discrepancies such as broken insulators, oil leaks, and gate or fence disrepair. Significant discrepancies are fixed immediately and less significant discrepancies are scheduled for repair on a case-by-case basis. Under Alternative 5 (No Project/No Action Alternative), these inspections would likely be stepped up to monthly or weekly to allow for monitoring of the at-risk parameters. The substation controls are operated remotely from an Electric Systems Control Center. The substation circuit breakers can also be manually opened or closed by troublemen (CalPeco employees who patrol, repair, and restore service or report the nature of the trouble found on electrical lines, and inspect and operate automatic substation equipment) at the substations, as needed. Under Alternative 5 (No Project/No Action Alternative), the operational personnel would have the load shedding scheme available for implementation, if needed.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NO PROJECT/NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE Under Alternative 5 (No Project/No Action Alternative), the north Tahoe area could experience two different operating scenarios. In the event of mild weather and no line outages, the system could perform in its current normal state. However, in the event of winter weather and a critical line outage, the North Tahoe area could experience load shedding. During such an event, the risks to the community include traffic signal outages, risk to life support equipment in residences, and loss of power to residences and business (which could result in revenue loss). Depending on the level of the load shedding, there could be impacts to sewage management facilities, water service, and fire suppression sources. Additionally, line loadings would increase annually and, as the lines are operated to their limit, the associated operating temperature of the lines would increase and pose both annealing and arching concerns. In either case, the risk of fire to USFS area is increased.  Another risk with Alternative 5 (No Project/No Action Alternative) is a potential indirect effect in response to the level of outages. The purchase of stand-alone generators for residences and businesses to provide power during extended outages could increase. This could result in the increase use of fossil fuels, and, similarly, an increase in wood stove and fire burning.   ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED FROM 3.5DETAILED EVALUATION 3.5.1 REGULATORY BACKGROUND NEPA, the TRPA Compact, and CEQA all require that alternatives be evaluated in this EIS/EIS/EIR; however, not every possible alternative or option for project implementation need be fully examined. Issues related to practicality, feasibility, and ability to meet project objectives may result in an alternative being eliminated from detailed evaluation.  In accordance with Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing NEPA Section 40 CFR 1501.2(c), the USFS must study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources as provided by Section 102(2)(E) of NEPA. Specifically, Section 1502.14 requires that an EIS examine all reasonable alternatives to the proposed action and briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating considered alternatives. Reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint. An alternative should also meet the purpose and need, and address one or more significant issues related to the proposed action. Since an alternative may be developed to address more than one significant issue, no specific number of alternatives is required or prescribed (36 CFR 220.5(e)).  Environmental Impact Statements are addressed in Article VII of the TRPA Compact, which requires that TRPA prepare and consider a detailed EIS before deciding to approve or carry out a project. The EIS must study, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to the recommended courses of action for any project that involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative use of available resources. Guidance is not provided regarding a specific number of alternatives to consider or the evaluation of the reasonableness or feasibility of alternatives. CEQA Guidelines (Section 15126.6 (a-c)) state that an EIR shall describe a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project even if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly. Any alternatives that were considered by the lead agencies, but were rejected during the planning or scoping process should also be identified and the reasons underlying the lead agency’s determination should be briefly explained. 3.5.2 ALTERNATIVES SCREENING METHODOLOGY Numerous alternative methods to implementing the proposed project (including specific input on project activities in a particular area) were suggested during the scoping period. Other alternatives were presented by Sierra Pacific Power Company (the original applicant) in its PEA, or considered by the EIR/EIS/EIS team (i.e., lead agencies, applicant, and consultants) as the draft document was being prepared. Many of these suggestions, alternatives, or elements of alternatives (collectively referred to as “alternatives” in the remainder of this section), are incorporated into the action alternatives described above. However, several alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for detailed evaluation in this EIS/EIS/EIR. To assess the proper approach for addressing each alternative, the description of each alternative was clarified to allow a meaningful comparative analysis, then they were evaluated using each Lead Agency’s criteria, and a finding of suitability for full analysis in the EIS/EIS/EIR was made. Alternatives that did not meet the selection criteria were removed from further analysis.  To comply with NEPA/CEQA requirements, each alternative that has been suggested or developed for this project has been evaluated against the following three criteria:  Does the alternative meet the project purpose and need/objectives?  Is the alternative feasible (i.e., legal, regulatory, technical)?  Does the alternative avoid or substantially lessen any significant effects of the proposed project (including consideration of whether the alternative itself could create significant effects potentially greater than those of the proposed project)? These criteria are described in more detail below. In total, the alternatives screening process culminated in the identification and screening of 16 potential alternatives for the proposed project, the four action alternatives described above, and 12 additional alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed evaluation (described below). These alternatives range from a different substation location and power line alignments and designs, to various expansions of existing system options, as well as a “non-wires alternatives.” “Non-wires alternatives” include methods of meeting project objectives that do not require major electrical lines (e.g., development of renewable energy supplies, conservation and demand side management to reduce electrical usage and prevent the need for facility upgrades).  CONSISTENCY WITH PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED/OBJECTIVES For purposes of NEPA, an alternative should meet the purpose and need and address one or more significant issues related to the proposed action. State CEQA Guidelines require the consideration of alternatives capable of eliminating or reducing significant environmental effects while feasibly attaining most of the project objectives, although an alternative may “impede to some degree the attainment of project objectives” (Section 15126.6 (a) and (b)). Therefore, it is not required that each alternative meet all of the applicant’s objectives. The purpose and need/objectives of the project used for the alternatives screening are the same as those listed in Chapter 2, Purpose and Need:  provide normal capacity for current and projected loads,  provide reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages,  reduce dependence on the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station,  reduce the risk of fire hazards and outage durations associated with wooden poles and encroaching vegetation, and  provide more reliable access to the 625 Line for operation and maintenance activities. FEASIBILITY Under NEPA, reasonable alternatives include those that are practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint and using common sense, rather than simply desirable from the standpoint of the applicant. The CEQA Guidelines (Section 15364) define feasibility as being “capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social, and technological factors.” In addition, CEQA requires that the Lead Agency consider site suitability, economic viability, availability of infrastructure, general plan consistency, other regulatory limitations, jurisdictional boundaries, and applicant’s control over alternative sites in determining the range of alternatives to be evaluated (State CEQA Guidelines, Section15126.6(f)(1)).  For the screening analysis, the legal, technical, and regulatory feasibility of potential alternatives was assessed. An alternative was excluded from detailed analysis if a determination was made that there was anything about the alternative that would be infeasible on technical, legal, or regulatory grounds. For this analysis, these feasibility criteria were applied as follows.   Legal Feasibility: Does the alternative have the potential to affect lands that have legal protections that may prohibit or substantially limit the feasibility of permitting the project?  Regulatory Feasibility: Does the alternative have the potential to affect lands that have regulatory restrictions that may substantially limit the feasibility of, or permitting of, the project within a reasonable period of time?  Technical Feasibility: Is the alternative feasible from a technological perspective, considering available technology; the construction, operation, and maintenance or spacing requirements of multiple facilities using common ROW; and the sensitivity to common failure mechanisms (e.g., weather, tree fall) and ability to repair failures? While the screening analysis does include cost information where available, the analysis does not focus on relative economic factors or costs of the alternatives (as long as they are found to be economically feasible) since the State CEQA Guidelines require consideration of alternatives capable of eliminating or reducing significant environmental effects even though they may “impede to some degree the attainment of project objectives or would be more costly” (State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.6(b)). POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS Under NEPA, an alternative should address one or more significant issues related to the proposed action. Under CEQA, an alternative should have the potential to “avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project” to be fully considered in an EIR (State CEQA Guidelines, Section 15126.6(a)). If an alternative was identified that clearly would not provide potential overall environmental advantage as compared to the action alternatives receiving detailed review, it was eliminated from further consideration. At the screening stage, it is neither possible, nor legally required, that impacts of each potential project option be compared against the action alternatives with absolute certainty, nor is it necessary to quantify impacts for every alternative put through the screening process. However, it is possible to identify elements of an alternative that are likely to be the sources of impact and to relate them, to the extent possible, to similar impacts from the action alternatives. The following environmental issue areas where significant effects could occur as part of the action alternatives were used to determine whether an alternative met NEPA/CEQA guidance on avoiding and lessening significant environmental effects:  Scenic Resources;  Hydrology and Water Quality;  Biological Resources;  Heritage, Cultural, and Paleontological Resources;  Hazards and Hazardous Materials;  Air Quality; and  Noise. 3.5.3 RESULTS OF SCREENING Table 3-6 provides a composite list of the alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed evaluation, and the results of the screening analysis with respect to the criteria findings for consistency with project objectives, feasibility, and environmental effectiveness. A description of each of these alternatives is then provided with a discussion of the screening analysis and results.   Table 3-6 Summary of Screening Analysis for Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Evaluation  Alternative Title  Consistent with Project Purpose and Needs/Objectives  Feasibility  Potential to Eliminate Significant Environmental Effects  Alternative Eliminated from Detailed Evaluation  Legal  Regulatory  Technical  Rebuild Only the 650 Line at  120 kV  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Operate the 629 Line at 120 kV  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Rebuild the 625 Line along its Existing Route  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Reconductoring the 609 Line from Truckee to Squaw Valley  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Completing a Closed 120 kV Loop to the Incline Substation from Kings Beach Substation  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Utilizing Distribution Backup for Single-contingency Transmission Outages on the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  Utilizing Additional Diesel Generation to Provide Reliable Capacity for Transmission Outages  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Submarine Cable Alternative  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  Potential to reduce some significant effects while generating new or more severe significant effects  Yes  Installing Power Lines Underground  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Non-Wires Alternative – Demand Management Conservation  No  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  Yes  Utilizing Reactive Capacitance to Delay the Need for the Project  No  Yes  Yes  No  No  Yes  Relocate the Tahoe City Substation  No   Yes  Yes  Yes  No  Yes   ALTERNATIVES ELIMINATED FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION  Rebuild Only the 650 Line at 120 kV Description Rebuild only the 650 Line at a 120 kV capacity with new, larger conductor to be operated at 60 kV with the ability to use the increased capacity of the larger conductor to operate the line at 120 kV when more incremental capacity would be needed. The upgraded line would follow the route of the existing 650 Line, putting it in the same alignment as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). No improvements would be made to the 625 Line. The design, construction, operation, and maintenance activities described above under the 650 Line portion of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would be the same under this alternative.  Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. The overall environmental effects would be similar to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). However, neither the project objective of providing reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages nor the objective of reducing dependence on the Kings Beach Generation Station would be met. Based on system planning analysis, this alternative could provide a reliable capacity of 91 MVA, including use of the generators at Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station, until about 2019 when coincident peak is projected to exceed 91 MVA. The reliable system capacity is determined with one leg of the system out of service. The loss of the 132 Line would result in the 650 Line being overloaded and would require load shedding (i.e., rolling blackouts) even with the Kings Beach generators in operation. To avoid this situation, the remainder of the project, as proposed in the action alternatives, would be required to be in service in 2019. Therefore, from an environmental perspective, the spatial effects would be similar to the action alternatives but temporally they would occur over a longer period of time. However, this alternative would not provide adequate long term reliable capacity system-wide and was therefore dismissed from further evaluation because it would not meet the objectives of the project. Operate the 629 Line at 120 kV Description The 629 Line, which generally runs parallel to SR 89, comprises the southwest side of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System and was previously upgraded with large conductor to accommodate 120 kV but currently operates at 60kV. Under this alternative, the 629 Line would be operated at 120 kV to utilize the increased current capacity; however, the 625 Line and 650 Line would not be upgraded. Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. Under this alternative, the overall environmental effects would be less than the action alternatives because the 625 Line and 650 Line would not be upgraded. System planning analysis indicates that operating the 629 Line at 120 kV would provide a reliable capacity of 85 MVA, which would not meet current peak electrical needs. Without the ability of switching the full capacity of the 629 Line to the 625 and 650 Lines, this alternative would essentially provide an island of increased reliability in the system, and would not improve single contingency reliability.  A peak electrical demand situation occurred on December 30, 2012 in which the contingency that was of concern was the loss of the 629 Line. In the event of the 629 Line being lost during this peaking period, a critical situation would have occurred, potentially requiring load shedding. A loss of the 629 Line, on peak, could cause the current 650 Line to overload, and result in a situation where the applicant would have had to run the Kings Beach diesel generators as well as shed load. Even with implementation of this alternative, the loss of the 629 Line during peak loads (such as those experienced December 30, 2012) would still result in load shedding, even with Kings Beach diesel generators in operation and the 650 line operating at 120kV high. Therefore, neither the project objective of providing reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages, nor the objective of reducing dependence on the Kings Beach Generation Station would be met. This alternative was, therefore, dismissed from further evaluation because it would not meet the objectives of the project.  Rebuild the 625 Line along its Existing Route Description The existing 625 Line was originally routed in the early 1970s in a remote location which provided visual screening by intervening vegetation and topography. The line has many angle points and is difficult to access for inspection, maintenance, and repairs. The remoteness of the line and high numbers of angle points (which have a higher probability for failure) has proven problematic in terms of reliability (i.e., when the line fails, which is typically during weather events, it is difficult to access for emergency repairs).  Under this alternative the 625 Line would be rebuilt, typically following the existing alignment, but would deviate in some locations to allow straightening of the line to reduce the number of angle points. Where the new alignment would deviate from the existing ROW, tree removal to accommodate a 40 foot ROW and other construction related activities associated with installation of a new power line alignment would be required. In addition, where the existing ROW would continue to be used, widening of the 20 foot vegetation management corridor to 40-feet would be required to meet CPUC regulatory requirements under GO 95 for a 120 kV line.  Based on available USGS topographic maps and use of as many existing roadways as possible, the applicant designed a conceptual access way plan for this alternative which indicated that construction of approximately 18 miles of new access ways would be required. However, the extreme terrain would limit access in many places; so that overland vehicle access to the entire line would not be attained, even with the new access way system. Given the rough terrain, the installation of the new 625 Line (once the logging, vegetation removal, and access way building operations were complete) would be slower than normal, likely requiring a two season construction window.  Other than the distinctions described above, construction, design (except the modification to the original alignment and access ways), operation and maintenance activities described above under the 625 Line portion of Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would generally be the same under this alternative.  Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. This alternative would not meet the project objective of providing reliable overland vehicle access to the 625 Line for inspection, maintenance, and repairs because, as discussed above, the extreme terrain would limit overland vehicle access in many places even with the new access way system. Since full access would not be achievable, the reliability would not be addressed and, therefore, this project objective would not be met. Moreover, this alternative would not minimize environmental effects, but would cause impacts greater than those identified for the action alternatives primarily due to the need for more new access ways then the action alternatives. Specifically, this alternative would require approximately 18 miles of new access ways where the action alternatives would require between 4 and 16 miles of new access ways. Accordingly, because this alternative would not meet the project objectives and would not reduce environmental effects, it was eliminated from further review and consideration. Reconductoring the 609 Line from Truckee to Squaw Valley Description This alternative would include reconductoring the 609 Line, which parallels the 132 Line from Truckee to Squaw Valley and comprises the northwest side of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System, with larger conductors. While reconductoring the 609 Line would provide benefit to the overall system in the event of an outage on the 132 Line, it would not provide a benefit to the overall system in the event of an outage on the 629 Line because it would not provide a strong, reliable electricity source on the eastern side of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System which is also needed to increase the reliability of the overall system. Accordingly, upgrading the 625 and 650 Lines as described above under the action alternatives would still be required. Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. However, this alternative would result in greater environmental effects than the action alternatives and would not meet the project objectives and goals. It would include the additional construction activity of reconductoring the 609 Line. Increasing capacity of the 609 Line conductor would also require modification (i.e., installation of relay switches) within the fence lines of the substations associated with this line. Given that the construction effects associated with reconductoring the 609 Line would be greater than those associated with the action alternatives alone, this alternative was eliminated from further review and consideration. Additionally, this project does not address the reliability concern nor does it allow for better line access. Completing a Closed 120 kV Loop to the Incline Substation from Kings Beach Substation Description This alternative would include: (1) installation of a new 120 kV line to connect the Incline Substation (northeast of the project area/transmission system shown in Exhibit 3-2) to the Kings Beach Substation; (2) upgrade of the 650 Line to 120 kV, as described above for the action alternatives; and (3) continued operation of the 625 Line within its existing alignment at 60 kV with construction of approximately 18 miles of new access ways to address access issues as described above under the alternative considered but rejected entitled “Rebuild the 625 Line along its Existing Route.” This alternative would require the relocation of the California Substation phase shifter (in Truckee) to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company side of the North Truckee Substation, which would require modification and expansion to the California and North Truckee substations, respectively. Additionally, the 607 Line would have to be phase-shifted (power flow regulation by adjusting the angle at which the power is transmitted). A phase shifter would be required at the Truckee Substation for the 607 Line that connects the Truckee Substation to the Glenshire Substation (located east of Truckee and outside the project area shown in Exhibit 3-2).  Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective; however, this alternative would not meet the project objective of providing reliable overland vehicle access to the 625 Line for inspection, maintenance, and repairs; nor would it reduce potential environmental effects. In particular, as discussed above, under the alternatives considered but rejected entitled “Rebuild the 625 Line along its Existing Route,” full access to the 625 Line would not be achievable and the project objective of reliability would not be addressed. Moreover, this alternative would not minimize environmental effects and would cause impacts greater than those identified for the action alternatives, primarily due to the need for a new transmission line corridor between Incline and Kings Beach, potential expansion at the North Truckee and Truckee Substations to accommodate the required phase shifters, and more new access ways when compared to the action alternatives. Because this alternative would not meet the project objectives and would not reduce environmental effects, it was eliminated from further review and consideration. Utilizing Distribution Backup for Single-contingency Transmission Outages on the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System  Description This alternative would include installation of a 12 MVA transformer at the Truckee Substation along with a new distribution feeder line to the Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort. The intent would be to provide an alternative line to deliver power to the Northstar Substation, thereby decreasing demand on the 650 Line and allowing more capacity in the line to accept rerouted power during an outage elsewhere in the system. Improvements to the 650 Line included in the action alternatives would not be implemented under this alternative.  Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. However, this alternative would not meet the project objective of providing reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages. While this alternative would alleviate some of the load to the Northstar Substation by relieving the 650 Line in the event of an outage elsewhere in the system, it would not relieve sufficient load such that power could be transferred around the loop in the event of a single-contingency outage. In summary, the proposed enhancement of the distribution level infrastructure would not be sufficient to support the larger power line infrastructure during a single contingency outage. From an environmental perspective, effects would be reduced since modification to the system would be limited. However, because this alternative would not meet the project objective of assuring adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages, it was eliminated from further review and consideration. Utilizing Additional Diesel Generation to Provide Reliable Capacity for Transmission Outages  Description This alternative would include constructing one or more additional diesel generation stations outside the Lake Tahoe Basin to provide power during system failures. Any new diesel generation facilities would need to be located in the vicinity of a substation to allow power from the generators to be fed into the transmission system. Under this alternative, the issue of power line capacity during single or multiple contingency outages would still occur; that is, the existing 60 kV lines would still not be of sufficient size to reliably accept re-routed power if one or more other lines in the system were not operational. There would be greater flexibility in power sources, but the existing 60 kV lines would still limit delivery of that power to different parts of the system. Therefore, under this alternative the power line and substation upgrades associated with the action alternative would still be required. Note that an in Tahoe Basin scenario was also considered where a significant portion of the generation would need to be installed near an existing substation (i.e., Tahoe City or Kings Beach). Based on preliminary review, it was determined that this scenario would likely not be feasible from a regulatory perspective (i.e., air quality/stationary source emissions regulations). If some level of in basin diesel power generation were feasible (which is not likely given the current regulatory air controls), the allowable generation capacity or hours of operation would not be sufficient to meet the project objectives of providing reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages and reducing dependence on the Kings Beach Generation Station. The Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station is currently limited to 721 hours of annual operation. Although it is likely infeasible, it is reasonable to assume that new generation would have similar or potentially greater, limitations. Therefore, if there were a need for use of both the existing and new generation stations, after 1,442 hours of total use no back up would be available. Therefore this scenario was not considered further. Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. However, this alternative would result in greater environmental effects than the action alternatives and would not meet the project objectives and goals. Specifically, the environmental effects of the action alternatives would occur since the power lines and associated facilities would require upgrades; plus, increased environmental effects would occur from construction, operation, and maintenance of one or more additional diesel generation stations. Although the diesel generators would primarily be run during peak power demand periods or during outages of parts of the system, and they would meet more stringent Tier II emission standards, substantial adverse air quality impacts could as a result of operation. Increased noise impacts and fuel handling and storage would also be a concern. Therefore, even though this alternative would be feasible and meet project objectives, since it would not reduce environmental effects but would result in greater environmental effects, specifically increased operational effects related to air quality and noise, this alternative was eliminated from further review and consideration. Submarine Cable Alternative Description This alternative to the 625 Line rebuild would include installation of an approximately 10 mile long special water rated 120 kV submarine high voltage alternating current (HVAC) cable between the Kings Beach and Tahoe City Substations. This cable would be buried from the substations to the lake entrance points and would then be laid along the bottom of Lake Tahoe. Installation is estimated to require 25 cable splices to join segments of cable over the 10 mile route. Due to the required splicing of the cable, which would contribute to outage risk or failure to the 120 kV loop system, the existing 625 Line would need to remain in service with some additional substation modifications to allow for the existing 60 kV system to remain operational as a limited backup in the event of failure. Under this alternative the 650 Line would be upgraded consistent with one of the approaches in the action alternatives.  Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective. However, this alternative would not meet the project objective of providing reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages.  The following issues have been identified.   Reliability. Similar lines operating in the United States are primarily direct current (DC) current and generally not critical as single contingency outage lines. Utilities typically utilize high voltage (HV) DC cable in applications similar to this alternative where there is a submarine length requirement longer than 10 miles, and a voltage transmission above 60 kV. This is because HVDC cables are more efficient for long distance transmission than HVAC cables due to heat generation and power losses in the cable. The North Lake Tahoe Transmission System is an AC system with no ability to integrate DC conversion into the termination points of the submarine cable due to the required land and high cost. Given this, the submarine cable alternative evaluation was completed using HVAC.  Another technical constraint is the splicing of submarine cable. Splicing in general is not desirable because these locations are typically where failures occur. Due to the length of this alternative, approximately 25 splices would be required. Introducing this many points of potential failure causes operational and maintenance concerns. Additionally, in the event of failure, there is concern that the repair process (i.e., lifting the cable from the lake bottom) could impact the cable casing and adjacent splices and, in essence, create a weakened system with the potential for on-going “cascading” failure at the splice points. Technology does exist that would allow for the cable to be manufactured in one continuous length, which would eliminate the splicing concerns. This type of cable is cross-linked polyethylene cable, manufactured in Sweden, and is being used in the off shore wind generation and oil drilling industries. Essentially, as the cable is extruded, it is loaded onto ships for transport and installation. Transporting a 10 mile length of cable from Sweden to Lake Tahoe via ship would be impossible. Hence, using this technology was not given further consideration. To address this reliability concern, and to allow for switching in the event of failure, the existing 60 kV 625 Line would need to remain in service and the Tahoe City and Kings Beach substations would need to be expanded to accommodate the addition of 120/60 kV transformers.   Installation and repair. The HVAC cable is special water-rated cable that is manufactured oversees. It would be necessary to purchase the cable from a proven manufacturer that would provide a full warranty for an extended period of time. As such, that manufacturer would also be required to complete the installation and any maintenance or emergency repair. The installation of this cable is conducted utilizing a barge that is brought to the job site on trucks and assembled on site. In the case of the distribution submarine cable installed at Emerald Bay, that barge required three trucks with special permitting to allow travel into the Lake Tahoe area. For a three phase 120 kV installation, the cable manufacturer indicated that the required barge would be substantially larger. Further investigation would need to be conducted to establish the barge size requirements and transport needs, as well as the necessary permitting. Note that a similar barge would also be needed in the event of a cable failure in order to complete the repairs. Unlike the existing Emerald Bay Cable, which is a distribution line (14.4 kV),does not contain splices, and has contingency options, this alternative would likely require long repair times due the need for specialized work crews.  Cost. Preliminary cost estimates for the initial installation project costs of four to five times the other alternatives under consideration ($62 million versus $14 million for an overhead line). This is just for the cable installation and does not include any terminations, which would add substantially to the cost. It also does not include potentially expensive maintenance costs.  In addition, although construction of an upgraded 625 Line would not be required on land under this alternative, thus potentially avoiding or minimizing some significant environmental effects, installation of a submarine cable in Lake Tahoe could generate different or more severe water quality, recreation, biological, and hazard and hazardous materials impacts than those associated with the action alternatives. Therefore, because this alternative would not provide reliable capacity to assure adequate service to all customers during single-contingency outages, and could result in new or more severe environmental effects, it was eliminated from further review and consideration. Installing Power Lines Underground Description This alternative would include underground installation (“undergrounding”) of significant portions of the 625 and/or 650 Lines. A preliminary review was completed to determine viable routes for consideration. Based on this review by a design engineer, it was determined that SR 28 was the most direct route for the 625 Line; however, due primarily to the limited shoulder along the highway as well as conflicts with multiple existing utility lines, the entire 625 Line should be installed underground within the SR 28 travel lanes. During the design engineer evaluation of undergrounding of the 625 Line from the Tahoe City Substation to the Kings Beach Substation along SR 28, it was identified that this section of highway is very congested with existing overhead utilities, including power distribution, telephone, and cable television lines. For the purposes of this evaluation, it was assumed that only the transmission line would be put underground and the other utilities would remain. Under this alternative, a significant portion of the 650 Line would be installed in and along SR 267, and portions of the remaining power lines would be undergrounded along specific overland portions of the existing routes to minimize the visibility of project facilities. In forested areas where the line would be undergrounded, there could be a reduced width of the tree removal/vegetation management corridor from the 40-feet identified for the project, but undergrounding would not eliminate tree removal and vegetation management entirely. Trees, brush, and boulders would need to be removed to install an underground power line, and trees would not be allowed to regrow over the line to maintain vehicle access for inspections, maintenance, and repairs, and to prevent tree root damage to the buried conduit. SR 28 is a heavily traveled roadway that provides the primary access around Lake Tahoe between Tahoe City and Kings Beach. As such, there can be considerable congestion during the summer months. Construction on this route would require extensive lane closures and traffic delays. The construction pace would be slow and with the short TRPA-established construction season (between May 1st and October 15th), it would extend over approximately five seasons (summers). During operation, underground facilities are generally less apt to fail in winter weather, but are more difficult to access due to limited visibility and use of the roadway medians and shoulders to store ploughed snow. Vaults would be located approximately 2,600 feet apart. In addition to needing access to these vaults during outages, crews would need access periodically (usually during the summer) for inspection and routine maintenance. Accessing these vaults would require lane closures and traffic delays where they are within or adjacent to roadways. Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective and would largely meet the project objectives and need. One objective that may be compromised would be to provide more reliable access to the 625 Line for operation and maintenance activities. While undergrounding often does provide more reliable access, seasonal traffic and snow storage would result in reduced access in the project area.  This alternative would not reduce overall environmental effects as potential benefits of undergrounding would be outweighed by the substantial environmental effects that could occur. For instance, substantial ground disturbance is typically required for undergrounding. Underground installation is a slower process, increasing the time period for construction and construction-related impacts to air quality, noise, and traffic (i.e., lane/road closures). Effects could include increased:  potential for erosion and sedimentation;  disturbance to previously undisturbed habitat that supports special-status vegetation communities, plants, and wildlife;   potential to disturb currently undocumented hazardous materials sites;  potential to disturb known and unknown potentially significant archeological resources and resources of concern to Native American Tribes;  air emissions of criteria pollutants due to an increase in required construction equipment for trench activities (e.g., excavators, back hoes), dust generation, and truck trips to haul trench spoils and import bedding and back-fill;  construction related noise both on-site and off-site (i.e., increase in truck trips); and  traffic effects on local area roadways from increased truck trips. This alternative was identified to reduce environmental concerns related to aesthetics, fire risk, and vegetation management. However, it would create issues related to stormwater management and vehicle emissions. A key environmental issue would be the pumping of vault water and the management of the runoff from the vaults. This is a problem that is difficult to address. During emergency outage situations, vaults are often full of run-off water and must be immediately pumped. Under the California State Water Resources Control Board regulations, pumping directly to the storm drain is not allowed within the Lake Tahoe Basin. As such, pumper trucks would be needed. Again, similar to the effect of snow storage, this effort could greatly increase outage durations. Another increased environmental issue would be automobile emissions during traffic stoppages and/or delays during construction. These stoppages and delays would occur during construction (five summers) and continue (on a lesser scale) during summer inspection and maintenance periods. Based on the general discussion above, as well as the more specific preliminary evaluation of the undergrounding of the 625 Line along SR 28, it has been determined that while this alternative is feasible and would meet several of the project objectives, it would result in increased environmental effects when compared to the project alternatives. Accordingly, this alternative has been eliminated from further consideration. Non-Wires Alternative – Demand Management Conservation  Description Demand management conservation programs are designed to reduce and/or manage customer energy consumption. These programs are designed to either reduce the overall use of energy or to shift the consumption of energy to off-peak times. By reducing or better managing energy consumption, development or upgrading of delivery infrastructure may not be needed. CPUC regulatory requirements dictate that supply-side (e.g., energy generation and delivery infrastructure) and demand-side (e.g., energy conservation) options should be considered on an equal basis in a utility’s plan to acquire lowest cost resources. CalPeco currently offers a number of energy efficiency programs in California, under the umbrella of its Rebate and Savings program. The specific programs are divided into residential, business, builders and buyers, and energy management assistance programs. Under this alternative further energy efficiency and management programs would be considered in an attempt to meet the project objectives through demand-side options. Rationale for Elimination Reductions in demand through energy conservation programs are part of CalPeco’s future operations and are incorporated into its long-term peak load forecasts. Existing demand management conservation programs run by CalPeco include programs that offer energy saving measures and rebates to customers who participate and implement energy saving projects. However, these programs require voluntary participation. As separate and standalone programs, CalPeco cannot guarantee that such voluntary programs would provide sufficient energy conservation to achieve either the capacity or reliability needs of CalPeco in the Tahoe Basin, as stated in the objectives for the project. With current energy demands in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System meeting, and during peak demand periods exceeding, the design capacity of the system, it is not technically feasible to implement sufficient demand-side measures to avoid the need for improvements to delivery infrastructure included in the action alternatives. Although demand management conservation may be feasible from a legal and regulatory perspective, and would eliminate significant environmental effects associated with the action alternatives, because this approach would not meet the project objectives/need, and is not technically feasible, this alternative has been eliminated from further consideration. Utilizing Reactive Capacitance to Delay the Need for the Project Description Reactive capacitors are a piece of equipment that can be added to substations that can allow utilities to increase the amount of power that can be transmitted over their lines. Under this alternative, reactive capacitors would be added to substations in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System.  Rationale for Elimination This alternative would be feasible from a legal and regulatory perspective, but would be technically problematic and ultimately would not meet the project objectives and need. While the installation of reactive capacitors is a valid consideration and is used by some utilities to defer installation or upgrading of facilities, it is a scenario that is problematic with specific types of electrical loads. The applicant evaluated this option but determined that specific issues unique to the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System warrant that large scale installation of capacitors should not be relied upon as a substitute for the proposed project.  Modeling of the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System found that, not only was the harmonic resonance a concern, but that there was not sufficient space at the Brockway and Squaw Valley Substations to complete installation of reactive capacitors in a safe manner for operation and maintenance. The following specific concerns were identified:  Harmonic tuning issues. In the Lake Tahoe region, equipment that utilizes adjustable speed drives and could be effected by harmonic tuning includes ski resort equipment such as chair lifts and trams, and machinery used for various industries, such as wood working equipment. This equipment is operated with the use of variable speed drives or adjustable speed drive motors. Variable speed drives are susceptible to harmonic tuning issues that can occur when capacitor banks are switched. Harmonics would be particularly sensitive when large amounts of capacitors are switched in multiple banks, as would be the case at the Squaw Valley Substation. In order to delay the 625 and 650 Electrical Upgrade Project, multiple capacity banks would be required.   Reactive Concerns. An example of a reactive concern is that adding capacitors to a peak load would cause a significant leading power factor. The resulting leading power factor would make operations for voltage regulators (oil type) and breakers difficult, causing potential operating problems, especially with older equipment. These situations could arise by adding capacitors to the Squaw Valley and the other substations in North Lake Tahoe.   Limited Room. In many of the CalPeco substations in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System, space is limited and there would simply be no room for installation of reactive capacitors and the associated need for upgraded voltage regulators and breakers. This issue involves not only ease and efficiency of operations, but is critical to the safety of operation inside the substations. This is specifically the case at the Brockway and Squaw Valley Substations. Preliminary evaluations showed that multiple reactive capacitance banks would be necessary at Squaw Valley. If reactive capacitors were installed at substations in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System, it would only delay for a short time the need for the proposed project as they would not produce a large enough increase in system capacity to address the peak demands that currently meet or exceed the system’s design capacity. Therefore, installation of reactive capacitors would not meet any elements of the project purpose and need and objectives. Ultimately, implementation of this alternative would involve installation of reactive capacitors and related equipment at substations, and the expansion of some substations to accommodate this equipment, plus implementation of one of the action alternatives, resulting in greater environmental effects than the action alternatives alone. Therefore, because the alternative would only delay implementation of the proposed project, would increase the overall environmental effects due to the required substation additions, and could reduce reliability by introducing new technical issues into the system, it has been eliminated from further consideration. Relocate the Tahoe City Substation  Description The Tahoe City Substation was constructed in 1937. It functions as one of the critical substations in the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System. Within the substation, there are two power line terminations and multiple distribution getaways. Specifically, the 629 Line which runs between the Tahoe City and Squaw Valley Substations, and the 625 Line which runs between the Tahoe City and Kings Beach Substations both terminate at this facility. Electricity from these lines is stepped down at the substation to lower voltages to supply power to the Tahoe City area. See Exhibit 3-2 for the elements of the overall North Lake Tahoe Transmission System and specifically the line terminations into the Tahoe City Substation. Upon relocation, the existing Tahoe City Substation would be maintained by CalPeco for use as a material storage yard. In 1994, TRPA and the Placer County Board of Supervisors approved the Tahoe City Community Plan, which recommended consideration of substation relocation. This alternative was considered to address that recommendation (Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and Placer County 1994). Ownership of the parcel identified for relocation of the facility has since been transferred, and it is no longer available as an alternative location. Further, one of the reasons given in the community plan for the relocation was to improve scenic quality for the SR 89 TRPA travel route. Since publication of this plan, the travel route rating for this section of highway has increased as a result of other improvements in the community plan and the affected unit is now in attainment with the TRPA threshold. Therefore, the need to relocate this facility is significantly diminished and may no longer exist.  Rationale for Elimination This alternative could be feasible from a technical, legal, and regulatory perspective (with significant challenges described below) and would meet the project objectives and need. However, this alternative would not reduce overall environmental effects of the project such that these benefits would outweigh the substantial environmental effects that could occur with relocating a substation. For instance, relocating a substation would require locating a new site approximately of 0.5 acre that would be graded to prepare the site for installation of the substation and connections to the electrical grid. Grid connections would require power lines and distribution lines into and out of the substation, as well as electrical vaults (that require excavation) for shifting the overhead distribution lines to underground conduit to enter the substation site. The existing conduits in the bridge spanning the Truckee River do not have sufficient capacity for the reroute of all the distribution lines. Relocation rather than rebuilding of the Tahoe City Substation would also lengthen the construction period, thereby increasing construction-related impacts such as air emissions, noise, and traffic (i.e., lane/road closures). Effects of relocation of the Tahoe City Substation, similar to those discussed for undergrounding, could include increased:  potential for erosion and sedimentation;  disturbance to previously undisturbed habitat that supports special-status vegetation communities, plants, and wildlife;   potential to disturb known and unknown hazardous materials;  potential to disturb known and unknown potentially significant archeological resources and resources of concern to Native American Tribes;  air emissions of criteria pollutants due to an increase in required construction equipment for site preparation and excavation activities (i.e., grading equipment, hauling out excess site and excavation material), dust generation, and truck trips to haul spoils from the site;  construction related noise both on-site and off-site (i.e., increase in truck trips);  traffic effects on local area roadways from increased truck trips; and  visual effects because the site would be visible from Lake Tahoe and due to the need to string distribution over the Truckee River because there is not sufficient capacity within the existing conduits in the bridge to accommodate this alternative.  Accordingly, although the substation could be relocated, the increased environmental effects that could result would not justify relocation. Moreover, there are no significant adverse effects associated with the modification to the Tahoe City Substation as proposed and analyzed in this EIS/EIS/EIR that would warrant consideration of this alternative. Once all considerations were reviewed and evaluated, it was determined that this alternative does not better address any of the project goals, would have a substantially increased impact on the ratepayers, and would pose potential technical hurdles that may not be able to be feasibly addressed within the established schedule. As such, this alternative was rejected.  REQUIRED PERMITS AND APPROVALS 3.6CalPeco is seeking permit approvals from the three lead agencies with primary discretionary approval for the project evaluated in this EIS/EIS/EIR. Specifically, CalPeco is seeking to obtain a Special Use Authorization from the USFS, both the LTBMU and the Tahoe National Forest units, for implementation of the project on NFS land managed by the USFS. The USFS is also the federal lead agency for the project for compliance with NEPA. As the federal lead agency, the USFS would be responsible for compliance with Section 7 of the federal Endangered Species Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.  CalPeco is also seeking to obtain a Land Use and Development Permit from TRPA for implementation of all project components that fall within the Lake Tahoe Basin boundaries. TRPA is responsible for ensuring that the project is consistent with the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, the TRPA Rules of Procedure, and the TRPA Code of Ordinances, and that the project would allow for the attainment and maintenance of environmental thresholds established to protect the unique values of the Lake Tahoe Basin.  Public electric utilities are regulated by the CPUC, which is the lead agency for compliance with CEQA for this project. The CPUC reviews the permit application for adequacy in conjunction with environmental review pursuant to CEQA. CalPeco must comply with the CPUC’s GO 131-D, which contains the permitting requirements for the construction of substations and power line facilities and GO No. 95, which details the requirements for overhead line design, construction, and maintenance. CalPeco is seeking to obtain a Permit to Construct (PTC) from the CPUC for this project pursuant to GO 131-D, and submitted a PEA to the CPUC in August of 2010 as required by the Public Utilities Code.  No local discretionary permits are required, since the CPUC has preemptive jurisdiction over the construction, maintenance, and operation of CalPeco’s facilities, as outlined in Section XIV.B of GO 131-D. The applicant would still have to obtain all ministerial building and encroachment permits from local jurisdictions, and GO 131-D requires that the applicant comply with local building, design, and safety standards to the greatest degree feasible to minimize project conflicts with local conditions. CalPeco would obtain all other applicable permits for the project from federal, state, regional and local agencies with approval authority over the project.  Table 3-7, Required Permits and Authorizations, lists the potential permits and approvals required for project implementation.  Table 3-7 Required Permits and Authorizations  Agency  Permit/Authorization  Action Requiring Permit Approval or Review  Federal  USFS (LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest)  Special Use Authorization  Construction on NFS lands  NEPA Review/Approval as a Lead Agency  Issuance of a Special Use Authorization  Timber Sale Contract  Harvesting of timber on NFS lands  US Fish and Wildlife Service  Section 7 Consultation (through the USFS review process)  Potential impacts to a federally listed species or its habitat  Advisory Council on Historic Preservation  Section 106 Consultation (through the USFS review process)  Potential impacts to cultural resources  US Army Corps of Engineers  Section 404 Individual or Nationwide Permit  Potential work in waters of the United States, including wetlands  NEPA Review/Approval as a Cooperating Agency  Authority to Construct on USACE Land  Federal Aviation Administration  Air Traffic Consultation  Review and authorization of helicopter operations (e.g., flight paths, communication protocols)  Table 3-7 Required Permits and Authorizations  Agency  Permit/Authorization  Action Requiring Permit Approval or Review  State  CPUC  PTC  Construction or upgrade of facilities under 200 kV  CEQA Review/Approval as a Lead Agency  Issuance of a PTC  California Department of Fish and Wildlife  Section 1602 Streambed Alteration Agreement  Potential disturbance to the bed or bank of jurisdictional waters  2081 Incidental Take Permit  Potential impacts to a state-listed species  State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)  SHPO Consultation (through the Section 106 process)  Potential impacts to cultural resources  California Department of Forestry  Timber Harvest Plan  Harvesting of timber on private lands  State Water Resources Control Board  Water Quality Order No. 99-08 – National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit for Stormwater Discharges associated with Construction Activity  Discharges of stormwater runoff associated with construction activity involving land disturbance of 1 or more acres  Water Quality Order No. 2003-0003 – Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements for discharges to land with a low threat to water quality  Dewatering of excavations to land surface  Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board  Section 401 Water Quality Certification  Potential impacts to state water quality;

All APMs would be followed during project-related construction activity. CalPeco has committed to implementing these measures in order to reduce the potential direct and indirect impacts that could result from the action alternatives. Therefore, the APMs are considered part of the project description. The impact analysis in this EIS/EIS/EIR assumes implementation of all APMs. However, where other impacts are identified that are not addressed by these APMs, or where the APMs are not adequate to reduce impacts to less than significant levels, the EIS/EIS/EIR recommends additional mitigation measures. APMs will be incorporated into the Mitigation Monitoring, Compliance, and Reporting Program developed for this Proposed Project, and implementation of the APMs will be monitored in the same fashion as the mitigation measures developed in this EIS/EIS/EIR.  Table 3-8 Applicant Proposed Measures  APM Number  Description  Justification  Project Component  625 Line  650 Line  132/650 Line  Double-Circuit  Northstar Fold  Substations  Existing  New  Scenic Resources  SCE-1  The following measures will be implemented during construction:  Construction activities will be kept as clean and inconspicuous as practical.   Construction storage and staging will be screened, where practical, with opaque fencing from close-range residential views and public viewing areas.  Slash treatment within the immediate foreground (50 feet) will be by lop and scatter.   If hand-piling and burning is utilized, piles will be located away from the edge of the roadway.

The delineation will map and quantify the acreage of all aquatic habitats on the project site and will be submitted to USACE for verification. CalPeco will determine, based on the verified wetland delineation and the project design plan, the acreage of impacts on waters of the United States and waters of the state that would result from project implementation. Impacts will be avoided to the extent practicable through the siting of poles and other facilities outside of delineated waters of the United States and waters of the state. Work in wetlands or wet meadow habitats with saturated soil conditions will be scheduled when soils are dry to the extent possible. If soils become saturated, timber mats will be installed along all vehicle and equipment access routes to minimize rutting. Disturbed wetland areas will be restored to preconstruction conditions and seeded with a native species, consistent with the vegetation community present prior to disturbance, to stabilize the soils and minimize the introduction of noxious weeds, as specified by the USACE and RWQCB. In accordance with the USACE “no net loss” policy, all permanent wetland impacts will be mitigated at a minimum of a 1:1 ratio. This mitigation will come in the form of either contributions to a USACE-approved wetland mitigation bank or through the development of a Compensatory Mitigation and Monitoring Plan aimed at  Temporary impacts to wetlands, aquatic resources, and existing drainage patterns would be minimized and avoided during construction as a result of this measure.

At a minimum, if a potential heritage or cultural resources is discovered, construction will be halted within 50-feet of the site until a qualified archeologist can evaluate the find. If the archeologist can determine at the time that the find would not be eligible for the NRHP or CRHR and does not contain human remains, construction may proceed after the find is properly documented and/or collected. Otherwise, applicable elements of other APMs will be implemented. The Construction Monitoring and Unanticipated Discovery Plan will also discuss procedures for immediate work stoppage and treatment in the event of discovery of human remains during construction activities.  Implementation of this measure would help to ensure that actions taken by field personnel are compliant with the measure in this document and applicable regulations.              CUL-9  If human remains are discovered, all work within 50 feet of the discovery site will halt immediately.

The amount of suitable habitat designated as a PAC or HRCA for each species is as follows: a spotted owl PAC is 300 acres, a northern goshawk PAC is 200 acres, and a spotted owl HRCA is 1,000 acres. CalPeco will coordinate with the USFS to identify areas of interest and understand the desirable components or key criteria of suitable habitat used for PAC and HRCA designation.  This measure is intended to offset permanent impacts to California spotted owl and northern goshawk habitat by providing additional survey efforts in locations chosen in consultation with the USFS or funding for surveys, restoration, or protection of habitat.              BIO-14  CalPeco will conduct protocol-level surveys for willow flycatcher in the Martis Valley, within suitable habitat that could be affected by project activities associated with segments 650-4, 650-4A, and 650-4B. Suitable habitat within 200 feet of these segments is identified in Exhibit 4.7-7. (Additional suitable habitat not shown on Exhibit 4.7-7 is present along Martis Creek adjacent to these segments and may require consideration for surveys.) The survey will follow A Willow Flycatcher Survey Protocol for California (Bombay et al. 2003). The protocol requires a minimum of two survey visits to determine presence or absence of willow flycatcher: one visit during survey period 2 (June 15–25) and one during either survey period 1 (June 1–14) or  This measure is intended to avoid impacts to nesting willow flycatchers by defining survey locations and appropriate buffer zones.               Existing  New  period 3 (June 26–July 15). This measure is based on willow flycatcher sightings made in 2007 during field surveys to support the PEA, recent CNDDB records, and habitat mapping conducted during the 2012 surveys. If nesting willow flycatchers are discovered within the survey area, 250-foot exclusionary buffer zones will be established to exclude work during the breeding season—June through August—or until young have fledged the nest. If an area is given clearance to proceed with construction and nesting activities subsequently occur, it will be assumed that the nesting pair is acclimated to the ongoing disturbance of construction. If circumstances exist such that future activities may result in the abandonment or failure of the nest, as determined by a qualified biologist, an appropriate exclusionary buffer will be established by CalPeco, in coordination with the CDFW, to protect nesting birds.  BIO-15  Preconstruction biological surveys will be conducted no more than 30 days prior to construction activities to identify biological resources, including burrows and den sites, which could be impacted by construction activities. All burrows and den sites will be inspected for use by sensitive mammals, and buffers may be established based on occupation. If an area is given clearance to proceed with construction and burrowing or denning activities subsequently occur, it will be assumed that the individuals are acclimated to the ongoing disturbance of construction. However, the den will be flagged to prevent damage during construction. If circumstances exist such that future activities may result in the abandonment of the burrow or den site, as determined by a qualified biologist, an appropriate exclusionary buffer will be established by CalPeco, in coordination with CDFW, USFS, and, if necessary, the USFWS.  This measure is intended to identify sensitive mammals and burrows in the project area in order to facilitate the implementation of avoidance measures and lessen potential impacts.               BIO-16  If a potentially active sensitive mammal burrow or den site  The measure would protect sensitive young              Existing  New  is unavoidable, CalPeco will employ den-dusting or scoping to determine the species and reproductive status of the animal. If the burrow or den is determined to be active and does not contain young, CalPeco will excavate the burrow by hand, remove the den, or block the entrance to prevent re-entry until after the completion of work. If the animal is determined to be raising young, CalPeco will establish a 200-foot exclusionary buffer surrounding the burrow or den until it is determined that the young have left the den.

The measure also requires that any burrows (not containing young) are excavated so that animals are not harmed during construction activities.  BIO-17  Concurrent with the preconstruction surveys described in APM BIO-15, surveys will be conducted for amphibians, including eggs or juveniles, at aquatic habitat crossed by the project. If adults, juveniles, or eggs of sensitive amphibians are discovered, a permitted specialist will relocate the individuals to suitable habitat outside of the construction area. If amphibians are discovered in the construction area after the start of work, the environmental monitor will allow the individuals to leave under their own volition. As an alternative, an agency-approved biologist may relocate the individuals from the project area to similar, suitable habitat. CalPeco will coordinate with the CDFG, USFWS, and/or USFS prior to relocating any individuals.  This measure is intended to identify sensitive amphibians in the project area so that they can be relocated or allowed to leave construction areas unharmed.

Signage describing the closures will be posted at trail access points one week prior to closures, will remain posted during the entire closure period, and will be removed upon completion of construction.  The signage at trail access points would notify the public of closures and would suggest potential alternative facilities that can be accessed, thus reducing the impact of trail closures.              REC-4  Where helicopters will be used for construction, signage advising equestrians of the schedule for helicopter use will be posted at all equestrian trail-access points within the vicinity of the flight paths one week prior to helicopter activity. These signs will be checked and maintained daily until helicopter operation in the area ceases.  Horses are particularly sensitive to helicopter noise. This measure would allow the equestrians to avoid helicopter use areas, thus avoiding potential safety issues and impacts to the enjoyment of the activity.               REC-5  Pulling of conductor over the Truckee River will occur during the months of April, October, or November to minimize impacts to rafting operations.  The peak rafting season is May through September.

This would be completed by helicopter installation for a span of two to three poles, and has been proposed to limit future recreational travel ways.              Existing  New  CalPeco, TRPA, and the land owner/manager.   Cultural Resources  CUL-1  To the extent feasible, project design will avoid disturbance to significant heritage and cultural resources recommended or considered eligible for listing in the NRHP or CRHR. Avoidance may be achieved by various means such as placing poles outside the resource and spanning conductor across the resource and adjusting access way boundaries to avoid a resource. Resources to be avoided within the APE3, or those immediately adjacent to the APE, will be designated as exclusion zones and will be clearly marked with fencing, staking, flagging, or another appropriate material. Signage will be placed on the markers identifying the exclusion zone and stating that construction vehicles, equipment, and personnel are not permitted in the exclusion zone. If complete avoidance is not feasible, construction methods will be implemented that minimize potential impacts, such as hand excavating holes with an archeological monitor present to inspect spoils and using a helicopter for pole placement to avoid vehicles passing over the resource. Appropriate construction methods for each situation will be developed in coordination with a qualified archeologist, the land owner/manager, relevant federal or state agencies, and Native American representatives if a Native American site.  This measure documents the applicant’s intent to avoid cultural resources where possible.              CUL-2  The proposed Northstar Golf Course Staging Area is located adjacent to a known heritage and cultural resources site considered eligible for listing in the NRHP or CRHR.

Where soils and slopes exhibit high erosion potential, additional sediment control structures, such as erosion control blankets, matting, and other fabrics may be installed. Implementation and maintenance of these BMPs and any others identified in the SWPPP would be monitored by a qualified environmental monitor.  This measure would control erosion that could occur as a result of construction and complement implementation of required plans.              SOILS-2  A California Registered Professional Geologist or a California Registered Civil or Geotechnical Engineer will conduct a geotechnical analysis and prepare a Geotechnical Engineering Report that will be used to develop the final design of all project components (access ways, staging areas, substations/switching stations, and poles in order to avoid or minimize damage related to geologic hazards, including seismic activity, slope stability, and soil limitations (expansive and unstable soils) and to ensure that all applicable codes and seismic standards are adequately addressed in the design and construction of the project.

On public land, CalPeco will coordinate with the land management agency to determine an appropriate seed mix or tree planting plan. On private land, CalPeco will coordinate with the landowner and/or provide the landowner with a suggested seed mix based on consultation with the agency of jurisdiction. The plan will include approved seed mixes, application rates, and application methods. If broadcast seeding is determined to be the most feasible application method, seeding rates will be doubled relative to the standard seeding rate and the seeding method rationale will be explained. The plan will also include long-term erosion and sediment control measures, slope stabilization, and monitoring procedures. As part of normal equipment inspections an evaluation of access ways will be conducted to confirm that use has not resulted in compaction that would result in “coverage” per TRPA standards.   BIO-37  Decommissioning the existing 625 Line ROW and allowing natural regeneration of coniferous forest and other native vegetation types will assist in offsetting the permanent loss of trees and other vegetation along the new 625 Line ROW. Prior to the removal of poles and conductor, a qualified biologist or soil scientist will identify areas of the abandoned ROW that contain unnaturally compacted soil (resulting from unauthorized public use, development of user-created trails, or other factors) that could limit the natural reestablishment of vegetation and assess whether local treatments would be needed to facilitate native vegetation recruitment and development. CalPeco will consult with the applicable land owner/manager to verify that areas identified for treatments are appropriate (e.g., not part of a system road, authorized trail network, or other desired use) and secure approval for restoration.  Revegetation along the existing 625 Line would partially offset the impacts to habitat and species as a result of the tree removal associated with the new 625 Line.               Existing  New  REC-7  CalPeco will install access way barriers along any overland travel ways to minimize the possibility of establishing new recreational paths. This will be completed as prescribed under the Travel Analysis Process by USFS.  Placing boulders or gates to block access following construction would limit habitat degradation as a result of unauthorized use of access ways.              Utilities  UTL-1  During the project design process, the applicant will coordinate with utility providers in the project area to identify the location of underground facilities in the vicinity of the selected alignment and staging areas. The final excavation and grading plans will avoid existing utilities where possible; and where it is not possible to avoid utilities, the applicant will coordinate with service providers to minimize disturbance. Prior to start of construction, the applicant will verify utility locations through field surveys and use of the Underground Service Alert (USA) services. Any buried utility lines will be clearly marked in construction areas.  Prior to start of construction, the applicant will prepare a response plan to provide procedures to be followed in the event of accidental damage to a utility line. The plan will identify chain-of-command rules for notifying authorities and appropriate actions and responsibilities for ensuring the safety of the public and workers. Worker education training in response to such events will be conducted by the contractor.  The applicant will provide adequate notice to utilities and affected customers of planned service disruptions associated with transmission line construction activities.   This would minimize adverse impacts area resident and local businesses from utility service interruptions.               Traffic and Transportation  TRAN-1  The applicant will develop and implement a Traffic Control Plan to minimize disruptions to surface travel and protect the safety of workers and the traveling public.

Treatments will be selected based on each species ecology and phenology. All treatment methods—including the use of herbicides—will be conducted in accordance with the law, regulations, and policies governing the land owner (e.g., TRPA in the Lake Tahoe Basin; LTBMU and Tahoe National Forest on NFS lands). Land owners will be notified prior to the use of herbicides for invasive treatment. In areas where treatment is not feasible, CalPeco will clearly flag or fence noxious weed areas in order to clearly delineate work exclusion.  This measure would help prevent the accidental spread of noxious weeds into new areas where they do not currently exist. This measure also manages herbicide use in the Lake Tahoe Basin.              BIO-5  Equipment will arrive at the project area clean and weed-free. Equipment will be inspected by the on-site environmental monitor for mud or other signs that weed seeds or propagules could be present prior to use in the project area.

Coordination with the applicable agency would promote proper implementation of the measure so that the spread of weeds is minimized.   BIO-9  Exclusion zones will be established around any identified rare plants. In consultation with a qualified biologist, CalPeco will first attempt to avoid effects of project implementation on rare plants and protect their occurrences/populations in situ. In the event that a special-status plant occurance cannot be avoided by construction activities, CalPeco will notify CPUC, CDFW, TRPA, and/or USFS, as applicable depending on the species regulatory status. CalPeco will consult with CDFW, TRPA, and/or USFS in order to establish appropriate mitigation measures. If sacrifice seed collection or transplantation are selected as appropriate mitigations, then the following measures will apply: a) CalPeco will collect any mature seeds from the affected plants and store them at an appropriate native plant nursery or comparable facility; b) upon the completion of work, CalPeco will redistribute the seeds within the original location of the occurance; c) CalPeco will establish performance standards for survivorship and will also monitor and document the success rate of the transplanted individuals for three consecutive growing seasons; d) if performance standards are not met, corrective measures will be implemented and monitoring and adaptive management continued until success criteria are met.

The resource areas evaluated in Chapter 4 include those originally identified for review in the notice of preparation (NOP)/notice of intent for this environmental impact statement (EIS)/EIS/environmental impact report (EIR), those identified for consideration in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), environmental topics originating from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Appendix G Checklist, and issue areas identified in the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) Initial Environmental Checklist. Exceptions are agricultural resources and population and housing. As discussed in Section 1.3, Scope and Focus of the EIS/EIS/EIR, agricultural resources are not evaluated because the action alternatives would not affect any lands used for agricultural production, zoned for agriculture, or considered important farmland. As also identified in Section 1.3, housing is not discussed in detail in this EIS/EIS/EIR as the proposed project does not include construction of housing as part of the project, would not displace existing housing, and would not generate demand for new housing. Potential project effects on populations and employment are addressed in Section 5.5, Growth-Inducing Impacts of the Proposed Project, and Section 5.6, Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice. Sections 4.2 through 4.14 of this EIS/EIS/EIR are organized into the following major subsections.  Regulatory Setting: This section presents the applicable regulatory framework and planning context, if any, for the specific technical issue, under which the proposed project would be implemented. The section includes a discussion of applicable federal, state, TRPA, and local regulation. At the local level, plans reviewed in the preparation of each section, at a minimum, include the Placer County General Plan, Community Plans, Plan Area Statements, the Town of Truckee General Plan, and the Martis Valley Community Plan. Other plans were also reviewed where they were applicable to particular environmental resource area; for example, consideration of the Placer County 2035 Regional Transportation Plan Document in Section 4.12, Traffic and Transportation. California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) General Order No. 131-D establishes that local jurisdictions acting pursuant to local authority are preempted from regulating electric power line projects, distribution lines, substations, or electric facilities constructed by public utilities subject to the CPUC's jurisdiction. For this project, Placer County, Nevada County, and the Town of Truckee would not have discretionary permitting authority over the project. However, for informational purposes, pertinent local regulations and policies are identified in this EIS/EIS/EIR and under the provisions of General Order No. 131-D, the Applicant is encouraged to seek resolution of any land use issues with these entities. In the event that resolution of land use conflicts cannot be achieved, either party to the dispute may file a notice of such with the CPUC and a hearing shall be held on the matter within 30 days of receipt of the notice. Existing Conditions/Affected Environment: This section describes the existing regional and local environmental conditions relevant to the issue under evaluation. The regional setting provides context for the analysis of conditions within the project footprint. For the purpose of this EIS/EIS/EIR, the project footprint includes the right-of way (ROW) for all alternative power line alignments, stringing sites, access ways and roads, staging areas, and substations. The potential removal of hazard trees outside the defined alignment ROW is considered as appropriate in each section. Except as otherwise noted, the study area under consideration for the environmental resources is generally analogous with the project footprint. Expanded study areas have been established for some resource discussions, as determined by the potential for environmental impact (e.g., hazard tree removal outside the defined ROW) or the potential for information outside the project footprint to inform the analysis (e.g., special-status species occurrences outside the ROW indicating the potential for a species to occur inside the ROW). Environmental Consequences and Recommended Mitigation Measures: This section identifies the criteria used to determine the level of significance of an environmental impact and discusses potentially significant effects of the project alternatives on the existing environment. Both direct and indirect environmental effects are considered. Criteria to determine the significance of impacts were derived from several sources. The TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist (IEC) poses questions related to various environmental issue areas to assist in determining whether environmental effects may occur. However, the purpose of the TRPA IEC is primarily to determine if an EIS is required and to help define the topics to be evaluated in greater detail. While many of the IEC checklist questions are conducive for use as significance criteria (that is, they include a defined standard, qualitative or quantitative), many are not. For example, the IEC poses the question pertaining to air quality: “Will the proposal result in increased use of diesel fuel?” Because the question does not include a standard, a “yes” answer does not necessarily mean a significant air quality impact will occur as a project could result in a very minor increase in diesel fuel use (e.g., a gallon a day) and could include elements that have beneficial effects on air quality. The IEC questions are used as a guide in evaluating impacts in this EIS/EIS/EIR and in some cases have been tailored to function as significance criteria.  The sample environmental checklist provided in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines is also used as a source of significance criteria. Because the checklist includes standards (qualitative or quantitative), the questions are generally well suited for use as significance thresholds; however, they are modified or expanded as needed in this EIS/EIS/EIR to better reflect the nature and location of the project, and to support the environmental analysis. For example, local air pollution control district quantitative emission thresholds are used to elaborate on the thresholds provided in Appendix G.  To comply with NEPA, an environmental document must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are typically encompassed by the TRPA and CEQA criteria used for this analysis. However, where appropriate, specific significance criteria not encompassed by the TRPA IEC checklist or the State CEQA Guidelines Appendix G checklist may be added to address topics of particular concern to the US Forest Service (NEPA lead agency) or the US Army Corps of Engineers (NEPA cooperating agency).  Project impacts are numbered sequentially for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) through Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) in each section, with the alternative identified in parenthesis in the impact title. For example, impacts in Section 4.2 are numbered 4.2-1 (Alt. 1), 4.2-2 (Alt. 1), 4.2-3 (Alt. 1), and so on for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Impacts in Section 4.2 for Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) are numbered 4.2-1 (Alt. 2), 4.2-2 (Alt. 2), 4.2-3 (Alt. 2), and so on. A bold font impact title, and a summary of each impact and its level of significance, precedes the full discussion of each impact. The full impact discussion considers the potential for the alternative to result in environmental impacts in light of established applicant proposed measures (APMs) designed to minimize environmental effects (described in Section 3.7, Applicant Proposed Measures) and provides the evidence on which conclusions are made. In cases where impacts are still considered significant after implementation of applicable APMs, and feasible mitigation would reduce these effects, a mitigation measure (or measures) is described below the impact discussion, and the significance of the impact after mitigation is identified. The mitigation measures are numbered to correspond with the impact addressed by the measure; therefore, if Impact 4.2-1 (Alt. 1) is addressed by a single mitigation measure, the measure would be numbered Mitigation Measure 4.2-1 (Alt. 1). If multiple mitigation measures are provided for a single impact, a letter is added to the end of each mitigation measure number. For example, mitigation measures for Impact 4.2-1 (Alt. 1) would be numbered: Mitigation Measure 4.2-1a (Alt. 1), Mitigation Measure 4.2-1b (Alt. 1), and so on. The CalPeco 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project alternatives, Alternatives 1 (PEA Alternative) through Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), are analyzed at an equal level of detail in this chapter. Impacts and associated mitigation measures, if necessary, are identified for each alternative in each of the resource sections. Because all project alternatives except Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) contemplate some level of development in the project area, the alternatives may have many of the same or similar impacts, use of APMs, and mitigation measures where necessary. In these instances, rather than repeating the entire impact discussion and mitigation measures for each alternative, the reader is referred to the initial impact discussion and mitigation descriptions provided for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), and any different conditions under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), or Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) are identified. Cumulative Impacts: At the end of each resource section is a discussion of project effects in the context of other existing and proposed development that may contribute to cumulative impacts. Cumulative impacts are further described below, including the assumptions and approach used for the cumulative impacts analysis in each resource section. 4.1.2 CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY This section provides information on the cumulative impact analysis methodology common to the evaluation of cumulative impacts for all environmental issue areas later in this chapter. Each discussion of cumulative impacts provided in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, etc. utilizes the information provided here.  DEFINITION OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS NEPA implementing regulations require consideration of cumulative impacts (40 Code of Federal Regulations 1508.25). Cumulative impacts are defined as an “impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time” (40 Code of Federal Regulations 1508.7). Section 15130(a) of the State CEQA Guidelines requires a discussion of the cumulative impacts of a project when the project’s incremental effect is cumulatively considerable. Cumulatively considerable, as defined in State CEQA Guidelines Section 15065(a)(3), means that the “incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.” State CEQA Guidelines Section 15355 defines a cumulative impact as two or more individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time.  TRPA looks to NEPA and CEQA for guidance in assessing cumulative impacts (and thus the analysis contained in this document is sufficient for TRPA purposes). CUMULATIVE IMPACT APPROACH State CEQA Guidelines Section 15130 identifies two basic methods for establishing the cumulative environment in which a project is considered: 1) the use of a list of past, present, and probable future projects; or 2) the use of adopted projections from a general plan, other regional planning document, or a certified EIR for such a planning document. NEPA and TRPA do not provide similarly detailed guidance on methods for cumulative impact analysis. This cumulative analysis uses the “list” approach to identify the cumulative setting. The effects of past and present projects on the environment are reflected by the existing conditions in the project area. A list of probable future projects is provided below. Probable future projects are those in the project vicinity that have the possibility of interacting with the proposed project to generate a cumulative impact (based on proximity and construction schedule) and either:  are partially occupied or under construction,  have received final discretionary approvals,  have applications accepted as complete by local agencies and are currently undergoing environmental review, or  are proposed projects that have been discussed publicly by an applicant or that otherwise become known to a local agency and have provided sufficient information about the project to allow at least a general analysis of environmental impacts. CUMULATIVE SETTING GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE The geographic area that could be affected by the project varies depending on the type of environmental resource being considered. When the effects of the project are considered in combination with those other past, present, and probable future projects to identify cumulative impacts, the other projects that are considered may also vary depending on the type of environmental effects being assessed. Table 4.1-1 presents the general geographic areas associated with the different resources addressed in this analysis. Table 4.1-1 Geographic Scope of Cumulative Impacts  Resources Issue  Geographic Area  Land Use   limited to project site  Forestry Resources  the Truckee-Tahoe region  Scenic Resources  project site and surrounding public viewpoints  Geology, Soils, and Land Capability Coverage  regional for Land Capability Coverage; for geology and soils activities in the immediate vicinity   Hydrology and Water Quality   local and regional watersheds  Biological Resources  defined differently for each species, based on species distribution, habitat requirements, and scope of impact from proposed activities  Recreation  regional (overall accessibility of recreational opportunities) and local (interactions with individual recreational activities)  Heritage, Cultural, and Paleontological Resources  limited to project site  Hazards and Hazardous Materials  immediate project vicinity  Public Services and Utilities  regional (water, wastewater, electricity, natural gas, solid waste) and local (police and fire)  Traffic and Transportation  regional and local roadways where the project could contribute traffic  Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change  regional (pollutant emissions that affect the air basins), immediate project vicinity (pollutant emissions that are highly localized), and global/statewide for greenhouse gasses   Noise  immediate project vicinity where project-generated noise could be heard concurrently with noise from other sources   PROJECT LIST Table 4.1-2, below, provides the list of probable future projects that meet the requirements stated above, in the Cumulative Impact Approach section. Projects are listed that are in the project vicinity and that have the possibility of interacting with the proposed project to generate a cumulative impact. This list of projects was utilized in the development and analysis of the cumulative settings and impacts for each resource. Past and current projects in the project vicinity were also considered as part of the cumulative setting, as they contribute to the existing conditions/baseline upon which the proposed project and each probable future project’s environmental effects are compared, but are not listed in Table 4.1-2. The locations of cumulative projects listed in Table 4.1-2 relative to the project area are shown on Exhibit 4.1-1, Cumulative Projects. Significance criteria, unless otherwise specified, are the same for cumulative impacts as project impacts for each environmental topic area. When considered in relation to other probable future projects, cumulative impacts to some resources could be significant and more severe than those caused by the proposed project alone. Table 4.1-2 Cumulative Project List  Project Name  (Exhibit 4.1-1 Key)  Location  Description  Residential Units and/or Non-Residential Area  Project Status  Gregory Creek Subdivision (1)  0.25-mile north of the intersection of Donner Pass Road with Donner Lake Road, Truckee   Single-family, duplex, and attached multi-family residential.  31 residential units; 32 acre site  Draft EIR released in 2009.

Potential short-term and long-term land use impacts that could result from project implementation are described and mitigation measures are recommended as necessary to reduce potentially significant adverse effects.  Refer to Section 4.3, Forestry Resources (Impact 4.3-1), for a discussion of potential conflict with existing zoning of forest and timberlands.  4.2.1 REGULATORY SETTING A variety of plans and policy statements administered by federal, state, regional, and local agencies apply to the action alternatives. Relevant planning guidance used to evaluate the potential for land use impacts resulting from project implementation are described below. FEDERAL US FOREST SERVICE The project components are predominantly located on National Forest System (NFS) lands managed by the US Department of Agriculture, US Forest Service (USFS); these lands are located in the Tahoe National Forest and in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU). The management of NFS lands in each of these forests is guided by separate Land and Resources Management Plans. The current plans are summarized below. Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit---Land and Resource Management Plan LTBMU manages more than 75 percent of lands within the Tahoe Region, including lands located within the project study area. Land management is guided by the LTBMU Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) (USFS 1988), as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA) (USFS 2004), described below. The Forest Plan sets the framework for how the resources of the national forest are managed. The plan translates national laws, policies, and regulations into guidance for activities that occur on the NFS lands.  The LTBMU Forest Plan is currently being revised and is undergoing environmental review; the revision will be guided by the 2000 National Forest Management Act Planning Rule principles. The plan revision is occurring concurrently with the environmental review for the CalPeco 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project (proposed project) evaluated in this EIS/EIS/EIR. Because the timing of adoption and implementation of the plan revision is speculative, specific guidance in the 1988 Forest Plan provides the basis for evaluating the proposed project’s consistency with LTBMU planning guidance. The project’s consistency with the Forest Plan is considered in the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) Forest Plan Consistency Checklist, a planning tool developed and used by LTBMU staff, included in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in the NFMA checklist, incorporated by reference here, the action alternatives would be consistent with the relevant Forest Plan directives. Therefore, specific Forest Plan directives are not included for consistency analysis in this section. Tahoe National Forest---Land and Resource Management Plan The Tahoe National Forest is located in the north central Sierra Nevada in California and is bounded on the north by the Plumas National Forest, on the east by the Toiyabe National Forest and LTBMU, and on the south by the Eldorado National Forest. The Forest Plan (USFS 1990) provides direction for managing the Tahoe National Forest, which includes an approximately 1-mile stretch of the 625 Line (portions of Segment 625-3 and Segment 625-4/4A) and a 0.25 mile stretch of the 650 Line (Segment 650-4; the existing and rebuilt 650 Line along Glenshire Drive [Segment 650-6] is outside of the NFS boundary in this location) within the project study area. Specifically, Chapter V, Management Direction, presents both forest-wide and area-specific management direction for the Tahoe National Forest. The forest-wide management direction consists of forest goals and desired future conditions, objectives, and forest-wide standards and guidelines. Specific management direction for each of the 106 management areas includes: management emphasis for the area, selected standards and guidelines, and compatible available management practices. The Tahoe National Forest, Forest Plan is amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (USFS 2004), described below. The project’s consistency with the Tahoe National Forest Plan is considered in a matrix similar to the NFMA checklist described above for the LTBMU (but with relevant standards and guidelines only) and is included in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in the Tahoe National Forest NMFA checklist, incorporated by reference here, the action alternatives would be consistent with the Tahoe National Forest standards, guidelines, and management practices. Therefore, specific Tahoe National Forest standards, guidelines, and management practices are not included for consistency analysis in this section. Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment The Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment of 2004 (USFS 2004) amends the Forest Plans for the 11 National Forests that fall within the Sierra Nevada, including the LTBMU Forest Plan and the Tahoe National Forest Plan, described above. The SNFPA Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision (ROD) describe the amendments to the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan developed to improve protection of old forests, wildlife habitats, watersheds and communities in the Sierra Nevada and Modoc Plateau. Appendix A of the ROD provides management direction for the Record of Decision. The appendix is divided into six parts.  Part A presents broad management goals and strategies for addressing the five problem areas: old forest ecosystems and associated species; aquatic, riparian, and meadow ecosystems and associated species; fire and fuels management; noxious weeds; and lower westside hardwood ecosystems.  Part B describes desired conditions for land allocations across Sierra Nevada national forests.   Part C describes management intents and objectives.   Part D describes management standards and guidelines that provide direction for specific aspects of project planning and analysis.   Part E sets forth management direction for the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Pilot Project Area during the life of the pilot project.   Part F describes the monitoring plan for the ROD. While the ROD generally establishes broad goals, the Management Direction appendix (Appendix A of the ROD) is intended to provide more specifics at the objectives and implementation level. The project’s consistency with specific guidance provided in the SNFPA is considered in the NFMA Forest Plan Consistency Checklist included as Appendix D of this EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in the NFMA checklist, incorporated by reference here, the action alternatives would be consistent with the SNFPA guidance. Therefore, specific SNFPA standards and guidelines are not included for consistency analysis in this section. US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS Martis Creek Lake Master Plan The US Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Martis Creek Lake Master Plan (USACE 1977) is used to guide the administration and development of land and water within the Master Plan area (Exhibit 3-2 shows the limits of land managed by the USACE in Martis Valley). The Master Plan prescribes the policies, objectives, and programs for the continuation of conservation, enhancement, development, use, and management of land, water, and other resources within the Master Plan area. It identifies the resources of the Master Plan area and describes the manner in which public use needs and other uses of the land and water resources will be met. Facilities development, operation, and management are described and discussed. Segments 650-4 (Alternative 1, PEA Alternative and Alternative 4, Proposed Alternative), 650-4A (Alternative 2, Modified Alternative), and 650-4B (Alternative 3, Road Focused Alternative [there is no difference between Alternatives 3 and 3A in this area]) pass through this USACE managed property. Project consistency with relevant guidance provided in the Master Plan is considered in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. The master plan includes several Engineering Regulations (ER) that have been rescinded, but one is still in effect; ER 1110-2-400 (published May 31, 1988) establishes policy and guidance for the design of recreation sites, areas, and facilities. The action alternatives do not include design of recreation facilities, and therefore, ER 1110-2-400 does not apply.  FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION Federal Aviation Regulations Part 77 The Federal Aviation Administration published Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77, “Objections Affecting Navigable Airspace” in 1965. Subsequent Amendments 73-1 through 73-11 were incorporated into the edition published in March 1993. FAR Part 77 is codified under Subchapter C, Aircraft, of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. FAR Part 77 establishes standards for determining obstructions in navigable airspace; sets forth the requirements for notice to the Administrator of certain proposed construction or alteration; provides for aeronautical studies of obstructions to air navigation, to determine their effect on the safe and efficient use of airspace; provides for public hearings on the hazardous effect of proposed construction or alteration on air navigation; and provides for establishing antenna farm areas. FAR Part 77 standards and guidelines are incorporated into the Truckee Tahoe Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (Foothill Airport Land Use Commission 2004), which is described below.  STATE Several state agencies have approval responsibility over the project, such as permitting (see Table 3-7 in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives), but do not have planning documents that guide land use development. Relevant regulations of agencies that do not have land use authority related to the project are discussed in other resource sections of this EIS/EIS/EIR, as applicable. CPUC has sole and exclusive jurisdiction over the siting and design of the project and alternatives because it authorizes the construction, operation, and maintenance of investor-owned public utility facilities. Although such projects are exempt from local land use and zoning regulations and discretionary permitting (i.e., they would not require any land use approval that would involve a discretionary decision to be made by a local agency such as a planning commission, city council or county board of supervisors), General Order No. 131-D, Section XIV.B requires that in locating a project “the public utility shall consult with local agencies regarding land use matters.” The public utility is required to obtain any required non-discretionary local permits. This preemptive authority does not apply to special districts, other state, or federal agencies. The following state agencies do have land use authority in portions of the project area. CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS The California Department of Parks and Recreation, or California State Parks (State Parks), defines its mission as follows, “…to provide the health, inspiration, and education of the people of California by helping to preserve the state’s extraordinary biological diversity, protecting its most valued natural and cultural resources, and providing opportunities for high‐quality recreational experiences based on those resources.” State Parks manages the California State Park System, including Burton Creek State Park, the Kings Beach State Recreation Area (SRA), the Tahoe SRA, Washoe Meadows State Park, Lake Valley SRA, Emerald Bay State Park, D.L. Bliss State Park, and Sugar Pine Point State Park in the Tahoe Region. Long‐range development and management of each state park is directed by a general plan, which provides broad policy and program guidance. Each California state park must have an approved general plan before any major park facilities can be developed. Several of the power line poles along the existing 625 Line are located within the southern boundary of Burton Creek State Park. The action alternatives would involve replacing the existing wood poles with taller steel poles within the existing alignment, installing new conductors, and expanding the width of the existing easement, as is required with taller poles. Relevant planning guidance from the Burton Creek State Park General Plan is summarized below.  Burton Creek State Park General Plan Burton Creek State Park is located adjacent to Tahoe City. The park has been in existence since 1978 when it was acquired by California State Parks. The purposes of the acquisition were to provide a large area of resource protection and outdoor recreation opportunities on the north side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The Burton Creek State Park General Plan (State Parks 2005) was developed to lay the foundation for possible future campground development; to describe and address the immediate need to develop day use and access facilities; to implement planned interpretive programming; and to implement a Road and Trail Plan for the park. The Burton Creek State Park General Plan also addresses integration of the park with the surrounding USFS and California Tahoe Conservancy properties, and private property. Segment 625-2 of the action alternatives runs adjacent to Burton Creek State Park. Several existing poles are located within the southern park boundary. As part of each OF the action alternatives, the existing wooden poles would be replaced with steel poles. Two existing roads within the Burton Creek State Park boundaries are proposed for use as project access roads. One of these roads would require some improvements for project access, however, the applicant has agreed at the request of California State Parks to complete the construction with no new access and with limited impact to the existing right of way.  Project consistency with relevant policies in the Burton Creek State Park General Plan is considered in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. CALIFORNIA TAHOE CONSERVANCY The California Tahoe Conservancy’s (Conservancy) mission is to preserve, protect, restore, enhance, and sustain the unique and significant natural resources and recreational opportunities of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Established by State law in 1984, the Conservancy’s jurisdiction extends throughout the California side of the Lake Tahoe Region, as defined in California Government Code Section 66905. The Conservancy develops and implements projects to improve water quality, preserve Lake Tahoe’s scenic beauty, provide recreational opportunities and public access, preserve wildlife habitat areas, and manage and restore lands to protect the natural environment. The Conservancy has the power to acquire, hold, and manage property in the Tahoe Region. Since 1984, the Conservancy has acquired more than 4,800 parcels of land, comprising more than 6,500 acres, for the purposes of protecting the natural environment and promoting public recreation and Lake access. The Conservancy manages and implements restoration and other projects on these lands. The Conservancy has also provided approximately 170 grants to local governments and non‐profit organizations for erosion control, public recreation and access, land acquisition, and other projects. Since 1997, the Conservancy’s programmatic efforts have been focused on California’s commitment to the implementation of the Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) for the Tahoe Region and to address declining resource values at Lake Tahoe. The Conservancy has adopted Special Use Guidelines (Conservancy 2011) to regulate special uses on their lands. “Special uses” involve the grant of a lease, license, or easement on Conservancy land to a public or private entity for a variety of uses. Such uses often include installation of utility lines. The Conservancy permits special uses on its lands consistent with its guidelines through the execution by both parties of one of three documents: a license, a lease, or an easement. The Conservancy has classified its special use requests into four distinct types of uses: Temporary Uses (duration of five days or less; use is granted pursuant to a lease or license agreement), Short Term Uses (duration of more than five days but less than six months; use is granted pursuant to a lease or license agreement), Long Term Uses (duration of 6 months or more, but is not of a permanent nature; use is granted pursuant to a lease or license agreement), and Permanent Uses (use of Conservancy land is permanent; use is granted pursuant to an easement). The type of use will determine: (1) the application procedure for special use requestors, and (2) the nature of the legal document granting the right to use Conservancy property. That is, each type of use carries with it distinct requirements pertaining to use, insurance, indemnification, impairment, waivers, attorney fees, notices, etc. Specific requirements are outlined in the Special Use Guidelines document (Conservancy 2011).  While none of the action alternatives cross Conservancy-owned properties, Segments 625-2 and 625-10 run adjacent to Conservancy-owned properties. Additionally, the action alternatives would include new access ways and access roads with needed improvements on Conservancy-owned property located at the intersection of Segments 625-1 and 625-2. The applicant may be required to apply for a special use request for new access ways and improved access roads on Conservancy-owned properties and would coordinate directly with Conservancy staff on permitting needs.  TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY REGIONAL PLAN TRPA implements its authority to regulate growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan. The Regional Plan includes Resolution 82-11, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards), Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, community plans, plan area statements, and other guidance documents. Under the Regional Plan Update adopted in December 2012, local agencies may develop area plans that supersede community plans and areas, but none have yet been adopted.  Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities TRPA has established Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards) and indicators for nine resource areas: water quality, air quality, scenic resources, soil conservation, fish habitat, vegetation, wildlife habitat, noise, and recreation. TRPA threshold standards are minimum standards of environmental quality targets to be achieved in the Tahoe Region. Until December 2012, when TRPA adopted its Regional Plan Update, the attainment status of each TRPA threshold standard was evaluated every five years; with the Regional Plan Update, they will be evaluated every four years, along with the Regional Plan itself and Regional Transportation Plan. The latest TRPA Threshold Evaluation was completed in April 2012. No threshold standard applies specifically to land use, and the adopted environmental threshold standards do not define the maximum populations, densities, permitted uses, and other land use criteria for the Region. However, the threshold standards do set performance criteria that may be influenced by land use planning considerations, including coverage, restoration‐based incentives, and allocation considerations. Land use planning considerations proposed in this EIS/EIS/EIR that could affect environmental threshold standards are discussed in the relevant resource sections. Goals and Policies The foundation of the Regional Plan, the Goals and Policies are statements of policy to guide decision making as it affects the Region’s resources and environmental thresholds, and they are intended to provide opportunities for orderly growth and development consistent with those thresholds. The Goals and Policies are addressed in six major elements: land use, transportation, conservation, recreation, public services and facilities, and implementation. The Land Use Subelement of the Regional Plan addresses policies pertaining to growth and development of the Lake Tahoe Region. It is intended to direct the amount, type, and location of land uses and land coverage; balance land uses with the social, environmental, and economic wellbeing of the Region; and coordinate regional land uses with land uses in surrounding areas. The project’s consistency with relevant policies in the Regional Plan is addressed in Appendix D of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  Code of Ordinances  The Code of Ordinances (Code) contains necessary provisions needed to implement the Regional Plan Goals and Policies. Adopted standards in the Code must be met by projects. The most recent Code of Ordinances (published October 24, 2012) was adopted by the TRPA Governing Board on December 12, 2012. Code standards applicable to specific resources (e.g., biological resources, hydrology and water quality, scenic, etc.) are described in those resource sections of this EIS/EIS/EIR. The following Code sections are relevant to the discussion of land use impacts for the project. Permissible Uses Chapter 50, Allocation of Development, of the TRPA Code sets forth the requirements for regulating the rate and timing of growth within the region. TRPA regulates growth through the issuance of allocations of residential units, commercial floor area, tourist accommodation units, and public service facilities. Allocations are generally only required for primary uses, meaning that an allocation is only required for the main use for which the parcel is developed.  Primary uses are defined in Chapter 21, Permissible Uses, of the TRPA Code. All parcels have one or more permissible primary uses. Primary uses are defined as either “allowed” or “special.” Plan area statements and community plans (described below) define which terms apply to a particular parcel. Examples of primary uses include public utility centers, transmission and receiving facilities, hotels and motels, eating and drinking places, and residences. Subsection 21.2.1 of the TRPA Code defines allowed uses as uses listed in the applicable plan area statement, community plan, redevelopment plan or specific plans that are appropriate uses for the specified area, and projects and activities pursuant to such uses may be permitted. By definition, allowed uses are assumed to be compatible with the direction of the Regional Plan and surrounding land uses. Special uses are uses that may be determined to be appropriate uses for the specified area, and projects and activities pursuant to such uses found to be appropriate may be permitted. To determine whether a special use is appropriate, TRPA must make the following findings (Subsection 21.2.2): (1) The project, to which the use pertains, is of such a nature, scale, density, intensity and type to be an appropriate use for the parcel on which, and surrounding area in which, it will be located; (2) The project, to which the use pertains, will not be injurious or disturbing to the health, safety, enjoyment of property, or general welfare of persons or property in the neighborhood, or general welfare of the region, and the applicant has taken reasonable steps to protect against any such injury and to protect the land, water and air resources of both the applicant’s property and that of surrounding property owners; and (3) The project, to which the use pertain, will not change the character of the neighborhood, detrimentally affect or alter the purpose of the applicable planning area statement, community plan and specific or master plan, as the case may be.  Uses not listed in the applicable plan area statements and community plans as permissible uses are prohibited (Subsection 21.2.4 of the TRPA Code). Also, proposed special uses for which the findings in Subsection 21.2.2 (above) cannot be made are prohibited uses.  Uses that are legally existing (commenced before the effective date of the Regional Plan, July 1, 1987) that would be prohibited if new are defined as non-conforming uses and may be continued (Subsection 21.2.3 of the TRPA Code). Non-conforming uses cannot be expanded or intensified. Modifications to a non-conforming use may be permitted only when TRPA finds that the modifications do not increase the extent of non-conformity (Subsection 21.5.2.C of the TRPA Code).  Accessory uses are also defined in Chapter 21 of the TRPA Code. Accessory uses are defined as a use, building, or other facility customarily a part of any primary use; that is clearly incidental and secondary to the primary use; that does not change the character or the intensity of the primary use; and that does not operate independent of the primary use. Driveways are an example of an accessory use. Impact 4.2-1 addresses whether proposed uses associated with the action alternatives are Permissible Uses.  Land Use Classification System Land in the Tahoe Region is assigned to one of five classifications: Conservation, Recreation, Residential, Commercial and Public Service, and Tourist. The classifications are a gross summarization of major land uses that exist in the Region and are further defined by Plan Areas and corresponding Plan Area Statements (PASs).  Plan Area Statements  The Tahoe Region is divided into Plan Areas, as shown on Exhibit 4.2-1, each of which has an adopted PAS which provides the planning blueprint for that area. PASs supplement and elaborate on the Placer County General Plan for the area they cover and provide a detailed guide for planning within discrete areas of the Region. Each Plan Area is assigned a single land use classification, and one of three management strategies: development with mitigation, redirection of development, or maximum regulation. Some Plan Areas are designated as Community Plan areas, receiving areas for transfer of development commodities, or areas targeted for scenic restoration and affordable housing provisions. Additionally, PASs identify planning considerations, special policies, maximum densities for residential and tourist accommodation uses, community noise equivalent levels, allowable and special uses, and the amount of additional recreation capacity permissible. All of the action alternatives include components that are within the following Plan Areas: Lower Truckee (003), 64-Acre Tract (174), Tahoe City (001A), Tahoe City Industrial (001B), Fairway Tract (002), Burton Creek (004), Watson Creek (013), Northstar (015), Martis Peak (019), Kingswood East (025), Woodvista (027), and Kings Beach Industrial (026). TRPA does not have traditional zoning designations for parcels located within its jurisdiction. Instead, each PAS designates a Land Use Classification (general plan designation) and a list of Permissible Uses (zoning).  Community Plans Currently, there are 16 Community Plan areas that have adopted plans. These plans supersede the PASs and are designed to be more responsive to the needs and opportunities of the respective communities. The original intent of the Community Plans was to concentrate commercial uses to reduce the negative effects of “strip” development and to provide incentives to renovate, revitalize, and remove blighted commercial development. With the adoption of the 2012 Regional Plan Update, community plans may be superseded by the adoption of future Area Plans (described below).  Community Plan areas are made up of one or more Plan Areas and contain commercial, tourist, and public service land uses. Community Plans describe a land use vision, development and coverage incentives, and environmental targets. Additionally, like PASs, Community Plans provide planning considerations, special policies, maximum densities for residential and tourist accommodation uses, community noise equivalent levels, allowable and special uses, among other planning guidance. The Community Plans applicable to the project area are: the Tahoe City Community Plan (TRPA and Placer County 1996a) and the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan (TRPA and Placer County 1996b). The project’s consistency with relevant policies in these Community Plans is addressed in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  Area Plans The concept of Area Plans was introduced with the adoption of the Regional Plan Update in 2012, wherein public agencies may prepare plans consistent with the Regional Plan and utilize new allowances for streamlined permitting and increased intensity in specific community centers. Local jurisdictions are encouraged to engage local residents and businesses and, in coordination with TRPA staff, prepare coordinated plans for implementation of land use goals and policies. The Area Plans, which would also include development ordinances and zoning designations, would be required to be consistent with the Regional Plan; they would be subject to an initial conformance evaluation and on-going implementation oversight by TRPA. PASs, Community Plans, and use-specific Master Plans remain in effect in the newly-adopted Regional Plan (2012) until superseded by an Area Plan that is developed in accordance with and found in conformance with the Regional Plan.  Placer County is in the early visioning process for separate Area Plans addressing four distinct areas in the Placer County portion of the Lake Tahoe Basin. The planning process is still in its infancy, and it is not anticipated that any of these Area Plans would be adopted and in effect prior to a decision on the proposed project. Environmental Improvement Program Launched in 1997, the Lake Tahoe EIP is a cooperative effort to preserve, restore and enhance the unique natural and human environment of the Lake Tahoe Region. The EIP program defines restoration needs for attaining environmental goals or thresholds and, through a substantial investment of resources, increases the pace at which the thresholds will be attained. Key to this strategy is reliance upon partnerships with all sectors of the community, including the private sector, local, state and federal government. The EIP identifies hundreds of specific projects and programs to be undertaken by more than 50 funding partners, including federal, state, and local agencies and the private sector. The projects focus on improving air, water, and scenic quality, forest health, fish and wildlife, and public access to the Lake and other recreation areas. The prime directive of the EIP is to move the Tahoe Region closer to environmental threshold standard attainment. The project’s consistency with this directive is addressed in each of the resource sections for which a TRPA threshold standard has been established, including Section 4.4, Scenic Resources; Section 4.5, Geology, Soils, Land Capability and Coverage; Section 4.6, Hydrology and Water Quality; Section 4.7, Biological Resources; Section 4.8, Recreation; Section 4.13, Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Climate Change; and Section 4.14, Noise. LOCAL AGENCIES PLACER COUNTY  Placer County General Plan The Placer County General Plan was adopted on August 16, 1994 (Placer County 1994). The General Plan provides an overall framework for development of the county and protection of its natural and cultural resources. The goals and policies contained in the Countywide General Plan are applicable throughout the County, except to the extent that County authority is preempted by cities within their corporate limits. The project’s consistency with relevant policies in the General Plan is addressed in Appendix D of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  Placer County Code The Placer County Code includes updates through Ordinance 5681-B and the October 2012 code supplement (available online: <http://qcode.us/codes/placercounty/>). Code standards applicable to specific resources (biological resources, water quality, etc.) are described and evaluated in those resource sections of this EIS/EIS/EIR. The following Code standards would be applicable to this project.  12.04.010 – Roads and Highways: Permit required (Digging along roads, etc.). It is unlawful for any person to dig, cut, open, excavate or maintain, or to cause to be dug, cut, opened, excavated or maintained, any ditch, cut, hole, drain, tunnel, or other opening, in, through, under, along, across or upon any county or public road, land, street, sidewalk, or highway in the county, without first procuring a permit from the department of public works.  12.04.020 – Roads and Highways: Permit required (Erection of poles along roads, etc.). It is unlawful for any person to erect or construct any pole line for any purpose over, across, along or upon any county or public road, land, street, sidewalk or highway in the county, without first obtaining a permit from the department of public works.  Source: Data received from TRPA and Tri Sage 2012; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.2-1 Plan Area Statement and Community Plan Boundaries  12.04.120 – Roads and Highways: Private access roads. It is unlawful for any person to construct or maintain any private driveway or access road to a county highway without providing such facilities as may be necessary for drainage under such private driveway or access roads with the drainage way along such county highway or without first obtaining a permit from the department of public works.   13.36.070 – Underground Utilities: Other exceptions. This article and any resolution adopted pursuant to Section 13.36.040 shall, unless otherwise provided in such resolution, not apply to the following types of facilities: D. Poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures used for the transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of thirty-four thousand five hundred (34,500) volts. NEVADA COUNTY  Nevada County General Plan The Nevada County General Plan was approved in 1996, and amended in 2008 and 2010 (Nevada County 2012). The General Plan guides the physical, economic, and environmental future of the County, and includes goals, objectives, policies, and implementation measures. The role of the General Plan is to provide the framework for the future physical growth of the County, and serve as the foundation for land use decisions. It expresses long term community development goals and embodies public policy related to the distribution of future land use. Because it embodies public policy, it is intended to be used by County decision makers to review new development in order to ensure that such development will contribute to achieving the vision for Nevada County which is inherent in the General Plan. The action alternatives do not include any permanent improvements (e.g., power poles and lines, access ways, and substations) in unincorporated Nevada County. Several staging areas (i.e., Airport Staging Areas 1, 2, and 3) under consideration for use as part of the action alternatives are located within Nevada County and outside of the limits of the Town of Truckee. Because use of these staging areas would be temporary and would require limited site improvements (e.g., vegetation clearing, minor improvements to dirt access ways, and construction fencing), General Plan land use policies, which are intended to guide new development, would not be applicable. For these reasons, Nevada County regulations are not discussed further herein.  TOWN OF TRUCKEE  Town of Truckee General Plan The 2025 General Plan represents the first update to the Town of Truckee’s General Plan since the Town adopted its first General Plan in 1996, following its incorporation in 1993. The Town of Truckee 2025 General Plan was adopted by the Town Council on November 16, 2006 (Town of Truckee 2006). Segments 650-6 and 650-7 of the action alternatives are located within the limits of the General Plan area. The project’s consistency with relevant policies in the General Plan is addressed in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. Downtown Truckee Specific Plan The purpose of the Downtown Truckee Specific Plan (1997) is to implement the Town of Truckee General Plan within the boundaries of the Downtown Study Area (Town of Truckee 1997). The Specific Plan sets forth the policies, projects, implementation plans, and regulations intended to ultimately achieve this directive. Segments 650-6 and 650-7 of the action alternatives are located within this area. The project’s consistency with relevant policies in the Specific Plan is addressed in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. Town of Truckee Development Code The Town of Truckee Development Code carries out the policies of the Truckee General Plan by classifying and regulating the uses of land and structures within the Town of Truckee. The Development Code is adopted to protect and to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of residents, and businesses in the Town. Code standards applicable to specific resources (biological resources, water quality, etc.) are described and evaluated in those resource sections of this EIS/EIS/EIR. The following Code standards are applicable to land use impacts pertaining to this project.  18.24.090 – Services and Utility Placement Design Guidelines. Service areas and public utilities should be located in a manner that does not interfere with the form of buildings or their landscape.   18.30.056A(1) – Structures within Easements. No structure shall be allowed within public utility easements, access/driveway easements, drainage easements or any other easement offered for dedication to the County of Nevada or the Town, except as follows: The structure serves the purpose of the easement. For example, an electrical transformer in a public utility easement.   18.58.114 – Electrical Utility Facilities. The standards shall apply to the following types of electrical facilities in compliance with State law (Government Code Sections 53091 and 53096 and Public Resources Code Section 12808.5): 1. Electrical distribution lines of 100,000 volts or greater; and 2. Electrical substations within an electrical transmission system which receives electricity at 100,000 volts or greater. OTHER RELEVANT PLANS TRUCKEE TAHOE AIRPORT LAND USE COMPATIBILITY PLAN The Truckee Tahoe Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (Foothill Airport Land Use Commission 2004) was developed to promote compatibility between the airport and surrounding land uses. The plan serves as a tool for use by the Foothill Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) in fulfilling its duty to review airport and adjacent land use development proposals. Additionally, the plan sets compatibility criteria applicable to local agencies in their preparation or amendment of land use plans and ordinances and to land owners in their design of new development. The plan incorporates requirements and guidelines from FAR Part 77, described previously. The influence area for the Truckee Tahoe Airport extends roughly 2.7 miles from the airport runways. This influence area encompasses lands within the Nevada County, Placer County, and the Town of Truckee. Additionally, portions of the airport influence area affect lands within the jurisdiction of the USFS, Tahoe National Forest and the USACE. Although the authority of the Foothill ALUC does not extend to federal lands, policies in the Compatibility Plan address the importance of coordination on airport land use compatibility matters. The policies establish compatibility criteria for future land use development in the airport environs. The policies also define the types of actions to be submitted for ALUC review and the procedures that the ALUC will follow in making compatibility determinations. Segments 650-3, 650-4 (Alternative 1: PEA Alternative and Alternative 4: Proposed Alternative), 650-4A (Alternative 2: Modified Alternative), 650-4B (Alternative 3: Road Focused Alternative [there is no difference between Alternatives 3 and 3A in this area]), 650-6 and 650-7 pass through the ALUC Compatibility Zones B1, C, D, and E. The regulatory setting in Section 4.10, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, describes the height limits and other restrictions on uses within each of these capability zones. The project’s consistency with relevant restrictions and policies from the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan is addressed in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. MARTIS VALLEY COMMUNITY PLAN The Martis Valley consists of an area of land that is approximately 70 square miles near the Town of Truckee in the central Sierra Nevada. The Martis Valley is located in both Nevada and Placer Counties, encompassing approximately 44,800 total acres. Within Placer County, however, Martis Valley consists of approximately 25,570 acres, or roughly 57 percent of the total acreage of the Valley. Land use patterns consist of a wide range of urban and commercial areas, forest lands, public and private recreational areas and facilities, as well as areas designated for airport use.  The Martis Valley Community Plan (MVCP) (Placer County 2003) provides a detailed focus on a specific geographic area of the unincorporated County, the Martis Valley. Some of the goals, policies, and implementation measures contained in the MVCP repeat those contained in the Placer County General Plan that are important to the MVCP area. Others supplement and elaborate upon (but not supersede) those contained in the General Plan to address specific community concerns and issues. In some instances, the MVCP relies entirely upon the General Plan to address certain issues which are not unique to the MVCP area and which are more appropriately addressed in the broader context in the General Plan. The land use designations set forth in the land-use map for the MVCP are consistent with, and are designed to implement, the goals, policies, and programs set forth in the General Plan. Policies in the General Plan and the MVCP shall be construed in a manner that harmonizes and implements the policies set forth in both documents. If, in the context of a particular program or development proposal, a policy in the General Plan cannot be reconciled with a policy in the MVCP, then the policy in the General Plan shall govern. The project’s consistency with relevant policies in the MVCP is addressed in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  4.2.2 EXISTING CONDITIONS/AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT This section summarizes the existing land uses, designated land uses, and zoning designations of lands in the project area. Federal and state agencies with jurisdiction over the project do not have land use designations for lands under their oversight or management. For this reason, the maps only identify federal and state land boundaries. Any underlying land use designations are defined by local and regional jurisdictions and agencies. Exhibit 4.2-2 depicts the jurisdictional land use boundaries of the Town of Truckee, Placer County, and TRPA. Maps detailing the land use designations for these jurisdictions are provided in Exhibits 4.2-3, 4.2-4, and 4.2-5. EXISTING LAND USES AND DESIGNATIONS EXISTING 625 LINE Land Uses The existing 625 Line is located entirely within the unincorporated area of northeastern Placer County and generally follows an existing, partially-paved road (the Fiberboard Freeway) that is utilized for recreational and forestry-related activities. Approximately 13.4 miles of the approximately 15-mile-long power line is located on land managed by the USFS. The remaining portion of the line is located on state-owned lands within Burton Creek State Park and privately-owned land (Sierra Pacific 2010). See Exhibit 3-2 in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. One terminus of the existing 625 Line is at the Kings Beach Substation (end of Segment 625-10), which is located within the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Station, and situated north of the intersection of Deer Street and Speckled Avenue in Kings Beach. The area surrounding the Kings Beach Substation is forested and contains dispersed recreation facilities. From the station, the line heads in a northerly direction, until the end of Segment 625-10. Single-family homes are located west of the line in this section, and forested NFS land to the east. At the start of Segment 625-9, the line turns west and spans SR 267 at approximate the start of Segment 625-8. This portion of the line is located within forested areas of the USFS, LTBMU. The area is undeveloped, except for dirt access roads and recreational trails (Sierra Pacific 2010). From the intersection with SR 267, the existing 625 Line heads southwest and continues across NFS lands through Segments 625-6 and 625-5. The nearest development in these segments is the Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort, located north of the existing 625 Line. Segment 625-4 and a portion of Segment 625-3 pass through NFS lands managed by the Tahoe National Forest. The line then heads south through NFS lands managed by the USFS, LTBMU in Segment 625-3, and turns east in Segment 625-2,with a few power poles within the limits of the southern boundary of Burton Creek State Park for approximately 0.5 mile. A portion of the line ROW encroaches into Burton Creek State Park and there are several poles within the park boundaries. From this location, the 625 Line turns to the south and continues through the NFS land. This entire portion of the existing 625 Line travels through forested USFS land that is undeveloped, except for dirt roads and recreational trails (Sierra Pacific 2010).  After spanning SR 89 and the Truckee River at the start of Segment 625-1, the line turns in a northeasterly direction and parallels the Truckee River until terminating at the Tahoe City Substation. This portion of the line is bordered by the Truckee River to the north and the USFS-owned 64 Acre Recreation Site, which is comprised of recreational trails, restrooms, picnic areas, public restrooms, and parking managed by the Tahoe City Public Utility District, to the south. The existing 625 Line terminates at the Tahoe City Substation located on the west side of SR 89, across from the Truckee River Outlet (Fanny Bridge). The area surrounding the power line and the Tahoe City Substation to the north and east is commercially developed with restaurants and tourism-related uses (Sierra Pacific 2010). Land Use Designations The majority (approximately 80 percent) of the existing 625 Line is located within the regulatory jurisdiction of the TRPA, because of its location within the Lake Tahoe Basin. The remaining 20 percent of the power line is located in Placer County. Most of the land crossed by the existing 625 Line is designated as either Recreation or Conservation in the applicable TRPA PASs. Approximately 0.2 mile of the existing 625 Line near the Tahoe City Substation is within the Tahoe City Community Plan and is classified as Mixed Use. All of the applicable TRPA PAS classifications allow power lines under the provisions for a Special Use.  Two segments of the existing 625 Line – where the line spans SR 267 and just west of the Watson Creek Plan Area – are located within Placer County, but outside the boundary of the Lake Tahoe Basin, and thus outside of TRPA jurisdiction. The Placer County General Plan has designated the land use within these segments as Forest and Open Space along SR 267, and Agriculture/Timberland west of the Watson Creek Plan Area. These segments are zoned for Forestry (FOR), Timberland Production (TPZ), and Open Space (O). The allowed uses in the FOR, TPZ, and O zoning districts include growing and harvesting of timber and other forest products, agriculture and grazing, as well as public and commercial recreational uses. Power lines are listed as an allowed use in the FOR, TPZ, and O zoning districts.  PROPOSED RELOCATED 625 LINE Land Uses The four action alternatives (Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4) all propose realigning the 625 Line to generally parallel the path of the existing 625 Line, except in Segments 625-9 and 625-10. Because the proposed relocated 625 Line would follow a similar alignment as the existing 625 Line in Segments 625-1 through 625-8 (albeit offset from its current alignment by up to 0.75 mile in some reaches [see Exhibit 4.2-1]), the same types of existing land uses are present (forest, conservation, and recreation). Single-family residences are located along the proposed 625 Line alignments in the same locations as the existing 625 Line (near both termini, where existing and proposed run coincident). For Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Segments 625-9 and 625-10 would generally follow the path of the existing 625 Line and would have the same types of existing land uses. For Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) the difference is that in this case the line would be double circuited with the 650 Line in these segments. However, Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) do not include Segments 625-10 and 625-9, as the 625 Line would be double circuited with the 650 Line on the existing 650 Line alignment that runs parallel to and east of SR 267 for this portion of the line. See the description for Segments 650-1 D-C OH-1/1A and 650-2 D-C OH-2, below.  Source: Data received from Placer County, Tri Sage, and TRPA 2012; Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.2-2 Land Use Jurisdiction Overview Map Source: Data received from TRPA and Tri Sage 2012; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.2-3 TRPA Land Use Designations Map Source: Data received from Placer County, TRPA, and Tri Sage 2012; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.2-4 Placer County Land Use Designations Map Source: Data received from Placer County and Tri Sage 2012; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.2-5 Truckee Land Use Designations Map Land Use Designations The action alternatives for the proposed relocated 625 Line are offset from the existing 625 Line in various segments. In Segments 625-1 and 625-2, the alternatives are the same as the existing 625 Line, and share the same land use designations and allowable uses. In Segments 625-3 through 625-8, the four action alternatives vary in location from the existing line, but all fall within the same TRPA land use designations and allowable uses (and Placer County Land Use Designations and Zoning for the portions outside TRPA jurisdiction). The proposed alternative alignments for the 625 Line would not cross any new Placer County land use designations and zoning or TRPA land use designations or Plan Areas that are not already crossed by the existing 625 Line alignment and discussed in the previous section. EXISTING 650 LINE Land Uses The portion of the 650 Line to be upgraded begins at the end of Segment 650-4 and heads south then east through the Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area (see the discussion of the 132/650 Line Double-Circuit below for information on Segments 650-6 and 650-7). The line continues east then heads north, crossing SR 267 at the end of Segment 650-3. The line turns east, through an area generally known as the Martis Valley. Geographically, the area is primarily flat and lacks any significant development. The line then continues south and parallels SR 267 through Placer County for the remainder of Segment 650-3. The land surrounding SR 267 lacks significant commercial or residential development and is forested. The nearest housing or commercial development in Segment 650-3 is the Northstar-at-Tahoe Golf Course and Resort. In Segment 650-2, the line travels east, and passes through NFS land managed by the USFS, LTBMU before entering Kings Beach for the remainder of Segment 650-2 and all of Segment 650-1. In Segment 650-1, residential uses are clustered near the power line. The terminus of the existing 650 Line is at the Brockway Substation. The area around the Brockway Substation is located within a mixed industrial/commercial neighborhood, and is surrounded by single-family residences to the east, west, and south (Sierra Pacific 2010). Land Use Designations The 650 Line traverses areas where land use is dictated by both Placer County and TRPA. From the end of Segment 650-4 to the end of Segment 650-2 (just past the Brockway Summit), the line is located within Placer County and is within the Martis Valley Community Plan Area. The general plan designation, as described in the community plan, is Open Space, which allows for low-intensity public and commercial recreational uses, as well as necessary public utility facilities. From Brockway Summit to the terminus of the line at the Brockway Substation, the TRPA regulates land use in the Martis Peak Plan Area, the Kingswood East Plan Area, and the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area. The TRPA Martis Peak PAS designates the land use as Conservation and the Kingswood East PAS designates the land use as Residential. The permitted uses include summer homes, and recreational uses such as campgrounds, snowmobile courses, and hiking trails. Power lines are allowed under the provisions for a Special Use (see Impact 4.2-1). Additionally, Segments 650-3 and 650-4 pass through the Truckee Tahoe Airport Influence Area Boundary. The existing line passes through Compatibility Zones C, D, and E.  PROPOSED 650 LINE Land Uses  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would follow the path of the existing 650 Line, entirely, and therefore would have the same types of existing land uses as described for the existing 650 Line, above. Alternatives 2 (Modified Alternative) and Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would follow the same alignment as the existing 650 Line in Segment 650-3, and therefore the same types of existing land uses are located within that segment. Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would deviate from the path of the existing 650 Line in Segments 650-1, 650-2, and 650-4A. In Segments 650-1 and 650-2, the line would be double-circuited with the 625 Line Segments 625-10 D-C OH-3 and 625-9 D-C OH-4. Existing land uses are described above for the Existing 625 Line. The area surrounding the Kings Beach Substation is forested and contains dispersed recreation facilities. As the line leaves the station, it heads in a northerly direction, until the end of Segment 625-10 D-C OH-3. Along this section, there are single-family homes located west of the line, and forested NFS land to the east. At the start of Segment 625-9 D-C OH-4, the line turns west and spans SR 267 at approximate the start of Segment 625-8. In Segment 650-4A, the line would be located approximately 0.25 mile to the north of the existing 650 Line, and generally would include the same types of land uses.  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would deviate from the path of the existing 650 Line in Segments 650-1 and 650-4B. Two options are included for Segment 650-1. One option routes the 650 Line along the existing 650 Line pathway, but would double-circuit it with the 625 Line, as Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1. Land uses for this option would be the same in this segment as for the existing 650 Line. The second option would route the 650 Line along SR 267, as Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1A (Alternative). The land uses along SR 267 in this area are similar to the existing 650 Line with single-family residences located along SR 267 and Speckled Avenue. In Segment 650-4B, the line is located approximately 0.5 mile to the north of the existing 650 Line, and joins the existing line in Segment 650-5 further north, passing closer to the Truckee Tahoe Airport.  Land Use Designations Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would follow the path of the existing 650 Line, entirely, and therefore would have the same types of land use designations as described for the existing 650 Line, above. Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would follow the same alignment as the existing 650 Line in Segment 650-3, and therefore the land use designations are the same. Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would deviate from the path of the existing 650 Line in Segments 650-1, 650-2, and 650-4A. Under this alternative, Segments 650-1 and 650-would be double-circuited with 625 Line Segments 625-9 and 625-10 and would have the same land use designations as described for those segments above. In Segment 650-4A, the line would pass through land that is designated as Water Influence and Open Space. Additionally, Segments 650-3 and 650-4A would pass through the Truckee Tahoe Airport Influence Area Boundary, Compatibility Zones C, D, and E. Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) and Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would deviate from the path of the existing 650 Line in Segment 650-1. Two options are included for Segment 650-1. One option would route the 650 Line along the existing 650 Line pathway, but in a double circuit with the 625 Line, as Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1. Land use designations in this segment are the same as for the existing 650 Line. The second option would route the 650 Line along SR 267, as Segment 650-1 D-C OH-1A. The TRPA land use designation in this segment is Residential. Under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), the line in Segment 650-4B would pass through land that is designated by Placer County as Water Influence and Open Space. Additionally, Segments 650-3 and 650-4B of Alternative 3 pass through the Truckee Tahoe Airport Influence Area Boundary, Compatibility Zones B1, C, D, and E. 132/650 LINE DOUBLE-CIRCUIT Land Uses The segment of the existing 132 Line (Segment 650-7) that would be upgraded to accommodate a double circuit with the 650 Line, and the stretch that is already double-circuited but would be upgraded to accommodate a 120 kV capacity 650 Line (Segment 650-6), are located within the Town of Truckee. The 132 Line originates at the North Truckee Substation. The line runs east along Pioneer Trail Road and then turns south, crossing I-80. In this area, the line is surrounded by medium-density commercial and industrial developments, such as tire shops, repair businesses, and general office uses. The line then turns east and travels parallel to Glenshire Drive. This area contains many undeveloped parcels, as well as low-intensity industrial uses and materials storage yards. The 132/650 Line then turns south and crosses the Truckee River. The alignment continues along the easternmost edge of the Truckee River Regional Park, which includes ball fields, an amphitheater, a skate park, and rodeo grounds, among other recreation opportunities. Adjacent to this portion of the line on the west side of the ROW are residential uses (multi-family units). The line continues south through private open space to its termination at the intersection of Marc Trail and Chris Course at the northwest corner of the Village Green Mobile Home Park. In this area, the line spans the rear of a hotel parking lot then travels parallel to the backyards of five units at Village Green Mobile Home Park. Vacant land is located to the west of the line in this area (Sierra Pacific 2010). Land Use Designations The 132/650 Line is entirely within the Town of Truckee and land uses are dictated by the Town of Truckee General Plan. Portions of the alignment, as it travels along Glenshire Drive and near downtown Truckee (Segments 650-7 and 650-6), are also located within the Downtown Specific Plan Area. From the beginning of the line at the North Truckee Substation to Glenshire Drive, the area is comprised of commercial and industrial uses consistent with the general plan designation of Industrial (I). As the alignment travels south, the land is General Plan-designated Residential and Public. The line travels east along Glenshire Drive and then south, crossing the Truckee River. This area is designated as Open Space Recreation, Industrial, Public (Truckee River Regional Park), and Residential. The line continues south crossing Brockway Road then continues to the termination of the line. The line passes through parcels that are designated Residential in the General Plan. Additionally, Segments 650-6 and 650-7 pass through the Truckee Tahoe Airport Influence Area Boundary, Compatibility Zones C and D. NORTHSTAR TAP/FOLD Land Uses The Northstar Tap/Fold begins at the Northstar Substation, located at the end of Stable Road in the Northstar-at-Tahoe Resort area. This 0.5-mile-long section of line generally traverses forested areas adjacent to an existing dirt road. There is limited commercial development located to the north. In addition, a horse stable and riding ring are crossed by the existing Northstar Tap near the line’s terminus at the Northstar Substation (Sierra Pacific 2010).  Land Use Designations Land use along the Northstar Fold is located in Placer County. The parcels traversed by the line are designated Forest, Residential, and Open Space.  BROCKWAY SUBSTATION Land Uses The Brockway Substation is located in Kings Beach at the intersection of Speckled Avenue and Deer Street. This substation is the current terminus of the existing 650 Line. The substation is located in a mixed-use neighborhood, with an industrial use located to the east of the substation and single-family residences located to the north, west, and south (Sierra Pacific 2010).  Land Use Designations Land use in and around the Brockway Substation is regulated by TRPA and guided by the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan, which sets forth land use designations and permissible uses. Land uses in this area are designated as Commercial/Public Service. Power lines and substations are allowed under the Special Use provisions of the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan (see Impact 4.2-1). NORTHSTAR SUBSTATION Land Uses The Northstar Substation is located on Northstar Drive in Placer County. This substation is the current termination point for the Northstar Tap, which would be upgraded to a fold as part of the project. The substation is surrounded by forested area to the north, south, and west. A riding stable (Northstar Stables) is located to the northeast of the substation. Approximately 25 single-family residences are located 450 feet west of the Northstar Substation (Sierra Pacific 2010). Land Use Designations Land use around the substation is designated by the Placer County General Plan as Forest and has a zoning designation is FOR-B-X-160. The FOR zoning classification designates the area as Forest and the B-X is a combining district designation that defines the minimum buildable lot size, in this case 160 acres. Allowed uses in the FOR-B-X zoning district include forestry and timber-related uses, grazing, and recreation. Power lines and public utility facilities are allowed uses. SQUAW VALLEY SUBSTATION Land Uses The Squaw Valley Substation is located at the intersection of Squaw Valley Road and SR 89. A small, commercial center is located to the east of the site, Squaw Valley Academy is located to the southwest, and forested land is located to the northwest and north (Sierra Pacific 2010). Land Use Designations Land use surrounding the substation is designated Conservation Preserve and zoned Forest Recreation by the Placer County General Plan. Allowed uses include public utility structures. TAHOE CITY SUBSTATION Land Uses The Tahoe City Substation is located near the intersection of Westlake Boulevard/SR 89 and Tahoe Tavern Road. This substation is the current termination point for the existing 625 Line. The Bridgetender restaurant is located to the north of the Tahoe City Substation and forested, undeveloped parcels are located to the south. The Truckee River and the 64 Acre Recreation Site is located to the west and commercial and tourism-related uses are located to the east.  Land Use Designations The substation site is within the jurisdiction of the TRPA and is subject to the land use regulations of the Tahoe City Community Plan. The Community Plan divides the greater Tahoe City area into five Special Areas that are characterized by their location and level and type of development. The Tahoe City Substation site is classified as Commercial/Public Service and is located in Special Area 3. Power lines and substations are allowed under the Special Use provisions of the Community Plan (see Impact 4.2-1). TRUCKEE SUBSTATION AND NORTH TRUCKEE SUBSTATION Land Uses The Truckee Substation serves as one terminus of the 650 Line. The substation is located near the intersection of Donner Pass Road and Church Street in the Town of Truckee. The Truckee Substation site is relatively flat and is surrounded by industrial uses on all sides (Sierra Pacific 2010).  The North Truckee Substation is located on Pioneer Trail Road, just south of Comstock Drive, and would serve as a terminus of the 650 Line upon completion of the project. The substation is surrounded by commercial and industrial uses to the south and east. A cement manufacturing plant is located to the north and undeveloped forested parcels are located to the west (Sierra Pacific 2010).  Land Use Designations The Truckee Substation is designated as Public by the Town of Truckee General Plan and is zoned Public Facilities (PF). Auxiliary uses required to meet the needs of the town, such as public parks and other facilities, schools, and government offices, are allowed. Electric utility facilities are allowed with a Use Permit. The North Truckee Substation is located within the Town of Truckee. The Town of Truckee General Plan designates the land as Industrial and the zoning as Manufacturing/Industrial (M). Allowed uses include processing, distribution, and storage facilities. Electric utility facilities are allowed in the M zoning district with a Use Permit. KINGS BEACH SUBSTATION Land Uses The Kings Beach Substation is located inside the Kings Beach Diesel Generation Facility property, just north of the intersection of Speckled Avenue and Deer Street in Kings Beach. The substation is accessed via a private road north of Deer Street and is entirely surrounded by undeveloped and forested parcels (Sierra Pacific 2010). Land Use Designations The Kings Beach Substation is located on an approximately 20-acre parcel within TRPA jurisdiction. The site is located partially within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan, and partially within the Martis Peak Plan Area. The existing substation and diesel generating facility are located within the Martis Peak Plan Area. The land use classification for the site as designated in the Martis Peak PAS is Conservation and the list of permissible uses per the PAS includes camping, off-road vehicle uses, public services, timber harvesting, and summer homes. Power lines are allowed under the Special Use provisions of the PAS. However, “Public Utility Center,” the use definition that includes substations, is not an allowable use as defined in the PAS. See Impact 4.2-1 for a discussion of this issue.  STAGING AREAS To support construction, the applicant has identified 12 possible staging areas. These staging areas are depicted on Figures 4.2-2 through 4.2-5 and are described further in the following paragraphs. The same staging areas are being considered for each action alternative, and all of the staging areas evaluated may not be required. The Northstar Golf Course and SPI staging areas would only be used if an agreement can be reached with the landowner. Additionally, only one of the Airport 1, Airport 2, Airport 3, and USACE staging areas would be used, if an agreement can be reached with a landowner. All four are evaluated because it is unclear at this time which, if any, might ultimately become available. Tahoe City The proposed Tahoe City Staging Area is located approximately 1 mile north of the Tahoe City Substation and is accessed by an existing dirt access road from Jackpine Street in Tahoe City. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and staging. This approximately 600-foot by 250-foot area is previously disturbed and covered with gravel. The primary vegetation type of the surrounding area is mixed conifer woodland. The site was used as a staging area and helicopter landing zone for the recent 629 Line upgrade (line extending along SR 89 from Squaw Valley to Tahoe City). Use of the site for staging would require installation of temporary fencing, but no other improvements would be required to prepare this staging area for use. The site is located in the Tahoe City Industrial Plan Area. The applicable PAS classifies the land as Commercial/Public Service and permissible uses include storage yards, warehousing, building materials and hardware storage, and industrial services. Fiberboard Freeway The proposed Fiberboard Freeway Staging Area is located approximately 200 feet east of the proposed rerouted 625 Line alignment near Segment 625-3 and is accessed from the Fiberboard Freeway. This staging area would be used to store and stage material and equipment, and for vegetation removal related to the project. This approximately 200-foot by 100-foot area is previously disturbed but has some vegetative cover. The staging area is located on lands where the allowed uses are designated by TRPA within the Burton Creek Plan Area. The staging area is designated Conservation, which allows for a range of low to moderate uses, including timber harvesting, wildlife management, grazing of livestock, and recreation. A staging area is an allowed use by the TRPA provided it is temporary, would not contribute to stormwater pollution, and would not contribute to visual impacts. Former Batch Plant The proposed Former Batch Plant Staging Area is located just off the Fiberboard Freeway near Segment 625-4. This staging area would be used to store and stage material and equipment, and may also be used for logging activities related to the project. This approximately 120-foot by 80-foot area is previously disturbed and supports little natural vegetation. This staging area is located within the jurisdiction of the TRPA and the land use designation and allowed uses are described in the Northstar PAS. The site is designated Recreation, and utility facilities, timber management, and accessory structures are allowed uses. A staging area is an allowed use by the TRPA, provided the staging area is temporary in nature, is constructed with the proper BMPs to avoid increased stormwater pollution, and has no visual impacts. Kings Beach The Kings Beach Staging Area is located just north of the Kings Beach Substation and is accessed using an existing dirt access road located at the end of Canterbury Drive. This location was formerly used as a landfill and as a result, has a previously disturbed area that measures approximately 300 feet by 300 feet. This staging area is located within the jurisdiction of the TRPA and the land use designation and allowed uses are described in the Martis Peak PAS. The Martis Peak PAS designates the land as Conservation and the list of permissible uses include camping, off-road vehicle uses, public services, timber harvesting, and summer homes. A staging area is allowed by the TRPA provided the staging area is temporary in nature, is constructed with the proper BMPs to avoid increased stormwater pollution, and has no visual impacts. SPI  The Southern Pacific Industries (SPI) Staging Area would be used for material and equipment storage, as well as equipment staging. Most of this site has been previously disturbed. Use of the 0.6 acre site would require vegetation clearing, improvement to an existing dirt access road and new access way, and installation of temporary construction fencing. The staging area would be located north of Segment 625-9/DC OH-4 and east of 650-3 on land designated Forest in the Martis Valley Community Plan and zoned Forestry by Placer County.  Northstar Parking 1 The 3.5 acre Northstar Parking 1 staging area would be located in Northstar-at-Tahoe’s paved Castle Peak Park and Ride lot off of Northstar Drive on land designated Forest in the Martis Valley Community Plan and zoned Forestry by Placer County.  Northstar Parking 2 The Northstar Parking 2 staging area would also be located in Northstar-at-Tahoe’s Castle Peak Park and Ride lot, east of the Northstar Parking 1 staging area on land designated Forest in the Martis Valley Community Plan and zoned Forestry by Placer County.  Northstar Golf Course The Northstar Golf Course Staging Area is located just north of SR 267 and the Northstar Golf Course, and is accessed by a dirt road located approximately 1.4 miles southeast of Martis Creek Road. This approximately 300-foot by 300-foot staging area would be used to store materials and stage equipment. The site is located within Placer County and is owned by the Truckee Tahoe Airport District. The site is General Plan-designated Open Space and is zoned O. Allowed uses include storage as an accessory use. Airport 1 This approximately 4 acre staging area would be located on airport property in Nevada County, immediately west of Martis Creek Road. Nevada County has designated this area as Open Space. Low intensity land uses consistent with the purpose of providing protected open space are permitted in this district. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. Airport 2 The Airport 2 Staging Area would be located on undeveloped property northeast of Segment 650-4 and SR 267. The staging area would be south of the airport and parallel to the runway. This approximately 8 acre staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. The Airport 2 Staging Area would be partially located on land designated Planned Community in the Town of Truckee, and partially on land designated Industrial by Nevada County. Staging areas are consistent with Nevada County’s Industrial districts. Airport 3 The Airport 3 Staging Area would be located on undeveloped airport property in Nevada County. Nevada County has designated the area as Industrial. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. Staging areas are consistent with Nevada County’s Industrial districts. USACE The USACE staging area would be located on less than 2 acres of land designated as Open Space in Nevada County. Low intensity land uses consistent with the purpose of providing protected open space are permitted in this district. The entire site has been previously disturbed. This staging area would be used as a helicopter landing zone and for material storage and equipment staging. 4.2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND RECOMMENDED MITIGATION MEASURES SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA TRPA CRITERIA The “Land Use” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist (IEC) were used to define the land use topics for evaluation. As described in Section 4.1.1, the purpose of the TRPA IEC is primarily to determine if an EIS is required and to help define the topics to be evaluated in greater detail. While many of the IEC checklist questions are conducive for use as significance criteria (that is, they include a defined standard, qualitative or quantitative), many are not, such as those for land use. The checklist asks whether the project would result in the following conditions.  Include uses which are not listed as permissible uses in the applicable Plan Area Statements and adopted Community Plans?  Expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use?  Propose uses inconsistent with applicable goals and policies of the TRPA Regional Plan, and applicable Plan Area Statements and Community Plans? The analysis of these issues herein identifies whether these conditions of plan compliance or non-compliance would occur under the action alternatives, but also assesses whether and to what degree the alternatives would result in incompatible land uses or land use conflicts.  NEPA CRITERIA An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the TRPA and CEQA criteria used for this analysis. CEQA CRITERIA In accordance with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, an alternative was determined to result in a significant impact related to land use if it would:  physically divide an established community;  conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, local coastal program, or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect; or  conflict with any applicable habitat conservation or natural community conservation plan.  ISSUES DISMISSED FROM FURTHER EVALUATION To physically divide an established community, a project must introduce or expand an element that creates a hindrance to safe and efficient movement throughout the community. An example of a type of project that could physically divide an established community is a new highway or railroad that passes through a community. These types of projects may hinder safe pedestrian and bicycle crossings and create a real or perceived disconnection in the community. Utility lines are not inherently divisive features, as they are either located overhead or below ground, and do not hinder travel in a community. Additionally, these features are predominant in developed areas. Proposed access ways that would accommodate access to the power poles for inspection and maintenance purposes would be located in forested areas and would not divide an established community (Exhibits 3-4a, 3-4b, 3-4c, and 3-4d). The proposed substation improvements would occur within the boundaries of existing facilities, and as such, these improvements would not create a hindrance to safe and efficient movement through any community affected by the project. Because the project components associated with all of the action alternatives are not of the nature that would divide an established community or restrict safe and efficient movement, this significance criterion is not addressed further in this section. As discussed in Section 4.7, Biological Resources, none of the action alternatives would be constructed within an area covered under an adopted habitat conservation plan, natural community conservation plan, or other approved local, regional, or state conservation plan. Therefore, project implementation would not conflict with the provisions of an adopted conservation plan and this issue is not evaluated further.  METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS The land use analysis involved a review of various federal, state, city, county, and regional land use plans, policies, and regulations. Land use and policy information from Placer County, TRPA, and Town of Truckee official websites was reviewed. The land use analysis also included a review of applicable general plan maps covering the project area. Land use-related Geographic Information System (GIS) data was obtained from the Placer County Planning Department, TRPA, and the Town of Truckee, and was used to verify jurisdictional information collected. A review of USACE, USFS, and California State Parks plans was performed to confirm jurisdictional boundaries and identify applicable management practices and standards. ALTERNATIVE 1 – PEA ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.2-1 (Alt.1)  Introduce uses not listed as permissible in the PAS or Community Plan, expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that substantial land use conflicts or incompatibility would occur. All components of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) are listed as permissible in the applicable PASs and Community Plans, except the existing distribution underbuild on the 625 Line within the Lower Truckee (003) PAS and the proposed upgrade of the Kings Beach Substation in the Martis Peak (019) PAS. The existing distribution underbuild in the Lower Truckee (003) PAS is a non-conforming use, but the relocation of the underbuild to the upgraded power poles would neither expand nor intensify this use, because the distribution underbuild would simply be moved to the new poles—the capacity, conductor, and related infrastructure would not be altered. The proposed amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS would add “Public Utility Center” to the list of permissible uses, would accommodate the expanded substation in the most appropriate location (in the location of the existing substation and more distant from the residential area than would otherwise be allowed), and would allow the decommissioning of the Brockway Substation. The proposed access ways would be accessory to the power lines. Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) includes uses that are listed as both “allowable” and “special” by TRPA Code. The findings in Subsection 21.2.1 of the TRPA Code can be made for those project components defined as special uses in the applicable PAS/Community Plan. Therefore, because Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) components would be permissible with the adoption of the amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS and necessary special use findings could be made, Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use. This would be a less-than-significant impact.  All components of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) are listed as permissible in the applicable PASs and Community Plans, except the existing distribution underbuild on the 625 Line within the Lower Truckee (003) PAS and the proposed upgrade of the Kings Beach Substation in the Martis Peak (019) PAS to allow the decommissioning of the Brockway Substation. The regulations that govern permissible uses are contained in Chapter 21 of the TRPA Code and summarized above in Section 4.2.1, Regulatory Setting.  Each of the project components falls within a permissible use category defined in Table 21.4-A, List of Primary Uses and Definitions, in Chapter 21 of the TRPA Code. The project components and their respective primary use category are listed in Table 4.2-1 below. Note that access ways are defined as accessory uses, as described below, and as such are not listed in Table 4.2-1. Table 4.2-1 Project Components and Respective Primary Use Category  Project Component  Chapter 21 Primary Use Category  Substation  Public Utility Center  Power Line  Pipelines and Power Transmission  Underbuild (Distribution or Communications Lines)  Transmission and Receiving  Components of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) are located within nine PASs and two Community Plans. Each PAS is assigned one of five land use classifications: conservation, recreation, residential, commercial and public service, and tourist accommodation. Each land use classification specifies categories of permissible uses and identifies them as either an “Allowable” (A) or “Special” (S) use. Any use not listed is considered either prohibited or non-conforming. Table 4.2-2 lists the applicable PASs and Community Plans and identifies whether the relevant primary use categories for the project are permissible, as well as whether they are allowable or special uses. The existing substations and proposed substation improvements within the Lake Tahoe Basin are limited to parcels within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan (Brockway Substation); Martis Peak (019) PAS (Kings Beach Substation); and the Tahoe City Community Plan (Tahoe City Substation). As such, Table 4.2-2 only identifies permissible uses for Public Utility Centers in these planning documents. Table 4.2-2 Permissible Uses for Relevant Project Components  by Plan Area Statement/Community Plan  Plan Area Statement/  Community Plan  Land Use Classification 1  Primary Use Categories  Public Utility Center  Pipelines and Power Transmission  Transmission and Receiving Facilities  N/A  Tahoe City Community Plan (Special Area #3)  Commercial/Public Service  S  S  S  174  64 Acre Tract  Recreation  S  S  S  003  Lower Truckee  Recreation  S  S  N/A2  004  Burton Creek  Conservation  N/A  S  S  001B  Tahoe City Industrial  Commercial/Public Service  A  S  S  015  North Star  Recreation  N/A  S  S  013  Watson Creek  Conservation  N/A  S  S  019  Martis Peak  Conservation  N/A2  S  S  025  Kingswood East  Residential  S  S  S  027  Woodvista  Residential  S  S  S  N/A  Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan  Commercial/Public Service  S  A  A  Abbreviations: A = Allowable, S = Special, N/A = Not Applicable/Prohibited Use 1  Each PAS is assigned one of five land use classifications: conservation, recreation, residential, commercial and public service, and tourist. Classification descriptions are contained in Section 11.6.2 of the TRPA Code. 2 The Kings Beach Substation and the underbuild on the existing 625 Line are legally existing non-conforming uses.  Source: TRPA and Placer County 1996a, 1996b; TRPA 2012.  Table 4.2-2 shows that the proposed uses that are permissible are classified as either allowable or special uses with the exception of the upgrade of the Kings Beach Substation in the Martis Peak (019) Plan Area and the underbuild on the existing 625 Line in the Lower Truckee (003) Plan Area. As defined in Subsection 21.2.1 of the Code, allowed uses are appropriate for the specified area, may be permitted, and assumed to be compatible with the direction of the Regional Plan and surrounding land uses. Special uses, however, require that the findings under Subsection 21.2.2 of the Code be made by TRPA. The proposed uses subject to special use findings are not new uses, but rather upgrades to existing uses. As described in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, the findings supporting these special uses are incorporated into a separate Findings document for consideration by the TRPA Governing Board and are summarized as follows.  Adding public utility centers as a permissible use in PAS 019 would make the existing substation located on the diesel generator property a conforming use, and would allow transfer of the functions currently provided by the Brockway Substation in the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan to this property, thereby allowing its decommissioning.  Reconstruction of the substation would result in the consolidation of electrical facilities within one secure compound area, out of view from the general public.  The proposed PAS amendment is consistent with the goals of the Land Use and other elements of the TRPA Goals and Policies Plan which does not contain any specific restrictions on placement of public utility centers in conservation plan areas, such as PAS 019. A similar public utility center facility (a substation) exists in PAS 095 (Trout/Cold Creek) located on the south shore of Lake Tahoe near the old Meyers landfill site. PAS 095 is also a Conservation Plan Area, and Public Utility Centers are listed as a special use in PAS 095.  Based on the Initial Environmental Checklist prepared for the plan area statement amendment, there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the new land use, and no impacts that would exceed environmental threshold carrying capacities.  Adding a new public service land use to the Plan Area would not diminish the standards for air and water quality because the amendment only affects an electrical distribution facility where water quality and air quality standards are currently applicable. There are no additional impacts to air or water quality associated with the proposed amendment, and all future projects will be required to meet appropriate air and water quality development standards.  The proposed P AS amendment would not affect the ability of the Regional Plan to achieve and maintain the thresholds, as documented in the Initial Environmental Checklist and this EIS/EIS/EIR.  The proposed amendment would be limited to developed, private property, which contains existing regional-serving electrical facilities within a secure, fenced compound. Most of the area affected by the amendment is high capability land and the proposed plan area amendment would prohibit new or expanded public utility center facilities on low capability land. The affected property is immediately adjacent to the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area and is not isolated from other development. For security and public safety reasons, the affected property is closed to the public and is not suitable for recreation, non-intensive agricultural, or resource management uses for this reason.  The proposed PAS amendment would add a new public service use (public utility centers) to a Conservation Plan Area and would not expand an urban boundary.  The proposed amendment corrects an error that occurred at the time of adoption, specifically; the adopted PAS does not identify the existing, extensive, and essential regional electrical distribution system that exists within the boundaries of the Plan Area.  The amendment is a public health and safety measure and there is no reasonable alternative to plan area amendment because: 1) it would consolidate electrical facilities onto one property, reducing the potential for trespass and vandalism; 2) the electrical compound would be much less visible to the public and less of a potentially attractive hazard; and 3) the construction of an expanded Kings Beach Substation within the boundaries of the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan (and therefore in close proximity to nearby residences) is unreasonable because a superior, more secure site is available that would consolidate electrical facilities onto one secure property, thereby improving efficiency. KINGS BEACH SUBSTATION Martis Peak (019) Plan Area Statement Amendment As described in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, the proposed amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS would add “Public Utility Center” to the list of permissible uses and would allow construction of the expanded substation in the same location as the existing substation, which is approximately 430 feet north of the existing fence line and approximately 480 feet from the nearest residence (Exhibit 4.2-6). The substation rebuild would include 120 kV switches, two 120 kV/14.4 kV transformers, and 14.4 kV switchgear, plus the four relocated 14.4 kV distribution feeders which are currently above ground and would be placed underground, as described in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives. The proposed substation rebuild, with these elements, would allow removal of the existing equipment at the Brockway Substation, located within the residential neighborhood between Speckled Avenue and Cutthroat Avenue, just east of Deer Street. The determination of future site use has not yet been determined, but ownership would remain with CalPeco.  Absent the PAS amendment, the proposed Kings Beach substation improvements could be considered an upgrade and intensification of a legally existing non-conforming use, because of the increase in coverage at the site associated with the proposed improvements (see Section 4.5, Geology, Soils, Land Capability and Coverage). With the PAS amendment, proposed improvements at the Kings Beach Substation site would be consistent with the listed permissible uses. TRPA Governing Board adoption of the proposed PAS amendment requires TRPA to make the findings under Subsection 11.8.4.B of the TRPA Code.  Otherwise Permissible Kings Beach Substation Options As described in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, the findings necessary to support a proposed PAS amendment include a finding that there are no reasonable alternatives. Consistent with this requirement, two alternative configurations for the Kings Beach Substation that would not require amendment of the Martis Peak (019) PAS were considered. These two alternatives would involve locating the Kings Beach Substation within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area, where “Public Utility Center”—the use category that includes substations—is a permissible use under the special use provisions of the Community Plan. The Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area is generally bounded by the northern boundary of the block of parcels north of Speckled Avenue, Cutthroat Avenue to the south, Secline Street to the west, and a few parcels of Coon Street to the east. It includes the southernmost portion of the Kings Beach Substation area, within the fence line at the northern terminus of Deer Street. Under the first option, Option 1, the Kings Beach Substation facilities would be located in the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan and a new access way would be located in the Martis Peak Plan Area. The substation rebuild, including the 120 kV switches, two 120 kV/14.4 kV transformers, and 14.4 kV switchgear would be constructed on parcel 090-041-006 (Exhibit 4.2-7). This parcel is owned by CalPeco and is within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area. The parcel would require alteration and expansion of the access roads to allow adequate access to the facility. With this option, the Brockway Substation would be decommissioned. To accommodate this, the footprint of the substation would be larger to accommodate the distribution functions that would be redirected from Brockway. Because of parcel size limitations and the addition of the functions currently served by Brockway, the substation layout would require the needed access way improvements to be outside the parcel, within the Martis Peak Plan Area (on parcel 090-090-029) and subject to the Martis Peak PAS. Although the new access road might be permissible as an accessory use, the Martis Peak PAS does not otherwise permit the construction of new roads.  This configuration would physically move the substation approximately 300 feet to the south (relative to the proposed option), and closer to the residences located south of the substation, approximately 50 feet from the nearest residence at the closest approach. The facility would be located just inside the fence line of the CalPeco property, and would be much more visually prominent from the end of Deer Street and parcels south, including residential properties, than from rebuild in its existing location. In addition, locating the substation closer to the neighborhood may render the corona noise (the low frequency hum and occasional cracking sound) audible to surrounding businesses and residences. Finally, as described in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, CalPeco must locate certain equipment towards the interior of the property for the purposes of magnetic field reduction. Parcel number 090-041-006 is not large and even an interior location of certain equipment will result in the equipment being only 50 feet from the nearest residence. A second option, Option 2, also involves constructing the substation on parcel 090-041-006, but would not have an access road through the Martis Peak Plan Area (Exhibit 4.2-8). Instead, the access way would be completelySource: adapted by Ascent Environmental 2013 Exhibit 4.2-6 Kings Beach Substation – Proposed Configuration Source: adapted by Ascent Environmental 2013 Exhibit 4.2-7 Kings Beach Substation – Option 1 Source: adapted by Ascent Environmental 2013 Exhibit 4.2-8 Kings Beach Substation – Option 2 within the same parcel, within the Kings Beach Industrial Community Plan Area. With this configuration, there would not be sufficient space for the additional equipment that would be required to allow for the decommissioning of the Brockway Substation, as under the first option. Under this option, the Kings Beach Substation would include the 120 kV switches and one 120/60 kV transformer, but the parcel would not accommodate the 14.4 kV switchgear. As such, the Brockway Substation would need to remain operational in its current location to accommodate this function. The purpose of this option is to address the TRPA plan area statement compliance which, for full compliance would require all modifications to occur within the Kings Beach Industrial Plan area.  In addition, the existing distribution feeders would remain in their current overhead state. The existing 60 kV overhead line from the Kings Beach facility to Brockway Substation would remain primarily in its existing route but would need to have a new termination into the relocated substation site.  The same issues with regard to scenic prominence, noise, and inability to implement magnetic field reduction measures described for Option 1 would apply to Option 2, and the benefit of decommissioning of the Brockway Substation could not be realized. For these reasons, the rebuild of the Kings Beach Substation in its current location, and the amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS that would be required to accommodate it, is the proposed option included with the action alternatives. DISTRIBUTION UNDERBUILD The Lower Truckee PAS does not list Transmission and Receiving facilities, which include the distribution underbuild component of the project, as a permissible use. Because the power line and underbuild were constructed before the effective date of the Regional Plan, the underbuild is permissible as a legally existing, non-conforming use (Section 21.5.1 of the TRPA Code). Section 21.5.2 of the TRPA Code states that an existing non-conforming use may not be expanded or intensified beyond the existing use on the effective date of the Regional Plan, however modifications to an existing non-conforming use may be permitted when they do not increase the extent of non-conformity as determined by TRPA. In accordance with Section 21.5.2, the relocation of the underbuild to the upgraded power poles would neither expand nor intensify this use, because the distribution underbuild would simply be moved to the new poles—the capacity, conductor, and related infrastructure would not be altered.  Access ways are considered an accessory to the power lines and substations. TRPA defines an accessory use as a “use, building or other facility customarily part of a primary use that is clearly incidental and secondary to the primary use, that does not change the character or the intensity of the primary use, and does not operate independently of the primary use” (Section 90.2 of the TRPA Code). Accessory uses are regulated in accordance with the primary use upon which they are dependent (Section 21.3 of the TRPA Code). Power lines cannot be operated and maintained without designated access roads. In addition, access ways do not change the character or intensity of the power lines and do not serve a purpose outside of access to the power lines for inspection and maintenance purposes. As such, access ways meet the TRPA definition of accessory use and the primary uses are categorized as an Allowable or Special Use in all PASs and Community Plans (as described above) intersected by Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) (see Table 4.2-2). Table 3-3 in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, presents the extent of new or improved access ways for each alternative.  Because the proposed uses are permissible within all of the relevant PASs and Community Plans, or would be with adoption of the proposed Martis Peak (019) PAS amendment, the project would not expand or intensify a non-conforming use, and the special use findings under Subsection 21.2.2 can be made, this would be a less-than-significant impact.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.2-2 (Alt.1)  Consistency with land use plans, policies, and regulations. Construction, operation, and maintenance of the project have the potential to result in conflicts with some of the policies or regulations adopted by relevant state, regional (i.e., TRPA), and federal agencies with jurisdiction over the project. However, Applicant Proposed Measures (APMs) (see Chapter 3, Project Alternatives) are included as part of the project. Appendix G of this document contains an analysis of the consistency of the project with all applicable policies adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect, and references specific APMs, impact analyses, and mitigation measures that would preclude any policy conflicts, and reduce plan consistency impacts to less-than-significant levels.  Agencies with jurisdiction over lands in the project area include the USFS (Tahoe National Forest and LTBMU), the USACE, TRPA, the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Nevada County, Placer County, and the Town of Truckee. Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the majority of the proposed upgrades to the 625 and 650 Lines would occur within an established utility corridor in which an existing 60 kV power line is currently located. The rerouted segments of the 625 Line west of SR 267 and straightened segments east of SR 267 are limited to portions of the power line located on NFS land. As such, Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not result in any changes in land use or zoning designations in Nevada County, Placer County, or the Town of Truckee. Similarly, the upgrades to that portion of the 625 Line that crosses Burton Creek State Park would involve reconstruction of the power line within the existing, expanded, easement.  Plans identified in Section 4.2.1, Regulatory Setting, include policies to protect people and the environment from project-related impacts. The table contained in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR discusses the project’s consistency with specific goals, policies and objectives contained in these plans.  Projects that involve the siting and design of investor-owned public utility facilities (such as Alternative 1) are not subject to local land use plans, policies or regulations, because CPUC has sole and exclusive jurisdiction over these types of actions consistent with General Order No. 131-D. Consequently, Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not conflict with any applicable local land use plan, policy, or regulation and as discussed above would not alter land uses regulated by local agencies.  Although the project would be exempt from local land use and zoning regulations and discretionary permitting, local agencies have been consulted regarding land use matters potentially affected by the project. The discussion of the project’s consistency with local plans, policies, and regulations included in Appendix G is for informational purposes only.  The General Order No. 131-D exemption from local agency regulation does not apply to relevant state, regional, and federal agencies with regulatory jurisdiction over the project. Relevant state, regional (i.e., TRPA), and federal plans and policies are discussed in Section 4.2.1, and Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR summarizes project consistency with these regulations.  To reduce or avoid adverse environmental effects of the project, APMs (see Chapter 3, Project Alternatives) have been incorporated into the project as proposed project features. Further, for significant or potentially significant construction or operational impacts (that could also result in policy consistency conflicts), mitigation measures have been included in the applicable resource sections to reduce impacts (and policy conflicts) to less-than-significant levels.  With integration of all APMs into the project design and all mitigation measures identified in Sections 4.3, Forestry Resources through 4.14, Noise of this EIS/EIS/EIR, Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not conflict with applicable state, regional, and federal plans and policies. Because the project would not conflict with relevant state, regional, and federal plans and policies, the impact would be less than significant.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 2 – MODIFIED ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS IMPACT 4.2-1 (Alt.2) IMPACT 4.2-2 (Alt.2)  Introduce uses not listed as permissible in the PAS or Community Plan, expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that substantial land use conflicts or incompatibility would occur. This impact would be the same as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Like Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) components would be permissible with the adoption of the amendment to the Martis Peak (019) PAS, and necessary special use findings could be made, and as such Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would not expand or intensify a non-conforming use. For these reasons, this impact would be less than significant. Consistency with land plans, policies, and regulations. Construction, operation, and maintenance of the project have the potential to result in conflicts with some of the policies or regulations adopted by relevant state, regional (i.e., TRPA), and federal agencies with jurisdiction over the project. However, APMs (see Chapter 3, Project Alternatives) are included as part of the project. Appendix G of this document contains an analysis of the consistency of the project with all applicable policies adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect, and references specific APMs, impact analyses, and mitigation measures that would preclude any policy conflicts, and reduce plan consistency impacts to less-than-significant levels.  The impact and impact conclusion would be the same as that described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) because the project components, their use categories, and the relevant PASs and Community Plans would all be the same. The rationale for making the special use findings would also be the same for Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). This impact would be less than significant. Refer to the full discussion under Impact 4.2-1 (Alt. 1), above.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. The impact and impact conclusion for Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would be the same as that described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), because the project components would all be the same. Applicable APMs and mitigation measures for this alternative would be different, in some cases, than those identified for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), based on variability of physical impacts for the power line alignments associated with this alternative. However, the APMs and mitigation measures identified in this EIS/EIS/EIR would address any potential conflicts with applicable state, regional, and federal plans and policies (Appendix G). Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.

ALTERNATIVE 5 – NO ACTION/NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS Introduce uses not listed as permissible in the PAS or Community Plan, expand or intensify an existing non-conforming use such that substantial land use conflicts or incompatibility would occur. Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) existing conditions within the project area would be projected into the future. No changes to the existing power facilities, access ways, or substations would occur. Therefore, no impact would occur. Consistency with land use plans, policies, and regulations. Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) existing conditions within the project area would be projected into the future. No changes to the existing power facilities, access ways, or substations would occur. Therefore, because there would be no changes in use and no actions would occur that could result in conflicts with policies or regulations adopted by agencies with jurisdiction over local and regional land use, no impact would occur.  Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), the existing power line facilities for the 625 and 650 Lines would remain in place. Existing conditions would be projected into the future. Therefore, because there would be no changes in use, no impact would occur.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.2-2 (Alt.5)  Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), the existing power line facilities for the 625 and 650 Lines would remain in place. Existing conditions would be projected into the future. Therefore, because there would be no changes in use and no actions would occur that could result in conflicts with policies or regulations adopted by state, regional, and federal agencies with jurisdiction over the project, no impact would occur.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS With the possible exception of precedent-setting actions such as amendment of the TRPA Code or other policy documents, impacts involving land use plans or policies and zoning generally would not combine to result in cumulative impacts. The determination of significance for impacts related to land use, as considered in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, is whether a project would conflict with any applicable land use plan or policy adopted for the purpose of reducing or avoiding environmental impacts. Such a conflict is site specific; it is addressed on a project-by-project basis.  One project, development of the Tahoe City Transit Center, is located immediately adjacent to the 625 Line and the Tahoe City Substation, in the Truckee River Corridor in North Lake Tahoe. The project is a north shore transit center and parking facility. Construction of this project is currently underway. The Tahoe City Transit Center project is expected to be completed by the time construction begins on any portion of the 625 Line or 650 Line. However, there is a potential for conflicting uses at the Tahoe City Transit Center site as CalPeco intends to use a portion of the parcel to temporarily place transformers during construction on the 625 Line and at the Tahoe City Substation. As identified in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, to ensure that the temporary transformers would not interfere with operation of the Tahoe City Transit Center, CalPeco will coordinate with the USFS and Placer County well in advance of construction to obtain permission to use the parcel. CalPeco would work to site the temporary transformers in undeveloped areas or in area designated for parking and restrict the public from this area. As a result, no significant conflicts are expected to occur.    This page intentionally left blank.   4.3 FORESTRY RESOURCES This section describes existing forestry resources in the project area, presents applicable government regulations related to forest/tree removal and power line vegetation management, identifies forest zoning designations and uses in the project area, and presents an analysis of potential project impacts under each project alternative. This section focusses on the potential loss or conversion of forest land, and potential rezoning or zoning conflicts related to forest land, timberland, and timberland production zones.  The ability of forest land to support other uses and the effects that the proposed project might have on these uses are addressed in other sections of this EIS/EIS/EIR. Aesthetic resources are addressed in Section 4.4, Scenic Resources. The project’s consistency with US Forest Service (USFS) guidelines and Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and local agency goals and policies is presented in Section 4.2, Land Use. Forest-related habitat, wildlife, ecosystem, and land management impacts are evaluated in Section 4.7, Biological Resources. Issues related to recreation are addressed in Section 4.8, Recreation. 4.3.1 REGULATORY SETTING The following provides an overview of laws and regulations related to forestry resources that could apply to the proposed project and are related to the loss or conversion of forest land and potential rezoning or zoning conflicts related to forest land, timberland, and timberland production zones. FEDERAL UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE The project components are predominantly located on National Forest System (NFS) lands managed by the USFS; these lands are located in the Tahoe National Forest and in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU). The management of NFS lands in each of these forests is guided by a separate Land and Resources Management Plan (Forest Plan). The current plans are summarized below. Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit - Land and Resource Management Plan The LTBMU manages more than 75 percent of lands within the Tahoe Region, including lands located within the project study area. Land management is guided by the LTBMU Forest Plan (USFS 1988), as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA) (USFS 2003), described below. The Forest Plan sets the framework for how the resources of the national forest lands are managed. The plan translates national laws, policies, and regulations into guidance for activities that occur on the NFS lands. The Forest Plan addresses multiple uses and benefits of forest land.  The project’s consistency with the Forest Plan is considered in the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) Forest Plan Consistency Checklist, a planning tool developed and used by LTBMU staff, included in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in the NFMA checklist, incorporated by reference here, the project alternatives would be consistent with the relevant Forest Plan directives. Therefore, specific Forest Plan directives are not considered further for consistency analysis in this section. Tahoe National Forest---Land and Resource Management Plan  The USFS Tahoe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (USFS 1990), as amended, provides guidance as to the management of the Tahoe National Forest. Its goals are to ensure the wise use and protection of Tahoe National Forest resources, fulfill legislative requirements, and address local, regional, and national issues.  The Tahoe National Forest Plan (USFS 1990) provides direction for managing the Tahoe National Forest, which includes a portion of the proposed project. Specifically, Chapter V, Management Direction, presents both forest-wide and area-specific management direction for the Tahoe National Forest. The forest-wide management direction consists of forest goals and desired future conditions, objectives, and forest-wide standards and guidelines. Specific management direction for each of the 106 management areas includes: management emphasis for the area, selected standards and guidelines, and compatible available management practices. The Tahoe National Forest’s Forest Plan is amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (USFS 2003), described below. The proposed project’s consistency with the Tahoe National Forest Forest Plan is considered in a matrix similar to the NFMA checklist described above for the LTBMU (but with relevant standards and guidelines only) and is included in Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in the Tahoe National Forest NMFA checklist, incorporated by reference here, the project alternatives would be consistent with the Tahoe National Forest standards, guidelines, and management practices. Therefore, specific Tahoe National Forest standards, guidelines, and management practices are not considered further for consistency analysis in this section. Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment The SNFPA (USFS 2003) amends the Forest Plans for the 11 National Forests that fall within the Sierra Nevada, including the LTBMU Forest Plan and the Tahoe National Forest Plan, described above. The SNFPA Final Supplemental EIS and Record of Decision describe the amendments to the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan developed to improve protection of old forests, wildlife habitats, watersheds, and communities in the Sierra Nevada and Modoc Plateau. The proposed project’s consistency with specific guidance provided in the SNFPA is considered in the NFMA Forest Plan Consistency Checklist included as Appendix G of this EIS/EIS/EIR. As described in the NFMA checklist, incorporated by reference here, the project alternatives would be consistent with the SNFPA guidance. Therefore, specific SNFPA standards and guidelines are not considered further for consistency analysis in this section. FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires utilities to adopt and maintain minimum clearance standards between vegetation and power lines. These clearances vary depending on voltage. In most cases, the minimum clearances required in state regulations are greater than the federal requirement. In California, the state has adopted General Order 95 rather than the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Standards as the electric safety standard for the state. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is not discussed further in this section, as compliance with state requirements will ensure that the federal requirements are met.  STATE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE The California Fire Code (CFC) is contained within Title 24, Chapter 9 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR). Based on the International Fire Code, the CFC is created by the California Buildings Standards Commission and regulates the use, handling, and storage requirements for hazardous materials at fixed facilities. Similar to the International Fire Code, the CFC and the California Building Code use a hazards classification system to determine the appropriate measures to incorporate to protect life and property.  Title 14 CCR Sections 1250-1258, Fire Prevention Standards for Electric Utilities, provides specific exemptions from electric pole and tower firebreak and electric conductor clearance standards, and it specifies when and where standards apply. Section 1254 of Title 14 presents guidelines for minimum clearance requirements around poles or towers on which a switch, fuse, transformer or lightning arrester is attached. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION GENERAL ORDER 95: RULES FOR OVERHEAD TRANSMISSION LINE CONSTRUCTION General Order 95, adopted in 1941 and updated in January 2012, is the key standard governing the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of overhead electric lines in California. It includes safety standards for overhead electric lines, including minimum distances for conductor spacing and minimum conductor ground clearance, standards for calculating maximum sag, electric line inspection requirements, and vegetation clearance requirements.  Rule 31.2, Inspection of Lines, requires that lines be inspected frequently and thoroughly to ensure they are in good condition, and that lines temporarily out of service be inspected and maintained as to not create a hazard. Rule 35 of General Order 95 (Tree Trimming) defines minimum vegetation clearance around power lines and applies to all facilities at all times of the year. For the project area, Rule 35 guidelines, at the time of trimming, require the following:   4 feet radial clearances for any conductor of a line operating at 2,400 volts or more, but less than 72,000 volts;  6 feet radial clearances for any conductor of a line operating at 72,000 volts or more, but less than 110,000 volts;  10 feet radial clearances for any conductor of a line operating at 110,000 volts or more, but less than 300,000 volts; and  15 feet radial clearances for any conductor of a line operating at 300,000 volts or more.  CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE The California Public Resources Code provides a definition for forest land which is applicable to the proposed project.  Section 12220(g) defines forest land as land that can support 10 percent native tree cover of any species, including hardwoods, under natural conditions, and that allows for management of timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, biodiversity, water quality, recreation, and other public benefits.   Section 4526 defines timberland as land, other than land owned by the federal government and land designated by the board as experimental forest land, which is available for, and capable of, growing a crop of trees of a commercial species used to produce lumber and other forest products, including Christmas trees.  The California Public Resources Code also contains regulations associated with power line vegetation management.   Public Resources Code 4292 states a that a minimum firebreak of 10 feet (measured horizontally) shall be maintained in all directions from the outer circumference of any pole which supports a switch, transformer, lightning arrester, line junction, or end or corner pole. Flammable vegetation and materials located wholly or partially within the firebreak space shall be treated as follows.  At ground level - remove flammable materials, including but not limited to, ground litter, duff and dead or desiccated vegetation that will allow fire to spread.  From 0 - 2.4 m (0-8 feet) above ground level remove flammable trash, debris or other materials, grass, herbaceous and brush vegetation. All limbs and foliage of living trees shall be removed up to a height of 2.4 m (8 feet).  From 2.4 m (8 feet) to horizontal plane of highest point of conductor attachment remove dead, diseased or dying limbs and foliage from living sound trees and any dead, diseased or dying trees in their entirety.  Public Resources Code 4293 establishes the minimum vegetation clearance distances (between vegetation and energized conductors) required for overhead transmission line construction and identifies requirements for hazard tree removal where trees may contact the line from the side or may fall on the line. Minimum clearances are discussed as follows.   A minimum radial clearance of 4 feet shall be established for any conductor of a line operating at 2,400 or more volts but less than 72,000 volts.   A minimum radial clearance of 6 feet shall be established for any conductor of a line operating at 72,000 or more volts but less than 110,000 volts.   A minimum radial clearance of 10 feet shall be established for any conductor of a line operating at 110,000 or more volts.  CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE California Government Code definitions applicable to the proposed project include the following.  Section 51104(g) defines “timberland production zone” (TPZ) to mean an area which has been zoned pursuant to Section 51112 or 51113 and is devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber, or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses. Compatible uses are defined under Section 51104(h) and include the construction and maintenance of electric transmission facilities.  Section 51112 identifies situations which would warrant a decision that a parcel is not devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses.  Section 51113 allows the opportunity for a landowner to petition that his or her land be zoned timberland production. CALIFORNIA TIMBERLAND PRODUCTIVITY ACT OF 1982 The California Timberland Productivity Act of 1982 (California Government Code - Section 51100-51104) identifies the benefits of the state’s timberlands and acknowledges the threat of timberland loss via land use conversions. The law identifies policies intended to preserve timberland, including maintaining an optimum amount of timberland, discouraging premature conversion, discouraging expansion of urban land uses into timberlands, and encouraging investments in timberland. The law establishes TPZ on all qualifying timberland, which is devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber, or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses. The law also provides that timber operations conducted in a manner consistent with forest practice rules (Z’Berg-Nejedly Forest Practices Act of 1973) shall not be or become restricted or prohibited due to any land use in or around the locality of those operations. Z’BERG-WARREN-KEENE-COLLIER FOREST TAXATION REFORM ACT OF 1976 According to the Z’berg-Warren-Keene-Collier Forest Taxation Reform Act (California Government Code - Section 51110-51119.5: Article 2), enacted in 1976, counties must provide for the zoning of land used for growing and harvesting timber as TPZs. A TPZ is a 10-year restriction on the use of land, and replaced the use of agricultural preserves (Williamson Act contracts) on timberland. Land use under a TPZ is restricted to growing and harvesting timber, and to compatible uses approved by the county. In return, taxation of timberland under a TPZ is based only on such restrictions in use. Z’BERG-NEJEDLY FOREST PRACTICE ACT OF 1973 The Z’Berg-Nejedly Forest Practice Act (FPA) of 1973 (California Public Resources Code - Section 4511-4517) established the state Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, whose mandate is to protect and enhance the state’s unique forest and wildland resources. This mandate is carried out through enforcement of the California Forest Practice Rules (FPR) (Title 14, CCR, Chapters 4, 4.5 and 10). The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection enforces the laws that regulate logging on non-federal lands in California. Additional rules enacted by the State Board of Forestry and Fire Protection are also enforced to protect forest and wildland resources. The FPA is intended to create and maintain an effective and comprehensive system of regulation and use of all timberlands so as to ensure that the productivity of timberlands is restored, enhanced, and maintained and that the goal of maximum sustained production of high-quality timber products is achieved while giving consideration to values relating to sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2), recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, fisheries, regional economic vitality, employment, and aesthetic enjoyment. The FPA requires that a Timber Harvest Plan (THP) be prepared by a Registered Professional Forester for timber harvest on non-federal lands in the state.  THPs are prepared for timber operations and must be consistent with applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The California Public Resources Code (Section 21080.5) provides that a regulatory program of a state agency shall be certified by the Secretary for Resources as being exempt from the requirements for preparing EIRs, Negative Declarations, and Initial Studies if the Secretary finds that the program meets the criteria contained in that code section. The regulation of timber harvesting by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has been certified by the Secretary for Resources as meeting such requirements. Consequently, THPs serve as a functional equivalent of an EIR and include feasible mitigation measures and an evaluation of alternatives which would lessen or avoid adverse environmental impacts. The FPA also provides clarification for activities occurring within the jurisdiction of TRPA. Under the FPA, TRPA shall have the right to adopt rules and regulations which are stricter than those included in the FPA and may include matters relating to soil erosion control, protection of stream character and water quality, flood control, stand density control, reforestation methods, mass soil movements, submission of timber harvesting plans, location and grade of roads and skid trails, excavation and fill requirements, slash and debris disposal, haul routes and schedules, hours and dates of logging, and performance bond requirements.  However, the California Code of Regulations Title 14 Section 1104.1(c) exempts clearing of trees from timberland by a private or public utility from the requirement to file for a THP or a Timberland Conversion Permit (TCP) (needed to convert harvested forest land to another use) for construction of electric rights-of-way. Therefore project-related tree removal on non-federal land outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin would not require preparation of a THP or TCP. If wood products removed from the ROW would be sold, a Utility Right of Way Exemption would be required by CAL FIRE. Timber operations occurring in the Lake Tahoe Basin (pursuant to Title 14, CCR, Section 1038) are exempt from THP preparation and submission requirements and from the completion report and stocking report requirements of the FPA; however, such operations must have a valid Tahoe Basin Tree Removal Permit (as defined by the TRPA) or shall be conducted under a valid TRPA Memorandum of Understanding, when such a permit is required by TRPA. Such operations are also subject to specific restrictions as identified in the FPRs. Additionally, the FPRs identify agency-specific exemptions from the provisions of the FPA (PRC Section 4511 et. seq.). According to the FPRs, timber operations on land managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation (e.g., Burton Creek State Park) are exempt from the provisions of the FPRs, provided that the timber operations have undergone all required CEQA evaluation required pursuant to PRC Division 13 commencing with Section 21000. While various exemptions may apply to the proposed project, all timber operations on non-federal lands shall comply with all other applicable provisions of the FPA, regulations of the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, and currently effective provisions of county general plans, zoning ordinances and any implementing ordinances. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY TRPA implements its authority to regulate growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan. The Regional Plan includes Resolution 82-11, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards), Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, Plan Area Statements (PASs), and other guidance documents. TRPA plans and policies related to forest resources are from a habitat perspective instead of a timber resource perspective. As indicated above, this section focusses on issues related strictly to the loss or conversion of forest land and zoning of forest land, timberland, and TPZ as described in CEQA, and not the biological resources aspects of forest habitat. Therefore, further description of TRPA forest-related policies and regulations and analysis of how the project may affect forest resources from a TRPA regulatory perspective is provided in Section 4.7, Biological Resources, of this document.  However, zoning conflicts and potential rezoning related to forest land are considered in this section. TRPA does not have traditional zoning designations for parcels located within its jurisdiction. Instead, PASs designate a Land Use Classification (general plan designation) and a list of Permissible Uses (zoning). The TRPA Regional Plan area is divided into PASs for community areas, as shown on Exhibit 4.2-1 in Section 4.2, Land Use. All of the action alternatives include components that are within the following PASs: Lower Truckee (003), 64-Acre Tract (174), Tahoe City (001A), Tahoe City Industrial (001B), Fairway Tract (002), Burton Creek (004), Watson Creek (013), Northstar (015), Martis Peak (019), Kingswood East (025), Woodvista (027), and Kings Beach Industrial (026).  All project components are listed as permissible in the applicable PASs, with the exception of the existing distribution underbuild on the 625 Line within the Lower Truckee (003) PAS and the proposed upgrade of the Kings Beach Substation in the Martis Peak (019) PAS. The focus of forest land zoning in California is preservation of timberland devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber, or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses, and transferring existing non-conforming distribution underbuild to new poles in the Lower Truckee (003) PAS or the addition of the Kings Beach Substation as an allowable use in the Martis Peak (019) PAS would not lessen the capability to manage for forest resources in each PAS, nor would it affect the distribution of forest land in each PAS or in the region. Section 4.2, Land Use, of this EIS/EIS/EIR further discusses zoning and PASs. As noted, timber operations occurring in the Lake Tahoe Region (pursuant to Title 14, CCR, Section 1038) are exempt from THP preparation and submission requirements and from the completion report and stocking report requirements of the FPA; however, such operations must have a valid Tahoe Basin Tree Removal Permit (as defined by the TRPA) or shall be conducted under a valid TRPA Memorandum of Understanding, when such a permit is required by TRPA. Such operations are also subject to specific restrictions as identified in the FPRs.  LOCAL AGENCIES  Policies and ordinances of local agencies applicable to the proposed project are described in this section. PLACER COUNTY Zoning Code There are four zoning districts within the Placer County Zoning Ordinance that relate to Forestry Resources: Forestry (FOR); Forestry, combining minimum building site size of 160 acres (FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN.); Residential Forest combining a minimum building site size of 10 acres (RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN.), and TPZ (Placer County 1995). The FOR zone is intended to designate portions of the mountainous areas of Placer County where the primary land uses will relate to the growing and harvesting of timber and other forest products, together with public and commercial recreational uses (Placer County 1995). No land use permit approval is required for transmission lines in FOR zones because they typically involve no or minimal construction activities, are accessory to some other land use that will be the primary use of a site (which will require a land use permit), or are otherwise entirely consistent with the purposes of the particular zone (Placer County 1995). The FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN. zone is intended to combine FOR zoning with a minimum Building Site of 160 acres. The purpose of the building site (-B) combining district is to provide for different parcel sizes in new subdivisions than would otherwise be required by an applicable zone district, based upon special characteristics of the site or area to which the combining district is applied, including but not limited to sensitive environmental characteristics, limited resource capacities, and community character. The RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN. zone is intended to provide opportunities for rural residential living with a minimum building site size of 10 acres, in the forested, mountainous or foothill areas of Placer County. The purpose of the building site (-B) combining district is to provide for different parcel sizes in new subdivisions than would otherwise be required by an applicable zone district, based upon special characteristics of the site or area to which the combining district is applied, including but not limited to sensitive environmental characteristics, limited resource capacities, and community character. The TPZ is intended to be an exclusive area for the growing and harvesting of timber and those uses that are an integral part of a timber management operation. The zone is established in conformance with the Z’Berg-Warren-Keene-Collier Forest Taxation Reform Act of 1976 (California Government Code Section 51100 et seq.). No land use permit approval is required for transmission lines in TPZ zones because they typically involve no or minimal construction activities, are accessory to some other land use that will be the primary use of a site (which will require a land use permit), or are otherwise entirely consistent with the purposes of the particular zone (Placer County 1995). NEVADA COUNTY All proposed project facilities that could convert forest land within Nevada County occur within the boundaries of the Town of Truckee; therefore, regulations associated with tree removal in the Town of Truckee are discussed below.  TOWN OF TRUCKEE The Town of Truckee Development Code (Section 18.30.155) allows for tree removal for construction purposes; however, tree preservation is also identified as a goal. This section of the Development Code also includes development standards intended to ensure the retention of trees to the maximum extent feasible and identifies tree removal permit requirements. This section also identifies activities which are exempt from tree removal permit requirements, which includes activities associated with tree pruning or removal for safety reasons, as mandated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) (General Order 35) and PRC 4293. Additional exempt activities include removal of trees by private utilities, as necessary to perform maintenance, repairs, modifications, and/or to construct infrastructure.  4.3.2 EXISTING CONDITIONS/AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT The forest land study area includes the permanent 40-foot power line right-of-way (ROW) for single-circuit segments, the temporary 65-foot power line ROW (inclusive of the permanent ROW) for single-circuit segments, the permanent 65-foot power line ROW for double-circuit segments, new roads, staging areas, stringing/ pulling sites, substations, and all other project-related facilities plus a hazard tree border zone for the project alternatives. The hazard tree border zone includes the area within 150 feet of a power line center line and was included in the forest land study area to analyze the impacts associated with hazard tree removal. The 150 foot width of the hazard tree border zone was agreed to by the lead agencies as a reasonable area where a vast majority of hazardous tree removal would occur. The permanent 40-foot ROW, new roads, and substations would require permanent tree removal, while the temporary ROW (12.5 feet on either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW for single-circuit segments), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites would be abandoned following construction and would be allowed to re-grow trees. Tree removal in the hazard tree border zone would be restricted to individual trees which have the potential for falling into the constructed line; whereas, all trees within permanent and temporary impact areas would be removed. Hazard tree removal would occur concurrently with ROW tree removal.  FOREST LAND For the purposes of this analysis, forest land, as discussed in greater detail above in the description of state regulations, is defined as land that can support 10 percent native tree cover of any species that allows for management of timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, recreation, and other public benefits (PRC Section 12220(g)). Large portions of the project footprint for the action alternatives are located within land that meets the PRC 12220(g) definition. Forest types in the forest land study area typically have greater than 10 percent cover by native trees. For the purposes of this EIS/EIS/EIR, all forest types in the forest land study area are considered to be forest land. The following summarizes each of the forest types found in the proposed project area, and is summarized from Section 4.7, Biological Resources. Exhibits provided in Appendix K, Vegetation Maps, of this EIS/EIS/EIR display the distribution of forest land in the project area. These existing coniferous forest types could experience temporary or permanent effects from implementation of the action alternatives.  Jeffrey Pine Forest Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) is the dominant tree species in this community type. In the study area, lodgepole pine is also present in small numbers. Canopy cover is typically less dense than in other forest communities as Jeffrey pine tends to be more scattered throughout the community. This generally allows for the understory of the Jeffrey pine forest to contain plants requiring drier, sunnier conditions than in other conifer communities. These understory plants include big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate), bitterbrush (Purshia tridentate), green (or sticky leaved) rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), and rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa). This forest community type is present in the study area primarily along Segments 650-3, 650-4B, and 650-6 (see Exhibits in Appendix H, Supplemental Forestry and Vegetation Management Report).  Jeffrey Pine-White Fir Forest Jeffrey pine-white fir forest is similar to mixed conifer forest, but with shorter trees, and dominated by Jeffrey pine and white fir. The understory of this community tends to be open with scattered montane chaparral species, and smaller trees. Common understory species observed included pinemat manzanita (Arctostaphylos nevadensis), white-veined wintergreen (Pyrola picta), Pacific monardella (Monardella odoratissima), and rock cress species (Boechera spp.). Approximately 95 acres of Jeffrey pine-white fir forest occurs within the project area, mainly along the 625 Line and Segments 650-1 and 650-2.  Red Fir Forest Red fir forest is a community typically dominated by even-aged, monotypic stands of mature red fir (Abies magnifica). In the study area, scattered western white pine and sugar pine are also present. The understory is much more open than the Sierran mixed conifer forest, with the primary understory shrub species being pinemat manzanita. This is the most abundant community in the study area and is primarily present at the higher elevations along the existing and new 625 Lines. As with the majority of conifer forest habitat in the study area, most of the red fir forest habitat is comprised of mature, even-aged stands of trees due to past logging in the area.  White Fir-Red Fir Forest White fir-red fir forest is similar to red fir forest, but with white fir (Abes concolor) and red fir codominant throughout, with occasional occurrences of incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) and Jeffrey pine. The understory is also similar to the description of red fir forest, with the primary understory shrub species being pinemat manzanita. Within the study area, this community occurs primarily along Segments 625-8 through 625-10, 650-1, and 650-2.  Sierran Mixed Conifer Forest Sierran mixed conifer forest is dense forest dominated by a mix of white fir, red fir, Jeffrey pine, sugar pine, and incense cedar. Historic burning and logging have created wide variability in stand structure and composition in this community. Canopy cover varies from nearly 100 percent to more sparse cover, with some open areas. The understory consists of a variety shrubs, grasses, and forbs, including mahala mat (Ceanothus prostrates), mountain whitethorn (Ceanothus cordulatus), pinemat manzanita, greenleaf manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), bush chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens), and huckleberry oak (Quercus vacciniifolia). Mixed conifer forest is the second most widespread vegetation community in the study area, extending from Kings Beach north to the Brockway Summit area along the existing and new 625 Lines and the 650 Line and between Brockway Summit and Tahoe City along the existing and new 625 Lines. At higher elevations, the vegetation community transitions from Sierran mixed conifer forest to red fir forest.  TIMBERLAND Timberland, a subset of forest land, is defined by PRC Section 4526 and consists of non-federal land that is available for, and capable of, growing a crop of trees of any commercial species used to produce lumber and other forest products. Based on this definition and the species composition of forest land in the study area, all non-federal land classified as forest habitat is considered to be timberland for the purposes of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  TIMBERLAND PRODUCTION ZONE Timberland Production Zone is defined as an area which has been zoned as such and is devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber, or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses, which include construction and maintenance of electric transmission facilities (California Government Code Section 51104(g)). Of the timberland in the study area, only a small portion is currently zoned as TPZ by Placer County, which includes portions of the existing 625 Line and portions of alternative alignments along the Northstar Tap, east and west of Brockway Summit, and a small area situated between Mt. Pluto and Mt. Watson.  STREAM ENVIRONMENT ZONES  Stream Environment Zones (SEZ) are unique to the Tahoe Basin and include perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams and drainages, as well as marshes and meadows. Defined by TRPA, these areas generally include riparian or hydric vegetation, alluvial/hydric soils, and the presence of surface water or near-surface groundwater at least part of the year. SEZs make up a small portion of the land area within the Tahoe Basin (approximately 5 percent), but provide important wildlife habitat and help to reduce sediment and nutrient runoff (California Tahoe Conservancy 2013). Based on the ecological importance of SEZs in the Lake Tahoe Basin, an evaluation of forest land within these zones was conducted as some SEZs or portions thereof could be subject to temporary or permanent effects from implementation of the project alternatives.  4.3.3 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND RECOMMENDED MITIGATION MEASURES SIGNIFICANCE CRITERIA TRPA CRITERIA TRPA criteria related to vegetation, including forest habitat and tree removal, are assessed in Section 4.7, Biological Resources, of this EIS/EIS/EIR. NEPA CRITERIA An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. The factors that are taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of an action in terms of the context and the intensity of its effects are encompassed by the CEQA criteria used for this analysis.  CEQA CRITERIA In order to determine whether impacts to forest resources, including timberland, are significant environmental effects, Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines asks whether a project would do any of the following:   conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of, forest land (as defined in PRC section 12220(g)), timberland (as defined by PRC section 4526), or timberland zoned Timberland Production (as defined by Government Code section 51104(g));  result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to non-forest use; or  involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. This section evaluates impacts to forest land and timberland specific to these potential impact mechanisms. The ability of forest land to support other uses and the effects that the proposed project might have on these uses are addressed in other sections of this EIS/EIS/EIR. Aesthetic resources are addressed in Section 4.4, Scenic Resources. The project’s consistency with USFS guidelines and TRPA and local agency goals and policies is presented in Section 4.2, Land Use. Forest-related habitat, wildlife, ecosystem, and land management impacts are evaluated in Section 4.7, Biological Resources. Issues related to recreation are addressed in Section 4.8, Recreation.  METHODS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RESULTS  As discussed, the forest land study area includes a unique assessment area which incorporates the 40-foot (or 65-foot) permanent ROW, temporary ROW, new roads, staging areas, stringing/pulling sites, and substations, plus a hazard tree border zone for the action alternatives. The following discussion summarizes the methods used in compiling and analyzing forest land data, outlines any assumptions made in data processing and impact analysis, and summarizes the results of the analysis conducted for all alternatives. For the purposes of this analysis, permanent impacts are those associated with tree removal for the permanent 40-foot (or 65-foot) ROW, new access roads, and substations while temporary impacts are those associated with tree removal for the temporary ROW (12.5 feet in either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW for single-circuit segments), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites. Tree removal within the hazard tree border zone is accounted for in the tree quantity, tree volume, and sequestered carbon totals presented herein, but not included in the forest land impact acreage as it is assumed that this area would be subject to selective hazard tree removal only. In addition to the summarized information presented below, a detailed spreadsheet outlining impacts, by alternative and line segment, is presented in Appendix H (FCO 2013).  For Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), actions would be limited to existing operations and maintenance and completion of existing deferred vegetation management within the existing 625 and 650 Line ROWs. Vegetation management within the existing ROWs would be in compliance with existing regulations (CPUC General Order 95) and approved plans and permits and access would be gained via existing easements and rights-of-way. Therefore, as vegetation management for the existing system is currently approved and required, vegetation removal for Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) is not considered to be an impact.  FOREST LAND In order to evaluate the effect of each alternative on forest land, an analysis of the following data sets was conducted by FCO (2013).  USFS Pacific Southwest Region (R5) Vegetation Inventory Data.  Forest type stratification data derived from USFS R5 CALVEG data set.  CalPeco 132 Line 2009 hazard tree data.  As field-verified inventory data for the forest land study area does not exist, a geographic information system (GIS)-based evaluation of the aforementioned data sets was conducted by FCO (2013) to estimate forest land acreage, tree quantity, overall tree volume, merchantable tree volume, and sequestered carbon totals. The USFS R5 is responsible for producing comprehensive spatial and tabular databases for existing vegetation, which were analyzed for the forest land study area. The methodology used to generate this data captures vegetation characteristics using automated, systematic procedures that efficiently and cost-effectively map large areas of the state with minimal bias and is supplemented with onsite field visits, when appropriate. Map attributes consist of vegetation types using the CALVEG classification system and forest structural characteristics such as tree and shrub canopy cover and tree stem diameters.  Prior to analyzing the action alternative’s impacts to forest land, FCO created a GIS-based forest land data set by merging the USFS R5 CALVEG forest type stratification data for all project areas with USFS R5 vegetation inventory data for inside and outside of the Tahoe Basin. This data set was also augmented with CalPeco’s 132 Line (120-kilovolt power line) hazard tree data from 2009. Hazard tree volumes from this data set were geographically linked to the forest type in which they were located and then averages applied to the same CALVEG forest types found in the hazard tree border zone. Additionally, the intersection of other pertinent spatial information, such as SEZ areas and landowner classification, was incorporated and allowed for the forest land data set to be sorted for attribute-specific queries (FCO 2013).  As described above, the impact analysis was performed using a GIS overlay of project impact areas intersected with a custom base layer delineated by forest type with rates of vegetation extrapolated from USFS and CalPeco data. The best available and widely used stratification for the project area is the vegetation delineation from the EVEG/CALVEG GIS data files from Region 5 of the USFS. The delineation of the vegetation within the Tahoe Basin is based on is a raster or grid image with 15-foot resolution and delineation outside of the Tahoe Basin is based on a raster or grid image with 98.4-foot (30 meters) resolution. These data sets are provided by the USFS with a scale description of 1:24,000 and 1:100,000, respectively. The forest impact analysis conducted for this EIS/EIS/EIR includes data presented at a much finer scale, including some classifications as narrow as 12.5 feet (temporary ROW areas). Therefore, assumptions from the extrapolation of the data are necessary and the base layer is too coarse to provide reliable absolute numbers. However, the use of this dataset for a comparative analysis presented in this EIS/EIS/EIR may still be considered valid because the analysis has been conducted with a uniform methodology and all assumptions are consistent between alternatives (FCO 2013). Data included in the resulting GIS-based forest land data set forms the basis for evaluating project and alternative-related forest land impacts for this EIS/EIS/EIR and includes the following.  Forest Land Impact Area: this characteristic includes the acreage of forest land that contains trees greater than or equal to 1 inch diameter at breast height (dbh) and includes both permanent and temporary disturbance areas.   Tree Quantity: this characteristic includes the total number of trees greater than or equal to 1-inch dbh and includes hazard trees within the hazard tree border zone.   Tree Volume: this characteristic includes the total cubic foot volume of all trees greater than or equal to 1-inch dbh and includes the volume of hazard trees within the hazard tree border zone. Additionally, merchantable volume was calculated and includes the total cubic foot volume of all conifer trees greater than or equal to 9-inches dbh and excludes the volume of hazard trees within the hazard tree border zone as no hazard trees are assumed to be merchantable. While some hazard trees may in fact be merchantable, the potential number and volume of merchantable trees is unknown. Therefore, this assumption presents the most conservative estimate for evaluating potential sequestered carbon to be released by timber removal. The following sections present a summary of the forest land characteristics evaluated for the forest land study area and include analysis results for all alternatives (FCO 2013). As noted, a detailed spreadsheet outlining impacts, by alternative and line segment, is presented in Appendix H, Supplemental Forestry and Vegetation Management Report (FCO 2013). Forest Land Impact Area Forest land considered to be subject to permanent impacts includes areas that contain trees that are at least 1 inch dbh and that occur within the permanent 40-foot ROW (or permanent 65-foot ROW for double-circuit segments), new roadways, and substations. Forest land which would be subject to tree removal during construction but would be abandoned and allowed to regenerate (temporary impact areas) includes areas that contain trees greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh and that occur within the temporary ROW (12.5 feet on either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW for single-circuit segments), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites. Temporary impact areas also include those areas where trees would be removed for stringing sites related to removal of the existing 625 Line. Areas already converted for existing roads, existing ROWs, or urban areas, and the hazard tree border zone are not included in the forest land impact totals presented herein. Table 4.3-1, Forest Land Conversion Acres for Project Alternatives, presents the estimated forest land impact area, by impact type and alternative associated with construction of the action alternatives and removal of the existing 625 Line.  Table 4.3-1 Forest Land Conversion Acres for Project Alternatives  Alternative  Permanent Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  Temporary Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  121.9  97.9  Alternative Construction  121.9  88.0  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   -  9.9  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  128.2  86.4  Alternative Construction  128.2  77.6  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   -  8.8  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  93.1  92.4  Alternative Construction  93.1  78.0  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   -  14.4  Alternative 4 (Proposed Project)  92.8  91.6  Alternative Construction  92.3  77.2  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   -  14.4  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A  N/A   Tree Quantity The estimated quantity of trees proposed to be removed by action alternatives includes hardwood and conifer trees greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh within forest land impact areas (both temporary and permanent) and includes an estimate of hazard trees within the 150-foot hazard tree border zone and those requiring removal for stringing sites related to the removal of the existing 625 Line. Table 4.3-2, Number of Trees to be Removed for Project Alternatives, presents an estimate of the number of trees greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh that would require removal, by impact type and alternative, both within the ROW and associated with removal of the existing 625 Line.  Table 4.3-2 Number of Trees to be Removed for Project Alternatives  Alternative  Total Number of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed (Permanent and Temporary Impact Areas)  Number of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed (Permanent Impact Areas)  Number of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed (Temporary Impact Areas)  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  58,000  32,394  25,606  Alternative Construction  55,188  32,394  22,794  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   2,812  -  2,812  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  56,795  34,347  22,448  Alternative Construction  54,511  34,347  20,164  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   2,284  -  2,284  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  47,448  24,161  23,287  Alternative Construction  43,596  24,161  19,435  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   3,852  -  3,852  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  47,101  24,048  23,053  Alternative Construction  43,249  24,048  19,201  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   3,852  -  3,852  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A  N/A  N/A  Note: An estimate of hazard trees to be removed is included in the Permanent Impact Area totals.  Tree Volume Forested areas were delineated by the stratification of the CALVEG layer and were assigned a volume per acre from the best available USFS inventory data linked by the attributes of forest type, crown size, and crown cover. Intersections of the land cover that contained the tree volumes on a per acre basis and the associated project areas created thousands of unique polygons, each with their own acreages. Project totals were estimated by multiplying the acreages of the unique polygons by the geographically-specific estimated tree volume/acre totals (FCO 2013).  The estimated cubic foot volume for all removed trees (permanent and temporary) was calculated and includes estimates for total volume and merchantable volume. The total cubic foot volume of trees includes all trees greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh, plus hazard trees within the hazard tree border zone and trees requiring removal for stringing sites related to the removal of the existing 625 Line, and is inclusive of merchantable volume (greater than or equal to 9 inches dbh). Merchantable volume includes conifer trees greater than or equal to 9 inches dbh, but excludes hazard trees, as hazard trees are assumed to be non-merchantable. To provide context for the cubic foot volume totals presented herein, in 2006 construction of the average residential unit in the United States and Canada used approximately 1,600 cubic feet of wood products (Adair and McKeever 2009). Table 4.3-3, Total Cubic Foot Volume to be Removed under the Project Alternatives, presents estimated cubic-foot volumes of all trees to be removed by alternative, both within the ROW and associated with removal of the existing 625 Line. Table 4.3-3 Total Cubic Foot Volume to be Removed under the Project Alternatives  Alternative  Total Cubic Foot Volume of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed  Total Merchantable Timber Volume in Cubic Feet (Conifers ≥9” dbh)  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  815,242  560,473  Alternative Construction  769,378  525,646  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   45,864  34,827  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  809,253  554,361  Alternative Construction  770,815  525,142  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   38,438  29,219  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  668,169  456,064  Alternative Construction  601,498  404,849  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   66,671  51,215  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  666,073  454,823  Alternative Construction   599,402  403,608  Stringing Sites Associated with Removal of the Existing 625 Line   66,671  51,215  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A  N/A  STREAM ENVIRONMENT ZONES As discussed, the SEZ designation is unique to the Lake Tahoe Basin, and includes riparian or hydric vegetation and provides important wildlife habitat and helps to reduce sediment and nutrient runoff. The estimated quantity of removed trees (greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh) and associated total tree volume (cubic feet) was calculated for forest land impact areas (permanent and temporary) in SEZs (FCO 2013). These totals exclude trees requiring removal for stringing sites related to the removal of the existing 625 Line as stringing sites will be placed to avoid SEZs. Table 4.3-4, Number of Trees and Cubic Foot Volume to be Removed in SEZs for the Project Alternatives, presents the estimated number of trees and associated cubic foot volume of trees to be removed in SEZs and includes hazard trees.  Table 4.3-4 Number of Trees and Cubic Foot Volume to be Removed in SEZs for the Project Alternatives  Alternative  Number of Trees ≥1”  dbh to be Removed  Total Cubic Foot Volume of  Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  1,721  16,911  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  1,696  16,471  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  1,543  14,770  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  1,542  14,758  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A  N/A  SEQUESTERED CARBON In addition to the forest land characteristics described above, an evaluation of impacts to sequestered carbon was conducted for this EIS/EIS/EIR utilizing the data developed by FCO (2013). This analysis is important to the understanding of the net change in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the project alternatives. Carbon sequestration is the process by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and deposited into a carbon reservoir (e.g., vegetation). Trees and vegetation take in CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, break down the CO2, store the carbon within plant parts, and release the oxygen back into the atmosphere. The removal of vegetation from forest land would be required as a result of the proposed project, thereby removing stored carbon from the project site and reducing future sequestration capability in permanent impact areas. Temporary impact areas and the abandoned portions of the existing 625 Line ROW would allow tree establishment and growth over time, which would store new carbon via normal growth. As presented in Section 4.13, Air Quality and Climate Change, of this EIS/EIS/EIR, the California Emission Estimator Model (CalEEMod) was used to calculate potential CO2 emissions associated with the proposed project. CalEEMod calculates potential CO2 releases associated with the vegetation removal activities of land use change and assumes that the sequestered carbon is released as CO2 after removal of the vegetation. By default, CalEEMod utilizes data and formulas based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, which are based on global studies rather than local data sets. However, project-specific values were developed from the cubic foot tree volume totals included in the forest land data set discussed herein. For this analysis, it is assumed that sequestered carbon from all non-merchantable volume would be returned to the atmosphere as CO2. This assumption presents a worst-case evaluation, as the release of sequestered carbon to the atmosphere as CO2 would likely occur over a long period of time via the natural decomposition process. The analysis of sequestered carbon loss presented in this section does not include CO2 emissions estimates associated with vegetation clearing or removal activities, the transport of merchantable trees offsite, or the disposal process. GHG emissions generated from such activities are included in the analysis presented in Section 4.13, Air Quality and Climate Change, of this EIS/EIS/EIR.  Custom Carbon Content Factors CalEEMod calculates project-related GHG emissions resulting from land conversion and, by default, uses five general IPCC land use classifications (forest land [scrub], forest land [trees], cropland, grassland, and wetlands) for assigning default carbon content values (in units of metric tons CO2/acre). Calculation of the one-time loss of sequestered carbon in CalEEMod is the product of the converted acreage value and the carbon content value for each land use type. Rather than utilize the general IPCC carbon content values, the forest land data set data developed by FCO for this project (2013) was analyzed for the action alternatives to calculate the total carbon volume in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MTCO2e) included in trees to be removed. The method for calculating the loss of sequestered carbon is presented below.  Loss of Sequestered Carbon A development that removes vegetation results in potential release of sequestered carbon to the atmosphere as CO2, which would not have been released had there been no vegetation removal. In CalEEMod, the amount of sequestered carbon which would be lost to the atmosphere is based on the conversion acreage of forest land and the carbon content per acre value. For this analysis, more detailed USFS forest land data was utilized to calculate the loss of sequestered carbon resulting from the proposed project. Specifically, total removed cubic foot tree volume (greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh) data generated by FCO (2013) formed the basis for the carbon-related calculations included in this EIS/EIS/EIR. The calculations conducted for this EIS/EIS/EIR are consistent with those presented in the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) Forest Project Protocol, v3.3 (CAR 2012a, 2012b).  The total cubic foot volume of trees to be removed (which includes trees in permanent and temporary impact areas plus hazard trees in the hazard tree border zone) includes merchantable tree volume. This analysis assumes that merchantable wood would be utilized as forest products thereby retaining sequestered carbon in wood products and reducing the amount of sequestered carbon assumed to be released to the atmosphere as CO2. Merchantable volume includes all removed conifer trees greater than or equal to 9 inches dbh, but excludes hazard trees, which are assumed to be non-merchantable. Additionally, this analysis assumes that 70 percent of merchantable wood volume would be converted to forest products (James, Krumland, and Eckert 2007), with the remaining 30 percent becoming waste. Therefore, the net tree volume expected to release its stored carbon to the atmosphere as CO2 includes the total cubic foot tree volume (greater than or equal to 1 inch dbh) removed less 70 percent of the volume of merchantable trees (greater than or equal to 9 inches dbh, excluding hazard trees). The following equation summarizes the determination of net tree volume: Net Tree Volume (ft3) = Total Tree Volume (ft3) - (Merchantable Tree Volume (ft3) * 0.70) After accounting for the tree volume to be converted to forest products, biomass was calculated from the net tree volume expected to release its stored carbon to the atmosphere as CO2. As the USFS inventory data used for this analysis does not indicate species distributions, the net cubic foot volume was converted to biomass using the carbon/wood density factor for white fir, which is presumed to be the dominant species across the project area (FCO 2013). The source of the carbon/wood density factor is the Regional Biomass Equations provided by CAR (2012a). The following equation was used in calculating biomass (CAR 2012b): Biomass (tons) = (Net Volume [ft3] * 23.09 [carbon/wood density factor])/2,000 Finally, the conversion formulae presented in the CAR Quantification Guidance document (CAR 2012b) were used to convert the calculated biomass total to a MTCO2e value. The following equation was used in calculating MTCO2e: MTCO2e = ((Biomass (tons) * 0.50) * 3.67) * 0.90718474 Table 4.3-5, Total Sequestered Carbon to be Released by Timber Removal for the Project Alternatives, presents the total sequestered carbon expected to be released to the atmosphere as CO2 from the one time activity of timber removal, by alternative.  Table 4.3-5 Total Sequestered Carbon to be Released by Timber Removal for the Project Alternatives  Alternative  Total MTCO2e Released  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  8,128  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  8,095  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  6,706  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  6,682  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A   Loss of Carbon Sequestration Potential The loss of carbon sequestration potential is an assessment of the amount of carbon which would have been sequestered by trees had they not been removed by a project alternative. Sequestration rates vary across the landscape, and are affected by forest type, forest structure, stand age, location, disturbance regimes, management history, soil conditions, and climate, amongst others. As specific carbon sequestration rates for forest land in the project area are not currently available, an analysis of sequestration potential loss by project alternative was conducted by comparing the amount of carbon currently sequestered in trees within the project area with an estimated future carbon content value assumed at a time when the forest habitat reaches a higher level of maturity. The current carbon content values used in this analysis are those calculated by FCO (2013) for permanently impacted forest land areas and hazard trees in the hazard tree border zone because those trees would not be removed if the project alternatives were not implemented. The values for carbon sequestered in permanent impact areas and hazard trees are presented in the data tables included in Appendix H.  The future carbon content value was calculated by multiplying the acreage of permanently-impacted forest land (as presented in Table 4.3-1) by the Common Practice carbon content value for the Sierra Mixed Conifer forest type (146.1 MTCO2/acre), as presented by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) (ARB n.d.). The product of this calculation represents a potential future condition which the forest land areas may meet without implementation of a project alternative. Note that the 146.1 MTCO2/acre ARB estimate of future forest carbon content is the same value used below in the discussion of Future Carbon Sequestration as an estimate of forest carbon content that might ultimately develop in the abandoned 625 Line. The current carbon content value was then subtracted from the estimated future carbon content value, as it was below the Common Practice value, to determine the loss of carbon sequestration potential for each project alternative. This analysis compares current carbon storage with an estimated future average and is based on the best available information for forest carbon content, as presented by the California ARB. Table 4.3-6, Loss of Carbon Sequestration Potential in Permanent Impact Areas and Hazard Tree Border Zone for the Project Alternatives, presents the loss of carbon sequestration potential totals, by project alternative.  Table 4.3-6 Loss of Carbon Sequestration Potential in Permanent Impact Areas and Hazard Tree Border Zone for the Project Alternatives  Alternative  Permanent Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  Common Practice MTCO2e Content (per acre)  Calculated Common Practice MTCO2e Content in Permanent Impact Areas  Removed MTCO2e in Permanent Impact Areas and Hazard Trees  Lost MTCO2e Sequestration Potential  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  121.9  146.1  17,810  8,897  8,913  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  128.2  146.1  18,730  9,589  9,141  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  93.1  146.1  13,602  6,602  7,000  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  92.8  146.1  13,558  6,592  6,966  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A  N/A  N/A  N/A  N/A   Potential Future Carbon Sequestration To account for potential future carbon sequestration within portions of the existing 625 Line ROW which would be abandoned under the project alternatives, and within temporarily-impacted forest land, the forest land areas were multiplied by the average per acre carbon content value for the Sierra Mixed Conifer forest type (146.1 MTCO2/acre), as presented by the California ARB (ARB n.d.). The abandoned forest land area excludes any areas which may be impacted by a project alternative. Additionally, this abandonment acreage estimation includes only abandoned forest land areas which are assumed to be suitable for growing trees and excludes non-compatible areas (e.g., rock outcrops and existing roads) (FCO 2013). Temporarily-impacted areas include only those designated as forest land and also exclude non-compatible areas. Native conifer re-establishment and growth within the abandoned ROW would be expected to occur naturally once vegetation management activities are discontinued in the ROW. Within temporarily-impacted areas, revegetation efforts would be implemented as a part of APM 4.7-5. Potential future sequestration would be expected to occur over a period of approximately 100 years and it is assumed that re-growth will be similar to adjacent forest land. This time frame is based on the estimated age of forest land in the region, which is assumed to date back to Comstock-era logging activity which occurred in the region between 1860 and 1920 (Lindstrӧm 2000, Taylor et al. 2012). Table 4.3-7, Potential Future Carbon Sequestration for the Project Alternatives, presents the potential future carbon sequestration totals, by alternative.  Table 4.3-7 Potential Future Carbon Sequestration for the Project Alternatives  Alternative  Acreage of Forest Land in Abandoned ROW  MTCO2e Sequestered Over Time in Abandoned ROW  Acreage of Forest Land in Temporary Impact Areas  MTCO2e Sequestered Over Time in Temporary Impact Areas  Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  22.8  3,331  97.9  14,303  Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative)  21.2  3,097  86.4  12,623  Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative)  26.6  3,886  92.4  13,500  Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  26.7  3,901  91.6  13,383  Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative)  N/A  N/A  N/A  N/A   ISSUES NOT DISCUSSED FURTHER As discussed above in Section 4.3.1, Regulatory Setting, all project components are listed as permissible in the applicable TRPA PASs, with the exception of the existing distribution underbuild on the 625 Line within the Lower Truckee (003) PAS and the proposed upgrade of the Kings Beach Substation in the Martis Peak (019) PAS. The focus of forest land zoning in California is preservation of timberland devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber, or for growing and harvesting timber and compatible uses. Transferring existing non-conforming distribution underbuild to new poles in the Lower Truckee (003) PAS or the addition of the Kings Beach Substation as an allowable use in the Martis Peak (019) PAS would not lessen the capability to manage for forest resources in each PAS, nor would it affect the distribution of forest land in each PAS or in the region. Therefore, project consistency/inconsistency with PAS requirements are not considered further as a potential mechanisms to generate conflicts with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of, forest land, timberland, or timberland zoned Timberland Production. The issue of project consistency with PAS requirements is addressed in detail in Section 4.2, Land Use. ALTERNATIVE 1 - PEA ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.3-1 (Alt.1)  Conflict with or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ. Implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not result in a conflict with existing Placer County forest land/timberland-related zoning or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ located in the project footprint (i.e., FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ). Electric lines are allowed without land use permit approval under the Placer Zoning Ordinance on FOR, RF, and TPZ lands. Therefore, there would be no impact.  Much of the project site is on federal land (USFS, US Army Corps of Engineers) that does not contain zoning designations relevant to the CEQA significance criteria addressing rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ. This zoning criteria relates to zoning by local jurisdictions (e.g., Placer County). Portions of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would occur on land currently zoned by Placer County for forestry or timber-related purposes (i.e., FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ). Pursuant to CPUC General Order 131, local zoning designations do not apply as Placer County would not have discretionary permitting authority over the project as they are preempted from regulating electric power line projects, distribution lines, substations, or electric facilities constructed by public utilities subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. Therefore, this information is provided for informational purposes only (see Section 4.1, Introduction, for further discussion of CPUC General Order 131). This Alternative includes no proposal to alter existing zoning designations and does not require rezoning to accommodate project activities. No land use permit approval is required for electrical lines on land zoned by Placer County as FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ, because they typically: 1) involve no or minimal construction activities; 2) are accessory to some other land use that would be the primary use of a site (which would require a land use permit); or 3) are otherwise entirely consistent with the purposes of the particular zone (Placer County 1995). Therefore, implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not conflict with existing zoning or cause rezoning of land under the jurisdiction of Placer County currently zoned for forestry, timberland, or TPZ. There would be no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-2 (Alt.1)  Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses or loss of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would result in the removal of approximately 58,000 trees in up to 219.8 acres of forest land plus hazard tree border zones as part of project construction and long-term vegetation management in the power line ROW and in new access ways. Permanent tree removal would occur within the 40-foot wide power line ROW, along new access ways, at substation locations, and selectively within the hazard tree border zone and includes removal of approximately 32,395 trees within roughly 121.9 acres of forest land (excluding the hazard tree border zone). Tree removal in temporary impact areas would occur within the temporary construction ROW (12.5 feet in either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites and includes removal of approximately 25,605 trees within roughly 97.9 acres of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would also result in the one-time release of approximately 8,130 MTCO2e currently sequestered in forest land. Potential future sequestration of approximately 8,913 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 22.8 acres of land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW would result in an overall permanent forest land impact of 99.1 acres associated with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). The 22.8 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,330 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 14,305 MTCO2e over time. Tree removal would not result in substantial changes to adjacent stand structure or regional forest land composition or distribution. Forest land would not be lost or converted to a non-forest use as project-related activities are compatible uses with forest land zoning designations in the project area. With integration of APMs BIO-1, 21, 23, 26, 28, 36, and 37 into project design and implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.7-4 and 4.7-5, effects on forest land would be further minimized. Therefore, this impact would be considered less than significant.  As identified previously, forest land is defined in PRC Section 12220(g) as land that can support 10 percent native tree cover of any species, including hardwoods, under natural conditions, and that allows for management of one or more forest resources, including timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, biodiversity, water quality, recreation, and other public benefits. For the purposes of this analysis, forest communities identified above in the description of Existing Conditions/Affected Environment are assumed to fall within the definition of forest land. Within the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) forest land study area, approximately 121.9 acres of forest land would be permanently impacted for construction of ROWs, access ways, and substations. Selective tree removal would also be conducted in the hazard tree border zone, which includes the area within 150-feet of the power line center line. Tree removal in temporary impact areas would occur within the temporary ROW (12.5 feet in either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites. Tree removal within permanent and temporary impact areas and the hazard tree border zone would total approximately 58,000 trees (including approximately 1,720 trees in SEZ areas), which include roughly 815,240 cubic feet of wood volume (including approximately 16,910 cubic feet in SEZ areas). Impacts specific to late seral/old-growth trees are discussed in Section 4.7, Biological Resources, of this document. Tree removal would also result in the one-time release of approximately 8,130 MTCO2e. Potential future sequestration of approximately 8,913 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 22.8 acres of forest land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW, project implementation would result in an overall permanent forest land impact of approximately 99.1 acres associated with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) (121 acres permanent impact minus 22.8 acres of regeneration in the abandoned 625 Line ROW). The 22.8 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,330 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 14,305 MTCO2e over time. Carbon sequestration within the abandoned 625 Line ROW is expected to reach the totals presented herein over a period of approximately 100 years, based on the timeframe of Comstock-era logging activity in the region between 1860 and 1920 (Lindstrӧm 2000, Taylor et al. 2012). Although trees would be removed from a relatively large total area, this would not constitute a permanent conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. As discussed previously, forest land and timberland zoning (Placer County) identifies power lines as a compatible use within land currently zoned for forestry or timber-related purposes. Permanent tree removal would primarily occur within the narrow power line ROW and access ways, which is not expected to result in substantial changes to adjacent stand structure or regional forest land composition or distribution. Also, as outlined in APM BIO-37, the permanent loss of trees would be offset, in part, by abandonment of the existing 652 Line ROW, which would be allowed to regenerate, and temporary disturbance areas would be revegetated with native vegetation and locally collected native plants and seeds (Mitigation Measure 4.7-5 [Alt. 1]).  As described in Section 4.7, Biological Resources, APMs BIO-1, 21, 23, 26, 28, 36, and 37 have been incorporated into the project design to minimize, avoid, and reduce potential adverse effects from tree removal and loss of common vegetation communities, including forest land. These APMs are listed below and all APMs are described in Section 3.7, Applicant Proposed Measures.  APM BIO-1: Prior to construction, all CalPeco, contractor, and subcontractor project personnel will receive training from qualified resource specialists regarding the appropriate work practices necessary to effectively implement the APMs and to comply with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, including appropriate wildlife avoidance measures, impact minimization procedures, the importance of sensitive resources, and the purpose and methods for protecting such resources. Among other topics, the training will also include a discussion of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce the potential for erosion and sedimentation during construction.  APM BIO-21: Qualified environmental monitors will be present with each crew during all vegetation-removal activities to help ensure that impacts to biological resources are minimized to the extent possible. For all other construction activities, monitors will be allowed to cover up to 5 miles of the project area at once to allow multiple crews to work in close proximity to each other at the same time. Environmental monitors will have the authority to stop work or direct work in order to help ensure the protection of resources and compliance with all permits.  APM BIO-23: Topsoil, where present, will be salvaged in areas that will be graded or excavated. Topsoil will be segregated, stockpiled separately from subsoil, and covered. The topsoil will then be replaced to the approximate location of its removal after project construction has been completed to facilitate revegetation of disturbed areas. Topsoil will not be salvaged where permanent facilities are planned or where operation and maintenance activities preclude the establishment of vegetation.  APM BIO-26: Work areas will be clearly marked with fencing, staking, flagging, or another appropriate material. All project personnel and equipment will be confined to delineated work areas. In the event that work must occur outside of the work area, approval from lead and other agencies with jurisdiction over the property will be obtained prior to the commencement of activities.  APM BIO-28: CalPeco will minimize vegetation and tree removal to only the areas necessary for construction, especially in riparian areas.  APM BIO-36: Prior to construction, CalPeco will develop a Restoration Plan that will address final clean-up, stabilization, and revegetation procedures for areas disturbed by the project. The Restoration Plan will address loosening of any compacted soil, restoration of surface residue, and reseeding. If existing unpaved roads require modification to temporarily allow passage of construction equipment during the construction period, these roads will be returned to their original footprint after construction is complete. Areas temporarily disturbed by cut and fill activities would be re-graded to blend with the natural topography. On public land, CalPeco will coordinate with the land management agency to determine an appropriate seed mix or tree planting plan. On private land, CalPeco will coordinate with the landowner and/or provide the landowner with a suggested seed mix based on consultation with the agency of jurisdiction. The plan will include approved seed mixes, application rates, and application methods. If broadcast seeding is determined to be the most feasible application method, seeding rates will be doubled relative to the standard seeding rate and the seeding method rationale will be explained. The plan will also include long-term erosion and sediment control measures, slope stabilization, and monitoring procedures. As part of normal equipment inspections an evaluation of access ways will be conducted to confirm that use has not resulted in compaction that would result in “coverage” per TRPA standards.   APM BIO-37: Decommissioning the existing 625 Line ROW and allowing natural regeneration of coniferous forest and other native vegetation types will assist in offsetting the permanent loss of trees and other vegetation along the new 625 Line ROW. Prior to the removal of poles and conductor, a qualified biologist or soil scientist will identify areas of the abandoned ROW that contain unnaturally compacted soil (resulting from unauthorized public use, development of user-created trails, or other factors) that could limit the natural reestablishment of vegetation and assess whether local treatments would be needed to facilitate native vegetation recruitment and development. CalPeco will consult with the applicable land owner/manager to verify that areas identified for treatments are appropriate (e.g., not part of a system road, authorized trail network, or other desired use) and secure approval for restoration. Restoration of these sites will be overseen by a qualified biologist and will likely consist of a combination of the following.  Barricade existing access points and post appropriate signage to discourage use.  Loosen compacted soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches.  Incorporate logs and boulders into the disturbed area to discourage use.  Apply appropriate erosion control Best Management Practices (e.g., installation of check dams, mulch, log and/or rock stabilization) in areas where evidence of sheet, rill, or gully erosion exists.  Seed with a certified weed-free seed mix, approved by the applicable land owner/manager, containing native and site-appropriate species.  Apply 1 to 2 inches of locally obtained mulch such as pine needles, wood chips, or tub grindings.  Monitor for new noxious weed invasions and expansion of existing weed populations following treatments, and implement weed control measures where needed. Post-treatment monitoring for noxious weeds would be conducted annually for up to three years, similar to the frequency and duration specified for USFS land in the USFS Noxious Weed Risk Assessment prepared for the project.  Conduct post-treatment monitoring and reporting every two years for up to 10 years, to evaluate success of restoration treatments. The details of the monitoring and reporting program, including identification and implementation of potential adaptive management actions based on monitoring results, will be developed jointly by CalPeco, TRPA, and the land owner/manager.  Effects on forest resources would be further minimized with implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.7-4 (Alt. 1), which includes a pre-construction focused tree survey for the selected alternative, development of necessary timber harvest plans, and securing of all necessary permits. Overall, implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of forest land in the project area or interrupt the natural processes that support forest land. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-3 (Alt.1)  Change in existing environment that could result in conversion of forest land to non-forest use. Project activities are compatible with Placer County zoning and do not result in zoning changes that could promote growth. Although the proposed project responds to growth planned/authorized by others, it does not itself promote development that could result in forest land conversion. Implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not involve additional changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could temporarily or permanently result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would result in no impact.   Project activities are compatible with Placer County zoning and there would be no changes in zoning that would allow or promote conversion of forest land to another use. Additionally, as described in the discussion of growth-inducing impacts in Chapter 5, Other NEPA-, TRPA-, and CEQA-Mandated Sections, the project does not promote additional development that could convert forest land to another use. Growth in the project area is planned and regulated by the regional plans, general plans, zoning regulations, and other regulations of TRPA, Placer County, Nevada County, and the Town of Truckee. Utilities and service providers in the Lake Tahoe Basin and the Truckee and North Tahoe regions plan and upgrade their facilities based on growth projections provided by the local government agencies. The provision of electrical service responds to growth authorized by other entities and does not itself promote growth. The intent of the project is to increase reliability of the system and to allow re-routes of power and continued service to customers when part of the system is out of service. Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would not involve additional changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could temporarily or permanently result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would result in no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 2 – MODIFIED ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.3-1 (Alt.2)  Conflict with or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ. Implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would not result in a conflict with existing Placer County forest land/timberland related zoning or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ located in the project footprint (i.e., FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ). Power lines are allowed without land use permit approval under the Placer Zoning Ordinance on FOR, RF, and TPZ lands. Therefore, there would be no impact.  This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-1, (Alt.1) described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), there would be no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required.  IMPACT 4.3-2 (Alt.2)  Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses or loss of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would result in the removal of approximately 56,795 trees in up to 214.6 acres of forest land plus hazard tree border zones as part of project construction and long-term vegetation management in the power line ROW and in new access ways. Permanent tree removal would occur within the 40-foot wide power line ROW (and the 65-foot ROW in double-circuit segments), along new access ways, at substations, and selectively within the hazard tree border zone and includes removal of approximately 34,345 trees within roughly 128.2 acres of forest land (excluding the hazard tree border zone). Tree removal in temporary impact areas would occur within the temporary ROW (12.5 feet in either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW in single-circuit segments), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites and includes removal of approximately 22,450 trees within roughly 86.4 acres of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would also result in the one-time release of 8,095 MTCO2e currently sequestered in forest land. Potential future sequestration of approximately 9,141 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 21.2 acres of forest land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW would result in a overall permanent forest land impact of 107.0 acres associated with Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). The 21.2 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,095 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 12,625 MTCO2e over time. Tree removal would not result in substantial changes to adjacent stand structure or regional forest land composition or distribution. Forest land would not be lost or converted to a non-forest use as project-related activities are compatible uses with forest land zoning designations in the project area. With integration of APMs BIO-1, 21, 23, 26, 28, 36, and 37 into project design and implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.7-4 and 4.7-5, effects on forest land would be further minimized. Therefore, this impact would be considered less than significant.  This impact would be similar to Impact 4.11-2 (Alt.1) described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) except for the quantity, volume, and acreage of tree removal and one-time MTCO2e released. Implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would result in approximately 128.2 acres of forest land being permanently impacted for construction of ROWs, access ways, and substations. Permanent tree removal, selective tree removal in the hazard tree border zone, and tree removal in temporary impact areas would total approximately 56,795 trees (including roughly 1,695 trees in SEZ areas), which includes roughly 809,255 cubic feet of wood volume (including approximately 16,470 cubic feet in SEZ areas). Tree removal would also result in the one-time release of approximately 8,095 MTCO2e. Potential future sequestration of approximately 9,141 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 21.2 acres of forest land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW would result in an overall permanent forest land impact of 107.0 acres associated with Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) (128.2 acres of permanent impact minus 21.2 acres of regeneration in the abandoned 625 Line ROW). The 21.2 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,095 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 12,625 MTCO2e over time. For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) (e.g., integration of APMs into the project design and implementation of mitigation measures), this impact would be less than significant. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-3 (Alt.2)  Change in existing environment that could result in conversion of forest land to non-forest land. Project activities are compatible with Placer County zoning and do not result in zoning changes that could promote growth. Although the proposed project responds to growth planned/authorized by others, it does not itself promote development that could result in forest land conversion. Implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would not involve additional changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could temporarily or permanently result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would result in no impact.   This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-3 (Alt.1) described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). For the same reasons described for PEA Alternative (Alternative 1), there would be no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 3 – ROAD FOCUSED ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.3-1 (Alt.3)  Conflict with or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ. Implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would not result in a conflict with existing Placer County forest land/timberland related zoning or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ located in the project footprint (i.e., FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ). Power lines are allowed without land use permit approval under the Placer Zoning Ordinance on FOR, RF, and TPZ lands. Therefore, there would be no impact.  This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-1 (Alt.1) described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), there would be no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-2 (Alt.3)  Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses or loss of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would result in the removal of approximately 47,450 trees in up to 185.5 acres of forest land plus hazard tree border zones as part of project construction and long-term vegetation management in the power line ROW and in new access ways. Permanent tree removal would occur within the 40-foot wide power line ROW (and the 65-foot ROW for double-circuit segments), along new access ways, at substation locations, and selectively within the hazard tree border zone and includes removal of approximately 24,160 trees within roughly 93.1 acres of forest land (excluding the hazard tree border zone). Tree removal within temporary impact areas would occur within the temporary ROW (12.5 feet in either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW in single-circuit segments), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites and includes removal of approximately 23,285 trees within roughly 92.4 acres of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would also result in the one-time release of approximately 6,705 MTCO2e currently sequestered in forest land. Potential future sequestration of approximately 7,000 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 26.6 acres of land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line  ROW would result in an overall permanent forest land impact of approximately 66.5 acres associated with Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative). The 26.6 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,885 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 13,500 MTCO2e over time. Tree removal would not result in substantial changes to adjacent stand structure or regional forest land composition or distribution. Forest land would not be lost or converted to a non-forest use as project-related activities are compatible uses with forest land zoning designations in the project area. With integration of APMs BIO-1, 21, 23, 26, 28, 36, and 37 and Mitigation Measures 4.7-4 and 4.7-5, effects on forest land would be further minimized. Therefore, this impact would be considered less than significant.  This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-2 (Alt.1) described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) except for the quantity, volume, and acreage of tree removal and one-time MTCO2e released. Implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would result in approximately 93.1 acres of forest land being permanently impacted for construction of ROWs, access ways, and substations. Permanent tree removal, selective tree removal in the hazard tree border zone, and tree removal in temporary impact areas would total approximately 47,450 trees (including approximately 1,545 trees in SEZ areas), which include roughly 668,170 cubic feet of wood volume (including approximately 14,770 cubic feet in SEZ areas). Tree removal would also result in the one-time release of approximately 6,705 MTCO2e. Potential future sequestration of approximately 7,000 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 26.6 acres of forest land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW would result in an overall permanent forest land impact of 66.5 acres associated with Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) (93.1 acres of permanent impact minus 26.6 acres of regeneration in the abandoned 625 Line ROW). The 26.6 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,885 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 13,500 MTCO2e over time. For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this impact would be less than significant. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-3 (Alt.3)  Change in existing environment that could result in conversion of forest land to non-forest land. Project activities are compatible with Placer County zoning and do not result in zoning changes that could promote growth. Although the proposed project responds to growth planned/authorized by others, it does not itself promote development that could result in forest land conversion. Implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would not involve additional changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or nature, could temporarily or permanently result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would result in no impact.   This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-3 (Alt.1), described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), there would be no impact.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 4 – PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.3-1 (Alt.4)  Conflict with or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ. Implementation of Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would not result in a conflict with existing Placer County forest land/timberland-related zoning or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ located in the project footprint (i.e., FOR, FOR-B-X-160 AC. MIN., RF-B-X 10 AC. MIN., and TPZ). Power lines are allowed without land use permit approval under the Placer Zoning Ordinance on FOR, RF, and TPZ lands. Therefore, there would be no impact.  This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-1 (Alt.1), described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), there would be no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-2 (Alt.4)  Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses or loss of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would result in the removal of approximately 47,100 trees in up to 184.4 acres of forest land plus hazard tree border zones as part of project construction and long-term vegetation management in the power line ROW and in new access ways. Permanent tree removal would occur within the 40-foot wide power line ROW (and a 65-foot ROW for double-circuit segments), along new access ways, at substation locations, and selectively within the hazard tree border zone and includes removal of approximately 24,050 trees within roughly 92.8 acres of forest land (excluding the hazard tree border zone). Tree removal in temporary impact areas would occur within the temporary ROW (12.5 feet in either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW in single-circuit segments), staging areas, and stringing/pulling sites and includes removal of approximately 23,055 trees within roughly 91.6 acres of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would also result in the one-time release of approximately 6,680 MTCO2e currently sequestered in forest land. Potential future sequestration of approximately 6,966 MTCO2e over time would also be lost. Considering forest regeneration on up to 26.7 acres of land currently maintained in the existing 625 Line ROW would result in an overall permanent forest land impact of 66.1 acres associated with Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative). The 26.7 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,900 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 13,385 MTCO2e over time. Tree removal would not result in substantial changes to adjacent stand structure or regional forest land composition or distribution. Forest land would not be lost or converted to a non-forest use as project-related activities are compatible uses with forest land zoning designations in the project area. With integration of APMs BIO-01, 21, 23, 26, 28, 37 into project design and implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.7-4 and 4.7-5, effects on forest land would be further minimized. Therefore, this impact would be considered less than significant.  This impact would be the same as Impact 4.11-2 (Alt.1) described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) except for the quantity, volume, and acreage of tree removal and one-time MTCO2e released. Implementation of Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would result in approximately 92.8 acres of forest land being permanently impacted for construction of ROWs, access ways, and substations. Permanent tree removal, selective tree removal in the hazard tree border zone, and tree removal in temporary impact areas would total approximately 47,100 trees (including roughly 1,540 trees in SEZ areas), which include approximately 666,075 cubic feet of wood volume (including roughly 14,760 cubic feet in SEZ areas). Tree removal would also result in the one-time release of approximately 6,680 MTCO2e. Potential future sequestration of approximately 6,966 MTCO2e over time would also be lost.

The 26.7 acres of forest land regeneration in the existing 625 Line ROW would sequester approximately 3,900 MTCO2e over time and re-growth within temporarily-impacted areas would sequester approximately 13,385 MTCO2e over time. For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this impact would be less than significant. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-3 (Alt.4)  Change in existing environment that could result in conversion of forest land to non-forest land.

For the same reasons described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), there would be no impact.  MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 5 – NO ACTION/NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE  DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.3-1 (Alt.5)  Conflict with or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ. Implementation of Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would not have the potential to result in conflicts with existing zoning or cause rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ because existing facilities would not be changed and new facilities would not be constructed. No impact would occur.   Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), the project would not be implemented and no new or upgraded power lines or related facilities would be constructed, no new or improved access ways would be built, and no expansion of the existing ROW would occur. Actions associated with this alternative would be limited to existing operations and maintenance and completion of deferred ROW maintenance, which would be in compliance with existing regulations (CPUC General Order 95) and approved plans and permits. Maintenance access would be gained via existing easements and rights-of-way. No conflicts with existing zoning would occur and no rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ would occur. Therefore, this alternative would have no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-2 (Alt.5)  Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses or loss of forest land. Implementation of Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would not result in the conversion of forest land to non-forest uses as no new power lines, access roadways, or related facilities would be constructed. Ongoing vegetation management within the existing ROW would continue under existing regulations and previously-approved management plans and permits. No impact would occur.   Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), the project would not be implemented and no new or upgraded power lines or related facilities would be constructed, no new ROW or access roadways would be built, and no expansion of the existing ROW would occur. Actions associated with this alternative would be limited to existing operations and maintenance and completion of deferred ROW maintenance, which would include removal of trees in the existing ROW. While tree removal would occur, it would be conducted in compliance with existing regulations (CPUC General Order 95) and approved plans and permits. Maintenance access would be gained via existing easements and rights-of-way. No conversion or loss of forest land would occur; therefore, this alternative would have no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.3-3 (Alt.5)  Change in existing environment that could result in conversion of forest land to non-forest use. No new power lines, access roadways, or related facilities would be constructed under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) and vegetation management within the existing ROW would continue under existing regulations and previously-approved management plans and permits. Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) does not include any features that would indirectly result in the conversion of forest lands. No impact would occur.  Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), the project would not be implemented and no new or upgraded power lines or related facilities would be constructed, no new or improved access ways would be built, and no expansion of the existing ROW would occur.

Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) does not include any features that would indirectly result in the conversion of forest lands. Therefore, this alternative would have no impact. MITIGATION MEASURES No mitigation measures are required. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS The action alternatives result in no impact related to conflicts with or causing rezoning of forest land, timberland, or TPZ and changes in the existing environmental that could result in conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. Therefore, the action alternatives could not contribute to any cumulative impact related to these issues. The following analysis focusses on the conversion of forest land to non-forest uses and loss of forest land from implementation of the action alternatives. The geographic scope for analyzing the cumulative effects on forest land consists of the Truckee-Tahoe Region. As discussed above, the action alternatives would result in temporary forest land impacts (i.e., trees removed during construction but trees allowed to regrow) on 86.4 to 97.9 acres of forest land and permanent forest land impacts (i.e., the permanent conversion of forest land to another use or trees removed and not allowed to grow back due to ROW vegetation management) on 128.2 to 92.8 acres of forest land habitats (see Table 4.3-1, Forest Land Conversion Acres for Project Alternatives). However, when considering the restoration of forest habitat resulting from the abandonment of the existing 625 Line ROW, the action alternatives result in a net reduction in forested habitat of 66.1 to 107 acres. Although trees would be removed from a relatively large total area, this does not necessary constitute a permanent conversion of forest land to a non-forest use. The presence of the project does not preclude the ongoing growth of trees in the power line right-of-way and access ways, as evidenced by the need for ongoing vegetation management. If the project were moved to a new location at a later date, trees would return to the vacated right-of-way. This return of trees to an abandoned right-of-way is expected to occur as a result of the proposed project where the existing 625 Line is removed and vegetation management ceases in the former right-of-way.  Trees removed as part of the action alternatives are only a small proportion of the amount of forest land present in the Truckee-Tahoe region (i.e., less than 1 percent). Further, tree removal would primarily occur within the narrow electric line ROW and access ways, which would not result in substantial changes in stand structure or composition or in the distribution of forest land in the project area overall. After installation of the proposed project, the forest would continue to function, providing timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, biodiversity, water quality, recreation, and other public benefits. As described in Section 4.7, Biological Resources, APMs-BIO-1, 21, 23, 26, 28, 36, and 37 and Mitigation Measure 4.7-4, the permanent and temporary removal of trees would be minimized to the extent feasible, forest land habitat would be restored to pre-project conditions in temporary construction areas, and the applicant compensates for unavoidable losses. Therefore, implementation of any of the action alternatives would not substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of forest land in the project area or interrupt the natural processes that support forest land.  Conversion of forest land to non-forest uses has occurred in the project region as a result of habitat conversions, residential and commercial development, utility and infrastructure development, and other compounding factors, such as lack of regeneration and pressures from invasive species. Thus, there is an existing significant cumulative impact associated with loss of forest land. However, for the reasons stated above, the tree removal and the prevention of tree growth in vegetation management corridors associated with the action alternatives would not result in a cumulatively considerable incremental contribution to this significant cumulative impact.     This page intentionally left blank.   4.4 SCENIC RESOURCES This section describes laws, ordinances, regulations and policies applicable to scenic resources, and existing conditions regarding scenic quality. Potential short-term and long-term scenic impacts that could result from project construction and operation are discussed and mitigation measures are recommended as necessary to reduce potentially significant adverse effects. 4.4.1 REGULATORY SETTING A variety of laws, regulations, plans, and policies related to scenic quality and scenic resource management are administered by federal and state agencies, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), and local agencies. Those that apply to the proposed project are discussed below.  The proposed project is located within and near overlapping jurisdictions that have policies pertaining to scenic resources. More than half of the project components are located on National Forest System (NFS) lands in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) and the Tahoe National Forest and much of the project area is within the jurisdiction of TRPA. The project is located in Placer and Nevada counties. Various communities and local planning jurisdictions also have policies that address visual quality in the project area. FEDERAL The National Forest Management Act requires the development of long-range land and resource management plans for NFS. The LTBMU Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) was approved in 1988 as required by the act (USFS 1988). It has been amended several times, including the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (2004). The LRMP provides guidance for all natural resource management activities within LTBMU managed lands. The Tahoe National Forest has a LRMP that specifically addresses management of Tahoe National Forest lands outside the LTMBU (USFS 2005). The National Forest Management Act requires all projects and activities to be consistent with the LRMP.  The applicable LRMPs direct forest management activities to consider scenic resources identified through the Visual Management System (VMS), which provides an overall framework for the inventory, analysis, and management of the visual environment (USFS 1974). Under the VMS, the US Forest Service (USFS) has established management goals referred to as Visual Quality Objectives (VQOs) to describe the level of visible modification resulting from proposed land use activities that are considered acceptable in a given area. The six VQOs, in order of scenic quality and levels of afforded protection, include Preservation (i.e., the highest degree of scenic quality), Protection (i.e., unaltered scenic quality), Retention (i.e., appearing unaltered), Partial Retention (i.e., appearing slightly altered), Modification (i.e., moderately altered), and Maximum Modification (i.e., heavily altered) (USFS 2001).  The VQO levels applicable to lands within the project area are:  Retention (R) – The Retention (R) VQO provides for management activities that are not visually evident. Under Retention, activities may only repeat form, line, color, and texture that are frequently found in the characteristic landscape. Changes in qualities of size, amount, intensity, direction, and pattern should not be evident.   Partial Retention (PR) – Under the Partial Retention (PR) VQO, management activities are to remain visually subordinate to the characteristic landscape. Activities may repeat form, line, color, and texture common to the characteristic landscape but changes in qualities of size, amount, intensity, direction, and pattern remain visually subordinate to the characteristic landscape. Activities may also introduce form, line, color, and texture that are found infrequently or not at all in the characteristic landscape, but they should remain visually subordinate to the visual strength of the characteristic landscape.   Modification (M) – Under the modification (M) VQO, management activities may visually dominate the original characteristic landscape. However, activities of vegetative and land form alterations must borrow from naturally established form, line, color, and texture so completely and at such a scale that its visual characteristics are those of natural occurrences within the surrounding area or character type (USFS 1974).  A map of the project area with VQO designations shown for NFS land managed by the USFS is presented in Exhibit 4.4-1. As shown, the primary VQO for NFS land affected by the project is Partial Retention. The project also crosses some NFS land with a VQO designation of Retention, as well as a limited area designated as Modification. Portions of the project are on lands within the jurisdictional boundaries of TRPA, which oversees land development in the Lake Tahoe Region; these portions of the project were evaluated using TRPA visual resources management criteria and guidelines, where applicable (discussed below). STATE California’s Scenic Highway Program was created by the Legislature in 1963 to preserve and protect scenic highway corridors from change that would diminish the aesthetic value of lands adjacent to highways. The State Scenic Highway System includes highways that are either eligible for designation as scenic highways or have been designated as such. There are no officially designated State Scenic Highways within the project viewshed. However, State Route (SR) 28 and SR 89 in Placer County and Interstate 80 (I-80) in both Placer and Nevada counties are eligible for designation as state scenic highways. Portions of the 650 Line and the 625 Line cross or are visible from these roadways. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY REGIONAL PLAN TRPA implements its authority to regulate growth and development in the Lake Tahoe Region through the Regional Plan. The Regional Plan includes Resolution 82-11, the Environmental Threshold Carrying Capacities (threshold standards), Goals and Policies, Code of Ordinances, and other guidance documents. ENVIRONMENTAL THRESHOLD CARRYING CAPACITIES TRPA adopted environmental threshold carrying capacities in August 1982 for the purpose of maintaining and improving the various resources of the Lake Tahoe Region. Scenic quality is an exceptional attribute of the Region, and specific threshold carrying capacities were developed to protect and improve the scenic resources of the area. TRPA threshold standards require maintenance of threshold rating values for roadway and shoreline travel routes, individually mapped scenic resources, recreation area scenic resources, and compatibility with the natural environment. According to Policy ME-1.1 of the Regional Plan, TRPA shall prepare evaluation reports every four years to evaluate the status and trend of threshold standard attainment (TRPA 2012a). The TRPA thresholds were most recently evaluated in 2011.  Following is a description of the TRPA threshold indicators for scenic resources that are relevant to the project alternatives. The methods for inventory and evaluation of travel routes and scenic resources are parallel with those employed by the USFS, and are standard practice within the LTBMU.  Source: Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.4-1 Visual Quality Objectives within NFS Lands Travel Route Ratings The TRPA travel route rating threshold tracks long-term, cumulative changes to views of the landscape from state and federal highways in urban, transitional, and natural landscapes in the region. The threshold also tracks changes to views from the surface of Lake Tahoe looking toward the shore. Major roadways within the Lake Tahoe Region have been divided into 53 segments called “Roadway Travel Units” based on their landscape characteristics. Lake Tahoe’s shoreline is similarly divided into an additional 33 segments called “Shoreline Travel Units.” The project would neither directly affect nor be visible from any of the Shoreline Travel Units because of screening by trees and man-made structures; therefore, Shoreline Travel Units are not discussed further.  The following six criteria are rated to determine the travel route rating threshold score for each Roadway Travel Unit: 1. Human-made features along roadways and shoreline; 2. Physical distractions to driving along roadways; 3. Roadway characteristics; 4. Views of the lake from roadways; 5. General landscape views from roadways and shoreline; and, 6. Variety of scenery from roadways and shoreline. The travel route rating is a unit-less, numerical rating (composite score) consisting of the sum of the ratings of the six different aspects of the landscape within each travel unit. To secure threshold attainment, travel route ratings must meet or exceed the threshold standard. To do this, the composite score of those roadway travel routes with a 1982 score of 15.5 or greater must be maintained at 1982 levels, and the composite score of all roadway travel routes with a 1982 score of 15 or lower, must improve until the minimum score of 15.5 is reached. Elements of the proposed project would be visible from the following Roadway Travel Units (Exhibit 4.4-2): Unit 14 – Tahoe Tavern, Unit 15 – Tahoe City, Unit 41 – Brockway Summit, and Unit 42 – Outlet to Lower Truckee River. As of 2011, Units 14, 15, and 41 currently meet or exceed the scenic threshold standard and Unit 42 does not (TRPA 2012c). Scenic Quality Ratings The purpose of this TRPA scenic quality threshold is to maintain or enhance views of individual, existing scenic resources. The scenic resources in the Region include certain views of the natural landscape and distinctive natural features that were identified, mapped, described, and evaluated as part of the 1982 Scenic Resource Evaluation (TRPA 1982). Scenic resources include:  foreground, middle-ground, and background views of the natural landscape from roadways;  certain views to Lake Tahoe from roadways;  certain views of Lake Tahoe and the natural landscape from roadway entry points into the region;  unique landscape features, such as streams, beaches, and rock formations that add interest and variety, as seen from roadways;  certain views of the shoreline, the water’s edge, and the foreground as seen from the lake;  certain views of the backdrop landscape, including the skyline, as seen from the lake; and  visual features on or near the shore that are of particular visual interest as seen from the lake (TRPA 1982). Numerical scenic quality ratings are derived for each mapped scenic resource using four visual indicators as subcomponents: unity, vividness, variety, and intactness. As defined by TRPA, unity is the degree to which the visual resources of a scene join together to form a single, coherent, harmonious unit. Vividness is a measure of contrasting elements, such as color, line, and shape, marked differences seen as related, or repetition of similarities. It is sometimes referred to as distinctiveness. Variety is numerous or different parts seen together and can be referred to as richness. Intactness describes the degree to which a landscape retains its natural condition, or the degree to which modifications emphasize or enhance the natural condition of the landscape (TRPA 2007). Each of these four indicators is rated on a scale from zero (absent) to three (high). The ratings for all four indicators are summed to yield the scenic quality rating (composite score) for a particular resource. To secure threshold attainment, the current rating of each scenic resource must meet or exceed the threshold standard, which is equal to the rating reported in the 1982 Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Resource Inventory. As of 2011, the scenic resources that could be affected by the proposed project, as listed below, were in attainment of the threshold standard for scenic quality (TRPA 2012c).   Within Roadway Travel Unit 14 – Tahoe Tavern: Scenic Resource 14-1, views of the natural landscape from the road (SR 89) and Scenic Resource 14-2, a visual feature that includes a meadow area across from the Tahoe Tavern.  Within Roadway Travel Unit 15 – Tahoe City: Scenic Resource 15-6, visual features that include views down the Truckee River and surrounding areas from Fanny Bridge.  Within Roadway Travel Unit 41 – Brockway Summit: Scenic Resource 41-1, entry point views looking south from SR 267 that include the highway corridor with Lake Tahoe seen in the distance.  Within Roadway Travel Unit 42 – Outlet to the Truckee River: Scenic Resource 42-6, views of natural landscape from SR 89 that include the river (TRPA 1982).  The locations of these scenic resources are shown in Exhibit 4.4-2.  Public Recreation Areas and Bike Trails Ratings The TRPA public recreation area scenic quality threshold applies to 37 specific public recreation areas, including certain beaches, campgrounds, ski areas, and 11 segments of Class I and Class II bicycle trails listed in the Lake Tahoe Scenic Resource Evaluation, II. Recreation Areas (TRPA 1993). Public recreation areas with views of scenic resources are valuable because they are major public gathering places, hold high scenic values, and are places where people are static (compared to people on the travel routes) and, therefore, have more time to focus their attention on the views and scenic resources. Scenic resources visible from public recreation areas include:  views of the lake and the surrounding natural landscape from within the recreation area,  views of distinctive natural features that are within the recreation area, and  views of human-made features in or adjacent to the recreation area that influence the viewing experience. Scenic quality threshold ratings for scenic resources associated with public recreation areas and bike trails are derived in the same manner described above for scenic resources within Roadway Travel Units, using the same visual indicators of unity, vividness, variety, and intactness.  TRPA’s inventory of public recreation areas and bike trails was developed in 1993. Since then, new public recreation areas and bike trails have been developed but are not yet included in the inventory. The 64-Acre Recreation Site in Tahoe City that now serves as a recreation area and the Truckee River Bike Trail that passes through the 64-Acre Recreation Site and alongside the Truckee River are among these facilities. Elements of the proposed project would be visible from these facilities and the analysis of scenic impacts considers these views.  Source: Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.4-2 TRPA Roadway Travel Units and Scenic Resources COMMUNITY DESIGN  The TRPA community design threshold is a policy statement that applies to the built environment and is intended to ensure that design elements of buildings are compatible with the natural, scenic, and recreational values of the Region. The community design threshold is implemented through the community plan process, wherein design standards and guidelines are developed to meet the needs and desires of individual communities, and through the site planning process, wherein the design principles of the TRPA Code are implemented as part of individual development projects, and are reviewed and approved by TRPA and local governments. None of the project alternatives would result in construction of buildings. GOALS AND POLICIES The Regional Plan includes two elements relevant to scenic resources, the Conservation Element, Scenic Sub-element and the Land Use Element, Community Design Sub-element (TRPA 2012a). Scenic Goal SR-1 is to “maintain and restore the scenic qualities of the natural appearing landscape.” In support of this goal, Policy SR-1.1 states that, “all proposed development shall examine impacts to the identified landscape views from roadways, bike paths, public recreation areas, and Lake Tahoe.”  CODE OF ORDINANCES The following chapters of the TRPA Code of Ordinances contain aesthetic standards that are relevant to the project (TRPA 2012b). Design Standards Chapter 36, “Design Standards,” of the TRPA Code contains design standards, including standards for site design, building design, landscaping, and lighting. The TRPA Design Review Guidelines provide a summary of the Code requirements and guidelines or suggestions for attainment of the standards (TRPA 1989a).  Scenic Standards Chapter 36 of the TRPA Code also contains design standards pertaining to scenic quality. These standards establish a process for analyzing projects for scenic quality and outlines when visual simulations and other documents are required. They also require a security deposit equal to the cost of scenic mitigation measures for projects visible from nonattainment areas, and a five-year review for continued presence and maintenance. Chapter 66 of the TRPA Code contains scenic quality standards, provides scenic highway corridor design standards, and establishes scenic quality review processes. Specifically, Subsections 66.1.4 and 66.1.5 of the TRPA Code describes scenic quality standards for projects in view from roadway and shoreline travel units, and public recreation areas and bicycle trails. Subsection 66.2 specifies that major roadways and all federal and state highways within the Lake Tahoe Region are designated as scenic highways. Scenic highway corridor design standards in Subsection 66.2 apply to projects visible from 300 feet, 1,000 feet, and 0.5 mile from urban corridors, transition corridors, and natural corridors, respectively. The proposed project is within the scenic highway corridors of SR 89, SR 28, and SR 267. These corridors are coincident with the boundaries of the Roadway Travel Units shown in Exhibit 4.4-2.  Height Chapter 37 of the TRPA Code contains standards pertaining to height. Specifically, Subsection 37.6 establishes height standards for structures other than buildings. Subsection 37.6.1 states that no structure, other than a building, shall have a height greater than 26 feet. Subsection 37.6.2 states that this maximum height may be increased for certain structures, including utility poles, up to the minimum necessary to feasibly implement the project if certain findings are made. The required findings include that the function of the structure requires a greater maximum height than otherwise allowed, and the additional height is the minimum necessary to implement the project and there are no feasible alternatives that would require less additional height. TRPA SCENIC QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM The TRPA Scenic Quality Improvement Program (SQIP) (TRPA 1989b) was adopted to provide a program for implementing physical improvements to the built environment in the Tahoe Region. It is intended to contribute to the attainment of scenic thresholds and serves as an implementation guide. The program is an overall action plan to specifically improve the scenic quality of roadway and shoreline travel routes that do not meet the scenic thresholds. The Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) adopted in 1998 incorporates elements of the SQIP. The EIP includes a list of specific projects throughout the Tahoe Basin that are deemed necessary to help attain and maintain scenic thresholds (TRPA 1998).  LOCAL AGENCIES Placer County Design Standards and Guidelines for the Lake Tahoe Region Including Community Plan Areas The Placer County Design Standards and Guidelines include guidelines for minimizing the visual impact of utility lines within scenic highway corridors (Placer County 1994). These corridors include SRs 28, 89, and 267. The standards relevant to utilities, such as required undergrounding, are applicable only to electrical lines that operate at 32 kilovolts or less. Otherwise, the standards primarily address signage, parking, site and building design, architecture, and landscaping for residential, commercial, light industrial, public service and recreational development. Placer County General Plan The Placer County General Plan (Placer County 1994b) contains a number of policies related to scenic resources. Scenic Routes are specified in Community Plans, including the Martis Valley Community Plan and Tahoe City Community Plan (each discussed below). Town of Truckee 2025 General Plan The Town of Truckee 2025 General Plan (2006) contains provisions regarding scenic resources and utility undergrounding in its Community Character Element. I-80 is listed as a scenic corridor. Scenic views include views to Mount Rose, Castle Peak, Donner Summit, Mount Judah, Tinker’s Knob, Donner Lake, and views up and down the Truckee River. Brockway Road from the Truckee River to SR 267 is considered a key corridor with a gateway to Truckee at SR 267. The Community Character and Land Use Elements of the Town of Truckee 2025 General Plan (2006) contain policies regarding aesthetic resources. Martis Valley Community Plan Martis Valley is an approximately 70-square-mile area that lies within Placer and Nevada counties, as well as within the Town of Truckee incorporated limits. This area is generally located to the east of Truckee and north of Northstar. The northern portion of the 650 Line passes through this area. A number of policies contained within the Martis Valley Community Plan (2003) are relevant to visual resources. In particular, Section IV, Community Design, provides directions for preserving high visual quality of the area. Section VI, Public Facilities and Services also contains provisions for undergrounding utilities.  Tahoe City Community Plan The Tahoe City Community Plan (1994) contains goals and objectives for urban design and development, traffic and parking, public service facilities, commercial development, and recreation. The objectives of the plan are implemented through enforceable policies. The plan also describes a vision for the future of Tahoe City and identifies various projects in the immediate Tahoe City area that are intended to improve scenic quality. It identifies opportunities for scenic improvements along SR 89 at the entrance to Tahoe City through relocating or screening existing non-compatible uses including public service facilities.  4.4.2 EXISTING CONDITIONS/AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT This section describes the existing visual environment as it relates to the proposed project, including a description of the scenic resources study area, an associated visibility analysis, identification of potentially affected viewer groups, and a description of scenic quality and visual exposure conditions generally, and for representative viewpoints. CONCEPTS RELATED TO SCENIC RESOURCES Scenic or visual resources are generally defined as both the natural and built features of the landscape that contribute to the experience and appreciation of the environment by the general public. Depending on the extent to which a project would adversely alter the perceived visual character and quality of the environment, a visual or scenic impact may occur. Familiarity with the following terms and concepts will aid the reader in understanding the content of this chapter. These terms and definitions are not specific to any one visual resource assessment methodology (i.e., neither TRPA nor USFS), but instead are general in nature such that the setting can be described in a manner that allows for adequate assessment of visual impacts under either framework. These concepts are routinely used by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in visual impact assessment of projects throughout California for which it serves as lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Visual Quality is defined as the overall visual impression or attractiveness of an area as determined by the particular landscape characteristics, including landforms, rock forms, water features, and vegetation patterns. The attributes of line, form, and color combine in various ways to create landscape characteristics whose variety, vividness, coherence, uniqueness, harmony, and pattern contribute to the overall visual quality of an area. For the purposes of this EIS/EIS/EIR, visual quality is defined according to three levels:   Indistinctive, or industrial: generally lacking in natural or cultural visual resource amenities typical of the region  Representative: typical or characteristic of the region’s natural and cultural visual amenities  Distinctive: unique or exemplary of the region’s natural or cultural scenic amenities It is important to note that the visual quality of a particular scene or viewpoint is judged within the context of the general visual character of an area. Viewer Exposure addresses the variables that affect viewing conditions from potentially sensitive areas. Viewer exposure considers the following factors:   Landscape visibility – the ability to see the landscape  Viewing distance – the proximity of viewers to the proposed project  Viewing angle – whether the proposed project would be viewed from above (superior), below (inferior), or from a level (normal) line of sight  Extent of visibility – whether the line of sight is open and panoramic to the project area or restricted by terrain, vegetation and/or structures  Duration of view – the elapsed time the project area would be visible to a particular viewer Viewer Types and Degree of Use pertain to the types of use (i.e., public viewers including recreationist and motorist) and amounts of use (i.e., number of recreational users or motorists) that various land uses receive.  Visual Sensitivity is the overall measure of the susceptibility of an existing landscape to adverse visual changes. People in different visual settings, typically characterized by different land uses in the vicinity of a project, have varying degrees of sensitivity to changes in visual conditions, often depending on the overall visual characteristics of the place. In areas of more distinctive visual quality, such as designated scenic highways, designated scenic roads, parks, and recreation and natural areas, visual sensitivity is characteristically more pronounced. In areas of more indistinctive or representative visual quality, sensitivity to change tends to be less pronounced. This analysis of visual sensitivity is based on the combined factors of visual quality, viewer types and numbers of viewers, and visual exposure to the project. Visual sensitivity is described as high, moderate, or low, depending on these factors. Scenic Vista: A scenic vista is generally considered to be a location from which the public can experience unique and exemplary high-quality views—typically from elevated vantage points that offer panoramic views of great breadth and depth. REGIONAL LANDSCAPE SETTING The proposed project is located in the Lake Tahoe Region, which is centered on Lake Tahoe, and straddles the northern edge of the California-Nevada state border. It is a mountainous area located in the Sierra Nevada, west of the Carson Range. Approximately three-quarters of the land in the region is publicly owned, and the majority of the land is managed by the USFS. Lake Tahoe is world renowned for its crystal clear water and picturesque setting. The lake is approximately 12 miles wide and 22 miles long, with about 75 miles of shoreline. The surface elevation of Lake Tahoe is approximately 6,000 feet above sea level, with surrounding peaks rising to almost 11,000 feet above sea level. Near the project area, Mount Watson rises to 8,424 feet and Mount Pluto rises to 8,617 feet. The dominant vegetation is softwood forest stands (conifers) which, at near distances, provide strong vertical lines, locally interspersed with open meadows. Although the dark coniferous forests contribute to a stable framework for the area’s visual character, seasonal changes introduce a dramatic variation to this landscape character. During winter, snow cover accentuates areas that are not forested, which can create a strong visual contrast in areas of timber harvesting, ski slopes, roadways, transmission rights-of-way (ROWs), and other places where the unforested ground is visible. Development is mostly clustered around the shoreline of Lake Tahoe and in a few level or moderately sloping areas. The region experiences a peak population with summer vacationers; however, it is also popular as a winter tourist destination for skiing and snow-related sports. STUDY AREA VIEWSHED AND VISIBILITY For the purpose of describing the visual setting and analyzing project impacts, the study area is defined as the project’s viewshed, that area of land, water, and other environmental elements that are visible to the human eye from a fixed vantage point, and more specifically, the portion of its viewshed from which the public could perceive changes in the landscape caused by the proposed project. Any other location or viewer group not exposed to visual effects of the project (i.e., outside the study area) is not relevant to this section. Geographic Information System (GIS) tools are a highly effective means of establishing a project’s viewshed, especially for the purposes of determining from which areas the project would not be visible. However, standard GIS viewshed tools typically consider only observer points relative to surrounding topography, which is most effectively used in landscapes without intervening vegetation or structures, such as dry deserts or pasturelands, but will vastly overestimate the real viewshed of projects in developed and/or forested landscapes, such as the project area.  Because the proposed project consists of several linear overhead power lines, its viewshed is actually represented by a cumulative viewshed, consisting of many poles along several linear routes. The total viewshed of the project is represented by combining each pole’s individual viewshed into one spatial dataset that represents the number of individual poles visible from any fixed vantage point. Exhibit 4.4-3 shows the project’s potential viewshed, as calculated from a 10-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and confined to a 4-mile buffer around all proposed facilities, facility upgrades/modifications, and temporary work areas. Four miles is defined by the USFS as the boundary between the middleground and background zone (USFS 1995). A 4-mile buffer was used because proposed poles, conductors, and tree removal, even if theoretically visible from farther away based on terrain, would be indistinguishable from other background elements due to the small apparent size, angle of view, and viewing context. Exhibit 4.4-3 also shows the boundary between USFS-defined distance zones, which are 300 feet (immediate foreground/foreground), 0.5 mile (foreground/middleground), and 4 miles (middleground/background). As indicated above, because the landscape is forested, the viewshed shown in Exhibit 4.4-3 vastly overestimates the real viewshed of the project. A small portion of the proposed project consisting of the area surrounding Segments 625-7, 625-8a, 625-9, 650-2 and 650-3 was isolated to demonstrate the effect of a confined landscape on the real viewshed. A “confined” landscape is characterized by trees or other features that limit a viewer’s field of vision, such that only foreground views of the landscape are available. Using an ultra-high resolution (0.5-meter) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset of this area—which contains both a bare-earth DEM and a “highest hit” DEM—trees and fine-scale landscape elements (such as cuts and fills) could be incorporated into viewshed calculations. A small area was chosen due to the high computational demands of ultra-high resolution data. This area in particular was chosen because it is at the intersection of several travel corridors with high recreational and scenic value including the Fiberboard Freeway, the Tahoe Rim Trail, and SR 267. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-4, the viewshed of the existing power lines in this area is confined to areas within or immediately adjacent to the ROW, primarily because of the density and height of existing trees. The height of the tree canopy consistently exceeds the height of the power poles. The Tahoe Rim Trail, though it is in close proximity to the power lines, is outside the viewshed of the lines except briefly as it crosses Mt. Watson Road and SR 267. Vantage points within the middleground distance zone (i.e., 0.5 to 4 miles from the proposed project) would require a very specific set of circumstances to occur for the proposed project to be visible. From this distance, the color/texture contrast in the landscape caused by vegetation clearing would be more noticeable than the poles and the conductors themselves, particularly during the winter. Because of the height and density of trees in the landscape, cleared ROWs tend to be easily hidden from view, especially if viewed at an oblique or inferior angle. The project would only be visible to observers within this distance zone if: 1) the immediate foreground is clear of obstructions (e.g., a meadow, a field, or a large parking lot), 2) the line of sight is otherwise uninterrupted, and 3) the power line ROW is aligned in the same direction as the viewer’s line of sight. Otherwise, the power line is likely to remain hidden from view; if it crosses perpendicular or obliquely to the viewer’s line of sight, the height of trees on either side of the cleared ROW would mask the gap, even in steeply sloped areas.  For the reasons stated above, the “study area” shall refer to the immediate foreground of all proposed project components, and certain locations in the distant foreground and middleground distance zone that meet the viewing conditions described above. VISUAL CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF THE STUDY AREA The visual character of study area can be generally described in terms of three distinct visual contexts: developed communities, undeveloped portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin, and the Martis Valley. In terms of visual environments described in the SQIP design review guidelines, developed communities are inclusive of “urban areas” and “urban transition areas” whereas undeveloped portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin are equivalent to rural areas. The following pages contain photographs illustrating the visual character and quality of each portion of the project area. Exhibit 4.4-5 shows the location and direction of view for each photo, and Exhibits 4.4-6A through 4.4-6L include the images themselves.    Source: data received from Dudek in 2013 Exhibit 4.4-3 Potential Viewshed and Distance Buffers    Source: data received from Dudek in 2013 Exhibit 4.4-4 Real Viewshed and Bare-Earth Viewshed of Existing Poles This page intentionally left blank.    Source: Adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2012 Exhibit 4.4-5 Photograph Locations     Photograph 1: Lakeside Trail at the Truckee River outlet looking south  Photograph 2: State Route 89 at William B.

These areas have a mix of developments, including low-density residential housing; commercial, retail, and tourism-related establishments; and public utility infrastructure including overhead electric lines. On the fringes of these communities is typically an urban transition zone between intensely developed areas and a fully natural-appearing landscape characterized by sporadic occurrence of driveways, rural homes on large lots, and electrical distribution lines within a predominantly forested context. Tahoe City Photographs 1 through 8 (Exhibits 4.4-6A and 4.4-6B) show the general areas surrounding the proposed upgrade to the 625 Line (Segment 625-1) in Tahoe City. In this area, particularly in and around the “Y” (i.e., the intersection of SR 89 and SR 28), the visual character was described in the 1982 Lake Tahoe Basin Scenic Resource Inventory as cluttered, but has improved in recent years (TRPA 2011). Developments are nestled among pine trees, and the Truckee River is a scenic amenity that contributes positively to views. However, as seen from SR 89 and SR 28, commercial development, parking areas, utility lines, and signage are prominent enough to distract from what might otherwise be a scenic view of the Truckee River and the surrounding environment. This general visual character is reflected in TRPA’s rating of the area as being in non-attainment of scenic thresholds for Roadway Travel Unit 42. The public experiences partially screened views of the Tahoe City Substation (shown in Photographs 1 through 4), which is on the west side of SR 89 just south of the Truckee River. Recreational amenities, including pedestrian and bike paths, the Truckee River, and a pedestrian bridge (shown in Photographs 5 through 8) provide access to scenic and recreational opportunities, but the quality of views in these areas are somewhat compromised by the presence of structures, utility poles, and conductors. Overall, the visual quality in the portion of the study area in Tahoe City can be considered representative to locally indistinct, depending on location, view direction, and other viewing circumstances. Despite the presence of the Truckee River, high quality views from public travel routes are not available in views directed towards the site of the proposed substation upgrade. Kings Beach Photographs 17 through 21 (Exhibits 4.4-6E and 4.4-6F) show the general areas surrounding the proposed upgrade to the 625 Line (Sections 625-10 and 650-1) on the outskirts of Kings Beach. The Kings Beach Substation is at the northern edge of the community of Kings Beach in a forested area that has residential and industrial land uses to the south and is surrounded by forest on the other three sides. This substation is setback from public transportation routes, as shown in Photograph 17 (Exhibit 4.4-6E). The general area can be described as an urban transition zone; it has a predominantly natural appearance and a thick density of trees with occasional signs of development, such as parked vehicle, driveways, utility poles, street signs, small graded areas, and houses and structures fully to partially screened by trees.  Overall, the visual quality of these sections of the study area is considered representative of an urban transition zone. The affected portion of SR 267 (Roadway Travel Unit 41) is in attainment of threshold standards for scenic quality and travel route ratings. Truckee Photographs 37 through 44 (Exhibits 4.4-6J and 4.4-6K) show the general areas surrounding the proposed upgrade to the 650 Line (Segments 650-6 and 650-7) within and adjacent to the Town of Truckee. For the same reasons discussed above for Kings Beach, the visual quality of these sections of the study area is considered representative of an urban transition zone.  UNDEVELOPED PORTIONS OF THE LAKE TAHOE BASIN Most of the proposed power line upgrades would occur within undeveloped portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin, in mountainous terrain of fir, pine, and cedar forest areas. The forest cover is mostly dense; openings and patches of meadow are relatively rare and infrequent as compared to areas of the High Sierra along the Pacific Crest west of Lake Tahoe. Within the study area, the density of trees and height of the canopy varies, but is sufficiently widespread and ever-present that unencumbered long-distance views and scenic vistas are only available from wide graded areas on moderate to steep slopes (such as portions of SR 267 that descend into the Basin and cleared utility ROWs). Along the Fiberboard Freeway, there are a few localized areas where users are afforded long-range views of the landscape; these include high-elevation, steeply-sloped areas along the side slopes of Mount Pluto and Mount Watson. The visual character of the study area in undeveloped portions of the Tahoe Basin is therefore of a confined natural forest, but in a few specific locations, can be punctuated by high quality vistas.  The study area is also characterized by a number of forest roads, as well as recreational routes including the Tahoe Rim Trail and other trails used by the public for dispersed recreation. USFS roads crossing the study area include FS Road 73 (Fiberboard Freeway), 16N46, 16N50, 16N73E, 16N74, 16N95, 16N63, 16N93, 16N92, 16N52, and 16N56. Photographs 9 through 16 (Exhibits 4.4-6C and 4.4-6D) illustrate portions of the study area along the 625 Line between the northern edge of Tahoe City and Brockway Summit along SR 267. The Fiberboard Freeway, a paved road along most of its length, extends westward into the area from SR 267 and provides public access to Mount Watson, Watson Lake, and surrounding areas. Power lines, including the existing 625 Line, cross the Fiberboard Freeway in a number of locations. Although not a dominant element of the landscape character, power poles and conductors, where they “skyline” (i.e., protrude above the horizon) in certain locations (as shown in Photographs 9, 12, and 16), can adversely affect view quality. Otherwise, the vertical form of the poles and their dark brown color mimic the color and form of tree trunks and minimize the apparent visual contrast. For the majority of the public routes in this area, existing power line ROWs are only visible in the immediate foreground where they cross existing roads and trails. Photographs 22 through 29 (Exhibits 4.4-6F and 4.4-6G) show the portion of the study area along SR 267 in the general area of proposed upgrades to the 625 and 650 Lines in Segments 650-2, 650-3, 625-8 and 625-9. The width of the highway corridor provides openings in the forest sufficient in size to afford viewers with partial middleground and background views of hillsides and the Lake Tahoe Basin. Similar to the context photographs along the Fiberboard Freeway, power lines locally and briefly detract from views where they skyline or cross the highway corridor. Overall, the visual quality of these sections of the study area is considered representative of the rural/undeveloped portions of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Unique and distinctive aesthetic elements within the study area, such as Lake Watson and scenic vistas from the Tahoe Rim Trail do not contain views of the 625/650 power line corridors.  MARTIS VALLEY The portion of the proposed project located outside of the Lake Tahoe Basin is within the Martis Valley, which extends north from Lake Tahoe. Martis Valley is bisected by Martis Creek, which flows north to the Truckee River. The northern portions of SR 267 and SR 89 meet I-80 in the northern portion of the valley in the Town of Truckee. Aside from the Town of Truckee itself, the primary developments in the valley include the Truckee Tahoe Airport and several golf courses, as well as electrical and transportation infrastructure. However, as seen from public roadways, the Martis Valley primarily appears in a natural condition, and is sufficiently flat and unobstructed to provide long views of surrounding mountains and forests. Photographs 31 through 36 (Exhibits 4.4-6H and 4.4-6I) show the portion of the study area within Martis Valley, including Section 650-4 of the 650 Line. The visual character of the valley stands in contrast to the Tahoe Basin by virtue of its grassland and open meadow habitat and largely unobstructed views of the surrounding mountains. Views from travel routes in the area include foreground, middleground, and background elements, with a wide variety of landscape elements of visual interest, including foreground open sage and grassland and background forested mountains. The existing 650 Line crosses SR 267 and leaves the highway heading west where it skirts the edge of the Northstar Golf Course and passes near a small residential area. It continues westward along the southern edge of Martis Valley where the forested slopes of Lookout Mountain rise from south edge of the valley floor. The slopes form a backdrop of trees to views of the power line from Martis Creek Lake National Recreation Area and the network of trails in the valley. Overall, the visual quality of these sections of the study area is considered representative to distinctive, depending on location, view direction and other viewing circumstances. The open grassland habitat provides view opportunities that are relatively rare and unique in the context of the predominantly forested environment of the Sierra Nevada. VIEWER TYPES AND EXPOSURES The primary types of potentially affected viewer groups in the project area include roadway motorists and recreationists. These groups may overlap at times, but for purposes of this analysis, they are described separately. The approach to evaluating viewer types and exposure presented here is routinely used by CPUC in visual impact assessment of its projects. MOTORISTS Motorists represent the largest of the affected viewer groups. Included in this group are motorists traveling on regional roadways, such as SRs 28, 89, and 267, and I-80. Motorists include a variety of roadway travelers, both local and regional travelers familiar with the visual setting, and travelers less familiar with the visual setting that use the roadways more infrequently. These less frequent travelers might, for example, utilize these roadways to reach vacation destinations such as Lake Tahoe or ski resorts, or use the roads in the course of their work. These motorists include commuters, drivers of commercial trucks, and drivers of emergency vehicles. Depending upon the road and travel direction, views of the study area could range from a few seconds to 20 minutes or more. The average annual daily traffic on I-80 ranges from 27,000 to 32,000 vehicles. On SR 89 at the SR 28 junction the average annual daily traffic is 10,900 vehicles, and on SR 267 the average annual daily traffic ranges from 8,400 to 12,600 vehicles, depending on location. VISITORS AND RECREATIONISTS The second viewer group includes recreational users of the Lake Tahoe area. The LTBMU is a very popular recreation forest with winter sports opportunities that include downhill ski areas and extensive snowmobile and cross-country ski trails found throughout the National Forest. In the summer, an extensive array of hiking, off-highway vehicle (OHV), equestrian, and mountain biking trails provide access to the lakes, rivers, and mountain areas. Developed recreation sites within the LTBMU include campgrounds, boat ramps, picnic areas, and nature trails. None of the power line segments are visible from campsites in the LTBMU, including the Watson Lake Campground. Additional information about the recreational resources in the project area can be found in Section 4.8, Recreation. This section focuses on recreation resources from which portions the proposed project could be visible. Although the total duration of views of the 625/650 Line ROWs for this group of users tends to be brief, the expectation of a natural landscape setting raises visual sensitivity to moderate to high levels.  Recreational trails and facilities from which the proposed project could be visible include the following.  Martis Creek Lake Recreation Area, in the northern portion of the project area, is managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and provides recreation activities including camping, hiking, ranger programs, boating, fishing, and day use. On the west side of SR 267, the Martis Creek Wildlife Area offers a 4.3-mile hiking and biking trail that loops around the valley.   Burton Creek State Park contains more than 2,000 acres of forest and meadowland. Facilities consist of a network of dirt roads and trails, two small dams, two water tanks, and a few signs. The roads into Burton Creek State Park are gated and only California State Parks and emergency vehicles are allowed on the roads in the park. The roads and trails are used by hikers and bikers during the summer, and cross-country skiers and snowshoe hikers in the winter. The proposed project would be largely out of view from these areas except for a short segment of the 625 Line that would graze the southwest portion of the park.  The Tahoe Rim Trail, shown in Exhibit 4.4-5, is a 165-mile, single-track, multi-use trail encircling Lake Tahoe. Throughout the project vicinity, the trail is located on LTBMU lands and is open to hikers, equestrians, and mountain bikers. Winter use by cross-country skiers and snowshoers is also popular. There is a trailhead in Tahoe City near the Community Center on Fairway Drive. From that location, the trail ascends to overlook the Truckee River Canyon, and then extends north and east past Watson Lake more than 20 miles to the trailhead on SR 267, 0.5-mile south of Brockway Summit. Along this segment, the trail generally parallels the existing and proposed 625 Line alignments, crossing under the existing 625 Line twice (see Exhibit 4.8-5). Trail users can cross SR 267 and beneath the existing 650 Line to a trailhead on the east side of the highway. From there, the trail continues northeastward, crosses beneath the existing 625 Line again, and continues toward Martis Peak. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-4, trail users are exposed to views of the power lines only briefly because the viewshed of the existing line is highly localized due to the screening effect of the forest.  The Fiberboard Freeway, a network of LTBMU service roads (including FS Roads 16N46, 16N50, 16N73E, 16N74, 16N95, 16N63, 16N93, 16N92, 16N52, and 16N56), and Fire Road 6, on the Tahoe National Forest provide access to numerous opportunities for dispersed recreation. In the winter, this includes snowmobiling, snowshoeing and cross country skiing; in the summer this includes OHV, cyclists, joggers and/or hikers.  Truckee River Regional Park is located just south of Downtown Truckee on SR 267. The 62-acre park’s recreation facilities include: ball fields; picnic areas; a rodeo arena; a nature trail; tennis, volleyball and basketball courts; amphitheater; tot lot; skateboard park; disc golf course; and playground equipment. Segment 650-6 is adjacent to the eastern border of the park (TDRDP 2012).   Northstar Resort Golf Course is an 18-hole course that incorporates the mountainous landscapes of Tahoe with the open meadow of Martis Valley into two 9-hole settings (Vail 2012). A portion of Segment 650-4 would cross a northern portion of the property.   64-Acre Recreation Site is located near the southern terminus of the existing 625 Line (Segment 625-1) in Tahoe City. The alignment runs adjacent to the south side of the Truckee River (between 0 to 10 feet from the top of the bank) for approximately 0.2 mile. This portion of the line is adjacent to the 64-Acre Recreation Site, which provides picnic facilities, hiking and biking trails, and a rafting ramp for access to the Truckee River. The 64-Acre Recreation Site and the Truckee River Bike Trail that passes through the site and alongside the Truckee River are among these facilities. Elements of the proposed project would be visible from this park and trail.   Gatekeeper’s Museum and Lake Tahoe Dam are located in an area immediately east of SR 89 atop and south of the Truckee River. The dam has a restaurant that affords diners views of Lake Tahoe and the Truckee River. The museum is visited by over 10,000 visitors annually and contains an eclectic collection of Tahoe history, including photographic collections, oral histories and transcription, newspapers, court ledgers, maps and written materials, letters, clothing, artifacts, and furniture. Visitors may have partial views of the Tahoe City Substation across SR 89 and portions of the existing 625 Line along the south bank of the Truckee River. The exposure to project facilities is similar to the views shown referenced in Exhibit 4.4-5.  River Rafting operations occur on the Truckee River downstream of the dam with several commercial rafting operations in the vicinity. The rafts depart from piers and ramps that project out into the river in this area.   Kings Beach Snowmobile activities occur on approximately 100 miles of recreational trail in the project area. The trail transects several segments of the 625 Line routes. Lake Tahoe Snowmobile Tours, Inc. and Full Throttle are two snowmobile rental /tour businesses that operate out of Kings Beach and utilize this trail.  VISUAL SENSITIVITY The process for selecting key viewpoints for simulation purposes is addressed in Section 4.4.3, Environmental Consequences and Mitigation Measures. However, key viewpoints are referenced here to describe the existing scenic setting, affected viewers, and to evaluate the visual sensitivity of each viewpoint. These viewpoints, as discussed in detail below, represent: 1) sensitive or protected views including public open space and recreation trails, residential areas, and designated scenic roadways or vista points; 2) views that represent the visual experience of a relatively large number of affected viewers; and 3) views that portray a representative range of viewing conditions along the project corridor. Table 4.4-1 summarizes the viewer groups, visual exposure, and scenic quality represented by 15 viewpoints. These factors are routinely used by CPUC in visual impact assessment of its projects. CPUC visual impact assessment methodology considers visual sensitivity as a composite measurement of the overall susceptibility of an area or viewer group to adverse visual or aesthetic impacts given the combined factors of landscape visual quality, viewer types, and exposure conditions which are considered together to determine an overall visual sensitivity for each viewpoint. The viewpoints listed in Table 4.4-1 are shown in the “existing” photographs in Exhibits 4.4-8 through 4.4-23 and Exhibit 4.4-25. Table 4.4-1 Viewer Types, Visual Exposures, and Visual Quality  Key Viewpoint No. / Name  Viewer Group(s)  View Exposure  Visual Quality  Visual Sensitivity  VP 1, Tahoe City Substation  Motorists and Pedestrians  Partially blocked by building, enclosed view framed by trees, viewers experience passing view  Indistinctive to Representative  Low to Moderate  VP 2, Tahoe City Substation  Motorists and Pedestrians  Nearly fully screened by trees, viewers experience brief passing views  Indistinctive to Representative  Low to Moderate  VP 3, Truckee River Corridor  Pedestrians and Cyclists, Tahoe Rim Trail Users  Unencumbered view includes slight skylining of existing pole.

The purpose and intent of the various measures are frequently overlapping and the same discussions and analyses can be used to address the requirements of multiple agencies. Following the listing of individual criteria is a discussion of the overall approach to assessing the significance of scenic resource impacts of the proposed project. TRPA CRITERIA The “Light and Glare” and “Scenic Resources/Community Design” criteria from the TRPA Initial Environmental Checklist were used to evaluate the scenic resources impacts of the alternatives. The checklist inquires as to whether the proposed project would result in any of the following conditions.  Be visible from any state or federal highway, Pioneer Trail or from Lake Tahoe?  Be visible from any public recreation area or TRPA designated bicycle trail?  Block or modify an existing view of Lake Tahoe or other scenic vista seen from a public road or other public area?  Be inconsistent with the height and design standards required by applicable ordinances or Community Plans?  Be inconsistent with the TRPA SQIP or Design Review Guidelines?  Include new or modified sources of exterior lighting?  Create new illumination which is more substantial than other lighting, if any, within the surrounding area?  Cause light from exterior sources to be cast off-site or onto public lands?  Create new sources of glare through the siting of improvements or the use of reflective materials? TRPA maintains applicable threshold standards for scenic resources in its threshold carrying capacities. For the purposes of this analysis, a significant scenic resource impact would result if implementation of the proposed project would result in one or more of the following:  a decrease in Roadway travel route ratings below the minimum required for threshold attainment;   a decrease in Scenic Quality Ratings;  a decrease in Public Recreation Areas and Bike Trails Ratings; or  violation of the adopted Community Design threshold by failing to comply with site planning or design principles contained in the TRPA Code. NEPA CRITERIA An environmental document prepared to comply with NEPA must consider the context and intensity of the environmental effects that would be caused by or result from the proposed action. Context means that the significance of the action must be considered in terms of the region as whole, affected interests, and the specific locality. Intensity refers to the severity of an effect. Under NEPA, the significance of an effect is used solely to determine whether an EIS must be prepared. A decrease in scores or ratings assigned to landscape units in scenic resources inventories conducted by either USFS or TRPA would constitute an adverse impact.  VQOs under the USFS framework commit lands to specific levels of visual quality, which becomes part of the overall land management plans adopted for each Forest. The USFS visual management system was designed to: 1) inventory visual resources and provide the basis for ascribing visual resource management objectives to lands under agency management, and 2) to determine whether a proposed action or its alternatives would meet those management objectives. While visual management objectives (identified on Exhibit 4.4-1 and discussed in the regulatory setting) will frequently reflect the baseline visual inventory of the landscape, that is not always the case, and VQOs do not in and of themselves offer a NEPA-compliant framework for identifying the intensity of impacts on visual resources or the significance of those impacts. Specifically, the degree of visual change that constitutes a significant impact is not defined and no criteria or standards for significance are offered. However, because conformance or non-conformance with VQOs relate to the project’s consistency with plans and policies, these are addressed separately (under Impact 4.4-3 below). CEQA CRITERIA Based on Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, an alternative would have a significant impact on scenic resources if implementation of the alternative would do any of the following:  have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista;  substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway;  substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings; or  create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area. OVERALL APPROACH Given that the analysis of scenic resources in the EIS/EIS/EIR must be consistent with multiple criteria and measures, as identified above, scenic impact statements were organized in a manner that allows a coherent discussion of visual impacts while considering all relevant criteria and measures. Because the proposed project would not be visible from an officially designated state scenic highway, the second criteria listed in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines (i.e., substantial damage to scenic resources […] within a state scenic highway) is not applicable and is not discussed further.  METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS  Potential project-related impacts to scenic resources were analyzed by determining the nature and extent of anticipated changes to the existing visual environment that would result from construction and operation of the proposed project and comparing those anticipated changes to the criteria of significance described above. The analysis involved field reviews of the project area plus reviews of project data, including maps and drawings provided by the applicant, aerial and ground-level photographs of the project area, planning documents, and the preparation of computer-based visual simulations. Specific project data included the Proponent’s Environmental Assessment (Sierra Pacific 2010), power line pole designs and configurations, pole heights and locations, substation plans and elevation drawings, and proposed construction methods and long term maintenance practices. SELECTION OF SIMULATION VIEWPOINTS The purpose of visual simulations is to document the project-related change that would be visible from representative sensitive viewpoints or viewing locations. The visual simulations provide an analytical tool for developing a technically sound assessment of visual impacts. The simulations also facilitate clear and objective communication of visual impacts. Field observations and review of photography, technical data, and plans and policies pertaining to visual resources management were used as a basis for selecting simulation viewpoints. Selection of the simulation viewpoints was determined in consultation with the applicant, USFS, and TRPA. The following criteria were used to select key viewpoints:  sensitive or protected views including public open space and recreation trails, residential areas, and designated scenic roadways or vista points;  views that represent the visual experience of a relatively large number of affected viewers; and  views that portray a representative range of viewing conditions along the project corridor (i.e., varied viewing distance and landscape character). In addition, key viewpoints were limited to publically accessible ground level viewing locations that represent what the public actually sees. Therefore, oblique aerial or "birdseye" views were not considered appropriate for visual impact assessment purposes. PROJECT SIMULATIONS  A set of 17 visual simulations were produced to illustrate before and after visual conditions in the project area. The simulations illustrate the location, scale, and appearance of the project as seen from representative public viewpoints. With the exception of Viewpoints 7 and 15, the visual simulation photographs were taken using a digital single lens reflex camera with a 50-millimeter equivalent lens which represents a horizontal view angle of 40 degrees. A 28-millimeter equivalent lens representing a 65-degree horizontal view angle was employed to shoot the Viewpoints 7 and 15 simulation photographs to portray a wider angle view of the project that includes elements in the surrounding landscape context. The visual simulations were generated using an objective analytical and computer modeling process. Briefly, GIS data of existing conditions and digital aerial photographs provided the basis for developing an initial digital model. A three-dimensional model of the proposed power poles and substation structures and equipment was developed using engineering design data and GIS project data supplied by the applicant. The three-dimensional computer model of the proposed project components was combined with the digital site model to produce a complete computer model of the project. A set of computer-generated perspective plots were then produced to represent the selected viewpoints. For each of the simulation viewpoints, viewer eye level was assumed to be 5 feet above grade. Computer wireframe perspective plots were overlain on photographs to verify scale and viewpoint location. Digital visual simulation images were then produced based on computer renderings of the three-dimensional model combined with digital versions of the selected site photographs.  The location of each simulation is shown in Exhibit 4.4-7. The existing views and corresponding computer-based visual simulations are presented in Exhibits 4.4-8 through 4.4-23 and Exhibit 4.4-25. IMPACT DETERMINATION The significance and intensity of impacts to visual resources is determined using the TRPA, NEPA, and CEQA significance criteria listed above and in Table 4.4-2. The table provides guidelines to assist in evaluating effects of the project on the visual character or quality of an area, and is based on the visual sensitivity of key viewpoints and the degree of overall visual change introduced by the project within the view. The key factors in determining the overall visual change are visual contrast, dominance, and view blockage. This approach is routinely used by CPUC in visual impact assessment of its projects. Specifically, an adverse visual impact may occur when: 1) an action perceptibly and substantially changes, in an adverse way, the existing physical features of the landscape that are characteristic of the region or locale; 2) an action introduces new features to the physical landscape that are perceptibly uncharacteristic of the region or locale, or become visually dominant from common viewpoints; or 3) an action blocks or totally obscures aesthetic features of the landscape. The degree of visual impact depends on how noticeable the adverse change is and the related visual sensitivity. Table 4.4-2 Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity  Visual Contrast / Visual Change  Visual Sensitivity  High  Moderate  Low  None / Seldom Seen  Low  Potentially Significant / Moderate  Less than Significant / Minor  Less than Significant / Minor  Less than Significant / Negligible  Moderate  Significant / Major  Potentially Significant / Moderate  Less than Significant / Minor  Less than Significant / Negligible  High  Significant / Major  Significant / Moderate  Potentially Significant / Moderate  Less than Significant / Minor  Note: Scenic impact levels are provided for both CEQA (significant/less than significant) and NEPA (negligible, minor, moderate and major). The significance and intensity of impacts are judged from a static or linear key viewpoint, and may be modified based on site-specific circumstances including context and duration (both of which are required considerations under NEPA).   In addition, Applicant Proposed Measures (APMs) are incorporated into the project to minimize impacts to scenic resources. Impact conclusions are determined considering the attenuating effect of the following APMs.  APM SCE-1: The following measures will be implemented during construction:  Construction activities will be kept as clean and inconspicuous as practical.   Construction storage and staging will be screened, where practical, with opaque fencing from close-range residential views and public viewing areas.  Slash treatment within the immediate foreground (50 feet) will be by lop and scatter.   If hand-piling and burning is utilized, piles will be located away from the edge of the roadway. Piles will be constructed to minimize residual unburnable material (resulting from pile compaction and/or high dirt content) and damage to remaining trees. Pile burning will be accomplished the following fall or spring, when possible. Pile burning will be planned and implemented to minimize scorching of existing non-fire-killed vegetation.  When "cut-tree" marks are utilized, marks will be placed on back sides of trees or away from views of the travelling public.  Within the immediate to middle-distance foreground (300 feet), log skidding trails will be re-graded, to the degree possible, back to their original, natural contour and rehabilitated with vegetation.  Non-affected timber and ground vegetation will be protected during harvesting and slash treatment.  Trees and vegetation within the “clear zone” that do not pose a risk to power lines will be preserved.  Visual diversity of the ground surface will be maintained through irregular scatter of limbs, seeding, and other means as practicable.  Barriers/boulders/downed logs will be placed in strategic locations to discourage the establishment of user-created trails.  Cut stumps will be 6-inch maximum height measured from the uphill side. Source: Data adapted by Ascent Environmental 2013 Exhibit 4.4-7 Photo Simulation Viewpoint Locations APM SCE-2: Self-weathering dark brown steel poles (CorTen), or equivalent, will be used for the power lines to reduce potential visual contrast.  APM SCE-3: Non-specular conductors will be used for the power lines to reduce the potential for new sources of glare. Non-specular conductor has been either mechanically or chemically treated to reduce reflectivity and has a smooth matte finish which blends more naturally with the environment.  APM SCE-4: A non-reflective finish will be used for substation equipment at all substations to reduce the potential for new sources of glare.  APM SCE-5: Screening through landscaping and non-vegetative means will be installed at the Tahoe City Substation to the degree that the rebuilt substation will not be obvious to the casual observer, and will account for public views of the substation from all sides. Plant material will be appropriate to the local landscape setting and will be consistent with CalPeco’s technical requirements for landscaping in proximity to substation and transmission facilities. More specifically, the following will be implemented:   With the property owner’s permission, native conifer trees will be planted outside of the perimeter fence along the southwest and southeast sides of the substation site. Tree planting will replace existing trees that will be removed and will provide additional screening and landscape backdrop with respect to views from SR 89.   With the property owner’s permission, on the southeast side of the substation, a mixture of trees and tall shrubs will be planted along the recreational trail adjacent to SR 89 to provide additional screening.  With the property owner’s permission, at the western corner of the substation site, a mixture of shrubs will be planted outside of the perimeter fence in order to screen views from the recreation trail.   APM SCE-6: Poles proposed in the vicinity of the highly visible clearing adjacent to Mount Watson Road will be placed so as to span the clearing or otherwise minimize their visibility from the Fiberboard Freeway.  APM SCE-7: In cases where replacement poles for the 650 Line are adjacent to SR 267 and will be visible in unobstructed foreground public views from the roadway, poles will be carefully sited to eliminate or substantially reduce their visibility from the highway within the Tahoe Basin as compared to the existing 650 Line without causing new visual impacts from tree removal or construction of access ways that would be required to erect and maintain the line. Any revised alignment or pole placement will be reviewed and approved by applicable land owners, agencies, and utilities.   APM SCE-8: In cases where replacement poles for the 625 Line are adjacent to the Truckee River and would be visible in unobstructed foreground public views along the river or adjacent trails, poles will be carefully sited to minimize their visibility. The westernmost pole on the south bank of the Truckee River where the power line crosses the river will be placed far enough from the river so as to be substantially unseen from the pedestrian bridge. The remaining poles along the south bank of the river will be located southward, outside the river corridor and behind the trees that line the riverbank such that visibility of the power line is minimized as viewed from SR 89, the Truckee River, and the pedestrian bridge. Any revised alignment or pole placement will be reviewed and approved by applicable land owners, agencies, and utilities.  APM SCE-9: In consultation with the USFS and to reduce potential project visibility, selective, site-specific conifer tree planting will be considered in limited areas along the new 625 Line route where relatively unobstructed foreground views of new structures are seen from Mount Watson Road. Placement of new trees will not conflict with project operations or safety requirements. ALTERNATIVE 1 - PEA ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.4-1 (Alt.1)  Cause inconsistency with adopted plans. The Tahoe City Community Plan (1994) suggests relocation of the Tahoe City Substation to a specific site known as “the Chimneys” as a means of removing it from public view and thereby improving scenic quality. This action is also defined as Scenic Program Project #135 in the SQIP. Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) proposes to rebuild the Tahoe City Substation in its current location and screen the facility from public view. The Roadway Travel Unit was not in attainment of scenic thresholds at the time substation relocation was recommended and it is now in attainment and has been since 2006. Because the Roadway Travel Unit is currently in attainment of scenic thresholds, the project would not result in substantially greater visibility of the Tahoe City Substation, and because the recommended relocation to a specific site (which is no longer available) was encouraged and not mandatory to achieve scenic objectives, the rebuild of the Tahoe City Substation on its existing site would not be inconsistent with the Tahoe City Community Plan or SQIP. This impact would be less than significant.  To achieve the project’s intended operating capability, it is necessary to rebuild the Tahoe City electrical substation as part of the proposed project. The substation is situated in its original location just west of SR 89 and south of the Truckee River in Tahoe City, behind the Bridgetender Tavern and Grill. The substation is in view from SR 89 and nearby public use areas, including the adjacent portion of the 64-Acre Recreation Site, bike trails, picnic tables, and Fanny Bridge, but is partially screened from view by trees and buildings.  Exhibit 4.4-8 shows the Tahoe City Substation as viewed from SR 89 looking south. Exhibit 4.4-9 shows the Tahoe City Substation as viewed from SR 89 near the Gatekeeper’s Museum property (which is behind the viewer), looking west. In both simulations, the new substation retains similar form and lines characteristic of an industrial site, but with a different finish and layout. The vertical lines are slightly higher and the forms slightly wider and more discernible, but spatial extent of the transformers appears concentrated within a smaller portion of the view. The texture and color contrast remains similar to slightly greater than the existing structures. Note that these images do not show proposed screening that would be installed in conjunction with the Tahoe City Substation rebuild. In the first viewpoint (Exhibit 4.4-8), fewer structures are visible behind the Bridgetender, and the tree removal associated with the Tahoe City Substation upgrade opens up the view to include trees in the middleground and a greater portion of the sky. The scenic quality of the first view is improved because less of the Tahoe City Substation is apparent, and the tree removal introduces a greater degree of variety and depth into the scene. The visual effect from the second viewpoint (Exhibit 4.4-8) is similar to the first, except that the tree removal renders the Tahoe City Substation site more conspicuous. However, the increase in exposure is balanced by the positive effect of opening up views of middleground views and mountainous horizon line. As compared to the existing Tahoe City Substation, the rebuilt substation would introduce a moderate degree of visual change. As discussed in the setting, these views have low to moderate sensitivity because they would be briefly experienced by high numbers of motorists and pedestrians. The 1994 Tahoe City Community Plan recommends the substation be relocated to an area known as the Chimneys (which has since been developed) where it would be unseen by the public. Subsequently, TRPA’s 2001 EIP, which contains the SQIP, identified Scenic Program Project #135 which similarly called for relocating the substation to the Chimneys area. In both cases, the goal was to improve scenic quality by removing the substation from public view. It should be noted that the specific roadway travel unit (Roadway Travel Unit 14 – Tahoe Tavern) was out of attainment of scenic threshold standards at the time the substation relocation project was recommended in the Tahoe City Community Plan (1994) and included in the EIP (2001). The unit came into attainment in 2006 and has remained in attainment (TRPA 2007 and TRPA 2011).   Existing View    Simulated View Source: Environmental Vision 2012 Exhibit 4.4-8 Tahoe City Substation, VP 1, All Action Alternatives  Existing View    Simulated View  Source: Power 2012 Exhibit 4.4-9 Tahoe City Substation, VP 2, All Action Alternatives Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) proposes to rebuild the substation in its original location. Rebuilding the substation at its current location would be inconsistent with the 1994 Tahoe City Community Plan recommendation and SQIP Scenic Program Project #135 to relocate the facility if the rebuilt substation would be in public view. In addition, the TRPA regulations prohibit any decrease in the travel route rating as seen from roadway travel units. Because the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation would increase in mass and height, with color and texture contrasts that conflict with the surrounding environment, it could, without screening, adversely affect the travel route rating associated with the roadway travel unit. The goal of eliminating or minimizing views of the Tahoe City Substation from public use areas expressed in the Tahoe City Community Plan and by Scenic Program Project #135 of the SQIP can be accomplished without relocating the substation through sufficient screening of appropriate types and placement. APM SCE-4 specifies use of a non-reflective finish on substation structures to reduce the potential for new sources of glare. In addition, APM SCE-5 describes screening (both through landscape and non-vegetative methods) that the applicant has integrated into project design, which will include native conifer trees and native shrubs to be planted outside of the perimeter fence along the southwest and southeast sides of the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation site, such that the presence of the substation would not be obvious to the casual observer. Tree planting would provide additional screening and landscape backdrop with respect to views from SR 89 and nearby public use areas. With the permission of the owner of the property on the southeast side of the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation, a mixture of trees and tall shrubs will be planted along the recreational trail adjacent to SR 89. The placement of trees to screen the project from view would preclude any decrease in the travel route rating and would result in improved aesthetic conditions.  The APMs that have been integrated into the project design would be sufficient to reduce visual impacts associated with the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation and would render the suggestion to move the substation unnecessary. Because Roadway Travel Unit 14 – Tahoe Tavern has been in attainment since 2006, the site to which the recommended relocation of the substation was to occur has since been developed, the visual change would be minor to moderate (see Table 4.4-2, Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity, for the guidelines used to evaluate the scenic effects of the project), and sufficient screening will be implemented to minimize visibility of the rebuilt substation, impacts associated with potential inconsistency with adopted plans described above would be less than significant. APMs would achieve the same objective as the plans for minimizing public views of the facility. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-2 (Alt.1)  Create views of rebuilt power lines or other project components from sensitive locations. The existing 625 and 650 Lines would be rebuilt in the alignment and configuration proposed under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) using larger poles that would be more conspicuous than the existing line in views from certain public recreation areas, bike trails, and scenic roadway corridors. Increased visibility of the rebuilt lines could fail to meet management targets for scenic quality established by lead agencies. However, because implementation of proposed APMs would minimize scenic effects during construction through specific screening and management practices; require use of specific materials, colors, and textures for project elements; and modify power pole and line placement such that views from sensitive locations and scenic resources are eliminated or minimized, potential scenic impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.   MIDDLEGROUND/BACKGROUND DISTANCES As described in the setting and shown in Exhibit 4.4-4, the existing poles are minimally visible in the middleground and background views. When viewed at greater distances within the larger landscape context, the poles visually blend with the surrounding trees in terms of line, form, and color.  With the proposed project, vantage points within the middleground distance zone (i.e., 0.5 to 4 miles from the proposed project) would require a very specific set of circumstances to occur for the proposed project to be visible. The project would only be visible to observers within middleground/background distances if: 1) the immediate foreground is clear of obstructions (e.g., a meadow or field), 2) the line of sight is otherwise uninterrupted, and 3) the power line ROW is aligned in the same direction as the viewer’s line of sight. In these circumstances, the color/texture contrast in the landscape caused by vegetation clearing would be more noticeable than the poles and the conductors themselves, particularly during the winter. While these viewing conditions are rare and would occur only briefly along a travel route, it is possible that portions of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would be visible from distant locations such as portions of the Tahoe Rim Trail farther removed from the proposed power lines. In addition, public roadways crossing Martis Valley would provide middleground and background views of the rebuilt 650 Line.  However, the incremental visual change caused by Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would be very limited from middleground/background distance zones because: 1) such views would not be available from many locations, and if visible, the duration of visibility would be brief; 2) the greater distance reduces the apparent size/dominance of the action; 3) vegetation clearings would be generally coincident with existing ROWs in the landscape; and 4) the visual context would attract viewer attention toward other, more attractive landscape features. The degree of apparent visual change would be low. The impact of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) from middleground/background distances would be less than significant (see Table 4.4-2, Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity, for the guidelines used to evaluate the scenic effects of the project).  VISUAL EFFECTS SPECIFIC TO THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE Visual disturbances associated with construction activity would include the presence of vehicles, heavy equipment, and workers. Site preparation and grading during the initial construction phase would also cause visual disturbance through the removal of existing vegetation and the creation of a visual contrast with the surrounding area. Multiple staging areas would be required in order to store, stage, and distribute construction equipment and materials as part of project implementation. However, the staging areas would primarily be located in areas that have been previously disturbed, thereby minimizing the degree of long-term visual change that would occur as a result of site preparation of the staging areas. In addition, the visual impacts of staging areas and use of temporary ROWs for construction activity along the 625/650 Line would be temporary. Overall, the construction phase is expected to take approximately 14 months within a five-year construction period; however, construction activity at any one place along the 625/650 Line would be substantially shorter in duration. As specific segments of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) are completed, construction activities and staging areas would move to the next segment or location. The annual construction season in the Lake Tahoe Region is from May 1 through October 15, and may be extended with TRPA approval. The construction season outside the Lake Tahoe Basin is generally the same, weather permitting. Work crews and equipment would be visible to the public during logging, removal of other vegetation, and grading of new access ways. They would also be visible in the area when installing the new poles and stringing the lines. A total of 12 sites for use as staging areas have been identified, which would vary in size from 0.2 acre to 9.1 acres. The staging areas are common to all project alternatives. Temporary chain-link fencing would be installed around the perimeter of the staging areas. Staging areas would be used during construction of the project and then removed. Only one of the 12 staging areas, referred to as the Northstar Golf Course, would be in public view from a heavily used sensitive location. It is located off the east side of SR 267 just north of where SR 267 passes the Northstar Golf Course, and is accessed by a dirt road located approximately 1.4 miles southeast of Martis Creek Road. It would be visible to the public from SR 267. Several other proposed staging areas, such as the Old Batch Plant, the Fiberboard Freeway, the Northstar parking lot, USACE staging area, and the Truckee Tahoe Airport staging areas, would be visible from public travel routes. Except for the Truckee Tahoe Airport and USACE staging areas, views of these facilities would be limited to the immediate area because of the surrounding forest cover. The other staging areas would be in locations that would not be visible from major roads, trails, or other sensitive areas because of the screening effect of the forest. None of the proposed staging areas would be located on or near the Tahoe Rim Trail. Staging areas that would be visible to motorists or cyclists along paved or unpaved routes, including SR 267 and the Fiberboard Freeway, would only be visible briefly (i.e., a matter of seconds) along the route, and would not substantially affect the quality of the scenic or recreational experience. Because the proposed staging areas are already disturbed and do not appear in their pristine natural condition, the sensitivity to visual change would be low and the visual impact incremental in nature. Nevertheless, during the construction phase, staging areas would have the appearance of a construction site, and could have substantial, albeit brief, visual effects as roadway users pass the site. In accordance with APM SCE-1, the applicant has committed to keeping construction activities as clean and inconspicuous as possible. In addition, APM SCE-1 will require construction storage and staging to be screened with opaque fencing from close-range residential views and public viewing areas, where practical. With incorporation of these measures into project design, the effect of staging areas on scenic resources would be minimized by substantially reducing the intensity of visual effects. The visual effects of vegetation clearing and limited tree removal necessary to prepare certain staging areas for use would have localized, long-lasting visual impacts by increasing the level of visual contrast that currently exists in the landscape. However, as described, the effect would be attenuated through APM SCE-1, minor in intensity, and would be visible only briefly as users of the Fiberboard Freeway and SR 267 pass the staging areas. Finally, the presence of work crews and equipment along the ROW necessary to log trees, remove other vegetation, grade new access ways, and to replace and relocate poles and conductors would be visually distracting, but temporary.  LONG-TERM EFFECTS FROM SENSITIVE LOCATIONS Long-term impacts are assessed using the key viewpoints identified as representative of the visual experience for a large number of public viewers and from sensitive and/or high-quality viewing locations (such as scenic highways). Existing visual conditions are described in Section 4.4.2, Existing Conditions/Affected Environment, and this discussion describes the magnitude and severity of visual changes that would occur so as to assess the significance and intensity of the impact in accordance with Table 4.4-2, Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity. It also addresses, for applicable viewpoints, whether features of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would meet applicable USFS VQOs or result in a reduction in TRPA scenic threshold ratings. Truckee River and SR 89 Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Segment 625-1 of the 625 Line would be replaced in its existing alignment, extending along the south bank of the Truckee River from the Tahoe City Substation before crossing the river and SR 89. The existing line within the river corridor is visible from the river itself and from the Truckee River Bike Trail. Exhibit 4.4-10 presents a southwesterly (downstream) view of the Truckee River from the pedestrian and cyclist overpass across the river. From this viewpoint, the new power line pole appears substantially wider and protrudes higher above the horizon line than the existing pole and surrounding trees. In this view, the scale and dominance of the proposed 625 Line is out of character with existing visual features, as compared to the existing pole which is more compatible with the surroundings and visual environment. Although the proposed pole would replace the existing pole in the same location, the incremental increase in width and height is sufficient in magnitude to be noticeable and potentially negatively perceived by a casual observer. While users of the overpass would only briefly be exposed to the view, the pole in the viewpoint and additional replacement poles along the south side of the Truckee River would also be visible to pedestrians along SR 89, rafters on the Truckee River, and to some users of the 64-Acre Recreation Site. Because the volume of visitors and recreationists would be high and because SR 89 is designated by TRPA as a scenic highway (Roadway Travel Unit 42 – Outlet to Lower Truckee River) in non-attainment of the scenic threshold standard, the visual sensitivity of the viewpoint is high. The power line upgrade along Segment 625-1 in the location of the existing line along the river could result in an adverse scenic effect and a decrease in the travel route rating of Roadway Travel Unit 42.  Existing View    Simulated View  Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-10 Truckee River Corridor, VP 3, Alts.1, 3, 4, Segment 625-1 APM SCE-8 would require carefully siting replacement poles along the 625 Line to minimize their visibility from the Truckee River and the adjacent 64-Acre Recreation Site. In cases where replacement poles for the 625 Line would be adjacent to the Truckee River and would be visible in the public’s unobstructed foreground views along the river or adjacent bike trails, poles will be carefully sited to minimize their visibility. The photo simulation of the location at which the 625 Line crosses SR 89, the bike trail, and Truckee River as seen from the highway and bike trail (Exhibit 4.4-15) shows that incorporation of this measure into project design would be effective in reducing views of the line from this particular viewpoint. Conversely, the photo simulation of the view of the river corridor from the pedestrian and bike trail bridge over the Truckee River (Exhibit 4.4-10) illustrates that, unless continued careful siting occurs for all the poles along the Truckee River to the Tahoe City Substation, the rebuilt line would be substantially more conspicuous within the river corridor. Implementation of APM SCE-8 would locate the new power line behind the existing line of trees on the south bank of the Truckee River, outside the river corridor such that visibility of the power line is minimized as viewed from SR 89, the Truckee River, and the pedestrian bridge. (Note: with this APM, the alignment of the 625 Line in Segment 625-1would be the same as Alternative 2 [Modified Alternative], assessed below.) As detailed in APM SCE-8, the westernmost pole on the south bank of the Truckee River where the power line crosses the river will be placed far enough from the river so as to be substantially unseen from the pedestrian bridge. This measure would enhance the view for a large number of sensitive viewers by removing the existing line along the river’s edge, and placing the new line out of direct view from SR 89, Truckee River, Truckee River Bike Trail (on the north side of the river), and the pedestrian bridge. The more southerly location would not avoid adverse impacts altogether, however. This alignment would parallel a paved path used by cyclists, pedestrians, and through-hikers on the Tahoe Rim Trail and would cross the access way to the bicycle/pedestrian bridge that crosses the river and raft launch site immediately east of the bridge. In the context of a recreational area with a mix of natural (trees, river) and urban (roadways, bridges, structures, parking areas) features, this alignment introduces a strong degree of visual change in the immediate vicinity.  APM SCE-8 will improve existing views from SR 89 and its associated TRPA travel route rating by moving the power line from the view corridor of the scenic highway to behind the line of trees on the south bank of the Truckee River. This would render the line visible to users of the 64‐Acre Recreation Site, and when viewed in the immediate foreground the new poles would be visually dominant features. When viewed at greater distances within the larger landscape context, however, the poles would visually blend with the surrounding trees in terms of line, form, and color. APM SCE 8 would result in an overall decrease in the number of affected viewers and would avoid impacts to the scenic highway corridor, Truckee River, and Truckee River Bike Trail on the north side of the river. Because this measure would reduce the amount of man-made structure visible from TRPA Roadway Travel Unit 42 (SR 89), the impact would be less than significant (i.e., the composite score would not decrease) and may be beneficial (i.e., the composite score may increase). SR 267 Segments 650-2 and 650-3 of the 650 Line are routed along the east side of SR 267 for about 6 miles from approximately 750 feet north of Stewart Way in Kings Beach northward over Brockway Summit and continuing on to Martis Valley where the line crosses SR 267 and heads westward away from the highway. The existing line is clearly visible along most of the route on the side of the road within these two segments. Segment 650-2 is within TRPA Roadway Travel Unit 41 – Brockway Summit. This Roadway Travel Unit is in attainment of scenic threshold standards; however, should the project result in a decrease in threshold ratings to a level below that inventoried and documented in 1982, the impact would be considered significant with respect to TRPA thresholds. Segment 650-3 is outside the Tahoe Basin and therefore not within a TRPA Roadway Travel Unit. However, this portion of SR 267 is identified as a scenic corridor in the Placer County General Plan. The existing 625 and 650 Lines are on poles that average 52 feet in height. New poles that would be used to rebuild the lines would be steel instead of wood. They would be, on average, approximately 7 to 12 feet taller than the existing wood poles, a height increase of between 13 and 23 percent, and would have a dark brown, rust-like color. Most of the new poles would be 15 to 19 inches in diameter at the base, which is 2 to 3 inches larger than the existing wood poles. Some new poles would be self-supporting and would be secured to a poured concrete foundation. The foundations would have diameters of 3 to 6 feet that would normally extend 6 to 12 inches above the ground surface but could extend as high as 2 feet. Self-supporting poles could have diameters of up to 4.5 feet at the base. In various locations, the existing poles not only support the power line but also electrical distribution and communication lines. (See Exhibit 3-6, Locations of Existing Distribution and Communication Underbuild, in Chapter 3, Project Alternatives). Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), all lines on existing poles, including distribution and communication underbuild, would be transferred to the new, larger poles and the existing poles would be removed, with the exception of a small portion of Segment 650-7 in the Town of Truckee between the Truckee Substation and the 132/650 double-circuit (see Exhibit 3-7). Martis Valley Along Segment 650-3 outside the Tahoe Basin, the larger poles would be more conspicuous than the existing poles, but would otherwise have a similar appearance and character. They would not substantially disrupt views from the highway as compared to the existing 650 Line. Exhibit 4.4-11 provides an example of how the new line would appear in the context of the Martis Valley, looking northwest from SR 267 near the Northstar Golf Course. The height and diameter of the poles are noticeably greater, and extend to a greater height above the horizon line. However, in the viewing context of an open plain, with wide panoramic views readily available, the new poles along the north end of Line Segment 650-3 and along Line Segment 650-4 represent a minor to moderate incremental change, as compared to existing conditions.  In all cases the new line would utilize non-specular conductors (see APM SCE-2) and self-weathering, dark brown poles, or equivalent (see APM SCE-3) which would be less conspicuous than the existing conductors and poles. From SR 267, the 650 Line diverges from the highway and extends west across Martis Valley. Segment 650-4 in this area is about 1,050 feet south of Martis Creek. A public trail leads from a gravel parking area off of SR 267. The trail generally follows the creek in this area, on its north side. The existing line is visible to the south from the trail. Exhibit 4.4-12 shows the effect of increased distance of Segment 650-4 from public roads on the degree of apparent visual change. In this exhibit, the difference between the existing power line and the proposed power line is nearly indiscernible, primarily because the greater distance of the line from the road decreases its prominence, and decreases its potential to protrude above the horizon line. For viewpoints from within or toward the Martis Valley, the degree of visual change associated with the upgrade of the 650 Line would be low and the visual sensitivity would be moderate. As such, the visual impact would be less than significant (see Table 4.4-2, Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity, for the guidelines used to evaluate the scenic effects of the project). A small parcel of land within Martis Valley, immediately east of the Northstar Golf Course and 0.5-mile south of SR 267 is administered by the USFS and has a VQO of Retention, which requires that management activities repeat the form, line, color, and texture frequently found in the characteristic landscape. The new power line would repeat visual elements of form and line of the existing power line, but would differ only slightly in color and texture. However, as seen from SR 267 (Viewpoint 5), Segment 650-4 would remain consistent with the Retention VQO because the visual changes would not be apparent for travelers on the roadway. Brockway Summit to Kings Beach The larger power line poles would be more conspicuous than the existing poles, as described above. Inside the Tahoe Basin, they would be visible in Segments 625-1 and 650-2 from TRPA Roadway Travel Units, public bike trails, and the SR 267 scenic corridor. In Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the section of SR 267 that descends into the Tahoe Basin from Brockway Summit is a particularly sensitive view corridor, as it affords travelers views of Lake Tahoe and the surrounding landscape. It also serves as a potential gateway to Lake Tahoe and offers a first impression for visitors to the region.   Existing View    Simulated View  Simulated View Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-11 SR 267, VP 4, All Action Alternatives, Segment 650-3  Existing View    Simulated View  Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-12 Martis Creek Trail, VP 5, Alts.1, 4, Segment 650-4 The existing 650 Line is located on the eastern and northern side of the road, whereas the views of Lake Tahoe are in primarily in the southerly direction. The existing power poles, which skyline in certain areas, can detract from the viewing experience. The new poles, which would be thicker and taller, have the potential to exacerbate this visual effect and could result in a decrease in the travel route rating for Roadway Travel Unit 41, which would violate the adopted Scenic Quality Threshold Ratings. This is because the presence of manmade features is one of the scoring factors used in the composite score, and Segment 650-2 would be more conspicuous to travelers on SR 267 because of the increased height and width of the poles.  Potential impacts to the scenic quality rating of Roadway Travel Unit 41 due to the increased presence of power poles would be avoided or minimized through implementation of APM SCE-7, which states that replacement poles for the 650 Line will be sited to eliminate or substantially reduce their visibility from the highway within the Tahoe Basin from Brockway Summit southward, as compared to the existing 650 Line, without causing new visual impacts from tree removal or construction of access ways that would be required to erect and maintain the line. In this area, the 650 Line would be moved eastward, away from SR 267, so as to be among the fringe of trees east of the highway (see Exhibit 4.4-24 650 Setback Alignment of APM SCE-7). This would result in beneficial scenic effects by further opening up views of the Tahoe Basin for travelers on SR 267. The realigned portion of the 650 Line would be unseen or minimally visible from the highway. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-13, Segment 650-2 would, from this viewpoint, be moved behind the line of trees such that it would be wholly hidden from view, or nearly so. Exhibit 4.4-14, in contrast, depicts the existing and post-project view of a portion of Segment 650-2 if the new power line is not set farther back; it would not be hidden behind the tree line and would result in greater visibility of man-made structure in the roadway travel unit. Because implementation of APM SCE-7 would set the reconstructed power line back from SR 267 and among the trees, it would result in additional impacts of the same types described for other wooded portions of the project area (e.g., along the Fiberboard Freeway). Construction of the line in this reach would have greater ease of access than a mid-forest location by virtue of its alignment along SR 267, but construction would require tree removal, vegetation removal, clearing of rocks and boulders, and surface disturbance for creation of access ways. Impacts typical of such construction include emissions from construction vehicles (which would be required in any case), generation of fugitive dust in the vicinity of grading and surface disturbance, release of otherwise stored carbon dioxide (CO2, a greenhouse gas), temporary staging and stockpiling, and noise from vehicles and heavy equipment in areas proximate to active construction. Construction and operational activities that would occur in the setback area would be the same as those that would occur in other, similar portions of the project area, and would be subject to all of the APMs to which the applicant has committed to reduce impacts to scenic resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, soils, hazards and hazardous materials, water quality, noise, recreation, utilities, and transportation. The expanded ROW needed for implementation of APM SCE-7 was surveyed for both cultural resources and biological resources, and no sensitive resources or resources of concern were found.  Construction of the power line along SR 267 without APM SCE-7 would result in permanent and temporary impacts to forest land, including tree removal, release of CO2, and loss of CO2 sequestration potential. Implementation of the revised, or setback, alignment of APM SCE-7 would result in additional tree removal and associated effects. To quantify the increase in impacts to forestry resources, the acreage of forest land within the revised alignment was calculated and compared with the acreage of forest land within the relevant portions of the alignments analyzed in Section 4.3, Forestry Resources, of this EIS/EIS/EIR. Forest land acreage calculations for the revised alignment were conducted using the same data sets used in the analysis presented in Section 4.3, Forestry Resources. To quantify impacts associated with different forest land variables (e.g., number of trees, total cubic foot volume, total merchantable volume), the average per-acre value of each variable was calculated, by segment, using the segment analysis data included in Appendix H, Supplemental Forestry and Vegetation Management Report. These per-acre values were then multiplied by the affected forest land acreage. Impacts associated with carbon sequestration were derived using the calculated tree volume totals and   Existing View    Simulated View Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-13 SR 267, VP 6, Alts.1, 4, Segment 650-2  Existing View    Simulated View  Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-14 SR 267, VP 7, Alts. 1, 4, Segment 650-2  Existing View   Simulated View  Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-15 SR 89, VP 8, All Action Alternatives, Segment 625-1   the methods and formulas presented in Section 4.3, Forestry Resources. Implementation of APM SCE-7 would result in approximately 7.2 additional acres of forest land impacts and removal of approximately 1,600 additional trees greater than 1-inch in diameter at breast height (dbh). These and related tree removal effects are shown in Table 4.4-3. Because of its long-term effect and degree of physical change to the landscape, tree removal would be the most pronounced effect of APM SCE-7 implementation. Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the power line along SR 267 would be the single-circuit 650 Line, requiring a temporary 65-foot ROW for construction and a 40-foot permanent ROW. All disturbances outside of the permanent 40-foot wide ROW required for operation would be restored to their original condition following construction. Implementation of APM SCE-7 for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would increase the acreage of permanent impacts to forest land, and would result in a 2.8 percent increase is the number and volume of trees that would be removed to accommodate construction of the alternative. These impacts would not substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of the forest land in the area or interrupt the view from sensitive locations and scenic resources. Table 4.4-3 Forest Land* Impact Comparison for APM SCE-7 for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative)  Impact Variable  Impact without Implementation of APM SCE-7  Impact with Implementation of APM SCE-7  Change in Forest Land Impact from Implementation of SCE-7  Difference  Percentage  Permanent Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  129.1  136.3  +7.2  5.6%  Temporary Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  97.9  97.9  N/C  0%  Total Number of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed (Permanent and Temporary Impact Areas)  58,000  59,601  +1,601  2.8%  Total Cubic Foot Volume of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed  863,600  839,421  +24,179  2.8%  Total Merchantable Timber Volume in Cubic Feet (Conifers ≥9” dbh)  594,065  577,269  +16,796  2.8%  Total MTCO2e Released  8,128  8,366  +238  2.9%  Lost MTCO2e Sequestration Potential  8,913  9,502  +589  6.6%  MTCO2e Sequestered Over Time in Temporary Impact Areas  14,303  14,303  N/C  0%  * Forest Land, as described in Section 4.3, Forestry Resources, is defined as land that can support 10 percent native tree cover of any species that allows for management of timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, recreation, and other public benefits.   Exhibit 4.4-16 depicts a view of Segment 650-2 from a trailhead for the Tahoe Rim Trail a short distance east of SR 267. From this location, two existing poles would be removed from view and replaced with a new pole would that would be taller and thicker than the existing poles. However, from this important viewpoint, the new pole would appear similar in size and scale because it would be placed at a greater distance from the trailhead.   Existing View   Simulated View Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-16 Tahoe Rim Trailhead, VP 9, Alts.1, 4, Segment 625-9   Implementation of APM SCE-7 would prevent adverse scenic impacts from increased visual exposure of the power lines from sensitive locations because the rebuilt power lines would be less conspicuous than the existing lines. By reducing the amount of manmade features that would be in view from TRPA Roadway Travel Units, the potential for reductions in adopted TRPA Scenic Threshold Ratings would not only be avoided, the composite score of the Roadway Travel Unit would improve, resulting in a beneficial scenic effect. In addition, the USFS VQO for these locations is Retention, which requires that management activities repeat the form, line, color, and texture frequently found in the characteristic landscape. For these portions of the alignment, incorporation of APM SCE-7 into the project design would be effective in decreasing the degree of visual change to a low level. Given the high sensitivity of the location but low level of visual change, the impact on scenic resources would be less than significant (see Table 4.4-2, Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity, for the guidelines used to evaluate the scenic effects of the project).  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-3 (Alt.1)  Compliance with USFS Visual Quality Objectives. Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the 625 Line would be constructed within a new alignment on NFS lands within a new ROW and these areas would require new access. The visual effect of the new cleared ROW, new access ways, and rebuilt power line would meet management goals for visual quality on NFS lands during construction and operation of the project. This impact would be less than significant.  Most of the rebuilt 625 Line in the area between SR 89 and SR 267 would be within a new ROW under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) instead of within the existing 625 Line ROW. This would be true of power line Segments 625-3, 625-4, 625-5, 625-6, 625-7, 625-8, and 625-9. This is a forested area largely within the LTBMU, but with a small portion within the Tahoe National Forest. Key observation points include the Tahoe Rim Trail (see Exhibit 4.4-16), the Fiberboard Freeway, and Fire Road 6, which are linear in nature and thus offer viewing opportunities along their length. The Fiberboard Freeway is paved from SR 267 for a distance of about 7 miles to where it becomes a dirt road and continues over very steep terrain toward Tahoe City. The paved road is open to the public and used in all seasons for recreation. It serves as a primary access way for this part of the LTBMU. The route of the existing 625 Line was laid out with the goal of keeping the line out of public view as much as possible. The existing line is visible from only a few spots along these two linear viewpoints including three locations where it crosses the paved portion of the Fiberboard Freeway and two places where it crosses the Tahoe Rim Trail. Otherwise, the existing line is not in close proximity to either of these linear viewpoints. Fire Road 6 is a dirt road within the Tahoe National Forest near Sawtooth Ridge in the area north of the project. The existing 625 Line is minimally visible from this road. Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the 625 Line would generally follow the Fiberboard Freeway. It would cross the road at six points and would cross the Tahoe Rim Trail in two locations. The new line would mostly be on the uphill side of the existing road. Poles would generally be placed 75 to 175 feet from the edge of the road but in some places would either be farther away or as close as 10 to 30 feet to the road. The length of segments that would be closest to the road would generally be about 1,200 linear feet or less. Where the line would be farther from the road, trees would be retained between the road and the rebuilt line. The distance between the Fiberboard Freeway and the ROW for the proposed 625 Line varies considerably because the Fiberboard Freeway more closely follows the topography of the landscape whereas the proposed 625 Line alignment contains long, straight segments, which are beneficial from a maintenance and reliability standpoint.  For Segments 625-3, 625-4, 625-5, 625-6, 625-7, 625-8, and 625-9, a new cleared ROW for the line would be created. New access ways and spurs from existing roads (see Chapter 3, Project Alternatives, subsection entitled “Access, Travel Ways, and Roads”) would be created to allow construction and long-term maintenance of the line. Under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), a total of approximately 15 miles of new access way within the power line ROW would be constructed and approximately 9.1 miles would be constructed outside the ROW. Also, a total of approximately 1.3 miles of existing roads would be improved to allow trucks to access the project site during construction. A comparison of the lengths of the existing and proposed 625 Line alignments in terms of the VQOs on USFS lands is shown in Table 4.4-4. Most of the proposed 625 Line under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would be in a landscape with a VQO of Partial Retention (about 10.8 miles), and a smaller portion of the line would be in Retention (about 3 miles) and Modification (about 0.4 mile). Compared to the existing alignment, which would be abandoned and allowed to naturally revegetate, Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would reduce the length of the 625 Line that would be located in a landscape with a VQO of Retention. Table 4.4-4 Comparison of VQOs traversed by 625 Line Alternative Alignments    Visual Quality Objectives (miles of alignment)  Retention   Partial Retention   Modification   Existing Alignment  3.15  9.53  0.42  Alternative 1: PEA Alternative  2.95  10.75  0.44  Alternative 2: Modified Alternative  2.55  11.36  0.44  Alternative 3: Road Focused Alternative  1.07  9.64  0.47  Alternative 3A: Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option  1.07  9.64  0.47  Once constructed, the new line and cleared ROW would be visible from the Fiberboard Freeway in some places but would be partially to completely screened from view in others. Exhibits 4.4-17 and 4.4-18 provide an example of the appearance of the new poles from locations close enough to the Fiberboard Freeway to be visible. Unlike the 650 Line, the 625 Line would be within a new ROW and would not replace existing poles in the same location. The addition of the poles and conductors would result in a minor to moderate visual change in the scene for Viewpoints 10 and 11. The vertical form and lines introduced by the poles would repeat the basic shape of the tree trunks, as typical tree heights exceed the proposed height of the new poles. In addition, non-specular conductors (see APM SCE-2) and self-weathering dark brown poles, or equivalent, (see APM SCE-3) would minimize the color and texture contrasts. However, the horizontal lines and shapes introduced by the conductors and pole cross-arms would be uncharacteristic of the visual elements found in the existing landscape. The visual contrast associated with the new line would be intermittently visible along the Fiberboard Freeway as a user travels along it. The permanent 40-foot wide vegetation management corridor would require removal of trees that conflict with operation and maintenance of the line, although low-growing vegetation that would not conflict with the line or the associated 10-foot wide access ways would be preserved. During construction, the corridor would be wider—approximately 65 feet to allow for establishment of access ways and construction of the line. The wider, temporary ROW would allow for flexibility in establishing access ways so that they may be constructed in a manner that minimizes the number of trees that would need to be removed and that allows for passage and maneuver of heavy construction equipment necessary to install poles and string conductors. After construction, the ROW would be stabilized with low growing species. Trees would be allowed to colonize within the ROW, but would be trimmed or removed if: 1) they reach a sufficient height/size as to conflict with radial clearance requirements of bare line conductors (18 inches pursuant to CPUC General Order 95), 2) pose a hazard to the line (i.e., dead, dying, diseased, decaying, or bug-infested trees), or 3) encroach on permanent access ways. Because revegetation would be allowed to occur after construction, the visual effect of vegetation clearing would be most severe immediately following construction but would decrease over time. The effect of vegetation management actions are depicted in the viewpoint simulations. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-17, little change would be visible in existing clearings that contain only grasses and low-growing shrubs. In this viewpoint, the line is sufficiently distant from the viewer that the effect of vegetation management would not be apparent. Exhibit 4.4-18 shows an example where vegetation clearing would be minimally visible; in this location, some tree removal is noticeable, resulting in a slightly less dense forest canopy and an increase in the amount of visible sky. In both simulations, however, the effect of ROW vegetation management is minimally apparent, and USFS VQOs would be met in both circumstances because the dominant landscape elements would be preserved. Access ways and spur roads for long term maintenance of the line would be visible where they lead from the Fiberboard Freeway or would otherwise be in close proximity to the road, appearing as corridors where trees are removed but low growing vegetation is present. Exhibit 4.4-19 depicts such an example, which would likely be the most intense visual effect of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). In this viewpoint, the position and view direction of the observer renders visible a large portion of the cleared ROW corridor. In these situations (in which the ROW obliquely deviates from the road), travelers on Fiberboard Freeway would briefly be exposed to a linear ROW that does not repeat the basic landscape character elements to which travelers are accustomed. Because the density and height of trees along the new ROW would vary significantly, the permanent 40-foot wide corridor would not appear as a “hard” edge in the landscape; rather natural clearings would serve to roughen/undulate the tree line, and the 10-foot wide access ways, where present, would weave along the ROW, between poles, in a manner that would allow natural screening by low-growing vegetation and trees.  The prominence of the poles and conductors, and the presence of a swath of cleared land, would not be uncharacteristic of the existing landscape. Users of the Fiberboard Freeway would only briefly be exposed to this visual effect, albeit at fairly regular intervals. However, this visual effect is not uncharacteristic of the visual setting as a whole because a similar effect currently exists along the route. Users of the Fiberboard Freeway regularly pass openings in the forest caused by forest roads teeing off the main route, as well as at crossings of the existing 625 Line. As described, the vertical orientation and shape of new poles would reflect the line, form, and color of the trunks of trees throughout the forest; the conductors would be minimally obtrusive because the applicant has proposed use of non-specular conductors as described in APM SCE-3. Therefore, the elements that comprise the power line itself would meet the adopted VQOs. In addition, the ground disturbance associated with long term maintenance of the line (as evidenced in Exhibit 4.4-19), while visually apparent, would meet the VQOs because it would mimic the existing visual features of the forest, which already include cleared corridors caused by existing USFS roads and existing power lines. Under the VQO of Retention, activities must repeat form, line, color, and texture, which are frequently found in the characteristic landscape. Under the VQO of Partial Retention, activities are to remain visually subordinate to the characteristic landscape. Segment 625-6 would cross an open patch of dry meadow inhabited by the native plant Wyethis mollis, a member of the sunflower family and commonly known as mule’s ears. The patch of meadow is about 400 feet wide and bisected by the Fiberboard Freeway. As viewed from the road, the meadow is a unique scenic feature within this otherwise forested setting and affords expansive unconfined views of forested hillsides. APM SCE-6 states that the meadow will be spanned by locating poles at either edge of the meadow thereby avoiding a potential adverse visual effect on the scenic feature. To address the larger scenic impact of the 625 Line, APM SCE-9 states that the applicant will, in consultation with the USFS and to reduce potential project visibility, consider selective, site-specific conifer tree planting in limited areas along the new 625 Line ROW where relatively unobstructed foreground views of new structures are seen from Mount Watson Road. New trees would not be placed where they conflict with project operations or safety requirements.  In summary, although the visual effect of the Line 625 would be adverse, particularly immediately following line installation and prior to passive recolonization of trees and shrubbery, it would not be inconsistent with the existing landscape character as seen from the Fiberboard Freeway. In addition, the 625 Line alignment under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) crosses less land with a VQO of Retention as compared to the existing 625 Line which will be abandoned and passively restored. Integration of APM SCE-1, which outlines a series of best management practices that minimize the visual effects of linear construction within forest landscapes, as recommended by the LTBMU, would meet applicable VQOs and minimize visual effects. For these reasons, the impact would be less than significant.  Existing View   Simulated View Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-17 Fiberboard Freeway, VP 10, Alt.1, Segment 625-3  Existing View    Simulated View Source: Environmental Vision 2012 Exhibit 4.4-18 Fiberboard Freeway, VP 11, Alt. 1, Segment 625-5  Existing View    Simulated View  Source: Sierra Pacific 2010 Exhibit 4.4-19 Fiberboard Freeway, VP 12, Alt. 1, Segment 625-7  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. The upgraded substations and conductors could introduce structural lighting and sources of glare that are more conspicuous than existing structures. APM SCE-3 states that in all cases the rebuilt power lines would utilize non-specular conductors. This would eliminate the potential for glare cast by the lines under certain lighting conditions. Such conditions occur temporarily, but on a daily basis.  Substations that would be upgraded as part of the project are on existing substation sites. Because of the differences in the design and finish of the transformers at the substation in Tahoe City, and because the structures would be new, there could be an increase in glare (see Exhibit 4.4-8). Integration of APM SCE-4 into project design, however, would reduce post-project glare through use of non-reflective finishes on substation structures. In addition, glare would continue to decrease over time as the metal structures weather. APM SCE-5 describes screening through landscaping and non-vegetative means that would also be integrated into project design, and which would include planting of native conifer trees outside the perimeter fence along the southwest and southeast sides of the Tahoe City Substation site. Depending on their size, these plantings could have an immediate beneficial effect with respect to glare attenuation, and would become more effective with vegetation growth. Any new security lighting would comply with local regulations regarding shielding and control of stray light. Placer County Design Standards and Guidelines require that light bulbs not be visible to the public (i.e., are shielded), that lighting for parking areas not spillover into adjacent areas, and that no lighting be used for the purpose of advertising or blink, flash or change in intensity. For other substation upgrades, only part of the facility would be upgraded, and increases in glare would be minimally apparent, if visible at all. No other project elements would create a new source of substantial light or glare. For these reasons, the potential for impacts due to substantial light or glare would be less than significant.  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 2 – MODIFIED ALTERNATIVE  DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS Because this element of the proposed project is the same under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) as it is for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the impact would be same as Impact 4.4-1 (Alt. 1). The 1994 Tahoe City Community Plan and the SQIP of TRPA’s 2001 EIP recommend the Tahoe City Substation be relocated to remove the substation from public view and thereby improve scenic quality. Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) proposes to rebuild the substation in its original location and screen the rebuilt substation from public view. Like Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the APMs that have been integrated into the project design (including APM SCE-5, Screening) would achieve the same objective as the plans for eliminating public views of the Tahoe City Substation. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. The most sensitive viewing areas affected by Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) would be avoided by Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). Even though the larger poles would be more conspicuous than the existing power line, they would meet management targets for scenic quality in areas where they would be seen. In Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Segment 625-1A of the 625 Line would be routed outside the Truckee River corridor but closer to or within the 64-Acre Recreation Site between the river crossing and the Tahoe City Substation instead of along the south bank of the river. (The southerly alignment defined by Segment 625-1A is superior to the river-side alignment of Segment 625-1, would avoid significant scenic effects, and is the same alignment as that resulting from implementation of APM SCE-8 for the other action alternatives.)  Removal of the existing power line along the river corridor in this area would enhance the scenic quality of this unique landscape feature. However, this segment of the line would then be visible from inside the 64-Acre Recreation Site, as shown in Exhibit 4.4-20. The setting inside the 64-Acre Recreation Site includes paved roads, asphalt parking lots, portable restrooms, trash receptacles, paved bike trails, and grassy areas among scattered pine and fir trees. The 64-Acre Recreation Site has an assigned VQO of Partial Retention.     Existing View    Simulated View Source: POWER 2012 Exhibit 4.4-20 64-Acre Recreation Site, VP 13, Alt. 2, Segment 625-1A As shown in Exhibit 4.4-20, Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would introduce poles and conductors that would require some tree removal. The poles would generally be shorter than the trees in the immediate area. The new alignment would parallel a paved path used by cyclists, pedestrians, and through-hikers on the Tahoe Rim Trail and would cross the access way to the bicycle/pedestrian bridge that crosses the river and the raft launch site immediately east of the bridge. In the context of a recreational area with a mix of natural (e.g., trees, river) and urban (e.g., roadways, bridges, structures, parking areas) features, Segment 625-1A introduces a strong degree of visual change in a setting with high visual sensitivity. Segment 625-1A under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would provide a benefit to views from SR 89 and the associated TRPA travel route rating by moving the power line from the view corridor of the scenic highway to behind the line of trees on the south bank of the Truckee River. This would render the line visible to users of the 64-Acre Recreation Site, and when viewed in the immediate foreground the new poles would be visually dominant features. When viewed at greater distances within the larger landscape context, however, the poles would visually blend with the surrounding trees in terms of line, form, and color. As a result, Segment 625-1A would meet the adopted VQO of Partial Retention that applies to the 64-Acre Recreation Site. The impact of Line Segment 625-1A on scenic resources would be less than significant. (See Section 4.8, Recreation, for discussion of impacts relative to recreation experience at the 64-Acre Recreation Site.) Segment 650-2 would not be routed along the east side of SR 267 as it is in Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Instead, it would be rebuilt as a double-circuit line with the 625 Line in essentially the same corridor as the existing 625 Line where it crosses SR 267 at Brockway Summit and heads eastward. The double-circuit line would require a 65-foot-wide permanent ROW, wider than the 40-foot permanent ROW required for single-circuit lines. The 650 Line would be removed from TRPA Roadway Travel Unit 41 – Brockway Summit. The existing poles in this area support distribution and communications lines as well as the power line. Once the power line has been removed and new line installed, the existing poles along the highway would be topped just above the distribution and communications lines and left in place, which would shorten the existing poles. Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would therefore result in a beneficial impact on the view corridor along SR 267 south and east of Brockway Summit. Line construction along the existing ROW would have similar effects described under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), but would affect fewer viewers and would be largely hidden by the forest canopy. Segment 650-3 would be routed along the east side of SR 267 from Brockway Summit to Martis Valley, following the route as identified for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Segment 650-3 is outside the Lake Tahoe Basin and therefore not within a TRPA Roadway Travel Unit, but within a county-identified scenic corridor. Segment 650-4A crosses SR 267 and heads in a westward direction staying south of Martis Creek. It would differ from Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) in that the line would be moved northward toward the creek by up to about 350 feet. The existing line supports distribution lines as well as the power line. Both would be transferred to the new poles and the existing poles would be removed. The existing 650 Line in this area is about 1,050 feet south of Martis Creek. A public trail leads from a gravel parking area off of SR 267. The trail generally follows the creek in this area, staying on its north side. The existing line is visible to the south from the trail. In Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), Segment 650-4A would be aligned closer to the trail than the existing line. It would be about 750 feet south of the creek and the trail. See Exhibit 4.4-21. The poles of the rebuilt line appear larger in the simulation and the new line is perceptibly closer to the viewer. However, the taller poles and alignment of 650-4A do not change the character of the scene or substantially disrupt the existing view for the same reasons discussed under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative).  Overall, implementation of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would not result in a failure to meet management targets for scenic quality established by local agencies. This impact would be less than significant. As compared to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would have visual impacts that are locally greater (such as along Martis Creek), and locally lesser (such as the view corridor from SR 89 west of Tahoe City and from SR 267 south of Brockway Summit).   Existing View    Simulated View  Source: POWER 2012 Exhibit 4.4-21 Martis Creek Trail, VP 5, Alt.2, Segment 650-4A  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. The impact of Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would be similar to that of Impact 4.4-3 (Alt. 1). The only differences between Alternative 1 (PEA Alterative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) on NFS lands between SR 89 and SR 267 involve Segments 625-4A, 625-6A and 625-8A. Segments 625-2, 625-3, 625-5, and 625-7 would be the same as Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) the power line would be briefly visible from the Tahoe Rim Trail and more frequently visible along the Fiberboard Freeway. Similar to Segment 625-4 in Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Segment 625-4 A under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would be on a north-facing slope outside the boundary of the Tahoe Basin and within the Tahoe National Forest. However, it would be located on the slope just above the Fiberboard Freeway rather than below it. This would reduce the visibility of the line from Fire Road 6 to the north and would preserve the scenic vistas to the north as seen from the Fiberboard Freeway (see Exhibit 4.4-22). Segment 625-6A would differ from Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) in that it would deviate from the Fiberboard Freeway in the north-south direction for about 1 mile.  Segment 625-6A and its associated ROW would be hidden from view along the Fiberboard Freeway in this location. Segment 625-8A would differ from 625-8 under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) by following the alignment of the existing 625 Line from SR 267 heading westward for the first 0.5 mile before turning southward to meet the Fiberboard Freeway. In a manner similar to Segment 625-6A, this would make the line less apparent from the Fiberboard Freeway as compared to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative).  As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), a new cleared ROW for the line and new access ways to allow construction and long-term maintenance would be created. Under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), approximately 13.6 miles of new access way would be created within the power line ROW and approximately 7.8 miles of access ways and spurs would be constructed outside the ROW. Also, a total of approximately 1.3 miles of existing roads would be improved to allow trucks to use the roads during project construction. These totals are less than under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Comparison of the lengths of the existing and proposed 625 Line under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) in terms of the VQOs on USFS lands through which they traverse is shown in Table 4.4-4. Most of the proposed 625 Line under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would be in a landscape with a VQO of Partial Retention (about 11.4 miles), and a smaller portion of the line would be in Retention (about 2.6 miles) and Modification (about 0.4 mile). Compared to the existing 625 Line, which would be abandoned and allowed to naturally revegetate, Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would reduce the length of the line that would be located in a landscape with a VQO of Retention. The prominence of the poles and conductors, and the presence of a swath of cleared land, would not be uncharacteristic of the existing visual environment, a forest that already has numerous openings caused by existing power lines and USFS roads. The number of visible corridors of cleared land would be reduced under Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) as compared to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Like Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), although the visual effect of the 625 Line would be adverse, particularly immediately following line installation (prior to passive recolonization of trees and shrubbery), it would not be inconsistent with the existing landscape character as seen from the Fiberboard Freeway. In addition, the 625 Line as proposed in Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would cross less land with a VQO of Retention as compared to the existing   Existing View    Simulated View  Source: POWER 2012 Exhibit 4.4-22 Fiberboard Freeway, VP 14, Alt. 2, Segment 625-4A 625 Line, which would be abandoned and passively restored. Implementation of APM SCE-1, which outlines a series of best management practices that minimize the visual effects of linear construction within forest landscapes, as recommended by the LTBMU, would meet applicable VQOs and minimize visual effects. For these reasons, the impact would be less than significant. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. Structures and substations that could potentially create glare or emit excessive lighting are the same as described under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Therefore, for the same reasons discussed under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) would have a less-than-significant impact with respect to light or glare.  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 3 – ROAD FOCUSED ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS  Because this element of the proposed project is the same under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) as it is for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the impact would be same as Impact 4.4-1 (Alt. 1). The 1994 Tahoe City Community Plan and the SQIP of TRPA’s 2001 EIP recommend that the Tahoe City Substation be relocated to remove the substation from public view and thereby improve scenic quality. Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) proposes to rebuild the substation in its original location and screening the rebuilt substation from public view. Like Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the APMs that have been integrated into the project design (including APM SCE-5, Screening) would achieve the same objective as the plans for eliminating public views of the Tahoe City Substation. Therefore, the impact would be less than significant. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. Under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), Segment 625-1 of the 625 Line would be the same as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and would have the same impacts. Implementation of APM SCE-8 would set the line back from the river corridor toward the south, as described above. Segment 650-2/D-C OH-2 (double-circuited, overhead) of the 650 Line would have the same alignment as 650-2 under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), but would be constructed as a double-circuit configuration with the 625 Line added to the poles. The distribution and communication lines that are on the same poles as the existing 650 Line would be transferred to the new double-circuit poles. Segment 650-1/D-C OH-1A would extend the 650 Line farther south than the existing line. It would remain along the shoulder of SR 267 for more than 1 mile instead of heading east away from the highway at about Stewart Way. Segment 650-1/D-C OH-1A (Alternative 3A) is an option that would utilize the alignment of the existing line (and of Alternative 1 [PEA Alternative]) from SR 267 to the Kings Beach Substation. In Martis Valley, Segment 650-4B would extend farther north along SR 267 than under Alternatives 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) by about 2 miles to Schaffer Mill Road where it would cross the highway and head westward along Schaffer Mill Road. The existing poles in Segment 650-4A would be topped just above the distribution lines and left in place.  The double-circuit configuration of Segment 650-2/D-C OH-2 would make the line more conspicuous than the existing line within TRPA Roadway Travel Unit 41 – Brockway Summit because it would require larger poles, the poles would also carry other overhead utility lines, and the width of the permanent ROW would be 65 feet instead of 40 feet. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-23, the poles would be substantially taller, would extend father above the horizon line, and would include additional horizontal cross arms, all of which would increase the visual contrast of the 650 Line with the surrounding setting. Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), however, would benefit views to the south from SR 267, because existing poles on the south side of the road would be removed. This change is only minimally apparent in Exhibit 4.4-23, but would remove manmade features from views that draw the attention of southbound travelers on SR 267. The visual change would be incremental from the viewpoint in Exhibit 4.4-23; however, extending the line along SR 267 southward by 1 mile with Segment 650-1/D-C OH-1A would add the power line to this section of Roadway Travel Unit 41. Similarly, extending the 650 Line along SR 267 in Martis Valley for another 2 miles would place the power line in the immediate foreground of the highway where currently it is absent.   Existing View   Simulated View Source: POWER 2012 Exhibit 4.4-23 SR 267, VP 15, Alt. 3, Segment 650-2 D-C OH-2 APM SCE-7 states that from Brockway Summit southward, replacement poles for the 650 Line (in this case, both the 650 and 625 Lines, as they would be double-circuited) will be sited to eliminate or substantially reduce their visibility from the highway within the Lake Tahoe Basin, as compared to the existing 650 Line, without causing new visual impacts from tree removal or construction of access ways that would be required to erect and maintain the line. In this area, therefore, the double-circuited line would be moved eastward, away from SR 267 so as to be among the fringe of trees east of the highway (see Exhibit 4.4-24,650 Setback Alignment of APM SCE-7). As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this would result in beneficial scenic effects by further opening up views of the Tahoe Basin for travelers on SR 267. Because Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option) would continue the double-circuited line along SR 267 south of the point at which the existing 650 Line (and Alternative 3, Road Focused Alternative) turns east, all the way to Speckled Avenue, implementation of SCE-7 would be infeasible. Setback of the line in this location would not be possible because existing residential structures are within 75 feet of the highway within this segment. Without setback, a double-circuited line in this location would substantially increase the visibility of manmade structures throughout this stretch and would be unmitigable. For these reasons, Alternative 3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option) is considered infeasible.  As described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), because implementation of APM SCE-7 would set the reconstructed power line back from SR 267 and among the trees, it would result in additional impacts of the same types as described for other wooded portions of the project area (e.g., along the Fiberboard Freeway), including tree removal, vegetation removal, clearing of rocks and boulders, and surface disturbance for creation of access ways. Impacts typical of such construction include emissions from construction vehicles (which would be required in any case), generation of fugitive dust in the vicinity of grading and surface disturbance, release of otherwise stored CO2, temporary staging and stockpiling, and noise from vehicles and heavy equipment in areas proximate to active construction.  As described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), tree removal would be the most pronounced effect of APM SCE-7 implementation, and would be greater for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) because the line would be double-circuited, requiring a larger permanent ROW of 65 feet. Construction of the power line along SR 267 without APM SCE-7 would result in permanent and temporary impacts to forest land, including tree removal, release of CO2, and loss of CO2 sequestration potential. Implementation of the revised, or setback, alignment of APM SCE-7 would result in additional tree removal and associated effects. Using the methodology described above under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the increase in impacts to forestry resources was calculated. Implementation of APM SCE-7 for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would result in approximately 7.4 additional acres of forest land impacts and removal of approximately 1,600 additional trees greater than 1-inch dbh. These, and related tree removal effects, are shown in Table 4.4-5. The numerical differences for implementation of APM SCE-7 for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) are similar to those for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) due to the similar 65-foot construction ROW needed for the setback alignment; however, this represents a proportionally greater impact for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative). Permanent loss of trees would be greater for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) because the line requires a larger permanent ROW of 65 feet, compared to the temporary ROW (12.5 feet on either side of the permanent 40-foot ROW) that would be allowed to regenerate under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Construction and operational activities that would occur on the additional 7.4 acres of land would be the same as those that would occur in other, similar portions of the project area, and would be subject to all of the APMs to which the applicant has committed to reduce impacts to scenic resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, soils, hazards and hazardous materials, water quality, noise, recreation, utilities, and transportation. Implementation of APM SCE-7 as part of Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would increase the total number of trees greater than 1-inch diameter removed for the entire alternative by 3.4 percent compared to Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) without APM SCE-7. The loss of this amount over the additional 7.4 acres of forest land impacted would not substantially reduce the size, continuity, or integrity of the forest land in the area or interrupt the view from sensitive locations and scenic resources. Implementation of APM SCE-7 would prevent adverse scenic impacts from increased visual exposure of the power line from sensitive locations because the rebuilt power line would be less conspicuous than the existing lines. As with Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), by reducing the amount of manmade features that would be in view from TRPA Roadway Travel Units, the potential for reductions in adopted TRPA Scenic Threshold Ratings would not only be avoided, the composite score of the Roadway Travel Unit would improve, resulting in a beneficial scenic effect. In addition, the USFS VQO for these locations is Retention, which requires that management activities repeat the form, line, color, and texture frequently found in the characteristic landscape. For these portions of Segment 650-2/D-C OH-2, incorporation of APM SCE-7 into the project design would be effective in decreasing the degree of visual change to a low level. Given the high sensitivity of the location but low level of visual change, the impact on scenic resources would be less than significant (see Table 4.4-2, Matrix for Determining Scenic Impact Significance/Intensity, for the guidelines used to evaluate the scenic effects of the project). Mitigation Measures  No mitigation measures are required.  Source: Data provided by TriSage in 2013; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2013 Exhibit 4.4-24A 650 Setback Alignment of APM SCE-7 - Map 1 of 2 Source: Data provided by TriSage in 2013; adapted by Ascent Environmental in 2013 Exhibit 4.4-24B 650 Setback Alignment of APM SCE-7 - Map 2 of 2 Under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) most of the rebuilt 625 Line between SR 89 and SR 267 would be within a new ROW. This would be true of Segments 625-3, 625- 4, 625-5, 625-6, 625-7, and 625-8. The route of the line under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would stay along the Fiberboard Freeway through much of this area. Poles would generally be placed as close as 10 to 30 feet from the road. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-25, this would place poles and conductors in the immediate foreground view. The vertical form and lines introduced by the poles would repeat the basic shape of the tree trunks and the proposed poles would not typically exceed the height of mature trees. In addition, integration of non-specular conductors (see APM SCE-2) and self-weathering dark brown color poles, or equivalent (see APM SCE-3) into the project design would minimize the color and texture contrasts. However, the horizontal lines and shapes introduced by the conductors and pole cross-arms would be uncharacteristic of the visual elements found in the existing landscape.  In contrast to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), in which the Line 625 would intermittently be visible, the new line would be visible along much of the length of the Fiberboard Freeway, with the exception of places where the road makes sharper turns. In these instances, trees would be retained between the road and the rebuilt line. Otherwise, roadside trees would be cleared to accommodate the line. New access ways to allow construction and long-term maintenance of the line would be established where necessary. However, most access would occur from the existing Fiberboard Freeway. Under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), approximately 9.3 miles of new access way would be created within the power line ROW and approximately 2.2 miles of access way and spurs would be constructed outside the ROW. In addition, approximately 0.7 mile of existing road would need to be improved to accommodate truck traffic during construction. Alternative  3A (Road Focused Alternative with Double Circuit Option), which includes Segment 650-1/D-C OH-1A, would reduce the new access way within the ROW to 8.4 miles. Mileage for other access ways and spurs and road improvements would be the same. These mileage totals are less than under Alternatives 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative). While the total number of poles and the length of conductors that would be visible to travelers on the Fiberboard Freeway would increase substantially compared to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative), the adverse visual effects of vegetation management would be less pronounced. This is because the new ROW would follow the existing roadway much more closely and there would be fewer locations from which travelers would experience gaps in the forest similar to the simulation shown in Exhibit 4.4-19. In addition, fewer access ways would need to tee off the road. As shown in Exhibit 4.4-25, the vegetation management associated with Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would also open up the viewshed, increasing the depth and variety of views and increasing the portion of visible sky. This would have a positive effect that would serve to partially counterbalance the negative effect of increase number of visible poles. In addition, the 625 Line would generally be constructed on the up-hill side of the Fiberboard Freeway. In those places where forest cover is thin or absent and where terrain is steep, view opportunities occur in the downhill direction, and viewer attention would generally be focused away from the 625 Line.  Existing View    Simulated View  Source: POWER 2012 Exhibit 4.4-25 Fiberboard Freeway, VP 16, Alt. 3, Segment 625-5 Comparison of the lengths of the existing and proposed 625 Line under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) in terms of the VQOs on USFS lands through which they traverse is shown in Table 4.4-4. Most of the proposed 625 Line under Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would be in a landscape with a VQO of Partial Retention (about 9.6 miles), and a smaller portion of the line would be in Retention (about 1 miles) and Modification (about 0.5 mile). Compared to the existing 625 Line alignment, which would be abandoned and allowed to naturally revegetate, Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would reduce the length of the 625 Line that would be located in a landscape with a VQO of Retention. This alternative is also preferable to Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) in terms of the length of power line that would cross forest land with a VQO of Retention. Work crews and equipment would be visible to the public during logging, removal of other vegetation, and grading of new access ways. They would also be visible in the area when installing the new poles and stringing the lines. Once constructed, the new line and cleared ROW would be clearly visible from the Fiberboard Freeway. Access roads for long term maintenance of the line would be visible where they lead from the Fiberboard Freeway or would otherwise be in close proximity to the road.  Like Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), although the visual effect of the Line 625 would be adverse, particularly immediately following line installation (prior to passive recolonization of trees and shrubbery), it would not be inconsistent with the existing landscape character as seen from the Fiberboard Freeway. In addition, the 625 Line would cross less land with a VQO of Retention as compared to the existing 625 Line which would be abandoned and passively restored. Integration of APM SCE-1, which outlines a series of best management practices that minimize the visual effects of linear construction within forest landscapes, as recommended by the LTBMU, would meet applicable VQOs and minimize visual effects. For these reasons, the impact would be less than significant.  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-4 (Alt.3)  Result in adverse effects with respect to lighting or glare. The upgraded substations and conductors could introduce structure lighting and glare that are more conspicuous than existing structures. Because substations would be rebuilt in the locations of existing substations (i.e., no new substations) and that APMs would provide for: 1) use of non-specular conductor that is mechanically or chemically treated to reduce reflectivity, 2) use of non-reflective finishes on substation structures, and 3) screening of the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation through landscaping and other means, no substantial increase in lighting or glare is anticipated. This impact would be less than significant.  Structures and substations that could potentially create glare or emit excessive lighting are the same as described under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Therefore, for the same reasons discussed under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) would have a less-than-significant impact with respect to light or glare.  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 4 – PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS  IMPACT 4.4-1 (Alt.4) IMPACT 4.4-2 (Alt.4)  Cause inconsistency with adopted plans. The Tahoe City Community Plan (1994) and TRPA’s EIP/SQIP (2001) recommend relocating the Tahoe City Substation as a means of removing it from public view and thereby improving scenic quality. Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would rebuild the Tahoe City Substation in its current location and screen the facility from public view. For the same reasons described above in Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), this action would not be inconsistent with the Tahoe City Community Plan or SQIP. This impact would be less than significant. Create views of rebuilt power lines from sensitive locations. The existing 625 and 650 Lines would be rebuilt in the alignment and configuration proposed under Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) using larger poles that would be more conspicuous than the existing line in views from certain public recreation areas, bike trails, and scenic roadway corridors. This is especially true in areas in which the lines would be built in a double circuit, which requires even larger poles. Increased visibility of the rebuilt lines could fail to meet management targets for scenic quality established by lead agencies. However, because implementation of proposed APMs would minimize scenic effects during construction through specific screening and management practices; require use of specific materials, colors, and textures for project elements; and modify power pole and line placement such that views from sensitive locations and scenic resources is eliminated or minimized, potential scenic impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels.  Because this element of the proposed project is the same under Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) as it is for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the impact would be same as Impact 4.4-1 (Alt. 1). The 1994 Tahoe City Community Plan and the SQIP of TRPA’s 2001 EIP recommend the Tahoe City Substation be relocated to remove the substation from public view and thereby improve scenic quality. Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) proposes to rebuild the substation in its original location and screen rebuilt substation from public view. Like Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the APMs that have been integrated into the project design (including APM SCE-5, Screening) would achieve the same objective as the plans for eliminating public views of the Tahoe City Substation. The impact to scenic resources due to inconsistency with adopted plans would be less than significant. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. Under Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative), the 625 Line would be the same as Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), described above. Segment 625-1 of the 625 Line would be the same as under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and would have the same impacts. Implementation of APM SCE-8 would set the line back from the river corridor toward the south, also as described above. Under Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative), the new 650 Line would be the same as that described for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) from Brockway Summit to Truckee, and the same as Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) from Brockway Summit to Kings Beach. As such, the alignment would follow the alignment of the existing 650 Line but with a double circuit from Brockway Summit to Kings Beach. From Brockway Summit to King Beach, the new 650 Line would increase the visibility of man-made features along the highway corridor, which could adversely affect TRPA travel route ratings and the Scenic Quality Ratings of TRPA scenic resources. This would involve increased height and mass of existing poles, a wider 65-foot permanent ROW associated with the double-circuit, and the placement of new poles along the highway corridor where the existing 650 Line deviates out of view. The visual impacts of Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) from scenic highways would be greater than Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) and Alternative 2 (Modified Alternative) because power line segments would be concentrated along the scenic highway corridors, and thus have a greater potential to adversely affect views.  Like Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would implement APM SCE-7, which states that from Brockway Summit southward, replacement poles for the 650 Line (in this case, both the 650 and 625 Lines, as they would be double-circuited) will be sited to eliminate or substantially reduce their visibility from the highway within the Lake Tahoe Basin, as compared to the existing 650 Line, without causing new visual impacts from tree removal or construction of access ways that would be required to erect and maintain the line See Exhibit 4.4-24, 650 Setback Alignment of APM SCE-7). As with Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative), this would result in beneficial scenic effects by further opening up views of the Lake Tahoe Basin for travelers on SR 267. As described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), because implementation of APM SCE-7 would set the reconstructed power line back from SR 267 and among the trees, it would result in additional impacts of the same types described for other wooded portions of the project area (e.g., along the Fiberboard Freeway), including tree removal, vegetation removal, clearing of rocks and boulders, and surface disturbance for creation of access ways. Impacts typical of such construction activities include emissions from construction vehicles (which would be required in any case), generation of fugitive dust in the vicinity of grading and surface disturbance, release of otherwise stored CO2, temporary staging and stockpiling, and noise from vehicles and heavy equipment in areas proximate to active construction.  As described above for Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), tree removal would be the most pronounced effect of APM SCE-7 implementation. Construction of the power line along SR 267 without APM SCE-7 would result in permanent and temporary impacts to forest land, including tree removal, release of CO2, and loss of CO2 sequestration potential. Implementation of the revised, or setback, alignment of APM SCE-7 would result in additional tree removal and associated effects. Using the methodology described above under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the change in impacts to forestry resources was calculated, as presented in Table 4.4-6, Forest Land Impact Comparison for APM SCE-7 for Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative).  Implementation of APM SCE-7 for Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would result in approximately 7.4 additional acres of forest land impacts and removal of approximately 1,603 additional trees greater than 1-inch dbh. The percentage of change in impacts that would result from implementation of  APM SCE-7 for Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) are similar to those for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) due to the similar 65-foot construction ROW needed for the setback alignment. Tree removal would be greater for these alternatives because the 65-foot construction ROW would be a permanent impact area, whereas only 40 feet of the 65-foot construction ROW would be permanent impact with implementation of Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Impacts in this area would be the same as those described above for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative).   Table 4.4-6 Forest Land* Impact Comparison for APM SCE-7 for Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative)  Impact Variable  Impact without Implementation of APM SCE-7  Impact with Implementation of APM SCE-7  Change in Forest Land Impact due to Implementation of SCE-7  Difference  Percentage  Permanent Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  92.8  100.2  +7.4  8.0%  Temporary Forest Land Impacts (Acres)  91.6  91.4  -0.2  -0.2%  Total Number of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed (Permanent and Temporary Impact Areas)  47,101  48,704  +1,603  3.4%  Total Cubic Foot Volume of Trees ≥1” dbh to be Removed  666,073  690,699  +24,626  3.7%  Total Merchantable Timber Volume in Cubic Feet (Conifers ≥9” dbh)  454,823  471,643  +16,820  3.7%  Total MTCO2e Released  6,682  6,929  +247  3.7%  Lost MTCO2e Sequestration Potential  6,966  7,557  +591  8.5%  MTCO2e Sequestered Over Time in Temporary Impact Areas  13,383  13,354  -29  -0.2%  * Forest Land, as described in Section 4.3, Forestry Resources, is defined as land that can support 10 percent native tree cover of any species that allows for management of timber, aesthetics, fish and wildlife, recreation, and other public benefits.  For the same reasons described under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), the segment of the 650 Line from Brockway Summit to Truckee would not substantially disrupt views from the highway as compared to the existing 650 Line. Impacts would be less than significant. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-3 (Alt.4)  Compliance with USFS VQOs. In rebuilding the 625 Line under Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative), various power line segments would utilize a new alignment on NFS lands within a new ROW, and would require new access. The alignment of the 625 Line on NSF lands west of SR 267 would essentially be along the shoulder of the Fiberboard Freeway and would thus require substantially fewer miles of new cleared ROW and new access ways relative to the other action alternatives. The visual effect of the new cleared ROW, new access ways, and rebuilt power line would meet management goals for visual quality on NFS lands during construction and long term operation of the project. This impact would be less than significant.  Under Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative), the new 650 Line would be the same as that described for the Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative) from Brockway Summit to Truckee, and the same as Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative) from Brockway Summit to Kings Beach. As such, the alignment would follow the existing 650 Line, but with a double circuit from Brockway Summit to Kings Beach. The upgraded 625 Line would be identical to the alignment proposed for Alternative 3 (Road Focused Alternative). For the reasons described above, the impact would be less than significant.  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-4 (Alt.4)  Result in adverse effects with respect to lighting or glare. The upgraded substations and line conductors could introduce structure lighting and glare that are more conspicuous than existing structures. Because substations would be rebuilt in the locations of existing substations (i.e., no new substations) and APMs would provide for: 1) use of non-specular conductor that is mechanically or chemically treated to reduce reflectivity, 2) use of non-reflective finishes on substation structures, and 3) screening of the rebuilt Tahoe City Substation through landscaping and other means, no substantial increase in lighting or glare is anticipated. This impact would be less than significant. Inconsistency with adopted plans. Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), no change to the Tahoe City Substation would be made as part of the project and visibility of the facility from public viewpoints would continue to be what it is today. Any potential increases in visibility resulting from necessary deferred maintenance would be appropriately mitigated in accordance with TRPA permit requirements and this impact would be less than significant.   Structures and substations that could potentially create glare or emit excessive lighting are the same as described under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative). Therefore, for the same reasons discussed under Alternative 1 (PEA Alternative), Alternative 4 (Proposed Alternative) would have a less-than-significant impact with respect to light or glare.  Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. ALTERNATIVE 5 – NO ACTION/NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS IMPACT 4.4-1 (Alt.5)  The existing circumstance regarding the location of the substation and suggestion for its relocation by adopted plans would not be changed by this alternative. Adopted plans would still encourage relocating the substation as they have since 1994. Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would not provide an opportunity to address this issue since no physical changes to the substation facility itself would occur. Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), actions would include completion of deferred maintenance to comply with current standards for vegetation clearing. This would include removal of trees that presently are inside the fence surrounding the Tahoe City Substation. Some of these trees provide at least partial screening of substation components, particularly for views from SR 89. Removal or trimming of trees inside the fence likely would increase the visual exposure of the substation. A permit from TRPA would be required to remove any trees. The permit process would take into account the likely visual consequences of removing the trees. Permit conditions would be imposed, as necessary, to address such effects; as a result Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would have a less-than-significant impact on scenic resources due to inconsistencies with adopted plans. A description of potential permit conditions is not necessary to maintain a conclusion of a less-than-significant effect because the permit would not be issued without a plan that either maintains or enhances the appearance of the substation site from the TRPA Roadway Travel Units. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-2 (Alt.5)  Create views of existing rebuilt power lines from sensitive locations. Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), there would be no changes to the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System. Under this alternative, project-related actions would be limited to operation and maintenance, including completion of deferred maintenance. This is not expected to create new views of the existing power lines. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.  Actions associated with this alternative would be limited to the operation and maintenance of the existing power lines and completion of deferred maintenance to comply with current standards for vegetation clearing and to meet annual inspection requirements. No details regarding specific locations of tree trimming or removal are known at this time. It is unlikely that actions associated with Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would create substantial new views of the existing power lines from sensitive locations. There would be no effect on adopted Scenic Threshold Ratings. This impact would be less than significant. Mitigation Measure No mitigation is required. IMPACT 4.4-3 (Alt.5)  Fail to meet USFS VQOs. Under Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative), there would be no changes to the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System. Actions would be limited to operation and maintenance, including completion of deferred maintenance to raise the existing system to current standards. These actions would result in conditions that meet adopted VQOs. Therefore, this impact would be less than significant.  Actions associated with this alternative would be limited to the operation and maintenance of the existing power lines and completion of deferred maintenance to comply with current standards for vegetation clearing and to meet annual inspection requirements. No details regarding specific locations of tree trimming or removal are known at this time. The existing 625 Line on NFS lands is located in areas that are largely unseen by the public. It is unlikely that Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would create substantial new views of the existing power lines from sensitive locations. Adopted VQOs would continue to be met. This impact would be less than significant. Mitigation Measure No mitigation measures are required. IMPACT 4.4-4 (Alt.5)  Result in adverse effects with respect to lighting or glare. Implementation of Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would not result in alterations to the North Lake Tahoe Transmission System that would influence existing light or glare conditions. This impact would be less than significant.  Actions associated with this alternative would be limited to the operation and maintenance of the existing power lines and completion of deferred maintenance to comply with current standards for vegetation clearing and to meet annual inspection requirements. Although no details regarding specific locations of tree trimming or removal are known at this time, it is unlikely that actions associated with Alternative 5 (No Action/No Project Alternative) would create light or glare that would have an adverse effect. This impact would be less than significant. Mitigation Measures No mitigation measures are required. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS State CEQA Guidelines Section 15355 defines a cumulative impact as two or more individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time. The effects of past and present projects are reflected by the existing conditions in the project area. Probable future projects considered are those in the vicinity that would result in visual impacts on, or as viewed from, the visual study area defined in Section 4.4.2, which includes the immediate foreground distance zone, and limited, localized areas in the middleground distance zone. Other projects proposed in this study area that would result in visual change have the possibility to contribute to a cumulative impact if they would occur during construction and operation of any of the action alternatives. Future projects in Table 4.1-2 that are within the geographic scope of the cumulative effects analysis include the SR 89 Fanny Bridge Community Revitalization Project, the Tahoe City Vision Plan, the Martis Valley Trail, the Joerger Ranch Specific Plan, and Pollard Station Senior Neighborhood. All are in the vicinity of the Tahoe City Substation, within Martis Valley, or along SR 267, and could be seen in the same context as power line Segments 625-1,625-1A, 650-3, 650-4, and 650-4B. Each project would, in some way, change the existing visual conditions in the vicinity of the substation and the power line segments. In other areas, future projects would not be viewed simultaneously with the proposed power line upgrade project and the potential for cumulative impacts would not occur.  With integration of APMs into project design, the impacts of the project with respect to scenic resources were determined to be less than significant.  CUMULATIVE EFFECTS IN TAHOE CITY The SR 89/Fanny Bridge Community Revitalization Project and future projects resulting from the Tahoe City Vision Plan could contribute to cumulative scenic impacts in Tahoe City, including TRPA travel route ratings along SR 89 and SR 28. Several alternatives for the SR 89/Fanny Bridge Community Revitalization Project are under consideration, but all alternatives would repair or replace Fanny Bridge, make modifications at the “Y” intersection, and construct a new bridge over the Truckee River near the east end of the Caltrans Maintenance Station. The new bridge and roadway would traverse the south side of the 64-Acre Recreation Site and align SR 89 to bypass the existing “Y” intersection of SR 89 and SR 28. The existing SR 89 and Fanny Bridge would become a local street with no change in access to existing recreational parking areas. One of the objectives of this project is to improve the river crossing’s structural integrity (Fanny Bridge) and resolve safety and community concerns about the cultural values related to the historic Fanny Bridge. The SR 89/Fanny Bridge Community Revitalization Project would result in an increase in transportation-related infrastructure in the project area. The new bridge crossing would be in nearly the same location as the crossing of the power line over the Truckee River in Segment 625-1 and would be visible from the viewpoint shown in Exhibit 4.4-10.  The SR 89/Fanny Bridge Project would be a substantial undertaking (with construction of an additional bridge and interchange/roundabout) that would result in marked visual changes in the project area, changes far greater than those of the power line project. As a Community Revitalization Project, however, it is proposed to include scenic and community character enhancements throughout the project area, particularly at the existing “Y.” Though design is not finalized and a final alternative is not selected, such enhancements are expected to include a reduced intersection at the existing “Y,” hardscape removal, extensive landscaping, continuity of bicycle and pedestrian trails, and other features. Ultimately, the project would be required to comply with the TRPA Code of Ordinances, including scenic requirements and threshold findings. The Tahoe City Vision Plan would guide development of the Community Plan update and future Area Plan. Under the TRPA Code of Ordinances, future development projects would undergo a design review process to ensure they comply with applicable scenic resource standards, as well as applicable community design standards.  Although the future cumulative scenic effects of the SR 89/Fanny Bridge Community Revitalization Project and projects implemented in accordance with the Tahoe City Vision Plan and ultimately, the Community Plan update and Area Plan cannot be predicted with any specificity, land use plans would encourage individual projects to be designed to maintain or improve the roadway travel unit ratings and comply with scenic resource policies and the cumulative effects of the Fanny Bridge Project, Tahoe City Area Plan developments, and the project, considered together are likely to be substantial. However, the contribution of the power line project to the cumulative impact would not be considerable because with integration of APMs into project design, the only visible element of the project from the pedestrian bridge and SR 89 would be the conductors that cross the Truckee River. This would be a negligible visual effect compared to the effect of the Fanny Bridge and/or new developments that could be contemplated under the Tahoe City Vision Plan. CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ALONG SR 267 AND IN THE MARTIS VALLEY The Martis Valley Trail, the Joerger Ranch Specific Plan, and Pollard Station Senior Neighborhood are all in the vicinity of Segments 650-3, 650-4, and 650-4B. Pollard Station would be an age-restricted senior neighborhood consisting of a lodge and condominiums on 8-acres in the Hilltop Master Plan area; the Joerger Ranch Specific Plan would be a 70-acre mixed use planned community including industrial, office space, public facility, transportation, and apartment uses; and the Martis Valley Trail would be a paved, multi-use recreational trail extending from the southern limits of the Town of Truckee at the Nevada/Placer County line eastward to the ridgeline defining the Lake Tahoe Basin. A 5.4-mile section of the trail would run along SR 267 between Truckee and Northstar.  The impacts of the project on scenic resources are less than significant and limited to travel routes in the Martis Valley, including SR 267. In general, the project would result in minor visual changes within Martis Valley, either because it replaces existing poles, or because of the distance of the power line from potential observers. Both Pollard Station and Joerger Ranch would result in visual changes within the Martis Valley that would be conspicuous for travelers on nearby local roadways, but the development would occur in the rural transition zone where housing and golf courses are already present and part of the existing visual character. The visual changes resulting from the development projects would not occur in the same view direction as the power line in the valley. Therefore the cumulative effect would not be significant. The Martis Valley Trail would bring additional viewers to the Martis Valley area, which would remain largely unobstructed and would continue to provide unique, high quality views of the surrounding environment. The trail itself would be a minor incremental addition to the visual effect of SR 267. Therefore the cumulative effect of the trail and the project would likewise not be significant.  CUMULATIVE EFFECTS SUMMARY There could be a cumulatively significant impact along SR 89 in Tahoe City due to the planned SR 89 Fanny Bridge Project, but the project contribution to the cumulative impact would not be cumulatively considerable because the only visible elements within views of the new bridge would be the power line conductors. Within Martis Valley and along SR 267, the cumulative impact would be less than significant because the magnitude of visual effects/changes would not be sufficient to exceed significance thresholds. Ascent Logo for print.pngAscent Logo for print.pngCalifornia Pacific  Electricity Company 625 and 650 Electrical Line Upgrade Project Draft EIS/EIS/EIR SCH# 2012032066 November 2013          PREPARED FOR: US Forest Service  Tahoe Regional Planning Agency  California Public Utilities Commission   California Pacific Electric Company  625 and 650 Electrical Line  Upgrade Project   Draft EIS/EIS/EIR SCH# 2012032066  PREPARED FOR:  US Forest Service Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit 35 College Drive South Lake Tahoe, CA 96150   Tahoe Regional Planning Agency P.O.
