Abstract: This Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (DSEIS) documents

the analysis of four alternatives for designation of 42 specific existing roads and trails for
public motorized use on the Eldorado National Forest. Alternative 1 proposes to
designate 42 routes for public motorized use and it includes amending the Eldorado
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan(ENF LRMP), Standard and
Guideline 100, to allow for public motorized use on sections of routes affecting the
hydrologic connectivity of meadows on 18 of the 42 routes. Alternative 2 proposes no
action. Alternative 3 proposes the same activities as Alternative 1 except it does not
include a LRMP amendment and proposes implementation of mitigation measures prior
to availability of the 18 routes for public use. Alternative 4 is the same as Alternative 1
except it does not include a LRMP amendment, proposes implementation of mitigation
measures for portions of 15 routes prior to availability for public use and proposes to
leave closed all or portions of 21 routes.
Comments:
Reviewers should provide the Forest Service with their comments during the review
period of the draft environmental impact statement. This will enable the Forest Service to
analyze and respond to the comments at one time and to use information acquired in the

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Summary
The Eldorado National Forest proposes the following designations for the portions
of the 42 routes that were closed by Court Order:
1. Designate for public motorized use 13 routes that field surveys conducted in 2011
and 2012 determined did not cross meadows, as defined in the 1989 Eldorado
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP). Route
09N54, a secondary access road to Leoni Meadows, would be designated up to
the intersection with Route 09N60.
2. Designate for public motorized use 11 routes where field surveys determined the
meadow crossings meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) No. 100.
3. Amend the ENF LRMP as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
Amendment (SNFPA) Standard and Guideline No. 100 (S&G 100) to allow
continued public motorized use on 18 routes that field surveys determined to not
currently meet S&G 100, and are needed to meet other purposes, and designate
those routes for public motorized use.
The area affected by the proposal includes 42 routes on the Eldorado National Forest in
California that were proposed for designation for public motorized use in the Eldorado
National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized Travel Management Environmental Impact
Statement (TM FEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD), March 2008.
The purpose of this supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement for the TMFEIS
and ROD, March 2008, is to reconsider in light of the applicable law that portion of the
Forest Service’s Final Environmental Impact Statement relating to the Riparian
Conservation Objective (“RCO”) Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and Guidelines #100
pertaining to the meadows on 42 specific routes that were designated for public
motorized use in the Record of Decision and subsequently closed under the final court
order on Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District Court, Eastern
District of California, filed 7/31/12).
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Eldorado National Forest Travel Management
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (TM SEIS) was published in the Federal
Register on October 12, 2012. The notice asked that comments on the proposed action be
received by November 7, 2012. In addition, as part of the public involvement process,
information on the proposed action was posted on the Eldorado National Forest web site
and mailed to 784 groups and individuals that have voiced an interest in Travel
Management on the Eldorado National Forest. The Forest Service held three public Open
House sessions, one in Markleeville on October 22, 2012; one in Placerville on October
25, 2012, and one in Jackson on October 29, 2012, to share information about the
i

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

proposal and listen to issues and concerns brought up by the public. Approximately 247
letters, emails and comment forms from the public scoping and public Open House
sessions were received providing public comments on the proposed action.
The following significant Issues were raised by the public during the scoping period:
1. Route 14N39 Richardson Lake: Richardson Lake is not the main destination for
route 14N39. Users enjoy a drive to the summit of Sourdough Hill to enjoy the views and
the sunset. The entire route should be designated for public motorized use.
This issue was addressed through a modification to the Proposed Action (Alternative #1).
The route is now proposed for designation all the way to the top of Sourdough Hill in
Alternative #1.
2. Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment: Amending the Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) to allow continued public motorized use in sensitive
meadow habitats will result in impacts to hydrology, natural vegetation and wildlife
habitat.
Alternatives #3 and #4 were developed to address this issue. Alternatives #3 and #4
would not amend the LRMP.
3. Corrective Actions: The proposed action does not include corrective actions to fix
the routes found inconsistent with Standard and Guideline #100, so impacts to meadows
will continue to persist.
Alternatives #3 and #4 both address this issue. While Alternatives #3 and #4 do not
include a description of the necessary actions required to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100, routes inconsistent with Standard and Guideline 100 would
not be available for public use until work has been completed to bring them into
compliance.
Four alternatives are analyzed in this SEIS:
Alternative #1
Described above as the Proposed Action.
Alternative # 2: No Action
The same portions of the 42 routes that were closed under the court order would remain
closed to public motorized use. There would be no amendments to the ENF LRMP.
ii

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Alternative #3: The Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 3 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The LRMP would not be amended for the routes as proposed in Alternative 1: 09N01,
09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider
Camp Road), 6.8 miles of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 10N21
(16E27; Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett
4WD trail), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. Instead, these routes would
continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use and
identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are in compliance with
Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. This alternative identifies these
routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions necessary to bring
each into compliance with Standard and Guideline 100. Corrective actions would be
proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement
corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions have been analyzed and
implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail on the
next revision of the MVUM.
Alternative #4
Alternative 4 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 1 except for the following:
The Eldorado National Forest proposes to designate the following routes or portions of
routes for public motorized use: 09N54 (open up to intersection with 09N60, closed to
public motorized use past that point), 10N06, 10N26, 11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 13N24,
09N15, 10NY05 (open from 10NY04 to a point just before drainage near 16E27) and
14N27.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until the routes are in compliance with Standard and
Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (open to a spot suitable
for camping just north of Schneider Camp meadow, closed to public motorized use
iii

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

beyond that point), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27) (open except for the section between
10NY04E and the section currently open on the west end), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32,
and 14N05 (open up to McKinstry Trailhead, closed to public motorized use beyond the
trailhead). This alternative identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does
not analyze the actions necessary to bring each route into compliance with Standard and
Guideline 100. Corrective actions would be proposed and analyzed as part of future
NEPA analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After
corrective actions have been analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as a
designated public motorized road or trail on the next revision of the MVUM.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35,
10N32, and 10NY06. The reasons mitigation is indicated for these routes are documented
in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in this document. Mitigation
would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to
implement corrective actions becomes available. After the mitigation has been analyzed
and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail
on the next revision of the MVUM. Portions of these routes that are currently open under
the court order would remain open for public motorized use.
The following portions of routes that are not currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: western 2.26 miles of 09N04
(17E79), and 10N03.
The portions of the following routes that are currently closed to public motorized use
under court order would remain closed to public motor vehicle use: 09N54 past
intersection with 09N60, 10NY04, 17E12, 14N58, 17E17, 17E21, 09N82 (southern
portion 16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01 (10N01B), 10N13 (17E73), closed
beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the section currently
open on the west end), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), a portion of 12NY06, 14N05 past
McKinstry Trailhead, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24 (west and east portions), and 17E28.
A portion of 12NY06 that is not currently closed to public motorized use by court order
would be closed in this alternative.

Summary of Effects to Hydrology and Recreation
The Hydrology Analysis indicates that there are 24 routes where there is no difference
between the alternatives with regard to Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100. This is
because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross or border
meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
#100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G #100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G #100. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in zero,
18, and seven of those 18 routes meeting S&G #100, respectively. This also means that
Alternatives 2, 3, 4 would result in 18, 0, and 13 routes not meeting S&G #100,
respectively.
It would likely take a number of years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes
meeting S&G #100.
The above results are summarized in Table 3.9 and Figure 3.9.
The Recreation Analysis shows that the alternatives differ substantially as to effects to
recreation users. Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, results in the highest number of
miles of roads and trails rated high in recreation value open to public motorized use
initially (95.8 miles). Alternative 3 results in the same number of miles of high value
recreation routes designated for public motorized use, however only 53.4 of those miles
would be open initially, with an additional 42.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS
but not designated for public motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map
(MVUM) until corrective actions are analyzed and implemented. Alternative 4 would
result in 3.7miles of high recreation value routes open to public motorized use, with an
additional 13.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS but not designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until corrective
actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 2, No Action, only the
29.97 miles of high value recreation routes that were not closed by court order would
remain open, with 65.85 miles of high value recreation routes closed to public motorized
use.
The effects on 4WD and motorcycle riding opportunities, particularly high country routes
over 6,000 feet in elevation, all rated high in recreation value, also vary substantially
between alternatives. In Alternative 1, the proposed action, 42.06 miles of 4WD routes,
all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately 18.47 miles of high
v

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in recreation value. In
Alternative 3, the same number of high country 4WD trails would be designated for
public motorized use, however only 11.22 miles would be open initially, with an
additional 30.84 miles added to the MVUM once corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
would be designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions are
analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 4, 8.96 miles of high country 4WD trails would
remain open, and an additional 7.85 miles of high country 4WD trails would be
designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions and mitigation
are analyzed and implemented. Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail
opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be
closed, and all of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado
National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed. In Alternative 2, 11.22
miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, and 30.84 miles of high country
4WD trails would be closed. This equates to the closure of 65 percent of the total 4WD
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. All of the
high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles, rated medium to high
recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This represents 90 percent of
the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in
elevation.

Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action
Introduction ____________________________________________
The purpose of this supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the
Eldorado National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized Travel Management EIS and Record
of Decision (ROD), March 2008, is to reconsider in light of the applicable law that
portion of the Forest Service’s Final Environmental Impact Statement relating to the
Riparian Conservation Objective (“RCO”) Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and
Guidelines #100 pertaining to the meadows on 42 specific routes that were designated for
public motorized use in the Record of Decision and subsequently closed under the final
court order on Court Order: Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District
Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12). All other portions of the Forest
Service’s original decision, including the parts of the 42 routes that do not intersect
meadows, remain in effect.
This Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) addresses only the additional

Background ____________________________________________
In March, 2008, the US Forest Service completed the Eldorado National Forest Public
Wheeled Motorized Travel Management EIS and ROD (ENF TMEIS). A comprehensive
background Summary of Eldorado National Forest Travel Management Direction may be
found on page 1-2 of that document.
Relevant Information from the ENF TMEIS includes the following:








The 2008 TMEIS and ROD designated roads and trails to be open for public motor
vehicle use and to prohibit cross country travel. The decision designated the class of
vehicle allowed and season of use for each route.
Each of the action alternatives except Alternative E included non-significant Forest
Plan amendments for various combinations of routes crossing meadows – they are
listed in Chapter 2 of the TMEIS in the description of each alternative.
The selected alternative, Alternative Modified B, included 20 routes through
meadows in the non-significant Land and Resource Plan (LRMP) Amendment for
that alternative. However, only 19 of those routes were designated for public wheeled
motorized travel under the Travel Management Decision. An additional 23 routes
with segments less than .05 miles through any meadow encountered along the route
were designated but have no Forest Plan amendment. Numerous other routes that
bordered or crossed meadows were not designated for public motor vehicle use.
The Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Final Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement Record of Decision, January, 2004 (SNFPA) amended the ENF
LRMP, established Riparian Conservation Objectives (RCOs), standards and
guidelines (particularly S&G 100), and direction to complete a RCO Analysis for all
new activities that might affect Riparian Conservation Areas (RCAs). In compliance
with the Record of Decision (ROD) for the SNFPA, the Forest completed the
“Reconciliation: Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment 2004 ROD & Eldorado
Forest Plan” to clearly state that the Standards and Guidelines for Management Area
2

28 (Meadows) from the 1989 ENF LRMP were replaced by the SNFPA meadow
allocation and Standards and Guidelines. The RCO Analysis for the ENF TMEIS
included the criterion that routes that bisect or go through meadows have the potential
of not meeting RCO #2. The identification of individual routes was completed using
the Forest’s Geographic Information System (GIS) database.
In Table 7 of the RCO analysis (a part of the project record for the EIS), there is a
listing of 42 routes through meadows, which includes the 19 routes designated in
Modified Alternative B, plus another 23.
The ENF TMEIS included a monitoring strategy for meadows: “Within two years of
implementation, commence field monitoring of meadows greater than one acre in size
that have a road or trail within the meadow or that bisects the meadow. Public
wheeled motor vehicle use through meadows can impair hydrologic function. If
adverse impacts to hydrologic function are detected, appropriate measures (including
closure) will be employed to restore proper functioning condition.”

Following the ENF TMEIS:


The Eldorado National Forest issued a Motor Vehicle Use Map in April, 2009,
showing the designated routes as established through the ENF TMEIS ROD. The map
was updated in 2010 and again in 2012. The 2012 MVUM included the changes in
routes as identified in the 7/31/12 decision of the Eastern District Federal Court,
Judge Karlton.
In keeping with the final decision in the ENF TMEIS ROD, a number of routes or
portions of routes that were previously classified as National Forest System roads but
will be managed as trails were changed on the Forest Transportation System to 4WD
Trails. These routes received a new trail number The routes are tracked in this
Supplemental EIS by the original road number (contains an N in the number) with the
new trail number (contains an E in the number) in parenthesis. On the GIS map set
accompanying this document, the routes are labeled with the new trail number, and
the associated old road number in parentheses.
Following the signing of the ENF TMEIS ROD there were 26 administrative appeals.
These appeals were resolved and the decision upheld by the Regional Forester.
In 2009 a complaint was filed with the Eastern District Federal Court alleging a
number of deficiencies in the EIS.
In 2010, the Eldorado National Forest contracted some monitoring for meadows
associated with designated routes. The results of the monitoring indicated that some
meadows mapped in GIS were not actually meadows. It also indicated that some
meadows were in poor condition, although it did not specifically conclude that
designated routes were the cause of the meadows being in poor condition.
On May 26, 2011, Judge Karlton issued an opinion (Court Case No. 2:09-CV-02523LKK-JFM) that raised an issue as to whether the Forest Service had adequately

explained why ephemeral streams could not function as suitable, non-breeding
California red-legged frog habitat. On September 1, 2011, the Forest Service received
US Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence that the Forest Service’s designation of
routes in Alternative Modified B in the Travel Management Decision is not likely to
adversely affect the California red-legged frog. The Forest Service prepared a new
Biological Assessment and the plaintiffs agree this issue has been resolved. Therefore
the issue will not be addressed in this SEIS.
In its opinion dated May 26, 2011, the Court also found the Forest Service failed to
comply with the National Forest Management Act (“NFMA”) in connection with its
analysis and designation of routes encountering meadows. Specifically, the court
found that the Forest Service had designated 42 routes through meadows which were
inconsistent with certain standards and guidelines in both the Forest’s 1989 Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and standards and guidelines within the 2004
Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA), which amended the ENF LRMP.
The Court pointed out that the error in the agency’s Travel Management Decision was
limited to 42 routes designated for public wheeled motorized travel that have some
segment(s) that go through meadows.
As planned in the ENF TMEIS Monitoring Strategy, field surveys were conducted in
2011 and 2012 at the 95 meadows crossed or bordered by the 42 routes in order to
determine compliance with Standard and Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Record of Decision (SNFPA ROD, 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
Standard and Guideline #100 states: “Maintain and restore the hydrologic
connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by
identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and
subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore
connectivity.” The field surveys were completed by a Hydrologist and a Hydrologic
Technician. The results of the surveys are summarized in the Hydrology section in
Chapter 3 of this SEIS.
On February 14, 2012, the Eastern District Court judge remanded the portion of the
decision that designated 42 roads through meadows for motorized traffic for
reconsideration in light of the applicable law. The Forest Service was directed to
submit a proposed order within 30 days that sets aside only that portion of its decision
that designated the 42 roads to the degree they go through meadows, and not affecting
the sections of those same roads that do not go through meadows, unless they cannot
otherwise be reached. Seasonal closures currently in place were to be extended until
further order of the court.
A final order on Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM was issued by the Eastern
District Court judge on July 31, 2012. That order “sets aside and remands for
reconsideration in light of the applicable law that portion of the Forest Service’s Final
Environmental Impact Statement relating to the Riparian Conservation Objective
(RCO) Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and Guidelines #100 pertaining to the

meadows on the 42 routes… Until such time as the Forest Service completes
supplemental environmental analysis pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) as provided above, public wheeled motorized vehicle use of a route
listed … that intersects a meadow shall be prohibited or limited ... All other portions
of the Forest Service’s decision, including the parts of the 42 routes that do not
intersect meadows, remain in effect.” The order also directed the Forest Service to
revise the Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) to incorporate changes called for in the
order. The revised MVUM’s were prepared and made available to the public in
September, 2012. The Forest is continuing to manage the designated route system to
the present time under the 2012 MVUM.

Purpose and Need for Action______________________________
The underlying needs for this proposal include:
1. There is a need to comply with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of California Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM, Court Order filed
07/31/12 in which the Court “set aside and remanded for reconsideration in light
of the applicable law that portion of the Forest Service’s Final Environmental
Impact Statement relating to the Riparian Conservation Objective (“RCO”)
Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and Guidelines #100 pertaining to the meadows
on the 42 routes.”
2. There is a need to determine whether public wheeled motor vehicle use will be
allowed on the 42 specific routes, or some portion of these routes, designated for
such use in the 2008 TM FEIS ROD that were found by the court to be
inconsistent with the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management
Plan, 1989 (ENF LRMP) Standards and Guidelines, as amended by SNFPA.
The action must also achieve the following purposes from the ENF LRMP and the
National Travel Management Rule of 2005:




providing wheeled motorized access to existing developed and dispersed recreation
opportunities on the Forest,
providing a diversity of wheeled motorized recreation opportunities, and
protecting natural resources

as outlined in the ENF TMEIS, Purpose and Need for Action, page 1-5 through 1-6.

Proposed Action ________________________________________
The Proposed Action is similar to the proposed action that was circulated for public
scoping with a few minor corrections and a change in the proposal for route 14N39,
Richardson Lake. The proposed action circulated in October 2012 proposed this route for
designation for public motorized use up to Richardson Lake, with the portion from
Richardson Lake to the top of Sourdough Hill closed to public motorized use. Comments
were received during the scoping period that stated the main destination of that route was
not Richardson Lake but the view from the top of Sourdough Hill, requesting designation
of the entire route. In the proposed action carried forward into this SEIS, the entire route
would be designated for public motorized use.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

The Forest Service conducted field surveys in 2011 and 2012 at the meadows on National
Forest land crossed or bordered by the 42 routes to determine compliance with Standard
and Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Record of Decision
(SNFPA ROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
For the following 14 routes that USFS field surveys determined did not cross or border
meadows:
1. Designate 08N23B, 08N35, 10N06, 10N26, 10N32, 10NY04, 11N09A,
11N22, 11N70, 12NY15, and 13N24 as “NFTS Road: Open to All Highway
and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.” Designate western 2.2 miles of 09N04
(17E79) as “NFTS 4WD Trail: Open to High Clearance Vehicles.” Designate
09N54 (Leoni Meadows) up to the intersection with 09N60 as “NFTS Road:
Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.” Route 09N54 is a
secondary access road to Leoni Meadows. Designate 17E12 as “NFTS Trail:
Open to Motorcycles only.”
For the following 10 routes where the meadow crossing meets Standard and Guideline
100:
2. Designate 09N15, 10NY05, 10NY06, 12NY06, 14N05, 14N27 and 14N58 as
“NFTS Road: Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.”
Designate 10N03 as “NFTS Road: Open to Highway Legal Vehicles only.”
Designate 17E17 and 17E21 as “NFTS Trail: Open to Motorcycles only.”
For the following 18 routes (10N13 is described in two segments) that the field survey
determined to not currently meet Standard and Guideline 100, and are needed to meet
other purposes:
3. Amend the Eldorado National Forest Plan as amended by SNFPA S&G No.
100 to allow continued public motorized use on these routes and designate
09N01, 09N08, 09N95, 10N01 (B), 0.5 miles of 10N13, 10N14, 10N98, and
14N39 as “NFTS Road: Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal
Vehicles.” Designate 11NY32 as “NFTS Road: Open to Highway Legal
Vehicles only.” Designate 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 6.8 miles of
10N13 (17E73), 10N21 (16E27), 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21), and
17E24 as “NFTS 4WD Trail: Open to High Clearance Vehicles.” Designate
17E16, 17E19 and 17E28 as “NFTS Trail: Open to Motorcycles only.”
The proposed action is described in more detail in Chapter 2 under Alternative 1.

Decision Framework _____________________________________
Given the purpose and need, the deciding official reviews the proposed action, the other
alternatives, and their environmental consequences, in order to determine whether to
implement the proposed action as described, select a different alternative or take no
action at this time.

Forest Plan Direction ____________________________________
The proposed action and alternatives are guided by the Eldorado National Forest Land
and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP), as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement Record of
Decision, January, 2004 (SNFPA). The Forest is subdivided into land allocations
(Management Areas) with established desired conditions and associated management
direction (standards and guidelines). The land allocation that applies to this proposal is
Management Area 28 – Meadow Management (ENF LRMP, pp. 4-277 through 4-282).
The definition of a meadow from the 1989 Land Resource Management Plan (page 4-90)
was used: “A meadow is defined as a grassy opening, 0.1 acres or larger, dominated by
perennial sedges, rushes, and grasses (wet meadow) or perennial grasses and forbs (dry
meadow).” The Standards and Guidelines that apply to management of meadows were
amended by the SNFPA. The SNFPA provided new standards and guidelines that
replaced the standards and guidelines of the original 1989 ENF LRMP for meadows.
Standard & Guideline #100 on page 63 of the 2004 SNFPA ROD applies directly to the
purpose and need of this SEIS. Standard and Guideline #100 states: “Maintain and
restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special
aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural
surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary
to restore connectivity.”

Public Involvement ______________________________________
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Eldorado
National Forest Travel Management Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement was
published in the Federal Register on October 12, 2012. The notice asked that comments
on the proposed action be received by November 7, 2012. In addition, as part of the
public involvement process, information on the proposed action was posted on the
Eldorado National Forest web site and emailed to 784 groups and individuals that have
voiced an interest in travel management on the Eldorado National Forest. The Forest
Service held three public Open House sessions, one in Markleeville on October 22, 2012;
one in Placerville on October 25, 2012, and one in Jackson on October 29, 2012, to share
information about the proposal and listen to issues and concerns brought up by the public.
Approximately 247 letters, emails and comment forms from the public scoping and
8

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

public Open House sessions were received providing public comments on the proposed
action.

Issues _________________________________________________
Comments from the public, other agencies, and tribes were used to formulate issues
concerning the proposed action. The Forest Service separated the issues into two groups:
significant and non-significant. Significant issues were defined as those directly or
indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-significant issues were
identified as those: 1) outside the scope of the proposed action; 2) already decided by
law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; 3) irrelevant to the decision to
be made; or 4) conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations explain this delineation in
Sec. 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not
significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…”.
A Summary of Public Comments received during the scoping period and the issues that
were identified may be found in Appendix B of this document and in the project record
located at the Eldorado National Forest Supervisor’s Office, Placerville, California.
Comments were received during scoping questioning the field methodology used to
determine effects to meadows:
1. Field Survey Methodology: In particular, they indicated they felt the
methodology for assessing compliance with Standard & Guideline #100 was not
adequate for that purpose and did not follow General Technical Report WO-86a.
This issue was determined to be conjectural and, therefore not carried forward in this
SEIS. The methodology in General Technical Report WO-86a, which provides a detailed
characterization of groundwater dependent features, does not specifically evaluate
compliance with Standard & Guideline #100. As a result, a methodology was developed
for this purpose as described in Table 3.6 of this SEIS. In addition, General Technical
Report WO-86a is only intended for a few types of features that are supported by
groundwater (springs, peatlands, and other wetlands) and not intended for meadows and
wetlands that are not supported by groundwater (i.e. supported by surface runoff and
precipitation). The methodology developed for evaluating compliance with Standard &
Guideline #100 does apply to meadows and wetlands that are not supported by
groundwater, and these types of features were within the scope of features that might be
encountered during the field surveys
The Forest Service identified the following significant issues from the public comments
during scoping:

9

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

1. Route 14N39 - Richardson Lake: Richardson Lake is not the main destination for
route 14N39. Users enjoy a drive to the summit of Sourdough Hill to enjoy the views and
the sunset. The entire route should be designated for public motorized use.
This issue was addressed through a modification to the Proposed Action (Alternative #1).
The route is now proposed for designation all the way to the top of Sourdough Hill in
Alternative #1.
2. Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment: Amending the Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) to allow continued public motorized use in sensitive
meadow habitats will result in impacts to hydrology, natural vegetation and wildlife
habitat.
Alternatives #3 and #4 were developed to address this issue. Alternatives #3 and #4
would not amend the LRMP.
3. Corrective Actions: The proposed action does not include corrective actions to fix
the routes found inconsistent with Standard and Guideline #100 so impacts to meadows
will continue to persist.
Alternatives #3 and #4 both address this issue. While Alternatives #3 and #4 do not
include a description of the necessary actions required to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows, routes inconsistent with Standard
and Guideline 100 would not be available for public use until work has been completed
to bring them into compliance.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Proposed
Action
Introduction ___________________________________________
This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Eldorado
National Forest Travel Management Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. It
describes both alternatives considered in detail and those eliminated from detailed study.
The end of this chapter presents the alternatives in tabular format so that the alternatives
can be readily compared. One of the alternatives, Alternative 1, includes an amendment
to the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP).

Development of the Proposed Action ______________________
In order to address the purpose and need, the 42 routes were surveyed in 2011 and 2012
in order to: 1.) reassess the location of the meadows on National Forest land that border
or cross the 42 routes, and 2.) determine whether those routes were in compliance with
Standard and Guideline #100 of the ENF LRMP as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Record of Decision (SNFPAROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
Standard and Guideline #100 states: “Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of
streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by identifying roads and
trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths.
Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore connectivity.”

The Proposed Action was developed based on the information summarized in the
previous table. Analysis supporting the determination as to whether routes meet Standard
and Guideline 100 is provided in Chapter 3 under Hydrology.

Alternatives Considered in Detail __________________________
Based on the issues identified through public comment on the proposed action, the Forest
Service developed three alternative proposals that achieve the purpose and need specified
in the July 31, 2012 Court Order, including the Proposed Action. In addition, the Forest
Service is required to analyze a No Action alternative. The alternatives are described in
detail below.
Alternative 1 - Proposed Action
Minor changes have been made to Alternative 1 since the circulation of the Proposed
Action during scoping in October, 2012. Route 09N54, a secondary access road to Leoni
Meadows, was moved to category of “No Meadows on National Forest Land” since the
meadow is located on private property. Routes 14N05 and 14N58 were moved into the
category of Meadows meeting Standard and Guideline 100, and routes 08N35, 09N04
(17E79), 10N32 and 11N09A were moved to the category of “No Meadows on National
Forest Land” based on review of information collected and additional field surveys.
In response to public scoping, there was also a change in the proposal for route 14N39,
Richardson Lake. The proposed action circulated in October 2012 proposed this route for
designation for public motorized use up to Richardson Lake, with the portion from
Richardson Lake to the top of Sourdough Hill closed to public motorized use. Comments
were received during the scoping period that stated the main destination of that route was
not Richardson Lake but the view from the top of Sourdough Hill, requesting designation
of the entire route. In the proposed action carried forward into this SEIS, the entire route
would be designated for public motorized use.
A Forest Plan Amendment is included in Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, to provide
an exception to Standard and Guideline #100 of the ENF LRMP Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment (SNFPA) to allow for public motorized use on sections affecting the
hydrologic connectivity of meadows until corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented at some time in the future.
The Eldorado National Forest proposes to designate the following routes for public
motorized use:

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
The following routes or route segments would require a Forest Plan amendment to be
designated open for public wheeled motor vehicle use: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26),
09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider Camp Road), 6.8 miles
of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27; Long Canyon
4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett 4WD trail), 11NY32,
14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. These routes are proposed for a Forest Plan
amendment because they provide a unique recreation opportunity (such as a high
elevation trail experience), enhance the recreation experience by connecting routes or
areas, provide access to areas of interest, or allow access for camping. They would be
designated for public motorized use with an exception to Standard and Guideline #100 of
the ENF LRMP SNFPA to allow for public motorized use on sections affecting the
hydrologic connectivity of meadows until corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented
Alternative 2 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, current management would continue to guide allowed
uses of the individual routes. The same portions of the 42 routes that were closed under
16

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

the court order would remain closed to public motorized use. No designation of route
segments currently closed would be implemented. There would be no amendments to the
LRMP.
Alternative 3 – Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the ENF LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 3 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The LRMP would not be amended for the routes as proposed in Alternative 1: 09N01,
09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider
Camp Road), 6.8 miles of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 10N21
(16E27; Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett
4WD trail), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. Instead, these routes would
continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use and
identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are in compliance with
Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. This alternative identifies these
routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions necessary to bring
each into compliance with Standard and Guideline 100. Corrective actions would be
proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement
corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions have been analyzed and
implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail on the
next revision of the MVUM.

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
There are no routes requiring LRMP amendments under this alternative.
Alternative 4
Alternative 4 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the ENF LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 1 except for the following:
The following routes or portions of routes would be designated for public motorized use:
09N54 (open up to intersection with 09N60, closed to public motorized use past that
point), 10N06, 10N26, 11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 13N24, 09N15, 10NY05 (open from
10NY04 to a point just before drainage near 16E27, and closed beyond that point) and
14N05 (open up to McKinstry Trailhead, closed to public motorized use beyond the
trailhead), and 14N27.

The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until the routes are in compliance with Standard and
Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (open to a spot suitable
for camping just north of Schneider Camp meadow, closed to public motorized use
beyond that point), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27) (open except for the section between
10NY04E and the section currently open on the west end), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32.
This alternative identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze
the actions necessary to bring each route into compliance with Standard and Guideline
100. Corrective actions would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses,
as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions
have been analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public
motorized road or trail on the next revision of the MVUM.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35,
10N32, and 10NY06. The reasons mitigation is indicated for these routes are documented
in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in this document. Mitigation
would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to
implement corrective actions becomes available. After the mitigation has been analyzed
and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail
on the next revision of the MVUM. Portions of these routes that are currently open under
the court order would remain open for public motorized use.
The following portions of routes that are not currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: western 2.26 miles of 09N04
(17E79), and 10N03.
The portions of the following routes that are currently closed to public motorized use
under court order would remain closed to public motor vehicle use: 09N54 past
intersection with 09N60, 10NY04, 17E12, 14N58, 17E17, 17E21, 09N82 (southern
portion 16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01 (10N01B), 10N13 (17E73), closed
beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the section currently
open on the west end), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), a portion of 12NY06, 14N05 past
McKinstry Trailhead, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24 (west and east portions), and 17E28.
A portion of 12NY06 that is not currently closed to public motorized use by court order
would be closed in this alternative.

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
There are no routes requiring LRMP amendments under this alternative.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study ___
Federal agencies are required to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all
reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives
that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in
response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for
achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the
scope of the need for the proposal, duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or
determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm.
Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed
consideration for reasons summarized below:
An alternative which included closure and rehabilitation of some routes was considered
but not carried forward. The purpose and need of this analysis was to reconsider whether
to allow public motorized use on 42 specific routes. An alternative addressing closure and
rehabilitation of those routes that are not designated for public motorized use is beyond
the scope of this analysis since a decision is not being made regarding other uses of the
routes including administrative use or permitted use such as access to private property.
An alternative was considered that would analyze the on the ground corrective actions for
each route that did not meet Standard and Guideline #100. This alternative was not
carried forward because substantially more time and resources would be required to
analyze in detail the appropriate corrective actions that could be taken for each route,
including additional field analysis for potential reroutes or ground disturbing activities.
The on the ground corrective actions will be analyzed on a route by route basis as
required by the alternative that is selected in the Record of Decision. This will enable the
24 routes that were found to not affect meadows to be reopened more expediently.

Comparison of Alternatives_______________________________
The table on the following pages provides a brief summary of mileages of route
designations under each of the alternatives in comparative format.

Comparison of Alternatives: Effects by Resource Area

Hydrology
The Hydrology Analysis indicates that there are 24 routes where there is no difference
between the alternatives with regard to Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100. This is
because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross or border
meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
#100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G #100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G #100. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in zero,
18, and seven of those 18 routes meeting S&G #100, respectively. This also means that
Alternatives 2, 3, 4 would result in 18, 0, and 13 routes not meeting S&G #100,
respectively.
It would likely take a number of years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes
meeting S&G #100.
The above results are summarized in Table 3.9 and Figure 3.9.

Recreation
The Recreation Analysis shows that the alternatives differ substantially as to effects to
recreation users. Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, results in the highest number of
miles of roads and trails rated high in recreation value open to public motorized use
initially (95.8 miles). Alternative 3 results in the same number of miles of high value
recreation routes designated for public motorized use, however only 53.4 of those miles
would be open initially, with an additional 42.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS
but not designated for public motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map
(MVUM) until corrective actions are analyzed and implemented. Alternative 4 would
result in 3.7miles of high recreation value routes open to public motorized use, with an
additional 13.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS but not designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until corrective
actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 2, No Action, only the
29.97 miles of high value recreation routes that were not closed by court order would

24

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

remain open, with 65.85 miles of high value recreation routes closed to public motorized
use.
The effects on 4WD and motorcycle riding opportunities, particularly high country routes
over 6,000 feet in elevation, all rated high in recreation value, also vary substantially
between alternatives. In Alternative 1, the proposed action, 42.06 miles of 4WD routes,
all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately 18.47 miles of high
country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in recreation value. In
Alternative 3, the same number of high country 4WD trails would be designated for
public motorized use, however only 11.22 miles would be open initially, with an
additional 30.84 miles added to the MVUM once corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
would be designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions are
analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 4, 8.96 miles of high country 4WD trails would
remain open, and an additional 7.85 miles of high country 4WD trails would be
designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions and mitigation
are analyzed and implemented. Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail
opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be
closed, and all of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado
National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed. In Alternative 2, 11.22
miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, and 30.84 miles of high country
4WD trails would be closed. This equates to the closure of 65 percent of the total 4WD
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. All of the
high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles, rated medium to high
recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This represents 90 percent of
the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in
elevation.

Analysis Framework
The scope of analysis is defined by the following Court Order: Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKKJFM (United States District Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12). This Court
Order requires the Forest Service to analyze 42 specific routes for consistency with the Riparian
Conservation Objective (RCO) #2, Standard and Guideline #100. The Court Order left intact all
other portions of the Forest Service’s travel management decision, including the parts of the
routes that do not intersect meadows. As a consequence, this analysis focuses on S&G #100,
which relates to impacts to meadows. The 42 routes are listed in Table 3.4, and S&G #100 is
provided in full below. Additional hydrologic topics were analyzed in the 2008 TM EIS and
ROD. Please refer to the 2008 TM EIS for an analysis of water quality, cumulative watershed
effects, streams, and wetlands.

Standard & Guideline #100:
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other
special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural
surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary to
restore connectivity.”

Data and Analysis Methods
Meadow Survey Results
The 42 routes were surveyed in the Eldorado National Forest (ENF) in 2011 and 2012 in
order to: 1) locate the meadows that border or cross the 42 routes, and 2) determine
whether those meadows and associated routes are in compliance with Standard and
Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Record of Decision
(SNFPAROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows. Standard and Guideline #100 states:
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and
other special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or
disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions
where necessary to restore connectivity.”
A summary of the survey results is described below and in Table 3.5 and Figure 3.1.
 81 of the surveyed features in the ENF were classified as meadows and 34 of the
features were not classified as meadows (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). The features that
were not classified as meadows included alder-dominated wetlands, narrow strips
of alder adjacent to streams, forested areas with or without shrubs, and areas of
shrubs without trees.
 14 routes do not cross or border meadows. As a result, S&G #100 does not apply
to these routes with regard to meadows.
 10 routes meet S&G #100. This is because these routes cross or border meadows
that meet S&G #100.
 18 routes do not meet S&G #100. This is because these routes have affected the
hydrology of a total of 38 meadows such that S&G #100 was not being met.
A description of the field surveys, which includes the definitions and methodology used,
is in Table 3.6. A summary of the field survey results for individual routes is in Table
3.7; a summary of the meadows that do not meet S&G #100 is in Table 3.8; two
examples of field surveys are in Figures 3.4 through 3.8. All of the field survey forms are
included in the Project Record.

Table 3.6 Description of the field surveys of meadows in the Eldorado National Forest

Purpose of field
surveys
Standard and
Guideline #100

To determine if specific road or trail segments are causing adjacent meadows to not meet
Standard and Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment of 2004.
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and
other special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or
disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions
where necessary to restore connectivity.”

Definition of a
meadow2

“A meadow is defined as a grassy opening, 0.1 acres or larger, dominated by perennial
sedges, rushes, and grasses (wet meadow) or perennial grasses and forbs (dry
meadow).”

Characteristics
of a meadow3

 “A meadow is an ecosystem type composed of one or more plant communities
dominated by herbaceous species.
 It supports plants that use surface water and/or shallow groundwater (generally at
depths of less than one meter).
 Woody vegetation, like trees or shrubs, may occur and be dense but are not
dominant.”

Definition of
hydrologic
connectivity

The hydrologic connectivity of a meadow exists when the surface and subsurface flow of
water through the meadow has not been visibly altered by the road or trail segment.
Description.
A field survey form for meadows was developed specifically to evaluate compliance
with Standard & Guideline #100. The questions on page 2 of the survey form are
specific to visible or noticeable evidence of alteration of the surface and subsurface flow
of water through the meadow. The questions are qualitative, require hydrologic
knowledge and field experience to answer, and are based on features that are visible at
the ground surface, but reflect surface and subsurface water flow characteristics as
described in the criteria below.4

Methodology4

Assumptions
 The mere presence of a road or trail through or adjacent to a meadow (on-theground) does not determine if Standard and Guideline #100 is being met. This is
because it is possible for a road or trail to occur within or adjacent to a meadow
without a visible alteration of surface or subsurface flow of water into or through
the meadow.
 A disruption of surface and/or subsurface flow in the meadow by a road or trail
would result in evidence that can be seen at the surface, such as changes in
vegetation, presence of deposited sediment, gullies, incised stream channels, etc.
Criteria for rating Standard &Guideline #100
Roads and trails were rated as not meeting Standard & Guideline #100 if field evidence
was visible that shows one or more of the following:
 The road or trail intercepts and diverts surface and/or subsurface water from the
meadow and routes the water away from the meadow such that the meadow has
decreased in size and/or wetness.
 Runoff from the road or trail has eroded sediment into the meadow such that
the size and/or wetness of the meadow has been reduced.
 Runoff from the road or trail has caused a stream channel to downcut such that
the water table next to the stream has dropped and the size and/or the wetness
of the meadow has decreased.

Environmental Consequences

Effects Common to All Alternatives

There are 14 routes where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 is not applicable with
regard to meadows. This is because field surveys in 2011 and 2012 determined that
these 14 routes do not cross or border a meadow in the Eldorado National Forest (ENF).
The definition and characteristics of a meadow is described in Table 3.6. The eleven
routes are: 08N23B, 08N35, 09N04 (17E79), 09N54, 10N06, 10N26, 10N32, 10NY04,
11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 12NY15, 13N24, and 17E12.
There are 10 routes where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 would be met. This is
because field surveys in 2011 and 2012 determined that all meadows that cross or border
these 10 routes meet S&G #100. The reason that these meadows meet S&G #100 is
because the following conditions were met at the time of the field surveys:
 The road or trail does not intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface water
from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
meadow has decreased in size and/or wetness.
 Runoff from the road or trail has not eroded sediment into the meadow such that
the size and/or wetness of the meadow has decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail has not caused a stream channel to downcut such
that the water table next to the stream has dropped and the size and/or the wetness
of the meadow has decreased.
The 10 routes where S&G #100 would be met are: 09N15, 10N03, 10NY05, 10NY06,
12NY06, 14N05, 14N27, 14N58, 17E17, and 17E21. The methodology used to evaluate
compliance with S&G #100 is described in more detail in Table 3-6.
Most of the 18 routes that do not meet Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100 will likely not
do so for a number of years. The primary reason is that a detailed plan of corrective
actions (to attain compliance with S&G #100) for most of the 18 routes does not
currently exist, and would require 2 - 10 years to both develop and implement. The 18
routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 10N13
(17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32,
14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.

Alternative 1: Proposed Action
There are 18 routes – the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where S&G #100 would no longer apply.
This is because a Forest Plan Amendment would exempt these 18 routes from S&G #100.
The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01,
10N13 (17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21),
11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to 38 meadows. The adverse impacts to
each meadow would include one or more of the following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
Ten OHV trails – all of which are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 would not meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 Water Quality Management
Handbook (WQMH) of December 2011.1,2,3 This is because Alternative 1 (Proposed
Action) contains no actions to correct or mitigate adverse impacts to meadows caused by
these OHV trails that were identified during the 2011 and 2012 field surveys. BMP
4.7.1, item # 3a-b states: “3. Identify trail segments causing adverse impacts to water
resources and prioritize mitigation measures, such as a.) Relocate existing trails or trail
segments that are in high-risk locations, including SMZs, riparian areas, and meadows,
to restore surface and subsurface hydrologic function, b.) Reconstruct trails to improve,
modify, or restore effective drainage.”
The ten OHV trails are: 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N93), 17E73 (10N13), 16E27
(10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.3
___________________________________________________________________

BMP 4.7.1, item #3a-b only applies to OHV trails and not to roads. The handbook National Best Management
Practices for Water Quality Management on National Forest System Lands (April 2012) contains similar language in
pages 91-92 to BMP 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the 2011 WQMH.

The 2008 TM EIS and ROD was under the WQMH of 2000; this SEIS is under the WQMH of 2011.

Trails that would not meet BMP #4.7.1, item #3a-b are identified by their trail number. For those routes that were
converted from a road to trail through the 2008 Travel Management ROD, the original road number is shown in
parenthesis to allow the reader to track between the 2008 EIS and this SEIS.

Alternative 2: No Action
There are 18 routes - the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100
would not be met. This is because Alternative 2 (No Action) does not require that a plan
of corrective actions for the 18 routes be developed in order to attain compliance with
S&G #100. The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95,
10N01, 10N13 (17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F
(16E21), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to 38 meadows until corrective actions
are taken. The adverse impacts to each meadow would include one or more of the
following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
There are ten OHV trails (that are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100) that
would not meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 WQMH of December 2011.
There are two reasons for this conclusion:
 Alternative 2 (No Action) does not contain actions to correct or mitigate adverse
impacts to meadows caused by those OHV trails as identified during the 2011 and
2012 field surveys.
 The closure of an OHV trail to public use, by itself, does not correct the reason(s)
that that the OHV trail is causing a meadow(s) to not meet S&G #100. For
example, a trail that intercepts surface and/or subsurface water from a meadow
and routes that water down the road and away from the meadow will continue to
do so after vehicles are not allowed on the trail. Two examples of this - meadows
17E73-3 and 17E34-5 - are described in Affected Environment, Figures 3.4
through 3-8. The reason(s) that a meadow does not meet S&G #100 have been
previously described in more detail in Effects Common to All Alternatives
(paragraph 2) and in Table 3.6.
The ten OHV trails are: 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N93), 17E73 (10N13), 16E27
(10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.

Alternative 3
The effects of Alternative 3 are similar to Alternative 1 with one important difference.
There are 18 routes - the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100
would be met after corrective measures to the routes have been implemented and the
Forest Service has determined that the routes are consistent with Standard and Guideline
(S&G) #100. The corrective measures could include one or more of the following:
 Relocation of route segments away from meadows and the subsequent removal of
unnecessary route segments near meadows.
 Reconstruction of route segments to direct runoff (and sediment) from meadows.
 Road or trail improvements in meadows that prevent the interception and
diversion of surface and subsurface water.
 Structures in route segments that enable vehicles to be suspended above
meadows.
Adverse impacts (as described under Alternative 1) would likely continue to occur to 38
meadows until the corrective actions to the 18 routes (that do not meet S&G #100) have
been implemented. The adverse impacts to each meadow would include one or more of
the following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01,
10N13 (17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21),
11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
There are ten OHV trails (that are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G#100) that
would meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 WQMH of December 2011 after
corrective measures to the OHV trails have been implemented such that the routes are
consistent with Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100. The ten OHV trails are: 16E26
(09N82), 19E01 (09N93), 17E73 (10N13), 16E27 (10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21

Alternative 4
The effects of implementing Alternative 4 are similar to Alternative 1 except for a few
differences as described below.
There are 13 routes - all of which crossed or bordered at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100
would not be met. There are two reasons for this conclusion:
 The closure of these 13 routes to public use, by itself, does not correct the
reason(s) that that each route is causing a meadow(s) to not meet S&G #100. For
example, runoff from a road or trail that has eroded sediment into a meadow such
that the size and/or wetness of the meadow has decreased will continue to do so
after vehicles are not allowed on the road or trail. The reason(s) that a meadow
does not meet S&G #100 have been previously described in more detail in Effects
Common to All Alternatives (paragraph 2) and in Table 3.6.
 Alternative 4 does not require that a plan of corrective actions be developed for
the 13 routes in order to attain compliance with S&G #100.
The 13 routes are: 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01 (10N01B), 10N13
(17E73; closed beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the
section currently open on the west end), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 14N39, 17E16, 17E19,
17E24, and 17E28.
There are seven routes – all of which crossed or bordered by at least one meadow that did
not meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G)
#100 would be met after corrective measures to the routes have been implemented and
the Forest Service has determined that the seven routes are consistent with Standard and
Guideline (S&G) #100. The corrective measures could include one or more of the
following:
 Relocation of route segments away from meadows and the subsequent removal of
unnecessary route segments near meadows.
 Reconstruction of route segments to direct runoff (and sediment) away from
meadows.
 Road or trail improvements in meadows that prevent the interception and
diversion of surface and subsurface water.
 Structures in route segments that enable vehicles to be suspended above
meadows.
The seven routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (segment from highway 88 to just north of
Schneider camp meadow), 10N14, a segment of 10N21 (16E27), 11N26F (16E21), and
11NY32.

Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to the meadows crossed or bordered by
the above seven routes until the corrective actions to the seven routes have been
implemented. The adverse impacts to each meadow (that does not currently meet S&G
#100) would include one or more of the following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
There are seven routes where corrective measures would be implemented that are not
related to meadows and S&G #100. The seven routes are: 08N23B, 08N35, 09N04
(17E79), 10N03, 10N32, 10NY06, and 12NY15. These routes either do not contain
meadows or contain meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are eight OHV trails (that are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100) that
would not meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 WQMH of December 2011.
There are two reasons for this conclusion:
 Alternative 4 does not contain actions to correct or mitigate adverse impacts to
meadows caused by those eight OHV trails as identified during the 2011 and 2012
field surveys.
 The closure of an OHV trail to public use, by itself, does not correct the reason(s)
that that the OHV trail is causing a meadow(s) to not meet S&G #100. The
reasons for this have been previously discussed.
The eight OHV trails are: 16E26 (09N82), 16E33 (11N23F), 17E73 (10N13), 19E01
(09N83), 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
There are two OHV trails that would meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5
WQMH of December 2011 after corrective measures to the OHV trails have been
implemented such that the routes are consistent with Standard and Guideline (S&G)
#100. The OHV trails are: 16E27 (10N21) and 16E21 (11N26F).

Summary
There are 24 routes where there is no difference between the alternatives with regard to
Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100. This is because 14 routes do not cross or border
meadows and 10 routes cross or border meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
#100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G #100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G #100. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in zero,
18, and seven of those 18 routes meeting S&G #100, respectively. This also means that
Alternatives 2, 3, 4 would result in 18, 0, and 13 routes not meeting S&G #100,
respectively.
It would likely take a number of years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes
meeting S&G #100.
The above results are summarized in Table 3.9 and Figure 3.9.

Recreation _____________________________________________
Affected Environment

Background
The 42 routes being considered in this document are located on three Ranger Districts of
the Eldorado National Forest. Most of the routes are located in the higher elevations, over
6,000 feet. High elevation roads and trails offer a different recreation experience than
lower elevation trails. There are not a large number of high elevation 4WD recreation
opportunities across the Forest. High elevation trails provide access to remote areas on
the Forest, especially for older and less able individuals who might otherwise not be able
to enjoy these areas. High elevation trails have cooler temperatures during the summer
months than those in the lower elevations, and often have sweeping views and beautiful
fall colors. The setting for these routes is more desirable for camping due to greater
solitude and scenic quality. Some of the routes are also used by hikers, mountain bikers
and equestrians. Some provide vehicle access to other hiking and equestrian
opportunities, including day hikes into the Desolation and Mokelumne Wilderness areas.
The higher elevation routes also offer access for deer and quail hunting during hunting
season, and access for fishing along streams and lake shores. The routes also provide
access for photography, geocaching, bird watching and wildlife viewing, and spiritual
pursuits.
The 42 routes being considered offer a variety of levels of challenge for recreation users.
Some of the routes are fully developed Forest roads, while others are passable only with
specialized vehicles. Several of the routes, such as the Barrett 4wd Trail, Squaw Ridge
4WD Trail, Strawberry 4WD Trail, and Clover Valley 4WD Trail offer multi-day
recreation opportunities with camping. The Barrett 4WD Trail offers a level of challenge
for 4WD users that is relatively unique in the Region, allowing users to test their
technical skills in travelling over large boulders. Only a few other 4WD trails in the
Sierra Nevada offer a similar level of challenge, including the Rubicon Trail on the
Eldorado National Forest and Fordyce Creek Trail on the Tahoe National Forest.
A number of the 42 routes being considered have been in use for over a hundred years,
being remnants of early emigrant trails over the Sierra Nevada. Others have been in place
for multiple generations, and many users have established treasured family traditions of
bringing the younger and older generations along on trips. Exposing family and friends to
the Forest through OHV recreation also fosters a love of the Forest in younger
generations and provides interpretive opportunities.

RECREATION VALUES OF THE 42 ROUTES:
Placerville Ranger District
Leek Springs Valley (09N15)
Route 09N15 is a native surface road approximately 0.5 miles long that ends at the
northeast corner of private property in the Leek Spring Valley area. This road is popular
for high elevation scenic driving , for hunting, and provides access to the North Fork
Cosumnes River for fishing.
Leoni (09N54)
Route 09N54 is a native surface road that enters the SW corner of the Leoni Meadows
Private Camp. The road does not provide the main access into camp, but serves as a route
for scenic driving and hiking. This road is open to all vehicles and is used by Forest
visitors for access to the Forest, driving for pleasure, fuel wood gathering, hunting, and as
a route for horseback and mountain bike riding by camp attendees.
Pebble Ridge (10N06)
Route 10N06 is a native surface road that connects two paved roads 10N59 and 10N58 in
the Pebble Canyon area which is popular for scenic driving, dispersed camping and for
hunters. The road is approximately 2 miles long and parallels a tributary of Camp Creek
which is popular for fishing.
Strawberry 4WD Trail (portion of 10N13, now 17E73)
The northern portion of route 10N13 (17E73), also known as Strawberry 4WD trail, is
used primarily by 4WD enthusiasts seeking a lower level of difficulty 4WD recreational
experience. Forest visitors can access the Strawberry 4WD Trail from either the
Placerville Ranger District (RD) side or the Amador RD side (via 10N13 Schneider
Camp Road). The trail offers ample recreational activities such as hiking, photography,
bird watching, mountain biking and wildflower viewing. The Strawberry 4WD Trail
continues to be a destination for 4 wheel drive activities, especially in the late spring and
early summer; however, it is not as intensively used as other trails such as the Rubicon
Trail. Routes 10N13 and 17E73 combined are approximately 6.73 miles long. Except for
a limited amount of the total length of the trail, the trail does not provide “extreme” 4WD
conditions. The Gold Hill Posse (GHP) 4WD club has “adopted” the Strawberry 4WD
Trail since 2002. This volunteer group routinely provides trail maintenance including reenforcing water bars to redirect water from the trail. The GHP have contributed
approximately 500 hours of volunteer labor since 2002, and are still active participants in
the Adopt-A-Trail program.

experience. The Long Canyon 4WD Trail provides a ‘loop’ with several other routes and
continues to be a destination for 4WD activities; however, it is not as intensively used as
other trails such as the Rubicon Trail. The Long Canyon 4WD Trail is approximately 4
miles long and is also used for hiking, mountain biking and hunting. A segment of the
trail provides a panoramic view of the forest and is a popular destination for forest
recreation, both motorized and non-motorized. Except for a limited amount of the total
length of the trail, the trail does not provide “extreme” 4WD conditions. Forest visitors
can access the Long Canyon 4WD Trail from either the Silver Fork Road or the
Packsaddle Road. The NorCal FJ Cruisers “adopted” the Long Canyon 4WD Trail in
2011. This volunteer group provides trail maintenance including the removal of trash
from the trail and adjacent lands. In addition they provide peer to peer informational
services to other OHV users on the trail regarding proper use of the forest and resource
protection. They contributed approximately 100 hours of volunteer labor during the
summer of 2011 and are still active.

routes provide access to some of the higher elevations on the district with spectacular
panoramic views of the surrounding areas, including Desolation and Mokelumne
wildernesses. These roads provide additional ‘loops’ surrounding the Long Canyon 4WD
Trail.
Bryan Creek (11N09A) and Sayles Canyon Trailhead
The end of the 11N90A road is a well-developed trail head that is used for accessing
Sayles Canyon Trail and the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. Sayles Canyon trail is a
popular high elevation non-motorized trail offering many hiking, equestrian and some
mountain bike activities. The high elevation environment and meadows along the hiking
trail, also affords forest visitors many nature based recreational activities including
wildflower walks, bird watching and photography. The relative ease of the trail provides a
near wilderness experience for forest visitors who otherwise may not be able to enjoy
such areas. The Bryan Creek Road is also used as a permitted access road for Sierra-atTahoe Ski Resort’s West Bowl area to maintain and service the ski lifts in the summer. In
2011 volunteers successfully completed the ‘Sayles Canyon Trailhead Improvement
Project’ including repair and resurfacing the existing trailhead loop, cleared the roadside
of overgrown brush, delineated and graded parking areas within the existing trailhead
area. The volunteer group “Elegant Ears Equestrians” and other equestrian groups
contributed approximately 941 hours of volunteer labor and over $7,000 dollars in
donations for materials and equipment use to improve the trailhead.

Indicator Measures
Two indicator measures were used for this analysis. The first is a relative recreation value
rating that was assigned to each route based on a set of criteria explained below. The
second indicator measure used was whether the route is a high country route (traverses
ground over 6,000 feet in elevation). High country routes represent a unique recreation
opportunity in the Sierra Nevada, and many of the historic high country routes have been
closed to public motorized use in the past, so few routes of this type remain available for
public motorized recreation use.

Rating of Recreation Values Associated with the 42 Routes
For the purpose of this analysis, the following criteria have been used to provide a rating
of recreation access and opportunities for the 42 routes. The criteria are similar to those
that were used in the 2008 Travel Management FEIS, Appendix H, to rate recreation
values associated with Intermittent Service Roads (NFS Level 1 Roads).
Low





Routes which provide only a very limited recreation opportunity, such as a short
route which accesses no specific dispersed recreation opportunity; or
Routes which provide access to a recreation opportunity that is very common,
such as access for hunting in an area with many other routes of comparable
opportunity; or
Routes which have a low level of use because of the lack of public recreation
opportunities.

Medium





Routes which provide only a moderate level of recreation opportunity, such as an
access route to a moderately popular dispersed recreation opportunity; or
Routes which provide access to a recreation opportunity that is somewhat unique,
such as access to stream reaches popular for fishing in an area lacking many other
comparable opportunities; or
Routes which provide recreation opportunities along the road which are not motor
vehicle based, such as horseback riding, etc.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Direct Effects to Recreation
Effects of Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
In Alternative 1, all of the routes temporarily closed under the court order in 2012 would
be reopened for public motorized use according to the type of use established in the 2008
Eldorado National Forest Travel Management Environmental Impact Statement and
Record of Decision. For the 42 routes, approximately 95.8 miles of roads and trails rated
high in recreation value would be open to public motorized use. Approximately 42.1
miles of 4WD routes, all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately
18.5 miles of high country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in
recreation value. Users would be able to continue enjoying these traditional motorized
routes and the portions of the Forest they access. None of the 42 routes rated medium or
high recreation value would be closed to public motorized use. A summary of the miles of
routes that would be reopened is provided in Table 3.2.
Effects of Alternative 2 (No Action)
In Alternative 2, all portions of the 42 routes that are currently closed would remain
closed to public motorized use. The 30 miles of high value recreation routes that were not
closed by court order would remain open, with 65.9 miles of high value recreation routes
closed to public motorized use. Approximately 11.2 miles of high country 4WD trails
would remain open, all rated high in recreation value, and 30.8 miles of high country
4WD trails would remain closed, all rated high in recreation value. This represents 65
percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000
feet in elevation. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles,
rated medium to high recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This
represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National
Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. Routes that are closed to public motorized use may
remain open to non-motorized trail uses, resulting in an increase in the non-motorized
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest. A summary of the miles of routes that
would be open and closed is provided in Table 3.2.
Effects of Alternative 3
In Alternative 3, approximately 53.4 miles of high value recreation routes would be open
to public motorized use, with an additional 42.4 miles of high value recreation routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are
in compliance with Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. Approximately
11.2 miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, all rated high in recreation
value, and an additional 30.8 miles of high country 4WD trails routes would be continue
to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use and

identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are in compliance with
Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. All of the high country motorcycle
trails, approximately 18.5 miles, rated medium to high recreation value, would be routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are
in compliance with Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. None of the
medium or high value recreation routes are designated closed to public motorized use. It
is estimated that analyzing and implementing necessary mitigation measures designed to
meet Standard and Guideline #100 could take a number of years, depending upon
available funding sources. A summary of the miles of routes that would be open and
closed is provided in Table 3.2.
Effects of Alternative 4
In Alternative 4, approximately 35.7 miles of high value recreation routes would be open
to public motorized use, with an additional 13.4 miles of high value recreation routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until corrective
actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented, and 46.7 miles of high value
recreation routes closed to public motorized use. Approximately 9 miles of high country
4WD trails would remain open, all rated high in recreation value, and an additional 7.9
miles of high country 4WD trails would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not
be designated for public motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map
(MVUM) until corrective actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented.
Approximately 25.3 miles of high country 4WD trails would be closed, all rated high in
recreation value. This includes many very popular routes such as the Strawberry 4WD
Trail, Squaw Ridge 4WD Trail, Carson Emigrant National Recreation Trail, and Clover
Valley/Deer Valley Trail. Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities
on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed. All of the
high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles rated medium to high recreation
value and representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the
Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation, would be closed to public
motorized use. This represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on
the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. Routes that are closed to public
motorized use may remain open to non-motorized trail uses, resulting in an increase in
the non-motorized trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest. It is estimated that
analyzing and implementing necessary mitigation measures designed to meet Standard
and Guideline #100 could take a number of years, depending upon available funding
sources. A summary of the miles of routes that would be open and closed is provided in
Table 3.2.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Indirect Effects to Recreation
In addition to the direct affects to recreation under each alternative, there are some
additional routes that would be indirectly affected under each alternative other than the
proposed action, resulting in a decrease in mileage available for recreation. These roads
and trails are routes that are accessed by one of the 42 routes planned to be closed or
opened after mitigation in that alternative. These routes are currently designated open to
motorized use under the 2008 Eldorado National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized
Travel Management EIS and Record of Decision, but they are not currently displayed on
the MVUM since they cannot be reached without travelling on a portion of one of the 42
routes currently closed to public motorized use pending completion of this SEIS. In
alternatives where they are not shown closed, the routes would be added back on to the
MVUM after a decision is issued on this SEIS.
In Alternative 2, No Action, 11.2 miles of additional routes would be affected. In
Alternative 3, 8.1 miles would be affected until corrective actions are completed on the
respective access routes. In Alternative 4, 9.3 miles would be affected until corrective
actions and/or mitigation is completed on the respective access routes.

Closure of the 42 routes resulted in greater impacts to
legitimate public recreation than was reflected by the route
mileage of the 42 routes alone.

I would like to volunteer time to work on maintaining and
improving these routes/Recommend partnerships with OHV
user groups to do work on the roads and trails to reduce
erosion, protect sensitive areas.

With some mitigating strategies for meadows and streams,
these traditional OHV roads can and should remain open.

Closure of these trails results in greater impacts on the
remaining few available local trails, both on the ground and
in terms of user safety as use becomes concentrated (Rubicon
specifically mentioned)

highways. Please no gates.

77, 209

If no other mitigation is appropriate or available, willing to
accept seasonal closure of the most sensitive areas as long as
closures are based/implemented on actual
observation/measurement of conditions (such as they do at
Georgetown and Mammoth Bar after rainfall) rather than an
inflexible calendar-based schedule

Request Deer Valley trail to remain open to OHV use. Propose
a reroute at the meadow area of concern. Details provided.

Keep Barrett Lake accessible to the wheeled public. It is a
great trail to go hiking from as it gets you near the peaks and
lakes.

We like to ride our quads from mud lake parking area and
ride the roads to Squaw Ridge and up the Martel Flats
(17N24, 09N04, 09N82) and walk from there to little lakes.
Also ride to Pardoe Lake area and to Mud Lake.

Pasture), 17E21 (Horse Canyon), 17E19 Allen’s Camp
Motorcycle trail), 17E28 Long valley Trail (Mud lake), and
9N82 (Squaw Ridge).

210

We adamantly opposed to the closure of 9N01 and all of
9N83. 9N83 has been in place since the late 1800's and is
historic in nature. By closure of this road you are specifically
closing a Handicapped parking site that was required to be
built by FERC. By forest closures of any type you are
depriving the public in general and handicapped specifically
of use of the forest.

List of favorite routes to keep open with descriptions

70

Keep open 09N15 Leek Springs Valley; 09N95 Cosumnes
Head; 10N98 Jim Quinn Spur; 09N23B Prothero Headwater.
The roads are not a hazard. Past impacts from logging and
grazing are healing.

Trails such as Barrett, Strawberry, and Deer Valley are held
dear to the OHV community. I would hope the FS could give

the user base a "heads up" so we are not surprised at the last
minute closures.
122

I think it is important to restore access to all meadow routes,
especially Jerrett Peak/McKinstry Lake area.

100

I want to encourage you to do everything that you can to
reopen as many miles of roads and trails as you can,
hopefully by next summer.

129, 207, 220, 227,
228, 127

Closing motorized access means only healthy people can
enjoy public land. The vast majority of Americans are not
capable of that, so if they want to get out in nature they are
dependent on motorized access.
Roads and trails as identified by Mr. Guidice 17E12, 17E16,
17E17, 17E19, 17E21, and 17E24 are important to the 4wd
community.

226

Keep the squaw ridge and horse canyon trail open. The OHV
people have a right to use this public land.

233

You closed all the best trails that I have been using for the
past 14 years. The state is taking our RV money and giving
us nothing in return. Refund our green sticker money or
open the trails.

If a portion of a route is found to be causing harm to an
adjacent meadow please fix it and not close it.

Friends of the Rubicon is interested in including 14N39 to
top of Sourdough Hill in their scope of responsibility for
maintenance.

Richardson Lake is
not the main
destination on that
trail. Users enjoy a
drive to the summit
of Sourdough Hill to
enjoy the views and

repairs. SMUD would like to clarify that the portion of 14N39
proposed for closure to public vehicle use would continue to
be open for administrative purposes, which would include
SMUD vehicle use and snow cat use for operating and
maintaining the two stations. SMUD is willing to work with
the ENF to develop an acceptable solution.
Richardson Lake route to the top of Sourdough Hill will
continue to see administrative use by SMUD. Recommend
forest undertake mitigation/BMP's in the area of concern
much like the County has done on the Rubicon and ask that
SMUD maintain it.

our water quality and quantity, wildlife and sensitive plans.
Closing the routes will not deny public access, but only
motorized access.

Concern that ORV riders do not limit their activities to
designated routes. Designated roads become whole areas
impacted by machines that destroy habitat.
Inadequate field surveys

97, 132

Determinations by filed surveys that certain routes do not
currently meet S&G 100 seem vague and the three criteria
used insufficient, and the determination to open them seems
arbitrary and capricious.

97, 132

Scoping letter needed to state whether the TM SEIS was going
to be processed under the old planning guidelines or the new
National Forest System Land Management Planning rule.

97, 132

To insure compliance with S&G 100, an assessment of the
effect of each meadow road on groundwater movement must
be made and included in the TM SEIS or its accompanying
NEPA documents. Such assessments should be consistent
with GTR-WO-86a.

97, 132

Methodology section of Table 2 of the Hydrology and
Watershed Resources Meadow Survey Results uses the word

substantial when referring to compliance with S&G 100.
However S&G 100 has no such qualifier; under S&G 100 a
route either alters surface and subsurface water flow or it
doesn't.

97, 132

2008 RCO analysis being used was based on GIS analysis.
Site specific information related to presence/absence of
aquatic and aquatic-dependent species including yellowlegged frog was scant.

97, 132

Because S&G 100 is integrally linked to other Standards and
Guidelines in RCO #2, to insure compliance with all
Standards and Guidelines in this Objective, the TM SEIS
needs data sets from an aquatic biologist, botanist, and soil
scientist that demonstrate consistency with the Standards
and Guidelines, not just inconsistency.

97, 132

There is a lack of discussion in TM SEIS on amount of vehicle
use a road will receive when it is open to public use during
periods when the soils will be saturated, the time when
rutting or other damage to meadow roads is most likely to
occur.

97, 132

Proposed action includes no corrective actions to move the
routes found inconsistent with S&G 100 towards compliance
even though the PA would open them to public use.
Closure of all routes

50

In favor of keeping as many roads closed as possible.

No action

Request for specific routes
49

Object to opening 17E12 Lovers Leap Trail, which crosses a
meadow and ends at a foot trail.

49

Object to opening of 11N09A past meadow complex in the
Sierra at Tahoe ski area due to illegal gunfire and access
provided by this road at intersection of Pony Express Trail. Or
consider seasonal closure after Aug 31 through hunting
season to protect recreation residents from gunfire and threat
to personal safety.

49

Recommend closing the Little Round Top trail as it crosses on
and near a huge seasonal wet area of meadows and springs
near the junction of the PCT.

243

Some of the routes are in close proximity to the PCT and pose
potential impact to the Trail and the experience it affords
hikers and equestrians. Impacts to the PCT should be one
criterion used in this SEIS when considering which routes to
open to motorized use. The following list of routes should be
considered: 19E01, 10N01B, 10N13, 17E16, 11N09A, and
14N39.
Outside the scope of the project

Unhappy with the one "car length" rule

106

The US District Court never considered if the LRMP blanket
meadow restriction is appropriate or not, without this
consideration the court did not condone it. The history record
93

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

reflects that the ENF has made a significant error and
omission in the LRMP by including the blanket restriction of
OHV routes in meadows. This action has denied the public
due process and has allowed the Forest Service to avoid
disclosure of a rationale, scientific basis for not allowing
routes in meadows.
22

Request Caples Creek, Government Meadows, trail from/to
Caples Creek /Martin Meadow CG/staging area designated

28, 222, 224

Support for reroutes around meadows or bridges rather than
closing parts of some trails

47

If you must close the current route to Sourdough Hill due to
a meadow, please recognize and add to your maps the
original route to the summit which still exists to the north of
Richardson Lake.
