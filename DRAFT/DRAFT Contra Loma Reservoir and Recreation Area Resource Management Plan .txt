Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Draft Resource Management Plan/Draft Environmental Impact
Statement

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has prepared a Draft Resource Management Plan
(RMP) and Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Contra Loma Reservoir and
Recreation Area (Contra Loma) located in Contra Costa County, California. The 741-acre
Recreation Area consists of the 80-acre Contra Loma Reservoir and approximately 661 acres of
surrounding land, including the Contra Loma Regional Park and the Antioch Community Park.
Contra Loma Reservoir was constructed in 1967 as part of the Central Valley Project and is
managed by Reclamation’s Mid-Pacific Region’s South-Central California Area Office. The
Contra Costa Water District operates and maintains the reservoir under contract with
Reclamation. East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) currently manages recreation on the
reservoir and the recreational lands surrounding the reservoir as the Contra Loma Regional Park
pursuant to an agreement with Reclamation. Under a separate agreement with EBRPD, the City
of Antioch operates and manages the Community Park located in the northeastern portion of
Contra Loma.
The Contra Loma RMP is a long-term (25-year) plan to guide management of the resources on
the federal lands of the reservoir and recreation areas. The primary emphasis of the RMP is to
protect the water supply and quality of Contra Loma Reservoir while balancing the management
of natural and cultural resources with enhancements to recreational uses within Contra Loma.
The purpose of the EIS is to help Reclamation evaluate the actions that will ultimately be
included in the RMP. This document evaluates a No Action Alternative and two action
alternatives. The No Action Alternative (Alternative 1) would continue current management
practices. The Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative (Alternative 2) would enhance
recreation opportunities and existing facilities at Contra Loma to fulfill the evolving needs of the
public while minimizing changes to Contra Loma’s recreation setting and adverse effects on
natural resources. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative (Alternative 3) would
expand recreation opportunities and facilities to accommodate increasing demand. This
document was prepared by Reclamation as the lead federal agency to satisfy the requirements of
the National Environmental Policy Act.

Executive Summary

Executive Summary
Introduction
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is preparing a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for
the Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area (Contra Loma) located in Antioch, Contra Costa
County, California (Figure ES-1). The Contra Loma RMP is a long-term plan to guide
management of the resources on the Federal lands within the reservoir and recreation areas. The
RMP is being developed in accordance with Reclamation’s 2003 Resource Management Plan
Guidebook, Planning for the Future, and is based on a comprehensive inventory of
environmental resources and facilities as well as input from the East Bay Regional Park District
(EBRPD), the City of Antioch (City), the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD), and the public.
The primary emphasis of the RMP is to protect the water supply and quality of Contra Loma
Reservoir, and balancing the management of natural and cultural resources with enhancements to
recreational uses within Contra Loma.
Contra Loma consists of the 80-acre Contra Loma Reservoir and approximately 661 acres of
surrounding land, including the Contra Loma Regional Park (Regional Park) and the Antioch
Community Park (Community Park; Figure ES-2). Contra Loma Reservoir was constructed in
1967 as part of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and is managed by Reclamation’s Mid-Pacific
Region’s South-Central California Area Office. CCWD operates and maintains the reservoir
under contract with Reclamation. The reservoir receives and stores water from the Contra Costa
Canal. The reservoir is primarily used as a regulating reservoir for peak or short-term municipal
water supplies for CCWD customers, for emergency storage, and as a backup water supply
during maintenance of upstream facilities. The recreation area was opened to the public in 1968
with few developed recreational facilities.
On September 18, 1972, a management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD transferred
responsibility for land use management and development, construction, and maintenance of
public recreational facilities to EBRPD (Bureau of Reclamation 1972). This agreement clarifies
that the rights of EBRPD under this agreement are subordinate to the rights of the United States
relating to the use of the lands and water areas for water regulation and other project purposes.
EBRPD continues to manage the recreational lands surrounding the reservoir. The City operates
and manages the Community Park in the northeastern portion of Contra Loma under a
Reclamation-approved license agreement granted by EBRPD in 1985 and amended in 1990.
The 1972 management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD and the license agreement
between EBRPD and the City were both scheduled to expire in December 2010. While the RMP
process is on-going, Reclamation issued EBRPD an extension of the management agreement.
EBRPD has expressed interest in renewing the management agreement with Reclamation. After
completion of the RMP process, Reclamation will negotiate a new long-term management
agreement with one or more local managing partner(s).

Executive Summary

Decisions directing current management of the recreation area are based on the Reservoir Area
Management Plan (RAMP; East Bay Regional Park District 1975a) and the Land Use–
Development Plan (LUDP; East Bay Regional Park District 1975b). Both planning documents
were prepared by EBRPD in 1975. Reclamation’s new RMP will be incorporated by reference in
the new long-term management agreement with its local managing partner(s) and is intended to
supersede the RAMP and the LUDP once adopted by the new local managing partner(s).
Importantly, the RMP will facilitate public understanding of the recreation area and provide
consistent and integrated land use planning decisions.
In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA; PL 91190, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (40
CFR 1500-1508) and U.S. Department of the Interior (43 CFR Part 46) regulations for
implementing NEPA, Reclamation has prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to
evaluate and disclose the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of
implementing the Contra Loma RMP. Because of the similarities between the requirements for
an RMP and an EIS, Reclamation has decided to combine the RMP and EIS into a single
document, hereafter referred to as the RMP/EIS.

Purpose and Need
The Reclamation Recreation Management Act of 1992 (Public Law [PL] 102-575, Title 28
[2805(c)(1)(A)]) directs Reclamation to “provide for the development, use, conservation,
enhancement, and management of resources on Reclamation lands.” The Contra Loma RAMP
currently guides EBRPD in administering, operating, planning, and developing Contra Loma.
The RAMP was prepared in 1975 and some features of the RAMP are either outdated or no
longer relevant. In addition, the types of recreational facilities requested by the public and the
infrastructure required to operate the recreation area have changed since the RAMP was
prepared. Finally, environmental conditions at the recreation area have changed since 1975.
These changes have created a need for Reclamation to evaluate resource and recreation
management practices at Contra Loma and to prepare an RMP that meets evolving public
demand and infrastructure needs.
The Contra Loma RMP has a planning horizon of 25 years. The planning horizon will begin
when new management agreement(s) are reached between Reclamation and local managing
partner(s). The RMP is needed to provide management guidance to Reclamation and the local
agencies and to ensure effective protection and management of Contra Loma’s resources,
particularly the reservoir. The RMP will also provide guidance on the allowed uses and desired
future conditions at Contra Loma and establish the framework for the new management
agreement(s).
The purpose of the RMP is to establish a set of management objectives, goals, and actions to be
implemented by Reclamation, either directly or through its management agreement(s) that
would:
•

establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote organized use,
development, and management of recreation area lands in a way that is compatible with
applicable federal and state laws;
DRAFT ES-5 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

protect the water supply and quality of Contra Loma Reservoir;

•

manage natural and cultural resources in and around the reservoir in a way that is
consistent with federal law and Reclamation policies;

•

provide additional recreational opportunities and facilities requested by the public; and

•

provide guidance for future decision making.

Primary Issue Areas
Reclamation conducted public outreach in 2010 and 2011 to explain the scope and objectives of
the Contra Loma RMP and to encourage comments from the public and stakeholders, including
EBRPD, the City, and CCWD, about the issues that should be addressed in the RMP and
evaluated in the EIS. During that time, Reclamation held a public scoping meeting, two public
workshops, and solicited written public and stakeholder comments. Based on the comments
received and its own review of the issues, Reclamation identified the following primary issue
areas to be addressed in the RMP:
•

Recreational facilities and opportunities at the Regional Park

•

Infrastructure and administrative facilities at the Regional Park

•

Facility management at the Regional Park

•

Recreational facilities and opportunities at the Community Park

•

Facility management at the Community Park

•

Reservoir water quality

•

Pasture vegetation management at the Regional Park

Reclamation also identified the following environmental and planning topics to be addressed in
the EIS:
•

Land use and management

•

Recreation

•

Visitor access and circulation

•

Utilities

•

Public health and safety

•

Water resources

Public Involvement
Public involvement is a critical element in developing a RMP. Reclamation’s goal is to gain
input from a cross section of the user public and stakeholders, including the current local
managing partners. Reclamation held a public scoping meeting and two public workshops in
2010 and 2011 to solicit issues and concerns and to develop alternatives to be analyzed in the
RMP. In addition, Reclamation developed a mailing list (and accompanying database), produced
and distributed flyers and public notices, and posted project updates and information on
Reclamation’s Contra Loma RMP/EIS website and the EBRPD website.
A Notice of Intent to prepare the RMP/EIS was published in the Federal Register on November
12, 2009. Reclamation held a scoping meeting for the Contra Loma RMP/EIS on February 8,
2010, at the Nick Rodriguez Community Center in Antioch. Reclamation also held a public
workshop on August 4, 2010, at Sutter Elementary School in Antioch to seek ideas, concerns,
and comments to inform development of the RMP/EIS. Written scoping comments were
solicited by Reclamation from February 8 through 22, 2010, and from August 4 through 31,
2010. On March 3, 2011, Reclamation held a second public workshop at Prewett Family Park &
Community Center in Antioch to solicit comments on the conceptual draft packages of RMP
actions and alternatives.
Reclamation prepared an Issues and Opportunities Report summarizing the public comments and
issues raised during the scoping meeting and the first public workshop in August 2010. The
report is included as Appendix A and provides a summary of written and verbal comments
provided by agencies, organizations, and individuals (Bureau of Reclamation 2010).
Reclamation will post the Draft RMP/EIS for a 60-day public review period to solicit written
comments. Reclamation will also hold a public meeting to receive public comments on the Draft
RMP/EIS. Responses to public comments will be included in the Final RMP/EIS.

Management Alternatives
Alternatives Evaluated in the RMP/EIS
Reclamation’s intent is to develop a broad range of management actions to evaluate alternatives
that would represent the varied interests pertaining to Contra Loma. Reclamation identified and
evaluated three RMP alternatives, which are designed to address the planning issues,
opportunities, and constraints at Contra Loma. The three alternatives evaluated in the Draft
RMP/EIS include a No Action Alternative and two action alternatives, as summarized below.
The management actions and alternatives are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. Reclamation
has not identified a preferred alternative at this time. As required by NEPA, the Final EIS will
identify the preferred alternative.
No Action (Alternative 1 – Status Quo)
The objective of this alternative is to continue the current resource and recreation management
direction and practices at Contra Loma.
Under this alternative, the current resource and recreation management direction and practices at
Contra Loma would continue unchanged, and would be generally consistent with EBRPD’s
current RAMP (East Bay Regional Park District 1975a), the Regional Park LUDP (East Bay
Regional Park District 1975b), the current management agreement between Reclamation and
EBRPD, the license agreement between EBRPD and the City, and the EBRPD land use plans
pertaining to Contra Loma. Some features of the RAMP, however, would not be implemented.
For example, the Community Park is now located where the RAMP and LUDP had envisioned a
day camp recreation zone. Therefore, the Day Camp recreation zone would not be implemented
under the No Action Alternative. Also, the RAMP and LUDP had envisioned a picnic meadow
cluster to the east of the reservoir that has not yet been built and might not be built under this
alternative.
The local managing partner(s) would implement and manage the administrative and operational
activities listed in Section 2.5 and Appendix B. The managing partner(s) would implement many
of these activities, including those that may require permits or environmental review under
NEPA or California Environmental Quality Act or authorization by Reclamation or CCWD. This
alternative addresses certain public comments requesting no further substantive change in
management direction or intensity be made at Contra Loma. The No Action Alternative provides
the appropriate basis by which all other alternatives can be compared. It meets all the primary
goals of the Contra Loma RMP except for provision of enhanced or new recreational uses and
facilities.
Enhanced Recreation and Facilities (Alternative 2)
The objective of this alternative is to enhance current recreational uses and facilities at Contra
Loma to fulfill the evolving needs of the public who recreate at Contra Loma and to implement
several basic infrastructure improvements while minimizing changes to Contra Loma’s
recreation setting and adverse effects on natural resources.
Under this alternative, the management direction would be shifted toward enhancement of
current recreational uses and facilities. This alternative includes management actions to enhance,
replace, or upgrade existing recreational uses and facilities and installation of new facilities to
DRAFT ES-8 – May 2014

Executive Summary

expand or complement existing uses and facilities. Examples include upgrades to restrooms, the
swim lagoon, fishing piers, the trail system, the boat launch, and administrative buildings.
Examples also include new facilities such as additional restrooms, sewer lines, picnic sites,
parking areas, and habitat restoration activities. Alternative 2 involves no major expansion of
recreational facilities. This alternative also includes boundary adjustments between the Regional
Park and the Community Park.
Expanded Recreation and Facilities (Alternative 3)
The objective of this alternative is to expand recreational uses and facilities to accommodate
increasing demand, especially for additional all-weather sports fields.
Under this alternative, the management direction would be shifted toward expansion of
recreational uses and facilities. This alternative includes the management actions listed under
Alternative 2 (Enhanced Recreation and Facilities) and provides additional management actions
to expand existing recreational uses and facilities and to install new facilities that expand
recreational opportunities. Examples include construction of a fishermen's shelter, a playground
structure, a disc golf course, and new multi-use sports fields, and expansion of the swim lagoon
and the trail system. Other examples include planting of shade trees, installation of shade
structures and solar panels, and fish habitat improvements to increase fish populations. This
alternative may also include overnight group camping.
Environmental Analysis
The Contra Loma RMP is a programmatic, planning-level document that provides management
direction at a broad scale and is not intended to provide project-level detail of future
management actions or projects. For this reason, the EIS evaluates the environmental impacts of
each RMP alternative in a programmatic manner. Future actions carried out under the purview of
the RMP beyond the programmatic analysis presented in the EIS would be subject to projectlevel NEPA analysis and compliance.
Chapter 4 (Environmental Consequences) evaluates the environmental impacts of implementing
each of the alternatives. The chapter is organized in sections by resource topic. Each resource
section begins with a brief description of the resources addressed within the section and the types
of activities that could affect the resource. Impact thresholds are then defined and are expressed
as beneficial impacts, no impacts, minor adverse impacts, or major adverse impacts. A list of
assumptions upon which the analysis is based follows. The impacts of activities common to all of
the alternatives are then discussed, followed by a discussion of impacts and mitigation measures
unique to each alternative. Where appropriate and feasible, mitigation measures are discussed
that would avoid or minimize impacts to the affected resource. Therefore, no unavoidable
adverse impacts would occur under any of the alternatives. Cumulative impacts are discussed at
the end of each resource.

Comparison and Summary of Alternatives and Environmental
Consequences
This section provides a summary of the key differences of the environmental effects between the
three alternatives. Because this discussion is intended to present the key differences between the

DRAFT ES-9 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

alternatives, it does not address all of the effects of the proposed management actions. A full
discussion of the environmental effects attributable to each alternative is provided in Chapter 4.
One important characteristic of the alternatives is that the management actions are additive under
each successive alternative. The Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative includes all of
the management actions that would be included in the No Action Alternative, and the Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative includes all of the management actions that would be
included in the other two alternatives. Therefore, the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would include more new or improved facilities than the No Action Alternative and
the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include more new or improved
facilities than the other two alternatives. Therefore the intensity of development would be more
intense under each successive alternative.
Another important, but related, characteristic of the alternatives is the relative increase in
visitation to Contra Loma that is expected under each alternative. Visitor use is expected to
increase under all of the RMP alternatives; however, the two action alternatives would include
more new or expanded recreational opportunities and administrative facilities than the No Action
Alternative and would, therefore, result in more visitation than the No Action Alternative. The
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include more new recreational
opportunities than the other two alternatives and, therefore, would generate the highest increase
in visitation.
Land Use
Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No Action
Alternative, they would increase the potential for conflicts among user groups. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most visitors and would, therefore, have
the most potential for such conflicts.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated facilities to
enhance or expand recreation and improve operations. These facilities are expected to be
designed and located in order to promote compatibility with existing land uses, however, some
new land use compatibility conflicts could occur under the two action alternatives. The
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include the most improvements and,
therefore, would have the most potential for such conflicts.
Recreation
The No Action Alternative would not alter the recreational opportunities available within Contra
Loma. The two action alternatives, however, would include new, enhanced, or expanded
recreational opportunities and administrative facilities that would have a beneficial impact on
recreation. Examples include an Americans with Disabilities Act facility retrofit program,
various trail improvements, additional picnic sites, improvements to the swim lagoon, additional
sports fields, improved fishing and boat launch facilities, a disc golf course, and improvements to
various administrative facilities. During construction of these improvements, some existing
recreational opportunities may be temporarily unavailable for use resulting in short-term minor
adverse recreation impacts. However, these recreational improvements would result in long-term
beneficial impacts on recreation. Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

DRAFT ES-10 – May 2014

Executive Summary

would include the most recreational opportunities and improvements, it would have the greatest
long-term beneficial impact on recreation.
Increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities
which could incrementally increase the frequency of temporary restriction or impairment of
public use and recreation access. Because the two action alternatives would include new,
enhanced, expanded, or renovated facilities to enhance or expand recreation, they would require
more routine maintenance activities which could increase the frequency of temporary restriction
or impairment of public use and recreation access. Also, because the action alternatives would
include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, they could result
in more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance. Therefore, these alternatives
could result in more frequent occurrences of temporary restriction or impairment of public use
and recreation access than the No Action Alternative. Because the Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative would have the most new facilities and would generate the most visitors, it
would have the most potential for this type of effect. Maintenance activities would have a minor
impact on recreation under all of the alternatives.
Visitor Access and Circulation
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase the number of
vehicles using park roads and parking areas and would increase the number of vehicles using
public roads to access Contra Loma. The internal roads and parking areas would be expected to
accommodate increased visitation on most days; however, gate closures to vehicles when road
and parking capacity is reached could occur more frequently than current conditions. Increased
vehicle trips to Contra Loma would represent a small proportion of the existing traffic on local
roads serving Contra Loma. These trips would increase average daily traffic from 2 to 6 percent
of the current traffic volumes and would be expected to cause a similar increase in volume-tocapacity ratios. It appears that these roads would be sufficient to accommodate increased
visitation. Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No
Action Alternative, they would generate more vehicle trips to Contra Loma. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most visitors and vehicle trips. Under
all of the alternatives, however, increased human use would cause a minor impact on visitor
access and circulation within Contra Loma and on the capacity of local roads serving Contra
Loma.
Increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities
which could incrementally increase the frequency of temporary road and trail closures. Because
the two action alternatives would include facility improvements and could result in more visitor
use, they may generate the need for incrementally more maintenance. The Expanded Recreation
and Facilities Alternative would likely generate the most need for maintenance. Under all of the
alternatives, however, road or trail closures during maintenance activities would be short term
and the impact on visitor access and circulation would be minor.
The two action alternatives would include trail improvements that would have a beneficial
impact on visitor access and circulation within Contra Loma. The Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative may include construction of new trails and connections that would result in
more benefits to visitor access and circulation than the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
Alternative.
DRAFT ES-11 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

The two action alternatives would also include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated facilities.
These facilities could attract more visitors to Contra Loma than the No Action Alternative. The
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include more new facilities than the other
alternatives. The existing roads and parking areas at both the Regional Park and the Community
Park are anticipated to be capable of providing an adequate level of service to accommodate
increased visitor traffic, although some existing gravel parking areas might be paved and
overflow parking at the Regional Park might be expanded, if it becomes necessary to
accommodate more vehicles. Facility improvements would not result in any permanent impacts
on visitor access or circulation. However, road or trail closures, if needed during construction,
could result in temporary, minor impacts on visitor access and circulation. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would have the most potential for such temporary, minor
impacts.
Utilities
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase demand for
publicly available utilities such as restrooms, potable water, electricity, and litter and waste
disposal. Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No
Action Alternative and because these alternatives could increase the volume of water pumped
from the reservoir to irrigate the Regional Park, they would generate more demand for utilities
than the No Action Alternative. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would
generate the most demand. Under all of the alternatives, however, increased human use would
cause a minor impact on utilities.
The two action alternatives may include new permanent restrooms to replace the existing
portable chemical toilets. This would be a beneficial impact that would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include
more new facilities and would, therefore, generate more new demand for utilities than the
Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. The new facilities would increase demand for
utilities; however, the increased demand would result in a minor adverse impact under both
action alternatives.
To help meet the increased demand for energy, the Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would include installation of solar panels on shade structures or buildings in the
Regional Park. Energy derived from these solar panels would be used to supplement the
Regional Park’s energy needs, decreasing its dependency on commercial electricity. This would
result in a beneficial impact that would not occur under the other two alternatives.
Public Health and Safety
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would generate more solid and
sanitary waste, which could create public health and safety issues. Increased facility use could
result in greater potential for unsanitary conditions, among other concerns. Increased visitation
could also increase the amount of solid waste, discarded food, and other attractants for unwanted
pests (such as rodents or wasps), and could increase the potential for accidental fires. Because
the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No Action Alternative, they
DRAFT ES-12 – May 2014

Executive Summary

would have a higher potential for such issues to occur. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would generate the most visitors and would, therefore, have the most potential for
such issues to occur. Under all of the alternatives, however, the managing partner(s) would
provide adequate sanitary and solid waste services, would continue to implement integrated pest
management plans to control pests, and would continue to reduce fire hazards by mowing and
grazing the grassland areas such that these public health and safety issues would be minor.
The two action alternatives may include replacing the existing portable chemical toilets with
permanent restrooms and new or upgraded sewer lines to connect future permanent restrooms to
the City’s sewer and wastewater system. These improvements would reduce the potential for
inadvertent spills from the portable restrooms, resulting in a beneficial impact on public health
and safety that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase demand for
emergency services, including fire and police, as well as the number of rescues and assistance
responses performed by lifeguards at the swim lagoon and possibly the reservoir. Use of existing
and expanded emergency and safety services, and the development and implementation of
emergency preparedness plans would ensure that increased visitor use of Contra Loma would
have no impact on the public health and safety of park users.
All of the alternatives include continuation of routine maintenance and repair activities that could
affect visitor health and safety. Increased visitation could incrementally increase the amount of
facility maintenance required, thereby incrementally increasing the potential risk to visitors.
Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No Action
Alternative and would also include new facilities requiring maintenance, they would have a
higher potential for such issues to occur. Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would generate the most visitors and would include the most new facilities, it would
have the most potential for such issues to occur. Under all of the alternatives, however, facility
maintenance would have a minor adverse impact on public health and safety because the
managing partner(s) would be expected to perform maintenance and repair activities in a manner
that meets the RMP goal of protecting public health and safety.
The two action alternatives would include renovations to the existing administrative facilities
intended to better provide for public service and safety. These renovations would result in a
beneficial impact on public health and safety that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
The two action alternatives may include fishing dock improvements to provide anglers with safe,
reliable fishing opportunities. They may also include a “safe swim” area or splash pad that would
improve swim safety for small children. These improvements would result in a beneficial impact
on public safety that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include expanded recreational
facilities and opportunities beyond those of the other alternatives that could increase the potential
for visitor injuries. However, the managing partner(s) would ensure that adequate staff and
emergency plans are available to effectively accommodate the increased risk to public health and
safety related to expanded recreational facilities resulting in a minor impact.

DRAFT ES-13 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

The two action alternatives may include a new radio communications tower that would enhance
emergency response and preparedness and may include call boxes and/or security cameras at the
Community Park. These improvements would have a beneficial impact on public safety that
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Water Resources
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase the potential for
human-related impairment of water quality. Increased visitation could increase the potential for
unauthorized human contact with the reservoir, increasing the potential for human-borne
pathogens and viruses to affect reservoir water quality. An increased volume of solid, human,
and domestic animal (e.g., dogs and horses) waste could also affect reservoir water quality.
Increased boating activity could increase the potential for reservoir infestation by zebra and
quagga mussels and other non-native species. Increased trail use could increase localized
erosion, and the resulting sediment could be transported to the reservoir by surface runoff.
Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No Action
Alternative, they would have a higher potential to impair water quality. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most visitors and would, therefore, have
the most potential for water quality impairment. Under all of the alternatives, however, the local
managing partner(s) would continue to implement restrictions on body contact with the reservoir,
and would continue programs for litter and waste reduction, regular restroom maintenance and
inspection, prevention of zebra and quagga mussel infestation, and trail maintenance. Under all
of the alternatives, these potential water quality issues would be minor.
The two action alternatives may include new permanent restrooms to replace the existing
portable chemical toilets. This improvement would reduce the potential for inadvertent spills
from the portable restrooms, resulting in a beneficial impact on water resources that would not
occur under the No Action Alternative.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include overnight group camping on a
discretionary basis as part of the current day camp programs or other special events. Because
camping would be discretionary and would receive oversight from the Regional Park’s local
managing partner, and because body contact restrictions would continue to be enforced, adverse
impacts to water quality from overnight group camping would be minor.
The two action alternatives may include a new storm water retention basin to improve the quality
of water carried by the Regional Park’s storm drain system before it reaches the reservoir. This
would have a beneficial impact on reservoir water quality that would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities. Construction activities and drainage improvements could affect water
quality through erosion and sedimentation, a temporary increase in reservoir turbidity due to
runoff from construction areas, or inadvertent spilling of construction-related chemicals. The
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include more new facilities and would,
therefore, increase the potential for construction-related water quality impacts. However, both
action alternatives include a management action requiring a focused site-specific assessment of

DRAFT ES-14 – May 2014

Executive Summary

any potential impact on water quality when specific construction activities are proposed,
preparation of a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and implementation of Best Management
Practices, if needed, to protect water quality from construction activities. This management
action would ensure that construction activities and drainage improvements would result in
minor adverse effects on water quality.
Vegetation
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase the potential for
visitors to damage vegetation. Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor
use than the No Action Alternative, they would have a higher potential for damage. Under the
No Action Alternative and the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative, this impact would
be minor. Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most
visitors and may include expansion of the trail system, however, it would have the most potential
for damage and could result in a major adverse impact on vegetation. Mitigation Measure
Vegetation-3 would incorporate signage along equestrian and bicycle trails to prevent horses and
bicycles from leaving trails and Mitigation Measure Vegetation-4 would route any new trails to
avoid sensitive vegetation communities, and provide for an educational leaflet program. These
measures would ensure that this impact is minor.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities. New construction can cause impacts to vegetation from vegetation
removal on the structure footprint, from ground disturbance due to equipment operations, or
from covering due to spoils deposition or erosion. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would include more new facilities and would, therefore, increase the potential for
construction-related vegetation impacts. Most of the affected vegetation is expected to be nonnative annual grassland; however, impacts to more sensitive vegetation communities could also
occur. New construction could result in a major adverse impact on vegetation. Mitigation
Measure Vegetation-1 would require the local managing partner(s) to perform a focused impact
assessment on vegetation resources when proposing specific construction activities. Feasible
wetland or riparian mitigation such as avoidance, minimization or compensatory measures would
be required for temporary and permanent losses of wetlands or riparian vegetation communities.
Mitigation Measure Vegetation-2 would require the local managing partner(s) to perform a
focused impact assessment on vegetation resources. Feasible wetland or riparian mitigation such
as avoidance, minimization, or compensatory measures would be required for temporary and
permanent losses of special-status plants. These measures would ensure that construction-related
vegetation impacts are minor.
The two action alternatives may include increased withdrawal of reservoir water for irrigation.
Increased irrigation may have a beneficial impact on vegetation resources in developed areas of
Contra Loma, including managed landscaping. However, the additional reservoir drawdown
would cause a small decrease in the reservoir’s wetted perimeter adjacent to existing wetland
vegetation at the reservoir high water mark, resulting in a minor impact to wetland vegetation
resources. These impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Wildlife
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase the potential for
visitors to disturb wildlife. Increased visitation would also increase the need for operation and
DRAFT ES-15 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

maintenance activities by the managing partners, which can also adversely affect wildlife.
Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use and require more
maintenance than the No Action Alternative, they would have a higher potential for disturbance.
Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most visitors and
would require the most maintenance, it would have the most potential for wildlife disturbance.
Under all alternatives, the potential for wildlife disturbance would be minor.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities. New construction and related ground disturbing activity can cause
impacts to wildlife from direct mortality or habitat removal. The Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative would include more new facilities and would, therefore, increase the
potential for construction-related wildlife impacts. New construction could result in major shortterm and long-term adverse impacts on wildlife. Mitigation Measures Wildlife-1 and Wildlife-2
would require the local managing partner(s) to perform a focused impact assessment on avian
wildlife resources and special status wildlife when proposing specific construction activities.
Feasible mitigation such as avoidance, minimization, or compensatory measures would be
required to ensure that the activity does not lead to take of migratory birds or special status
wildlife. These measures would ensure that construction-related wildlife impacts are minor.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may also expand Contra Loma’s trail
system, which could cause unexpected stress to wildlife species. New trails routed too close to
sensitive habitats could also result in an increased tendency for humans to venture into sensitive
habitats, causing stress to wildlife. This could result in a major adverse impact on wildlife that
would not occur under the other alternatives. Mitigation Measure Wildlife-3 would incorporate
signage along equestrian and bicycle trails to prevent horses and bicycles from leaving trails in
order to minimize this potential impact.
The two action alternatives may include increased withdrawal of reservoir water for irrigation.
The additional irrigation would have a positive impact on the urban habitat component in
developed areas of Contra Loma, and may have a small positive impact on wildlife there. The
additional irrigation of managed landscaping may also help maintain the hydrology of certain
wetland and stream corridor wildlife habitats that receive runoff from the landscaped areas.
Conversely, fertilizers and pesticides applied to non-native landscape plantings could be
transported to aquatic habitats by the additional landscape irrigation and cause a minor adverse
affect on wildlife and aquatic resources. The additional reservoir drawdown would cause a small
decrease in the reservoir’s wetted perimeter adjacent to existing wetland vegetation at the
reservoir high water mark, resulting in a minor impact to wetland habitat and the wildlife
supported by that habitat.
Fisheries
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase pressure on Contra
Loma’s recreational fisheries. Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor
use than the No Action Alternative, they would result in greater fishing pressure. Because the
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most visitors, it would create
the most fishing pressure. Under all alternatives, however, the impact of increased pressure on
the fishery resources of Contra Loma would be minor.

DRAFT ES-16 – May 2014

Executive Summary

Under all alternatives, the risk of introducing exotic species, such as zebra or quagga mussels,
baitfish, or crayfish into the reservoir would be minor. Two action alternatives would generate
more visitor use and, therefore, would present a greater risk of introduction of these species.
Fall and winter reservoir drawdown can limit access for fishermen because existing fishing and
boat launch docks are not seasonally extended, and weed beds which are normally submerged or
suppressed at higher levels may limit fishing access to open water during lower levels. The two
action alternatives may include modification, reconstruction, or replacement of the existing
fishing piers to allow safe, continuous fishing during reservoir drawdowns. They would also
include more fishing piers if needed to accommodate increased demand and other fishing and
boat launch improvements to partially compensate for the existing adverse effects on the angler
experience during fall and winter low water conditions. These improvements would have a
beneficial impact on fishing that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include creation or modification of fish
habitat if desirable to increase fish populations. If implemented, this management action would
serve to partially compensate for the existing adverse effects on the angler experience during fall
and winter low water conditions and would have a beneficial impact that would not occur under
the other two alternatives.
The two action alternatives may include modification, reconstruction, or replacement of existing
fishing piers, installation of additional fishing piers, and several improvements at the boat launch
area. Some of the new or rehabilitated piers and docks may require new pilings. Construction
activities of this type may cause temporary impacts on lake water quality, may adversely affect
fish resources (especially young panfish and bass), and may temporarily inconvenience anglers.
This would cause minor adverse impacts on fishery resources.
Geologic and Soil Resources
The two action alternatives would include all-season surfacing of several trails near the reservoir.
These improvements would reduce the potential for soil erosion and for the resulting sediment to
reach the reservoir. This would be a beneficial impact that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
The two action alternatives may include construction of new or expanded buildings and facilities.
All new buildings and facilities would meet applicable building code standards pertaining to
geologic hazards and stability. Therefore, these facility improvements would have a minor
impact with respect to geologic and soil resources.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may also include construction of a disc golf
course in the Regional Park, potentially in a location with steep unstable terrain. Construction of
the tee pads would not require any major ground disturbance associated with heavy equipment
use; therefore, the impact on geologic stability would be minor.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include expansion of bicycle use on
unpaved trails, which could slightly increase the potential for erosion. This would be a minor
impact that would not occur under the other alternatives.

DRAFT ES-17 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Climate and Air Quality
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase the number of
vehicles traveling to and from Contra Loma, thereby increasing the volume of air pollutants
including greenhouse gases (GHGs) generated by visitors’ vehicles. The two action alternatives
would generate more pollutants than the No Action Alternative; the Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative would generate the most. These increases are not likely to result in levels of
park visitation high enough to cause exceedance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for
any alternative.
Increased visitation would also increase the amount of particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5 and PM10)
generated by vehicle travel on unpaved roads and by visitor use of trails, barbecue grills, and the
Community Park ball fields. The two action alternatives would generate more particulate matter
than the No Action Alternative; the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would
generate the most. The volume of particulate matter generated would not be substantial, resulting
in a minor impact for all of the alternatives.
Increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities
which could incrementally increase the amount of air pollutants, including particulate matter and
GHGs, generated by maintenance activities. Because the two action alternatives would include
new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated facilities to enhance or expand recreation, they would
require more routine maintenance and, therefore, generate more air pollutants. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would require the most maintenance. Under all alternatives,
however, maintenance activities would have a minor impact on air quality and climate change.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities. Construction activities can temporarily generate air pollutants,
including particulate matter and GHGs. Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would include the most new facilities it would generate the most construction-related
emissions. Under all alternatives, however, construction activities would have a minor impact on
air quality and climate change.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include installation of solar panels to
supplement the Regional Park’s energy needs. Solar panels would reduce the Regional Park’s
demand for conventionally generated electricity, thereby slightly reducing air pollutant emissions
generated at the power plants that serve Contra Loma. This would be a beneficial impact that
would not occur under the other two alternatives.
Noise
The increased visitation expected under all of the alternatives would increase the amount of noise
generated by recreationists and their vehicles. Because the two action alternatives would result in
higher visitor use than the No Action Alternative, they would generate more noise. Because the
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the most visitors, it would
generate the most noise. Noise level increases from human use and visitor vehicle noise are not
expected to be noticeable; therefore, noise impacts resulting from increased visitation would be
minor under all alternatives.

DRAFT ES-18 – May 2014

Executive Summary

Increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities
which could incrementally increase noise generated within Contra Loma. Because the two action
alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated facilities to enhance or
expand recreation, they would require more routine maintenance and, therefore, generate more
noise. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would require the most maintenance.
Under all alternatives, however, maintenance activities would have a minor noise impact.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities. Construction activities can temporarily increase noise levels within
Contra Loma, which could be distracting to some park visitors. Construction noise may also be
audible from some offsite areas, depending on the location and the nature of the construction
activity. Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include the most
new facilities it would generate the most construction noise. However, construction activities
would be short-term. Also, the managing partner(s) can limit construction activities to days and
times that reduce noise-related effects on visitors and on sensitive receptors near Contra Loma.
Under all alternatives, construction activities would have a minor noise impact.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include the addition of two new sports
fields and increased parking capacity in the Community Park. The sports fields would have
floodlights to allow evening use in addition to those currently used within sports fields 1, 2, and
3. Therefore, this alternative may expand sports field use, including evening league play, at the
Community Park. Noise generated at the new sports fields could be noticeable to some residents
near the eastern portion of the Community Park. When considering the context and intensity of
additional noise generated by new sports fields, the new fields would have a minor noise impact.
In addition, the local managing partner(s) for the Community Park would have the ability to
adjust the hours of use to accommodate the needs of nearby residents.
Use of the other facilities constructed under the two action alternatives could increase ambient
noise levels within the Regional Park at certain times. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would include the most new facilities and would, therefore, generate the most noise.
However, the impact would occur over limited time periods, would typically occur in areas of
concentrated human use such as the swim lagoon and south shore of the reservoir, and would not
occur near noise-sensitive land uses located outside Contra Loma. In addition, such noises are
generally an accepted part of the ambient noise levels experienced by park visitors; therefore,
noise level increases from these improvements are not expected to be noticeable.
Visual Resources
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated administrative
and recreational facilities that could affect visual resources within Contra Loma. Because the
Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include the most new facilities, it would
have the most potential to affect visual resources within Contra Loma.
Some of the new or renovated facilities would improve the visual quality within the Regional
Park. Examples include new permanent restroom facilities to replace portable chemical toilets
and renovated fishing docks to replace deteriorating docks. Such improvements would result in a
beneficial impact on localized views in the vicinity of these improvements. Some of the
proposed improvements would represent noticeable changes to the visual environment but would

DRAFT ES-19 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

not impair the visual quality or character of the Contra Loma because they would be consistent
with the existing visual character of Contra Loma. For example, park visitors are accustomed to
seeing picnic areas, shade structures, trail signs, and restrooms when visiting Contra Loma, and
consider such facilities to be important components of their recreational experience. Such
improvements, therefore, would have no impact on visual resources.
Other proposed improvements, however, have the potential to impair visual resources. These
include the larger and more prominent improvements that would be visible from various
locations within Contra Loma and may be visible from offsite locations. Because the specific
designs and locations of these facilities are not yet known, the potential impact on visual
resources could vary in intensity. Improvements that are designed to blend well with the visual
environment would result in minor adverse impacts. Alternatively, improvements that appear
inconsistent with the visual environment could impair the visual character of Contra Loma from
viewpoints within the recreation area and from viewpoints outside the recreation area, resulting
in major adverse impacts. When feasible and appropriate, the proposed activity would be
modified or design measures would be implemented to reduce the visual impacts of the new
improvements, as described in Mitigation Measure Visual-1. This measure would ensure that
potential impacts are minor.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include the addition of two new sports
fields and increased parking capacity in the Community Park. The sports fields would have
floodlights to allow evening use in addition to those currently used within sports fields 1, 2, and
3. The new sports fields would be approximately 800 feet away from the nearest residences,
located on the north site of James Donlon Boulevard, and would be screened by vegetation and
topography. At night, glare or general skyglow from the floodlights may be visible from some
residences. When considering the context and intensity of the new lighting, the sports field lights
would result in a minor adverse impact on visual resources. In addition, the lights would be shut
off each night after their use, and the local managing partner(s) for the Community Park would
have the ability to adjust the hours of use to accommodate the needs of nearby residents.
Hazards
All of the RMP alternatives include continuation of routine maintenance and repair activities that
sometimes require the use of potentially hazardous materials (e.g., cleaning solutions, petroleum
products). Increased visitation could incrementally increase the amount of facility maintenance
required. Because the two action alternatives would result in higher visitor use than the No
Action Alternative and would include new or expanded facilities, they would require more
maintenance. Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would generate the
most visitors and would include the most new facilities, it would require the most maintenance.
Continued use of potentially hazardous materials for maintenance, although at a slightly greater
level, would result in a minor impact with respect to hazards under all alternatives.
The two action alternatives may include construction of a new fueling station and fuel storage
tank for use by managing partner(s) personnel to refuel equipment and vehicles used for
Regional Park operations. The risk that an inadvertent spill would cause an environmental hazard
is expected to be relatively low for several reasons. The facility would be designed with fuel
containment devices to protect public health and safety and prevent spilled fuel from creating an
environmental hazard. Also, the fueling station would not be available for public use and would
DRAFT ES-20 – May 2014

Executive Summary

only be operated by trained managing partner staff. In addition, the local managing partners(s)
will be required to prepare a hazardous waste/spill prevention plan subject to review and
approval by Reclamation.
Cultural Resources
Approximately 25 percent of the Area of Potential Effects (APE) has been disturbed by
dam/reservoir and recreation-associated developments. Small intact sites, isolated artifacts, or
sparse scatters of archaeological materials may still exist in these developed areas. However, in
general, any larger or potentially significant (per National Register of Historic Places [NRHP]
criteria) cultural resources in these areas likely would have been destroyed or at least damaged
by construction activities. Portions of the APE (approximately 170.62 acres [about 23 percent])
have been subjected to surface archaeological surveys including those conducted in 2011 for this
EIS.
A total of ten cultural resources investigations have been conducted within Contra Loma. These
studies included surface archaeological survey, reviews of historic mapping, and an examination
of Reclamation documents and other sources. This research indicates that 12 prehistoric and
historic-era sites and features have been identified within or immediately adjacent to Contra
Loma. These sites represent early Native American use of the landscape and historic-era
activities such as ranching, transportation, and water storage and conveyance in and around
Contra Loma. The surface archaeological surveys conducted in 2011 for this EIS identified three
of these resources; CA-CCo-572, Contra Loma Dam/Reservoir, and the Contra Costa Canal
which is situated outside but immediately adjacent to the northern edge of the APE.
Outreach with Native American Tribes did not yield any specific information about traditional
cultural properties or other pertinent Native American cultural interests in the immediate area.
None of the prehistoric and historic-era sites and features have been assessed as to NRHP listing
eligibility. However, the Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir is an important element in the Delta
Division of the CVP system. Reclamation considers and treats the CVP as eligible for NRHP
listing because of its national and local economic contribution to the development of California.
Therefore, the dam may be determined eligible for NRHP listing as a contributing property to the
CVP (Perry, pers. comm. 2014). Additional sites, features, and artifacts associated with
prehistoric and historic-era activities may be present in un-surveyed portions of the APE.
If any unidentified historic properties are located within Contra Loma, visitors could affect them
through inadvertent trampling or unauthorized collecting. Because the two action alternatives
would result in higher visitor use than the No Action Alternative, they would increase the
potential for effects to unidentified historic properties. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative would generate the most visitors and would, therefore, have the most potential for
such effects.
The two action alternatives would include new, enhanced, expanded, or renovated facilities to
enhance or expand recreation and improve operations. Under the Enhanced Recreation and
Facilities Alternative, most construction or renovation activities would occur within the footprint
of existing buildings or structures where there would be no impacts on unidentified historic
properties. However, some new construction activities could occur in areas that have not been

DRAFT ES-21 – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

surveyed for cultural resources and could affect unidentified historic properties, if any are
present.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include construction of new or
expanded recreation facilities in addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced
Recreation and Facilities Alternative; therefore, this alternative would have more potential to
affect unidentified historic properties than the other two alternatives.
When specific construction activities are proposed, site-specific environmental analyses would
be conducted that include a more focused assessment of any potential impact on historic
properties. If impacts are identified, the proposed activities may be modified or other mitigation
measures may be implemented to eliminate these impacts when possible (see Section 4.16.8,
Mitigation Measure Cultural-1). Reclamation would follow the process for complying with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act as outlined in 36 CFR, Part 800. These
impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Cultural resources and human remains are also protected according to the provisions of the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and the Native American Graves Protection
and Repatriation Act.
Socioeconomics
Visitation is expected to increase under all of the alternatives. This would have a net beneficial
socioeconomic impact for all of the alternatives, although increasing use fees could impair the
affordability of some uses for members of low-income populations.
Continuation of the recreational fishing program and management of fish populations through
fish planting (i.e., stocking) programs would continue to contribute to the local economy,
resulting in a beneficial socioeconomic impact for all of the alternatives.
Increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities.
Because the two action alternatives would include facility improvements and could result in
more visitor use, they may generate the need for incrementally more maintenance. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would likely generate the most need for maintenance.
Increased facility maintenance could have a minor beneficial socioeconomic impact on the
region under all of the alternatives, because the managing partner(s) would need to purchase
additional supplies and services.
The two action alternatives would include facility improvements for the purpose of improving
operation and enjoyment of Contra Loma. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
would include the most improvements. The facility improvements would create temporary
construction-related jobs and increase the amount the services and supplies purchased by the
local managing partner(s). Facility improvements would contribute to the local and regional
economies, resulting in temporary beneficial socioeconomic impacts. None of these impacts
would occur under the No Action Alternative.
The two action alternatives would include a management action to increase the frequency of fish
stocking in the reservoir from current levels in order to meet demand. Increasing fisheries

DRAFT ES-22 – May 2014

Executive Summary

resources would benefit the local economy by increasing the desirability of the reservoir as a
fishing destination, resulting in a beneficial socioeconomic impact that would not occur under
the No Action Alternative.
Environmental Justice
Although some residents in the general vicinity of Contra Loma have incomes below the poverty
level, the proportion of low-income households within the community is not high enough to be
considered a low-income population. Therefore, none of the alternatives would
disproportionately affect low-income populations.
Although the population in the general vicinity of Contra Loma includes a relatively high
proportion of minorities, none of the alternatives would cause dislocation, adverse changes in
employment, or increase flood, drought, or disease and none would disproportionately impact
economically disadvantaged or minority populations in an adverse manner.
All of the alternatives have the potential to increase employment and business opportunities
within Contra Loma and in the surrounding communities. None of the alternatives would reduce
or eliminate employment opportunities.
All of the alternatives would include management actions that encourage continued use of
Contra Loma’s recreational facilities by low-income groups (e.g., low-income youth swimming
programs), thereby benefiting low-income individuals.

Background Information

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is preparing a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for
the Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area (Contra Loma) located in Antioch, Contra Costa
County, California (Figure 1-1). The RMP is being developed in accordance with Reclamation’s
2003 Resource Management Plan Guidebook, Planning for the Future, and is based on a
comprehensive inventory of environmental resources and facilities as well as input from the East
Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD), the City of Antioch (City), the Contra Costa Water District
(CCWD), and the public. The Contra Loma RMP is a long-term plan to guide management of the
resources on the Federal lands within the reservoir and recreation areas. The primary emphasis of
the RMP is to protect the water supply and quality of Contra Loma Reservoir while balancing the
management of natural and cultural resources with enhancements to recreational uses within
Contra Loma.
In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA; PL 91190, 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347), and in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (40
Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1500-1508) and U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI; 43
CFR Part 46) regulations for implementing NEPA, Reclamation has prepared an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate and disclose the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative
environmental effects of implementing the Contra Loma RMP. Because of the similarities
between the requirements for an RMP and an EIS, Reclamation has decided to combine the RMP
and EIS into a single document, hereafter referred to as the RMP/EIS.

1.2

Overview and History of Contra Loma Reservoir and
Recreation Area

Contra Loma consists of the 80-acre Contra Loma Reservoir and approximately 661 acres of
surrounding land, including the Contra Loma Regional Park (Regional Park; Figure 1-2) and the
Antioch Community Park (Community Park; Figure 1-3). Contra Loma Reservoir was
constructed in 1967 as part of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and is managed by
Reclamation’s Mid-Pacific Region’s South-Central California Area Office. CCWD operates and
maintains the reservoir under contract with Reclamation. The reservoir receives and stores CVP
water from the Contra Costa Canal until it is released back to the canal via gravity flow.
The reservoir is primarily used as a regulating reservoir for peak or short-term municipal water
supplies for CCWD customers, for emergency storage, and as a backup water supply during
maintenance of upstream facilities. The recreation area was opened to the public in 1968 with
few developed recreational facilities.

Chapter 1. Introduction

On September 18, 1972, a management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD transferred
responsibility for land use management and development, construction, and maintenance of
public recreational facilities to EBRPD (Bureau of Reclamation 1972). EBRPD continues to
manage the recreational lands surrounding the reservoir.
In 1985, EBRPD transferred management of approximately 48 acres in the northwestern portion
of Contra Loma to the City under a Reclamation-approved license agreement that allowed for the
creation of the Community Park. The City is currently responsible for management and
maintenance of the Community Park. The license agreement was amended in 1990. The license
agreement was scheduled to expire in December 2010; however, Reclamation has authorized
extension of the license agreement.
The 1972 management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD and the license agreement
between EBRPD and the City were both scheduled to expire in December 2010. While the RMP
process is on-going, Reclamation issued EBRPD an extension of the management agreement.
EBRPD has expressed interest in renewing the management agreement with Reclamation. After
completion of the RMP process, Reclamation will negotiate a new long-term management
agreement with one or more local managing partner(s).

1.3

Purpose and Need

The Reclamation Recreation Management Act (RRMA) of 1992 (Public Law [PL] 102-575,
Title 28 [2805(c)(1)(A)]) directs Reclamation to “provide for the development, use,
conservation, enhancement, and management of resources on Reclamation lands.” An RMP is a
guide for future land resources management to ensure land and waters of the United States (U.S.)
are maintained and protected as provided for under the authorizing purposes over a given period
of time. The Contra Loma Regional Park Reservoir Area Management Plan (RAMP; East Bay
Regional Park District 1975a) currently guides EBRPD in administering, operating, planning,
and developing Contra Loma. The RAMP was prepared in 1975 and some features of the RAMP
are either outdated or no longer relevant. For example, the Community Park is now located
where the RAMP had envisioned a Day Camp recreation zone. Also, the RAMP’s Picnic
Meadow zone, located east of the reservoir, has not been developed. In addition, the types of
recreational facilities requested by the public (e.g., new multi-use sports fields) and the
infrastructure required to operate the recreation area have changed since the RAMP was
prepared. Finally, environmental conditions at the recreation area have changed since 1975.
These changes have created a need for Reclamation to compile a current inventory of Contra
Loma’s resources.
The Contra Loma RMP has a planning horizon of 25 years. The planning horizon will begin
when new management agreement(s) are reached between Reclamation and local managing
partner(s). The RMP is needed to provide management guidance to Reclamation and local
managing partner(s) in order to ensure effective protection and management of Contra Loma’s
resources, particularly the reservoir. The RMP will also provide guidance on the allowed uses
and desired future conditions at Contra Loma and establish the framework for new management
agreement(s).

1-5 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

The purpose of the RMP is to establish updated management objectives, goals, and actions
consistent with the authorized purposes of the lands associated with Contra Loma Reservoir. The
RMP shall be implemented by Reclamation, either directly or through its management
agreement(s) that would:
•

establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote organized use,
development, and management of recreation area lands in a way that is compatible with
applicable Federal and state laws;

•

protect the water supply and quality of Contra Loma Reservoir;

•

manage natural and cultural resources in and around the reservoir in a way that is
consistent with Federal law and Reclamation policies;

•

provide additional recreational opportunities and facilities requested by the public; and

•

provide guidance for future decision making.

1.4

Project Authority

The authority to establish and implement the Contra Loma RMP rests in a series of Federal
legislation and guidance. The key Federal authorities are identified in this section. Additional
information about the Federal regulations, laws, and planning policies relevant to each
environmental topic is provided in Appendix C.
Reclamation’s authority to operate water projects is vested in the authority of the Reclamation
Act of 1902 (Chapter 1093, 32 Stat. 388) and the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (Chapter 418,
53 Stat. 1187).
Reclamation’s authority to prepare RMPs is derived from the authority of the Reclamation Act of
1902; the Reclamation Project Act of 1939; the Federal Water Project Recreation Act (PL 89-72,
79 Stat. 213); and, more specifically, the RRMA. Water or power operations or water service
contracts are outside the scope of an RMP and either have been or would be covered under
separate actions and environmental review. Contra Loma Reservoir is operated as a component
of the CVP. Management of the land surrounding the reservoir is secondary to operation of the
CVP and is required to support Reclamation’s core mission of managing, developing, and
protecting water and related resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner.
The Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965, PL 89-72, as amended, was enacted in part to
help Reclamation utilize non-Federal public entities in managing Federal land and to provide a
means for cost-sharing assistance with non-Federal managing partners for planning, constructing,
and managing recreation facilities, opportunities, and programs.
The Reclamation Manual Directives and Standards (RCD TRMR-15) is a series of Policies,
Directives, and Standards and Delegations of Authority that collectively assign program

Existing Regulatory and Management Guidance

Currently, management guidance for Contra Loma is derived from Federal, State, and local laws,
regulations, policies, and planning documents. A complete list of Federal regulations applicable
to the RMP is found in Appendix C. The primary land use and management documents currently
applicable to Contra Loma are as follows:
•

Reclamation Manual – The Reclamation Manual (RCD TRMR-15) consists of a series
of Policies, Directives, and Standards and Delegations of Authority, which collectively
assign program responsibility and authority and document Reclamation-wide methods of
carrying out its responsibilities. All requirements in the Reclamation Manual are
mandatory and constitute official Reclamation management direction. The Reclamation
Manual also serves as a link to Reclamation’s supplements to the DOI and governmentwide regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

•

Management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD – The management
agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD (Bureau of Reclamation 1972) transfers
responsibility from Reclamation to EBRPD for development, construction,
administration, operation, and maintenance of public recreation, recreation facilities, and
other purposes within Contra Loma, including the water surface area of the reservoir. The
management agreement was amended in 1977, 1981, and 1989. While the RMP process
is on-going, Reclamation issued EBRPD an extension of the management agreement.

•

Master Plan – EBRPD’s Master Plan 2013 (East Bay Regional Park District 2013)
defines EBRPD’s vision, mission, and priorities for the future. The Master Plan
establishes policies for conserving natural and cultural resources; providing recreational
opportunities; and balancing the distribution, acquisition, protection, restoration,
management, and development of the regional parks. It also describes the future physical
growth and expansion of EBRPD.

•

Contra Loma Regional Park Reservoir Area Management Plan – The RAMP (East
Bay Regional Park District 1975a) is designed to guide EBRPD in administering,
operating, planning, and developing Contra Loma. The RAMP was prepared in
accordance with the 1972 management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD.

•

Contra Loma Regional Park Land Use-Development Plan – The purpose of the Land
Use-Development Plan (LUDP; East Bay Regional Park District 1975b) is to direct future
park development by outlining expected levels of use and development, delineating
general park character, planning access and circulation, and locating areas of preserves
and recreational development.

•

City of Antioch General Plan – The City’s General Plan (City of Antioch 2003) is a
comprehensive strategy for achieving the community’s goals and enhancing the quality
of life for the City’s residents. As the City’s lead policy document, the General Plan

1-8 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 1. Introduction

outlines how the City will manage its future and how the City expects to coordinate its
activities with those of other agencies. Planning directives are provided in the form of
goals, objectives, and policies.

1.7

Public Involvement

Public involvement is a critical element in developing the RMP. Reclamation’s goal is to gain
input from a cross section of the user public and stakeholders, including the current local
managing partners. Reclamation held a public scoping meeting and two public workshops in
2010 and 2011 to solicit issues and concerns and to develop alternatives to be analyzed in the
RMP. In addition, Reclamation developed a mailing list (and accompanying database), produced
and distributed newsletters, and provided notices and project updates on Reclamation’s Contra
Loma RMP/EIS website and the EBRPD website.
A Notice of Intent to prepare the RMP/EIS was published in the Federal Register on November
12, 2009. Reclamation held a scoping meeting for the Contra Loma RMP/EIS on February 8,
2010, at the Nick Rodriguez Community Center in Antioch. Reclamation held a public workshop
on August 4, 2010, at Sutter Elementary School in Antioch to seek ideas, concerns, and
comments to inform development of the RMP/EIS. Reclamation also solicited written scoping
comments between February 8 and 22, 2010, and solicited written comments from August 4
through 31, 2010. On March 3, 2011, Reclamation held a public workshop at Prewett Family
Park & Community Center in Antioch to solicit comments on the conceptual draft packages of
RMP actions and alternatives.
Attendance at the three public meetings/workshops totaled 59 participants: 20 people attended
the scoping meeting, 26 attended the August 4, 2010 workshop, and 13 people attended the
March 3, 2011 workshop. Some participants attended more than one meeting or workshop. Some
attendees at the scoping meeting and the March 3, 2011 workshop provided verbal comments,
which were recorded by hand and are summarized in Appendix D. Written comments were
received from the following public agencies and elected officials:
•

The Office of U.S. Congressman John Garamendi

•

The Office of Contra Costa County (County) Supervisor Federal D. Glover

•

EBRPD

•

CCWD

•

As described above, Reclamation prepared an Issues and Opportunities Report (Appendix A)
which provided an overview of the facilities and the natural and cultural resources to be
addressed in the RMP/EIS. The report also identified potential issues, constraints, and
opportunities relating to management of these resources and summarized input provided to
Reclamation by the current local managing partners, stakeholders, and the public early in the
RMP/EIS development process on topics and issues of concern.
In addition, Reclamation drafted planning criteria that helped establish the sideboards and
parameters for development of the RMP/EIS and helped highlight major areas of concern and
management objectives for the RMP. From this, Reclamation drafted three conceptual RMP
alternatives. Reclamation then sought technical comments from EBRPD, the City, and CCWD
(i.e., the current managing partners) on the draft planning criteria, draft management objectives,
draft goals, and the conceptual draft alternatives before presenting them to the public at a
workshop in March 2011. After receiving comments from the managing partners and the public,
Reclamation developed the draft alternatives in more detail. The conceptual draft alternatives are
attached to this EIS as Appendix E.
These initial documents assisted Reclamation in identifying issues of concern and developing the
Draft RMP/EIS.

1.9

Programmatic Environmental Impact Analysis

RMPs are programmatic, planning-level documents that provide management direction at a
broad scale and are not intended to provide project-level detail of future management actions or
projects. For this reason, the EIS evaluates the environmental impacts of each RMP alternative in
a programmatic manner. Any future actions carried out under the purview of the RMP beyond

the programmatic analysis presented in the EIS would be subject to project-level NEPA analysis
and compliance.

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and
Alternatives
As described in the RMP Guidebook (Bureau of Reclamation 2003), an RMP is a document that
provides management direction consistent with authorized Reclamation project purposes while
recognizing the rights and interests of existing contracts, legislation, and other entities for an
identified land area that is under the jurisdiction of Reclamation. An RMP identifies measures
necessary to achieve a desired future condition of the resources within a management unit
covered by the RMP. Management direction is set forth in the form of goals and objectives that
provide overall guidance for the RMP to be implemented by Reclamation, either directly or
through its management agreement(s). The management direction can be general in nature
covering the entire management unit (area wide), or unique to a portion of the management unit
(site specific).

2.1

Section Organization

This chapter first describes the planning process and planning influences that led to the
formulation of alternatives for the Contra Loma RMP. Then the No Action Alternative and two
action alternatives developed for this RMP are identified and described (Sections 2.6 through
2.8).
The planning process for the Contra Loma RMP involves the integration of issues, opportunities
and constraints, management actions, and management zones. As discussed in Chapter 1, the
RMP follows the guidance of Federal planning mandates by considering management actions
that balance recreation opportunities with natural and cultural resource stewardship. These
planning process elements are discussed in Section 2.2.
The goals identified in Section 2.3 will provide overall guidance for the RMP management
direction and actions. A variety of planning influences were considered in the planning process
that lead to the formulation of alternatives. These influences include public input (addressed in
Section 1.7), opportunities and constraints (addressed in Section 2.2.3), and the roles of
Reclamation and the managing partner(s) (addressed in Section 2.4.3). The management actions
common to all the RMP alternatives are described in Section 2.5 and the three RMP alternatives
are described in Sections 2.6 through 2.8.

2.2

Planning Process

The following are the basic elements of the RMP planning process:
•

define the overall goals and objectives,

•

describe the resource categories that group the issues,
2-1 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

identify the issues, opportunities, and constraints,

•

determine management actions to address the issues, and

•

define the management zones for Contra Loma.

More specifically, the development of the RMP alternatives followed the RMP planning process
steps outlined in Reclamation’s RMP Guidebook. The steps in this process are described below.
•

Step 1: Identify Issues. This step involved the identification of various resource and
management issues at Contra Loma. These issues might involve resource problems
needing corrections or adjustment or resources needing special protection. Management
issues might also include unrealized opportunities, unresolved conflicts or problems, or
development of new programs to address changing regulations or values that may be
impaired.

•

Step 2: Identify Opportunities and Constraints. This step involved the identification of
opportunities and constraints at Contra Loma. Opportunities can include resources,
programs, and management frameworks that can facilitate the implementation of the
RMP. Constraints can include laws, regulations, budgets, staffing, and environmental
limitations. Reclamation conducted a public involvement program early in the Contra
Loma RMP planning process to seek input from the public, EBRPD, the City, CCWD,
and resource agencies about issues, opportunities, and constraints.

•

Step 3: Develop RMP Goals. Reclamation developed RMP goals based on the issues
identified in Step 1 and in consideration of the purpose of an RMP. These goals represent
broad statements that provide overall guidance to the management direction and actions
in the RMP alternatives. The management direction embodies an overall approach or
strategy for managing resources and recreation.

•

Step 4: Planning Criteria. Reclamation developed planning criteria, which are short and
concise statements that establish the “sideboards” and parameters for the development of
the RMP alternatives. These planning principals were then used in formulating and
selecting management actions to be considered in the RMP alternatives.

•

Step 5: Gather and Analyze Resource Information. In this step, Reclamation collected
information about the physical, biological, and cultural resources of the Federal property.
In addition, information about the recreation and land use was also gathered. These data
were compiled into a Geographic Information System (GIS) to facilitate a display and
analysis of multidisciplinary considerations. This step involved literature review, field
studies, and coordination with EBRPD, City, and CCWD staff.

•

Step 6: Formulate RMP Alternatives. This step involved the formulation of multiple
RMP alternatives. Three alternatives were developed that provide a range of varying
degrees of resource protection and recreational opportunities. The alternatives were
designed to meet the overall RMP goals, although the extent to which they meet each
goal varies.

2-2 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

•

Step 7: Conduct Environmental Impact Assessment. Adoption of an RMP represents a
Federal discretionary action subject to NEPA’s environmental review requirements.
Under this step, Reclamation evaluates the environmental impacts of the RMP
alternatives in a comparative manner. The results provide the basis for Reclamation to
identify tradeoffs amongst various environmental resources, and between recreation and
environmental resources.

•

Step 8: Issue Draft RMP and EIS for Public Review. Reclamation is currently in this
step of the planning process. This Draft RMP/EIS is being circulated to the public to
provide an opportunity to review the Draft RMP alternatives, including a comparison of
how well they meet the RMP goals and their environmental impacts.

•

Step 9: Prepare Final RMP and EIS. After a review and consideration of public
comments, Reclamation will prepare a Final RMP/EIS that addresses any comments
received on the RMP/EIS and identify Reclamation’s Preferred Alternative. The Final
RMP/EIS will be circulated to the public for 30-days.

•

Step 10: Prepare Record of Decision. A Record of Decision will also be prepared
based on the Final EIS that identifies Reclamation’s decision regarding the RMP and the
basis for that decision.

•

Step 11: Implement the RMP. This step involves implementing the RMP actions in
accordance with the guidance described in the RMP. Implementing the actions identified
in the RMP will be the responsibility of the local managing partner(s), although actions
not covered in the RMP/EIS will require Reclamation approval and additional
environmental review.

2.2.1

Primary Issue Areas

Reclamation conducted public outreach in 2010 and 2011 to explain the scope and objectives of
the Contra Loma RMP and to encourage comments from the public and stakeholders, including
EBRPD, the City, and CCWD, about the issues that should be addressed in the RMP and
evaluated in the EIS. During that time, Reclamation held a public scoping meeting, two public
workshops, and solicited written public and stakeholder comments as described in Section 1.7.
Based on the comments received and its own review of the issues, Reclamation identified the
following primary issue areas to be addressed in the RMP:
•

Recreational facilities and opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park

•

Infrastructure and administrative facilities at Contra Loma Regional Park

•

Facility management at Contra Loma Regional Park

•

Recreational facilities and opportunities at the Community Park

•

Facility management at the Community Park

•

Reservoir management and reservoir water quality

•

Pasture vegetation management at the Regional Park

alternative must be consistent with all of the following planning criteria:
•

Protect the water supply and water quality of the reservoir.

•

Protect and enhance natural resources.

•

Manage cultural resources.

•

Recognize community concerns and values about Contra Loma.

•

Encourage a range of recreational uses that accommodate public demand within the
parameters of the Water and Land Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (WALROS) setting.

•

Ensure compliance with Federal policies, laws, and regulations.

2-4 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

•

Protect public health and safety.

•

Limit alternatives to those with reasonable certainty that:
− the management actions can be implemented within the 25-year planning period;
− Reclamation or managing partner(s) can fund the management actions; and
− Reclamation or managing partner(s) are committed to seeking financial, program, and
staffing resources necessary to implement the management actions.

2.2.3

Opportunities and Constraints

During the planning process, Reclamation identified potential resource management
opportunities and constraints for resolving the operational, natural resources management, land
use, cultural, recreational, and socioeconomic issues that fall under the primary issue areas listed
in Section 2.2.1 above.
Opportunities

The primary opportunities at Contra Loma include the following:
•

Available space could be used to expand recreational and administrative facilities in the
vicinity of the reservoir.

•

Existing sports fields, including the two soccer fields, could be reconfigured to
accommodate additional types of sports.

•

Relatively underutilized shoreline area.

•

Availability of fishing stocks

•

Fish habitat could be created or modified.

•

Availability of existing utility services at park boundary.

•

The expansive natural areas might be suitable for additional quail habitat restoration.

•

Opportunities for interpretation and education.

•

Natural resources such as plants of importance to local Native American groups could be
promoted as areas of interest to the general public through the use of signs, or could be
protected and made available for practitioners of traditional tribal practices.

Constraints

The primary constraints at Contra Loma include the following:
•

Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, WALROS settings and local
zoning.

2-5 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

Compliance with existing contracts/agreements with CCWD about reservoir operations.

•

Protection and maintenance of the water quality of the reservoir.

•

Protection of the reservoir’s water supply function.

•

Avoidance/protection of special-status species.

•

Avoidance/protection of existing California quail habitat enhancement and restoration
projects.

•

Avoidance/protection of wetland and riparian habitat.

•

Steep slopes across much of the recreation area that inhibit construction of structures and
roads.

•

Clay soils having high degrees of shrink-swell that can be susceptible to erosion and
slumping.

•

Clay soils that have high runoff potential.

•

Lighting, noise, traffic, and parking compatibility with nearby land uses.

•

Consistency with the rural open space character of a regional park.

•

Management of cultural resources.

•

Funding availability for implementing management actions by local managing partner(s).

•

Potential language barriers to non-English speaking park users.

2.2.4

Management Zones

Reclamation uses WALROS as a management tool for classifying water and land use zones in
terms of recreational experience. In 2009, the WALROS system replaced its predecessor, the
Water Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (WROS), which placed more emphasis on water-based
recreation than land-based recreation. The WALROS system is discussed in more detail in
Section 3.2 (Recreation).
Two distinct management zones based on the WROS system have been identified for Contra
Loma Reservoir. The southern half of the reservoir is classified as Suburban (S) and the northern
half of the reservoir is classified as Rural Developed (RD) (Figure 1-2). These zones are similar,
though not identical, to the S and RD zones under the WALROS system. None of the RMP
alternatives include adjustments to the WROS classification zones. Therefore, the management
actions proposed for the RMP alternatives are intended to be consistent with the existing WROS
classifications.

2.3

Goals

Reclamation has developed the following primary goals of the Contra Loma RMP to provide
overall guidance for the RMP management direction and actions. The degree to which the RMP
alternatives meet these goals are described in Sections 2.6 through 2.8 below.
•

Promote responsible stewardship of Federal land and water resources for the public
benefit.

•

Protect and maintain water quality.

•

Protect and enhance the natural resources at Contra Loma.

•

Manage the cultural resources at Contra Loma.

•

Protect public health and safety

•

Protect and maintain existing recreational uses and educational opportunities.

•

Provide for enhanced or new recreational uses and facilities that are compatible with
other RMP goals.

•

Maintain the social and natural setting of Contra Loma as described in the WALROS.

•

Promote continued compatibility with nearby land uses.

2.4

Formulation of Alternatives

2.4.1

Introduction

2.4.2

Alternatives Development

This section briefly describes the RMP alternatives designed to address the planning issues,
opportunities, and constraints at Contra Loma and Reclamation’s process for identifying the
alternatives. This section also describes the roles of Reclamation and the local managing
partner(s), and describes Reclamation’s approach for implementing and amending the RMP after
its adoption.
Reclamation’s first step in developing the RMP alternatives included public outreach to seek the
opinions of the public and the current local managing partners about Contra Loma’s existing
recreational uses and facilities and to identify possible management actions and opportunities to
improve the management of resources at Contra Loma. After considering the input received,
Reclamation began developing management actions and screening them against the RMP goals
and planning criteria to ensure consistency. Reclamation then grouped the management actions
into sets that represent a range of alternatives that address the varied interests pertaining to
Contra Loma. Reclamation then circulated the conceptual draft alternatives to the public for
review and comment. The process resulted in the development of the following three
alternatives:

2-7 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

No Action (Alternative 1 – Status Quo) This alternative manages land and activities
with the continuation of current management practice.

•

Enhanced Recreation and Facilities (Alternative 2) This alternative enhances
recreation opportunities and existing facilities, but limits expansion of recreation and
facilities to minimize changes to park character and adverse effects on natural resources.

•

Expanded Recreation and Facilities (Alternative 3) This alternative emphasizes
expanded recreation opportunities and facilities.

2.4.3

Roles of Reclamation and Local Managing Partner(s)

Reclamation intends to negotiate a long-term agreement with one or more local managing
partner(s) for Contra Loma. The local managing partner(s) will have overall responsibility for
managing, operating, and maintaining public access, recreation, infrastructure, public services
(including public safety and law enforcement), and natural resources in Contra Loma, excluding
the dam. Responsibilities for dam and reservoir operations are subject to a separate contract
between Reclamation and CCWD; therefore, these operations would not be affected by the RMP.
The RMP will provide the overall resource and recreation management direction and framework
for Contra Loma. It will be a guidance document for the local managing partner(s) for day-to-day
operations and long-range planning.
Reclamation will have overall responsibility for ensuring that all actions in Contra Loma by
Reclamation and its managing partner(s) are consistent with the RMP. The managing partner(s)
must ensure that its actions in managing Contra Loma and associated land and natural resources,
recreation facilities, and infrastructure, are consistent with the RMP.
The agreement with the managing partner(s) will require them to use the RMP as the primary
land use, natural resource, recreation, and facility management guidance document to be
followed during the management of Contra Loma. A long term management agreement will
recognize the RMP as a document that can effectively assist Reclamation and the managing
partner(s) in planning, decision-making, and implementing actions and activities affecting the
resources in Contra Loma. The purpose of the RMP is to chart the desired future condition for
the area in question. The RMP will be implemented through recommendations for specific
management actions and improvement projects.
If an agreement cannot be reached with any managing partner(s), Reclamation will manage
Contra Loma and its associated land and natural resources, recreation facilities, and
infrastructure in a manner consistent with the RMP.
Management Actions and Projects

The RMP includes recommendations for various resource management actions and facility
improvement projects. These are specific actions that may be implemented at Contra Loma to
meet the RMP goals. These management actions and projects are defined at a conceptual or
programmatic level in the RMP. More detailed descriptions of the actions and projects will be
developed during the planning horizon of the RMP. The responsibility for funding, designing,
and implementing (or constructing) the management actions and improvement projects will be
specified in financial assistance agreements with the local managing partner(s).

2-8 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

It should be noted that the RMP will require the local managing partner(s) to implement some of
the management actions, but not all of the actions. Required management actions are indicated
by the term “will,” whereas optional management actions are indicated by the term “may.” The
local managing partner(s) will have the option of implementing the optional management actions
and improvements based on considerations of the following factors: (1) sufficient public
demand, (2) sufficient staffing and funding to manage any new or modified facilities in
accordance with the RMP, and (3) potential for increased public benefits and use. New facilities
or activities allowed under the RMP may also be discontinued in the future at the discretion of
the local managing partner(s) if demand decreases, the activity is not economically viable, new
security or safety considerations arise, and/or unforeseen significant environmental impacts
occur that are irreparable or cannot be effectively mitigated.
Should the local managing partner(s) choose to implement management actions that involve new
or expanded recreational activities or facilities identified in the RMP, such as new fishing docks
in the reservoir or new sewer lines to connect the Regional Park sanitary facilities to the City’s
wastewater treatment system, they would be required to conduct an appropriate site specific
environmental review. The local managing partner(s) would need to receive Reclamation
approval and project-specific environmental documentation would be prepared to meet NEPA
and other Federal environmental requirements. In addition, local managing partner(s) will need
to satisfy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements.
Amendments to the RMP

The RMP can be amended by Reclamation, or by the managing partner(s) with Reclamation’s
approval, if the need arises. Conditions that may require an amendment could include, but are not
limited to, (1) changed environmental conditions; (2) unforeseen events; (3) changes in policies
and land use plans that have been determined to be infeasible, impractical, or have undesirable
consequences; (4) change in applicable laws and regulations; (5) changes in visitor needs or
demands, including recreation; (6) changes needed to accommodate operation and management
of the reservoir; or (7) changes to accommodate projects or activities that were not included in
the RMP, provided they meet the RMP planning criteria. Reclamation would initiate the RMP
amendment process, which would include appropriate NEPA environmental review tiered from
this EIS and may include public meetings if warranted.
2.4.4

Concurrent Projects by the Current Local Managing Partners

During the course of the Contra Loma RMP process, Reclamation received proposals from the
current local managing partners for improvements within the Regional and Community Park.
In September 2012, Reclamation completed an Environmental Assessment for the City’s
proposed modernizations of the two multi-use sports fields in the eastern portion of the
Community Park, identified as sports fields 4 and 5 on Figure 1-3. Reclamation subsequently
approved the project. The improvements include removing the grass from the surface of the
sports fields, constructing the base for the new synthetic turf fields, and installing furnishings,
perimeter fencing, concrete paving, an electrical/storage building, sports field lighting, perimeter
irrigation and landscaping, drainage structures, pavement, and new synthetic turf. The City has
undertaken these improvements. This project is not proposed in the RMP and is, therefore, not
evaluated in the EIS as such. Rather, this project is considered in the cumulative impacts analysis
as an action with the potential to cumulatively affect the resources discussed in this EIS.
2-9 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

In September 2013, EBRPD requested funding and approval from Reclamation for upgrades to
the restroom and fish cleaning facility located in the boat launch marina. Reclamation is
currently preparing site-specific environmental documentation for this proposal. EBRPD is also
seeking grant funding from the California Department of Boating and Waterways to implement
several additional improvements to the Regional Park’s boat launch area and fishing docks (see
Figure 1-2). The proposed improvements include reconfiguring and repaving the boat launch
parking lot, reconstructing the boat ramp, replacing the existing boat dock with a new articulated
dock, building a new Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-compliant picnic site near the boat
launch, rehabilitating the existing ADA-compliant fishing pier, rehabilitating the existing west
side fishing pier, building a new east side fishing pier and restroom with ADA-compliant
parking, installing concrete trails around the boat launch area, replacing the existing drinking
fountains, and installing additional landscaping. Some of the new or rehabilitated docks would
require new pilings. Management Action 44 would allow for these improvements. At this time,
Reclamation has not received a request for approval of these additional improvements. Should a
request be received, Reclamation would conduct site-specific environmental analysis prior to
approval.

2.5

Common Management Actions for All Alternatives

Each alternative has different components and management actions that would achieve the
objectives of that alternative. However, several components and management actions are
common to all alternatives. These are consistent with the current resource and recreation
management direction and practices at Contra Loma and are listed in this section. The remaining
management actions are listed as they apply to each alternative in Section 2.6 through 2.8.
2.5.1

Facilities Management at Contra Loma Regional Park

Litter and Waste

MA 1:

The local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park will continue
implementing a litter and waste reduction program to effectively meet
demand. Elements of this program will include staff outreach and public
education, routine litter and nuisance pickup and removal, litter removal
along the shoreline and within the reservoir, and availability of sufficient
litter cans and dog feces bag stations. The program may also include
organization of local volunteers to assist in cleanup. Elements of this
program may be modified or expanded as necessary.

Other Facility Management

MA 2:

The local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park will perform ongoing
routine maintenance activities and repairs of the existing facilities that
would not involve ground-disturbance or otherwise have the potential to
cause significant environmental effects. These are the same activities that

2.5.2

The local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park will prepare a
hazardous waste/spill prevention plan. The plan will comply with
Reclamation Manual directives, standards, and policies and will require
Reclamation approval before implementation.

Facilities Management at Antioch Community Park

Litter, Waste, and Graffiti

MA 9:

The local managing partners(s) for the Community Park will implement a
litter, waste, and graffiti reduction program to effectively meet demand.
Elements of this program may include staff outreach and public education,
routine litter pickup and removal, availability of sufficient litter cans and
dog feces bag stations, and prompt graffiti removal. The program may also
include organization of local volunteers to assist in cleanup. Elements of this
program may be modified or expanded as necessary.

Public Safety

MA 10: The local managing partners(s) for the Community Park may be required to
implement routine police patrols or other operational measures needed to
provide sufficient security.
MA 11: The local managing partners(s) for the Community Park will develop and
implement a plan(s) for fire and emergency preparedness and to provide
public safety with police and fire services. These services may be operated
by the local managing partners(s) or the services may be contracted with
other local agencies that provide police or fire services. The plan(s) will
comply with Reclamation Manual directives, standards, and policies and
will require Reclamation approval before implementation.

Other Facility Management

MA 12: The local managing partners(s) for the Community Park will perform
ongoing routine maintenance activities and repairs of the existing facilities
that would not involve ground-disturbance or otherwise have the potential to
cause significant environmental effects. These are the same activities that
have been and are being implemented by the City under its existing license
in addition to routine maintenance activities for the sports field
improvements performed in 2013. Examples of ongoing maintenance
activities include mowing, trimming, irrigation, aeration, fertilization, and
replacement of vegetation within the landscaped areas, cleanout and repair
of storm drain facilities, maintenance of sports fields and restrooms, pest
control (e.g., gophers, snails), painting, and damage repair. The local

managing partners(s) for the Community Park will prepare non-aquatic
pesticide management plans and integrated pest management plans for
weeds and other pests (e.g., rodents, wasps). The plans will be consistent
with those to be prepared for the Regional Park. The plan(s) will comply
with Reclamation Manual directives, standards, and policies and will require
Reclamation approval before implementation.
MA 13: The local managing partners(s) for the Community Park will be responsible
for performing management activities, such as regulation of park uses,
opening and closing park gates for daily operation, administration of
concession stands, issuance of permits for use of the group picnic area,
implementing a reservation system for use of the sports fields, and human
waste management.
MA 14: The local managing partners(s) for the Community Park will prepare a
hazardous waste/spill prevention plan. The plan will comply with
Reclamation Manual directives, standards, and policies and will require
Reclamation approval before implementation.
2.5.3

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park

Swim Lagoon

MA 15: The local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park will operate and
maintain the swim lagoon and all the associated facilities (e.g., ADAcompliant pool lift, showers, changing rooms etc.) for public recreation,
including the grass area adjacent to the lagoon and within the lagoon area
fence.

Fishing

MA 16: The local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park will provide a
recreational fishing program in the reservoir and to manage fish populations
through fish planting (i.e., stocking) programs. Management activities may
include monitoring of fish populations and provision of educational
information to the public. Management activities may also include catchand-release practices for certain fish species, tracking of stocking rates and
angler permit sales, periodic evaluation and adjustment of stocking rates to
maximize angler success and experience, and restrictions on the use of
certain live baits.

MA 17: The local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park will enforce State and
local fishing regulations in cooperation with the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife, including regulations prohibiting unauthorized fishing
(i.e., poaching).
Other Recreation

MA 18: Windsurfing and limited boating use will be allowed on the reservoir in a
manner that minimizes body contact with the reservoir to protect the

2-13 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

reservoir’s domestic water supply from pathogens such as Cryptosporidium.
Windsurfing and the use of self-bailing kayaks represent the only authorized
activities with the potential for limited or indirect body contact with the
reservoir. Water quality protection measures will include a requirement for
windsurfers and paddlers using self-bailing kayaks to shower before
entering the water and to wear wet suits while on the reservoir. Visitors may
use kayaks, canoes, and small boats (up to 17 feet) with electric motors only.
No gasoline-powered engines will be allowed on the reservoir in order to
protect water quality.
MA 19: The existing Regional Park trail system will be operated, managed, and
maintained for hiking, equestrian, and bicycle use. Trail maintenance
activities may include placing gravel and rocks on fire trails to maintain allweather access for emergency vehicles, annual grading of fire roads and
trails with machinery and hand tools to maintain the quality of the trail
surface and maintain proper drainage, trimming and mowing of vegetation
and spray application of herbicides to maintain a clear path for trail users,
and maintenance and repair of existing retaining walls and culverts, and
installation of wattles and straw netting to control erosion when needed.
MA 20: The Regional Park will provide opportunities for wildlife viewing,
photography, and painting.
MA 21: The Regional Park may continue to provide recreation programs such as
low-income youth swim programs, junior lifeguard programs, Girl Scout
and Boy Scout events, fishing derbies, outdoor and environmental education
experiences for children, cross-country running meets, fundraiser events,
youth day camps, and similar programs.
2.5.4

Natural Resource Management and Protection

MA 22: The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park may perform periodic
biological surveys to inventory and assess special-status plant and wildlife
species.
MA 23: The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park may develop programs
to protect special-status species likely to occur at the park. Such species may
include burrowing owl, loggerhead shrike, California tiger salamander, San
Joaquin kit fox, tri-colored blackbird, white-tailed kite, and stinkbells.
MA 24: All operations and maintenance activities will be consistent with Federal and
state laws and regulations that govern the protection of natural, cultural, and
paleontological resources within Contra Loma.

MA 25: All operations and maintenance activities within the Regional Park may
endeavor to be consistent with existing habitat restoration projects.

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

2.6

Management Actions for No Action Alternative (Alternative 1
- Status Quo)

2.6.1

Objective

2.6.2

Description

The objective of this alternative is to continue the current resource and recreation management
direction and practices at Contra Loma.
Under this alternative, the current resource and recreation management direction and practices at
Contra Loma would continue unchanged, and would be generally consistent with EBRPD’s
current RAMP (East Bay Regional Park District 1975a) the Contra Loma Regional Park LUDP
(East Bay Regional Park District 1975b), the current management agreement between
Reclamation and EBRPD, the license agreement between EBRPD and the City, and the EBRPD
land use plans pertaining to Contra Loma. Some features of the RAMP, however, would not be
implemented. For example, the Community Park is now located where the RAMP and LUDP
had envisioned a day camp recreation zone. Therefore, the Day Camp recreation zone would not
be implemented under the No Action Alternative. Also, the RAMP and LUDP had envisioned a
picnic meadow cluster to the east of the reservoir that has not yet been built and might not be
built under this alternative.
The local managing partner(s) would implement and manage the administrative and operational
activities listed in Section 2.5 and Appendix B. The managing partner(s) would implement many
of these activities, including those that may require permits or environmental review under
NEPA or CEQA or authorization by Reclamation or CCWD. This alternative addresses certain
public comments requesting no further substantive change in management direction or intensity
be made at Contra Loma. The No Action Alternative provides the appropriate basis by which all
other alternatives can be compared. It meets all the primary goals of the Contra Loma RMP
except for provision of enhanced or new recreational uses and facilities.

2.7

Management Actions for Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
(Alternative 2)

2.7.1

Objective

2.7.2

Description

The objective of this alternative is to enhance current recreational uses and facilities at Contra
Loma to fulfill the evolving needs of the public who recreate at Contra Loma and to implement
several basic infrastructure improvements while minimizing changes to Contra Loma’s
recreation setting and adverse effects on natural resources.
Under this alternative, the management direction would be shifted toward enhancement of
current recreational uses and facilities. This alternative includes management actions to enhance,
replace, or upgrade existing recreational uses and facilities and installation of new facilities to
expand or complement existing uses and facilities. Examples include upgrades to restrooms, the
swim lagoon, fishing piers, the trail system, the boat launch, and administrative buildings.
Examples also include new facilities such as additional restrooms, sewer lines, picnic sites,

2-15 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area

parking areas, and habitat restoration activities. Alternative 2 involves no major expansion of
recreational facilities. This alternative also includes boundary adjustments between the Regional
Park and the Community Park.
2.7.3

Management Actions

Infrastructure Improvements at Contra Loma Regional Park

Restrooms The restrooms at the Regional Park office and the restrooms and showers near the
swim lagoon are connected to the City’s sewer and wastewater treatment system. The remaining
restrooms are portable chemical toilets. According to EBRPD staff, the chemical toilets are not
sufficient for the current level of use. Under this alternative the portable restroom facilities
would be upgraded to permanent restrooms and additional restrooms would be built to
accommodate user demand.
MA 26: The existing portable chemical toilets may be replaced with permanent
restrooms served by vault systems, septic tanks that are periodically
pumped, or the City’s sewer system. Additional restrooms may be built to
accommodate existing and future user needs. New permanent restroom
facilities may be built near the fishing dock on the northwest shore of the
reservoir and near the parking lot on the east shore. All of the new restroom
facilities would be ADA-compliant. Leach fields will not be allowed.
MA 27: New or upgraded sewer lines may be built to connect future permanent
restrooms to the City’s sewer and wastewater system.
Buildings and Structures This alternative would allow for expansion or renovation of some
existing buildings and structures, and construction of new facilities for the purpose of improving
Regional Park operations. One new facility would be a residence for park staff to replace the
former park residence that was converted to a police substation for the current local managing
partner.
MA 28: The existing park offices, the police substation, the secondary storage yard,
and the buildings near the swim lagoon may be expanded or renovated to
better provide for public service and safety.
MA 29: Structures and facilities for classes, including swim and safety lessons, may
be built near the swim lagoon.
MA 30: A new park residence may be built near the park office to replace the former
park residence that was converted to a police substation for the current local
managing partner.
MA 31: The gravel/overflow parking area may be expanded and some existing
gravel parking areas may be paved.
MA 32: A fueling station and fuel storage tank may be built in or near the service
yard and materials storage area located 500 feet west of the park office. The
fueling station would be used for Regional Park vehicles and equipment and
2-16 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

for public safety officers. Only staff trained to safely use the station would
be allowed to operate it, thereby reducing the potential for spills caused by
improper use. This facility must be designed with fuel containment devices
to protect public health and safety and to prevent any spilled fuel from
reaching the natural ground surface (i.e., soil), entering the reservoir,
impairing surface water or groundwater quality, or creating an
environmental hazard. This facility must also be designed and operated in a
manner that minimizes its impact on air quality. This facility may only be
built and operated in compliance with applicable federal and federallymandated laws, regulations, and permits. As a condition of Reclamation’s
approval of this facility, the local managing partner(s) will ensure that fire,
public safety, spill prevention, and decommissioning plans are prepared or
amended to address operation and eventual decommissioning of this facility.
Other Infrastructure

This alternative would include other infrastructure improvements at the Regional Park.
MA 33: A radio communication tower may be built to improve communications for
the local managing partner(s) and public service providers. This tower must
be sited and designed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the Regional
Park’s aesthetic character.
MA 34: Water infrastructure (e.g., water lines, spigots, pumps, troughs) may be built
to support new, expanded, or renovated facilities and livestock grazing.
MA 35: A storm water retention basin may be built to improve the quality of water
carried by the Regional Park’s storm drain system before it reaches the
reservoir.
MA 36: Future improvements at the Regional Park must comply with ADA
accessibility requirements. The local managing partner(s) may implement an
ADA facility retrofit program that includes replacing, retrofitting, and
restructuring many of the park facilities to meet current ADA requirements.
Some improvements would include ground-disturbing activities, such as
installation of ADA-compliant water fountains, picnic facilities, and
restrooms.
MA 37: Call boxes and/or security cameras may be installed in the Regional Park if
needed for public safety and to protect Regional Park property.
MA 38: New donation boxes for walk-in users may be installed at key entry
locations.
Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park

Swim Lagoon This alternative would include some improvements and operational changes at
the swim lagoon to improve public safety and enjoyment.

2-17 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

MA 39: A “safe swim” area or splash pad may be built for small children and other
physical improvements could be made to the swim lagoon to accommodate
public needs. Expansion of the pumping and filtration facility may also be
required.
MA 40: More shade structures may be built on the swim lagoon lawn. The new
structures would likely be similar to the existing 15’x 15’ umbrella-shaped
structures that are cemented into the ground.
MA 41: Benches may be added to the swim lagoon area.
Fishing and Boating The reservoir currently has two fishing docks, one on the south shore and
one on the west shore. The fishing docks and the boat launch dock are nearing the end of their
designed lifecycle and require repair or reconstruction. The fishing docks float on the reservoir
and are unusable (and closed) during large reservoir drawdowns either because the access ramps
become too steep for safe passage or because the docks are resting directly on the sloped,
exposed lakebed. When the fishing docks are unusable some anglers choose to fish from the boat
launch dock, which can cause congestion on the boat dock and interfere with boater access. Also,
fishing from the boat dock could pose safety issues for boaters who are using the dock to launch
and are not paying attention to nearby anglers casting fish hooks and lures. This alternative
would enhance fishing access at the reservoir. Boating is also a popular activity. This alternative
includes several improvements at the boat launch area to enhance boating access.
MA 42: Existing fishing docks may be modified or reconstructed to allow safe,
continuous fishing use during reservoir drawdowns, and aging fishing docks
may be replaced.
MA 43: More fishing docks may be added if needed to accommodate increased
demand. Possible locations include the south shore near the boat launch and
the east shore which currently has no fishing docks.
MA 44: Several improvements may be implemented at the boat launch area to
enhance boating and fishing access. The improvements may include
reconfiguring and repaving the parking lot, reconstructing the boat ramp,
replacing the existing boat dock with a new articulated dock, building a new
ADA-compliant picnic site, rehabilitating the existing ADA-compliant
fishing pier, installing concrete trails, replacing the existing drinking
fountains, and installing additional landscaping. Some of the new or
rehabilitated docks may require new pilings.
MA 45: Fish stocking may be increased from current levels as needed to meet
demand.
Trail System The trail system within the Regional Park includes about 0.75 mile of paved trails
along the east and south shores of the reservoir and the trails across the dam and along the west
shore have a gravel surface. This alternative would include paving the gravel sections of the
shoreline trail system to provide all-season surfaces along the entire loop. This alternative would
also enhance signage along the trail system.
2-18 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

MA 46: Unpaved portions of the East Shore Trail, the West Shore Trail, and the trail
across the dam may be improved to provide paved surfaces along the entire
shoreline loop.
MA 47: Additional signs may be posted along the trail system that provide trail
names, distances, and direction information.
Other Recreation Many individual and group picnic sites are located along the south shore of
the reservoir. All sites include picnic tables and trash cans, and some sites include barbeque grills
and water faucets. The picnic sites are very popular on summer and holiday weekends. This
alternative would provide additional picnic sites as needed.
MA 48: Additional picnic sites may be constructed where useful and appropriate to
meet demand. Potential locations include the south shore of the reservoir
where most day use occurs and the east shore, which has parking lots and
restrooms but no picnic sites. Additional turf may also be planted if
sufficient irrigation water is available.
Placement of New Permanent Facilities

CCWD has expressed interest in a future increase of the reservoir operating level from the
current level of 205 feet to the spillway elevation of 211 feet. Some Regional Park facilities are
currently located between the 205-foot elevation and the 211-foot elevation. This alternative
would include a management action encouraging the managing partner for the Regional Park to
minimize the placement of new facilities below the 211 elevation to avoid having to replace such
facilities should Reclamation authorize a higher reservoir operating level in the future.
MA 49:

The managing partner for the Regional Park is encouraged to minimize
placement of new facilities below the 211 elevation (i.e., the spillway elevation)
within the watershed of the reservoir to avoid having to replace such facilities
should Reclamation authorize a higher reservoir operating level in the future.

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Antioch Community Park

Sports Fields The Community Park has five sports fields, as shown on Figure 1-3. The three
multi-use sports fields in the western half of the park are used for softball, baseball, football,
soccer, and kickball. The southernmost of these fields (labeled as sports field 3 on Figure 1-3) is
located adjacent to an intermittent stream and riparian zone. Some members of the public have
stated that the field sometimes develops wet, saturated surface conditions that inhibit its utility.
This alternative would improve the drainage of sports field 3, if necessary, to enhance its utility
during wet conditions.
MA 50: Drainage for the southernmost sports field in the western half of the
Community Park (sports field 3 on Figure 1-3) may be improved in a
manner that increases its utility during wet conditions but that minimizes
effects on the adjacent riparian habitat caused by placement of fill, removal
of vegetation, transport of chemicals and fertilizers, or changes in
hydrology.

2-19 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Boundary Adjustments between Contra Loma Regional Park and Antioch Community
Park

The boundary line between the Regional Park and the Community Park would be adjusted to
improve land and resource management by the local managing partner(s). Under this alternative,
an 8.4-acre portion of the Community Park would be managed as part of the Regional Park. This
area is located in the southwest corner of the Community Park, near the reservoir and the
Regional Park’s recreational facilities (Figure 2-1). This area supports a large stand of valley
foothill riparian habitat but includes no recreational facilities. Due to its lack of recreational
facilities and its proximity to the Regional Park, this land is better suited for inclusion in the
Regional Park.
In addition, 6.6 acres of land at the northeast corner of the Regional Park would no longer be
included in the Regional Park (Figure 2-1). A 2.7-acre portion of this land is owned by the U.S.
Government and is part of Contra Loma. Due to its distance from the Regional Park’s office and
recreational facilities, this land is better suited for inclusion in the Community Park than the
Regional Park. Therefore, this area would be managed as part of the Community Park instead of
the Regional Park. The remaining 3.9 acres of this land is owned by the City and had previously
been leased to EBRPD by the City for Regional Park use. Because this 3.9-acre parcel is owned
by the City, it is not part of Contra Loma and is not subject to this RMP. The City has the
discretion to decide whether to manage its 3.9-acre parcel as part of the Community Park.
MA 51: The boundary line between the Regional Park and the Community Park may
be adjusted as shown in Figure 2-1. Approximately 8.4 acres of land in the
southwest corner of the Community Park may be managed as part of the
Regional Park. This area is currently fenced on the south, east, and west
sides. The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park may install
exclusionary fencing along the north side of this 8.4-acre area to protect the
riparian habitat within the area from inadvertent trampling by the public.
The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park may also begin grazing
livestock on approximately 3 acres of annual grassland in this area for fire
suppression after receiving Reclamation’s approval of a grazing
management plan. If livestock are grazed in this area, the local managing
partner(s) for the Regional Park would install and maintain exclusionary
fencing around the riparian habitat and a protective buffer of annual
grassland. In addition, 2.7 acres of land in the northeast corner of Contra
Loma may be managed as part of the Community Park instead of the
Regional Park (Figure 2-1). This area would no longer be grazed if included
in the Community Park.
Natural Resource Management and Protection

MA 52: The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park may continue to
implement habitat restoration and improvement activities such as quail
habitat enhancement projects and installation of bat houses and avian nest
boxes. The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park will monitor
avian boxes to ensure that the boxes do not enable the spread of exotic
invasive avian species such as starlings.

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

MA 53: All future improvements should be consistent with laws and regulations that
govern the protection of natural, cultural, and paleontological resources
within Contra Loma.
MA 54: All future improvements within the Regional Park will be consistent with
future habitat restoration projects.
MA 55: When specific construction activities are proposed, the local managing
partner(s) will conduct a focused assessment of the activity’s impact on
water quality. If required by Federal regulations, the local managing
partner(s) proposing a construction activity will submit a plan that identifies
the sources of sediment and other pollutants on site and ensures the
reduction of such pollutants in stormwater discharged from the construction
site. The plan will provide descriptions of best management practices
(BMPs) selected to control erosion, sediment discharge, turbidity, and other
pollutant sources during construction. If needed, appropriate BMPs would
be implemented prior to construction and would be continued through the
duration of construction activities. The plan may include the following
methods for protecting water quality:
•

Limit site disturbance such as clearing, grubbing, and grading to between April
15 and October 15, unless special authorization is provided by Reclamation.

•

Prohibit heavy construction equipment from operating within 100 feet of the
reservoir or any creek during periods when soils are saturated from rain.

•

Implement temporary measures for controlling seasonal runoff and stormwater
flows from the construction area, including all staging areas and any other area
where site disturbance will occur during construction.

•

Use temporary erosion control measures (such as silt fences, staked straw bales,
and temporary revegetation) in disturbed areas, and ensure no disturbed surfaces
are left without erosion control measures in place during the rainy season.

•

Retain sediment on site by a system of sediment basins, traps, or other
appropriate measures.

•

Develop a spill prevention and countermeasure plan to identify proper storage,
collection, and disposal measures for potential pollutants (such as fuel,
fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) used on site.

•

Implement soil conservation practices to reduce erosion from storm water
runoff, and retain existing vegetation where possible.

•

Control surface water runoff by directing flowing water away from surface
waters and by reducing runoff velocity.

2-23 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

Store and treat topsoil removed during construction as an important resource,
and place berms around topsoil stockpiles to prevent runoff during storm events.

•

Establish fuel and vehicle maintenance areas away from all surface water
features and design these areas to control runoff.

•

Revegetate disturbed areas after completion of construction activities.

MA 56: When specific construction activities are proposed that involve new ground
disturbance in the portion of the Regional Park underlain by Cierbo
Sandstone (i.e., the southernmost portion of Contra Loma), the local
managing partner(s) will prepare a plan describing the measures they will
implement to manage any paleontological resources encountered during
construction. The plan will be submitted to Reclamation for review and
approval. The plan will describe measures for evaluating the importance of
the resource, performing recovery excavations, museum curation,
preparation of a report documenting the find, and/or development of public
outreach or educational materials or displays. These measures outlined in
the plan would only be implemented to the extent warranted by the
importance of the resource.
Operations and Maintenance

MA 57: The local managing partner(s) will be responsible for operations and
maintenance of any new recreation or infrastructure improvements that they
implement. All proposals submitted to Reclamation by the managing
partner(s) for new improvements will clearly describe the activities needed
to operate and maintain the improvements.

Management Actions for Alternative 3: Expanded Recreation
and Facilities

2.8.1

Objective

2.8.2

Description

The objective of this alternative is to expand recreational uses and facilities to accommodate
increasing demand, especially for additional all-weather sports fields.
Under this alternative, the management direction would be shifted toward expansion of
recreational uses and facilities. This alternative includes the management actions listed under
Alternative 2 (Enhanced Recreation and Facilities) and provides additional management actions
to expand existing recreational uses and facilities and to install new facilities that expand
recreational opportunities. Examples include construction of a fishermen's shelter, a playground
structure, a disc golf course, new multi-use sports fields, and expansion of the swim lagoon and
the trail system. Other examples include planting of shade trees, installation of shade structures
and solar panels, and fish habitat improvements to increase fish populations. This alternative
may also include overnight group camping.

2.8.3

Management Actions

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park

Swim lagoon The swim lagoon is a very popular facility during the warm weather months. This
alternative would allow for expansion of the swim lagoon if needed to accommodate a sufficient
increase in future demand.
MA 58: The size and capacity of the swim lagoon may be expanded if needed to
accommodate increased future demand.
Fishing Fishing continues to be a very popular recreational activity at the reservoir. The LUDP
anticipated future development of a fishermen’s shelter in an unidentified location along the
south shore, but the shelter has not yet been built. This alternative would include construction of
a fishermen's shelter along the south or east shore and would improve fish habitat to increase fish
populations.
MA 59: A fishermen's shelter may be constructed along the south or east shore.
MA 60: Fish habitat may be created or modified if desirable to increase fish
populations.
Trail System A trail system provides access to most areas of the Regional Park and
connections with other trail systems outside Contra Loma. Horses may be ridden on most trails
within the Regional Park. Bicycles are allowed on many trails, but are not currently allowed to
be ridden on many narrow (i.e., single track) trails and trails that are marked "No Bicycles."
Trees provide shade to a very small percentage of the trail system. This alternative would
increase mountain biking opportunities within the Regional Park and increase shade along some
trails. This alternative would also include a new fitness course with outdoor exercise stations
built along the shoreline trail loop.
MA 61: The number and length of trails and the number of loop trail opportunities
available for mountain biking may be increased by constructing new trails
open to bicycles and/or by allowing bicycles access to portions of the trail
system that are not currently open to bicycles.
MA 62: New multi-use trail connectors may be built in several locations.
MA 63: Shade trees may be planted along some trail segments if desirable and if
sufficient irrigation is available. Trees planted along trails outside the
landscaped areas will be endemic native species. The local managing
partner(s) for the Regional Park is encouraged to plant native trees along
trails in the landscaped areas of the Regional Park (i.e., south shore), but
may plant species similar to the existing ornamental trees.
MA 64: A new fitness course may be established by installing outdoor exercise
stations with stationary equipment and signage along the shoreline trail loop.

2-25 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Other Recreation This alternative includes management actions that recognize other
recreational opportunities at the Regional Park. The temperature at Contra Loma can be quite hot
in the summer. Trees and structures only offer shade in some areas of the Regional Park,
primarily in the developed recreational areas along the south side of the reservoir. The Regional
Park does not have playground structures, although structures are provided at the Community
Park. No disc golf courses are located near Contra Loma; the nearest course is located in
Moraga, 32 miles away. No camping facilities are available at the Regional Park and overnight
camping is not currently allowed in the park. This alternative would increase the amount of
shade available to park users, provide a playground structure at the Regional Park, provide a disc
golf course, and allow overnight group camping subject to event-specific authorization,
oversight, and regulation.
MA 65: Shade trees may be planted and shade structures may be installed to support
recreational uses and to provide shade in parking and picnic areas.
MA 66: A playground structure may be built in the developed recreational areas
along the south side of the reservoir.
MA 67: Overnight group camping may be allowed on a discretionary basis as part of
the current day camp programs or other special events. Group camping will
require event-specific authorization, oversight, and regulation by the
Regional Park’s local managing partner to ensure protection of the park’s
natural resources and facilities. No campground facilities may be built,
although some modification of existing day use facilities might be needed to
serve group campers. Modifications may include installation of additional
picnic tables, wash basins, and electrical outlets.
MA 68: A disc golf course may be built in a suitable location that minimizes
conflicts with other park uses. Potential locations may include the gently
rolling land east of the reservoir, gently sloping land near the southwest
corner of the reservoir, and the southeast portion of the Regional Park
directly north of Frederickson Lane.
Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Antioch Community Park

Sports Fields The Community Park has five sports fields. The three multi-use sports fields in
the western half of the park are used for softball, baseball, football, soccer, and kickball. The two
sports fields in the eastern half of the Community Park are used primarily for soccer, but are also
used for baseball, softball, football, rugby, and outdoor volleyball. League sports including
soccer, softball, football, and kickball are popular activities at the Community Park. This
alternative would include two new lighted sports fields south of the two existing soccer fields if
needed to accommodate demand and would increase parking capacity if needed to meet
additional demand.
MA 69: Additional multi-use sports fields may be built directly south of the two
existing sports fields on the east side of the Community Park. The sports
fields would have floodlights to allow evening use. The additional fields
would require expansion of the Community Park boundaries south into the

2-26 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

Regional Park by approximately 15 acres. The expansion would also require
adjustment of the boundaries between the two parks (see Figure 2-2) by
future managing partner(s). If the adjustment is made, the existing grazing
fence would also be relocated to follow the adjusted boundary line and lands
currently in the Regional Park would no longer be grazed. Also, a portion of
the Regional Park trail (Old Ranch Loop Trail) that currently follows the
south side of the boundary line between the two parks would be relocated to
follow the adjusted boundary line.
MA 70: If additional multi-use sports fields are built, additional parking capacity
may be developed if needed to accommodate increased parking demand.
Other Recreation This alternative includes management actions that recognize other
recreational opportunities at the Community Park. This alternative would expand the trail system
and create a botanical garden.
MA 71: The Community Park trail system may be expanded to include new trails
and to improve interconnection between trail systems.
MA 72: A botanical garden may be created within the Community Park. Possible
locations may include the undeveloped land north of the eastern sports fields
or the undeveloped land in the southwestern portion of the park.
Interpretive Opportunities Contra Loma’s history and natural resources provide opportunities
for interpretation and education. This alternative would increase interpretive signage and
programs.
MA 73: Interpretive signage and/or kiosks may be built and programs may be
provided that offer visitors educational experiences intended to instill or
enhance their appreciation of the region’s natural and cultural resources.
Informational walks and presentations may be provided by volunteer
docents. Interpretive opportunities could also focus on historic areas within
Contra Loma.
Infrastructure Improvements at Contra Loma Regional Park

Solar Panels This alternative would allow the managing partner(s) for the Regional Park to
install solar panels on shade structures or buildings to supplement the park’s energy needs,
including the energy needed to power the water pumps for the swim lagoon.
MA 74: Solar panels may be installed on parking or picnic area shade structures and
on buildings to supplement the Regional Park’s energy needs, including the
energy needed to power the water pumps for the swim lagoon.
Irrigation Water This alternative would allow additional reservoir water to be purchased from
CCWD.
MA 75: Some future facility improvements such as the planting of additional shade
trees could increase demand for irrigation water by about 50 acre-feet per
2-27 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

year. If additional reservoir water is needed for irrigation, the local
managing partner(s) would need to purchase the water from CCWD if the
requested water is available. CCWD would be responsible for review and
approval of the request for additional water.

Specific Management Actions Eliminated from Detailed Analysis

The concessions management policy (LND 04-02) of the Reclamation Manual Policy and
Directives and Standards requires new, renewed, or modified management agreements and
concession contracts to include clauses that prohibit exclusive use. For this reason, alternatives
and general management options proposing exclusive use for profit or benefit of a private entity
were not considered. This includes operation of part or all of Contra Loma as a private reservoir
or private recreation area.
Alternatives and general management options proposing maximum development, production, or
protection of one use or resource at the expense of other uses and resources were not considered.
Reclamation is subject to the Congressional mandate that “in investigating and planning any
Federal…water resource project, full consideration shall be given to the opportunities, if any,
which the project affords for outdoor recreation and for fish and wildlife enhancement” (PL 8972, 79 Stat. 213-218).
Alternatives reducing or eliminating existing recreation uses would not meet the purpose and
need for the proposed project. Currently, resource conditions do not warrant reduction or
elimination of any particular recreational use. Therefore, none of the alternatives include
reduction or elimination of these existing uses.
Alternatives addressing water or power operations or water service contracts are not considered,
because such actions are outside the scope of the RMP and would be covered under separate
actions and environmental review. Contra Loma Reservoir is operated and managed by CCWD
under contract to Reclamation and is a component of Reclamation’s CVP. Management of the
land surrounding the reservoir is secondary to operation of the CVP and is required to support
Reclamation’s core mission of delivering water and generating power.
Most of the management actions suggested by the public were included in one or more of the
alternatives. However, some management actions suggested by the public were not included in
any of the alternatives and have been eliminated from detailed analysis.

Chapter 2. Resource Management Plan and Alternatives

One public commenter suggested removing the swim lagoon to restore the character of Contra
Loma to a more natural state. The swim lagoon was constructed at great financial expense for the
purpose of protecting the reservoir’s water quality from human-borne viruses and pathogens
while serving a public recreation need. Removing the swim lagoon would require substantial
additional financial expenditure, and the public would cease to benefit from the expenditure
invested to build the lagoon. Also, the swim lagoon is a very popular facility during the hot
summer months. As stated in Section 2.9.3 above, alternatives reducing or eliminating existing
recreation uses would not meet the purpose and need for the proposed project. Therefore, this
suggested management action has been eliminated from further consideration.
Some commenters suggested controlling or removing vegetation within the reservoir and along
the shoreline to improve fishing access. Much of this vegetation, however, provides rearing
habitat for fish or provides important habitat for wildlife. These suggested management actions
would not be consistent with the primary goals of the Contra Loma RMP of protecting and
enhancing natural resources. Therefore, this suggested management action has been eliminated
from further consideration. It should be noted, however, that several management actions that
would enhance fishing access are included in the RMP.
Another commenter suggested enforcement of self-pay entrance fees. The local managing
partner for the Regional Park currently has the authority to enforce self-pay entrance fees for
vehicles. With respect to walk-ins, it would be impractical to enforce payment of self-pay fees
because once in the park, walk-in visitors are indistinguishable from visitors who have arrived in
vehicles and paid for entry. Therefore, this suggested management action has been eliminated
from further consideration.
One public commenter suggested better coordination for advertising of public events at Contra
Loma and another provided suggestions about the types of products that should be available for
purchase at the snack bar. Another commenter suggested that smoking should be prohibited
within the fenced swim lagoon area and that smoking areas should be designated outside the
fence and down-wind from swimmers. Other commenters suggested that the local managing
partners for the Regional Park consider increasing the presence of multi-lingual staff during high
use periods to assist non-English speaking park users. While these suggestions may have merit,
they are not directly related to resource management and fall outside the scope and purpose of an
RMP. These management actions would remain within the purview of the responsible local
managing partner(s) to implement if they choose to.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment
3.1

Introduction

This section describes the affected environment of Contra Loma at a level of detail
commensurate with the programmatic/planning nature of this RMP. Subsequent project-level
environmental compliance documents may need to be prepared by Reclamation or the managing
partner(s) in the future to address environmental resources that may be affected by management
actions and projects carried out under the selected RMP alternative. This chapter describes
resources and features that could be affected under any of the alternatives. Some resources such
as climate are described for the purpose of context, although project-related impacts to these
resources, regardless of the selected project alternative, would be minor.
Much of the data used to describe the environmental setting of Contra Loma was collected using
a GIS format. Figures are used to show Contra Loma’s layout, including features, facilities, and
infrastructure, as well as areas of sensitive resources (e.g., vegetation communities) and potential
hazards (e.g., geological faults). The discussion and figures in this chapter, and the impact
analyses presented in Chapter 4, are intended to serve as a guide to future development plans
within the planning horizon by identifying potential environmental constraints.

3.2

Land Use and Management

3.2.1

Existing Conditions

Current uses at Contra Loma include recreational uses, grazing, operations and maintenance, and
reservoir management. EBRPD has constructed recreational facilities on the south side of the
reservoir to support the various recreational opportunities offered at Contra Loma and has
developed trails throughout the area for hiking, biking, and equestrian uses. The City has
developed community facilities on the land it manages to support soccer, baseball, picnicking,
and other sports and community activities. Recreational uses are allowed in most areas of Contra
Loma, with the exception of the Reclamation Zone north of the dam. Group activities, such as
parties, performances, special events, or similar gatherings, are allowed with a special use permit
from EBRPD.
EBRPD’s park office is located south of, and adjacent to, the swim lagoon. The office adjoins
the buildings housing the showers and changing rooms. The park office building also includes
the corporation yard where EBRPD stores vehicles and maintenance equipment. The corporation
yard is enclosed on all sides by cinder block walls and by the office building, except for a 16foot wide driveway on the south side of the yard. A storm drain system provides drainage for the
corporation yard; this system drains to the reservoir. The EBRPD police substation is located in
the former park residence building approximately 250 feet southwest of the park office. There is
currently no park residence at Contra Loma. A service yard and materials storage area is located
500 feet west of the park office.

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Grazing is allowed on the 454 acres of rolling grasslands surrounding the reservoir in accordance
with the current grazing license. Grazing is used for fire suppression in order to protect the
recreational facilities and nearby residential areas. The grazing license allows for a livestock
carrying capacity of 389 animal unit months (i.e., the amount of grazing forage needed for one
mature cow and nursing calf per month) for the grazed land (Figure 1-2). Livestock grazing is
currently rotated between multiple enclosures, and cattle are not allowed near the reservoir in
order to protect water quality. EBRPD grazes livestock on about 60 percent (about 68,000 acres)
of its regional parklands, including its Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve adjacent to
Contra Loma. Grazing and pasture are important land uses in Contra Costa County. In 2000,
168,890 acres of the County were in pasture and range land, which includes land used for
grazing of large farm animals and dry farming of grains for feed (Contra Costa County 2005).
Contra Loma is located entirely within the City and has been designated by the City’s General
Plan as open space (City of Antioch 2003a) as it serves as a transitional area between the
developed portions of the City and extensive open space to the southwest. Contra Loma is
surrounded by residential uses to the north and south, the City golf course to the east, residential
uses along the eastern half of the southern boundary, open space along the western half of the
southern boundary, and open space and undeveloped land to the west (Figure 3-1).
The City owns the adjacent 201-acre parcel to the east of Contra Loma that comprises the
majority of the golf course (i.e., excluding the 5.7 acres of land leased to the City by
Reclamation). The golf course includes 18 holes, a driving range and practice area, a pro shop,
and a clubhouse with dining and beverage facilities.
EBRPD owns the open space lands to the south and west and manages them as part of the 5,300acre Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. The preserve provides recreational opportunities
and preserves a portion of the area’s history relating to Native American uses, ranching, as well
as coal and sand mining. A portion of land directly west of Contra Loma is privately-owned. The
City’s general plan land use designation for the privately-owned land is Estate Residential and
the City has zoned the land as Planned Development District.
Land Ownership and Management in Contra Loma

The U.S. Government owns Contra Loma, which consists of the 80-acre reservoir and
approximately 661 acres of land surrounding the reservoir (Figure 3-1). Reclamation is the
Federal agency charged with administering Contra Loma. EBRPD, the City, and CCWD are
responsible for managing Contra Loma in accordance with each agency’s management
agreement, license, or contract.
CCWD has been operating and maintaining the reservoir for domestic water supply under
contract with Reclamation since 1967. On September 18, 1972, Reclamation and EBRPD
entered into a management agreement transferring responsibility from Reclamation to EBRPD
for the development, construction, administration, operation, and maintenance of public
recreation, recreation facilities, and other uses within Contra Loma, including the water surface
area of the reservoir but excluding 20 acres directly north of the dam known as the Reclamation
Zone. This agreement clarifies that the rights of EBRPD under this agreement are subordinate to
the rights of the United States relating to the use of the lands and water areas for water regulation
and other project purposes. Reclamation and its contractor CCWD retained responsibility for the

Reclamation Zone and management authority for the reservoir for purposes of its operation and
use of CVP water supplies. According to the current management agreement with Reclamation,
EBRPD has the authority to issue special use permits, licenses, and concession contracts to other
entities as well as the responsibility to manage and maintain recreational facilities and uses at
Contra Loma. The City operates and manages the Community Park in the northeastern portion of
Contra Loma under a license agreement granted by EBRPD.
In 1981, 5.7 acres of land on the eastern side of Contra Loma adjacent to the City’s Lone Tree
Golf Course was removed from EBRPD’s management area and has been leased to the City for
golf course. The lease expired in 2011; however, Reclamation and the City are pursuing issuance
of a new license in order to allow continued use of the land for golf. Although, this land is owned
by the U.S. Government, it is not part of the Contra Loma Recreation Area and is, therefore, not
covered in this RMP/EIS. Issuance of a new license to the City will require separate
environmental analysis and approval from Reclamation. In conjunction with this lease of land to
the City in 1981, EBRPD agreed to accept the use of a 3.9-acre City-owned parcel adjacent to
the northeast corner of the Recreation Area (Figure 3-1). The lease between the City and EBRPD
for the 3.9 acres of City-owned land also expired in 2011. Because this 3.9-acre parcel is owned
by the City, it is not part of Contra Loma, and future use of this area will be determined by the
City.
In 1985, EBRPD transferred management of approximately 47 acres of Contra Loma to the City
under a license agreement that allowed the creation of the Community Park. The license
agreement was amended in 1990 and it has been extended through December 31, 2013. Pursuant
to this license agreement, management and maintenance of the Community Park is the
responsibility of the City.
Land Uses and Zones

Reclamation uses WALROS as a management tool for classifying water and land use zones in
terms of recreational experience. The primary goal of WALROS is to provide planners and
managers with a framework and procedure for making better decisions in order to conserve a
spectrum of high-quality and diverse water- and land-based recreation opportunities. In 2009, the
WALROS system replaced its predecessor, WROS, which placed more emphasis on water-based
recreation than land-based recreation.
In October 2008, Reclamation identified two WROS classifications for Contra Loma Reservoir.
The southern half of the reservoir is classified as S4 and the northern half of the reservoir is
classified as RD6 (Figure 1-2). The S4 zone is influenced by the developed recreation areas, high
visitor use, and corresponding managerial presence along the southern shore. Facilities along the
south shore include the swim lagoon, picnic areas, concessions, boat launch, parking lots, and
Regional Park administrative facilities. The RD6 zone receives less use and has fewer facilities
than the S4 zone, and is less developed than the S4 zone (Bureau of Reclamation and California
Department of Parks and Recreation 2008). These zones are similar, though not identical, to the
S and RD zones under the WALROS system. The 2008 WROS inventory did not identify
classifications for the land portions of Contra Loma.
As the managing partner, EBRPD prepared a park-specific LUDP for Contra Loma to define
allowed uses, describe the desired park character, provide guidance for future development and

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

use of the Regional Park, describe access and circulation, and designate areas for development or
preservation (East Bay Regional Park District 1975a). The LUDP established a natural
environment unit and recreation clusters in Contra Loma based on the anticipated and desired
uses of each area (East Bay Regional Park District 1975a). The natural environment unit and
recreation clusters encompass the 80-acre reservoir and all of the surrounding land except for the
20-acre Reclamation Zone, which encompasses the dam and its pumping facilities. The
Reclamation Zone is reserved for use by Reclamation and CCWD.
The natural environment unit was designated to protect natural resources and provide more
passive recreational opportunities with minimal development (East Bay Regional Park District
1975a). This unit encompasses the steeper hillsides and the majority of the reservoir surface and
shoreline. This unit offers hiking trails, scenic views, fishing, and informal picnicking. Some of
this unit is used for livestock grazing.
The recreation clusters were designated in Contra Loma to focus recreational activities and
facility development within specified areas that are most conducive to recreation, such as those
areas that have ease of access, are generally flat, and are close to water or other facilities (East
Bay Regional Park District 1975a). The following four use areas were designated within the
recreation clusters: the beach-marina cluster on the south shore of Contra Loma Reservoir, the
day camp cluster in the northeast portion of Contra Loma (where the current Community Park
is), the picnic meadow cluster to the east of the reservoir, and the equestrian facility or special
use area in the southeast corner. These areas include the lands south, east, and northeast of the
reservoir and in the southeast portion of Contra Loma adjacent to residential development.

3.3

Recreation

3.3.1

Existing Conditions

The Contra Loma Recreation Area was opened to the public in 1968 with limited recreational
development. Currently, recreation at Contra Loma is available within the Contra Loma Regional
Park and the Community Park managed by EBRPD and the City, respectively.
Contra Loma Regional Park

EBRPD classifies Contra Loma as a regional park because of its outstanding natural features and
its outdoor recreational opportunities for public enjoyment and education (East Bay Regional
Park District 1975a).
EBRPD operates the Regional Park to provide outdoor recreational and educational
opportunities, while managing the park’s natural and cultural resources. Recreational activities at
the park include picnicking, fishing, boating, windsurfing, kayaking, canoeing, swimming,
hiking, bicycling, horseback riding, and wildlife viewing. The Regional Park is open to the
public daily from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., although the park’s vehicle entrance gate hours vary
throughout the year. EBRPD collects fees for parking, dogs, swimming, boat inspection and
launching, windsurfing, and fishing. Visitation has increased annually in recent years, as shown
in Table 3-1.

The Regional Park contains various facilities that support the recreational uses offered at the
park, such as trails, picnic tables, a large swimming pool (i.e., “swim lagoon”), food concession,
parking areas, fishing docks, and a boat launch, as well as facilities for managing the land, such
as fencing, access gates, and roads. EBRPD has offices, maintenance equipment and facilities,
law enforcement vehicles, and a radio communication system onsite. The Regional Park has
potable (drinking) water, restrooms and showers, portable chemical toilets, electricity, and
telephones. Many, but not all, of the recreational facilities are ADA-compliant. The Regional
Park has wheelchair accessible drinking water, parking, and restrooms. The shaded picnic areas
near the swim lagoon are wheelchair accessible, and the swim lagoon has an accessible pool lift.
Most of the developed recreational facilities are located along the south side of the reservoir,
which corresponds with the beach-marina recreational cluster identified in EBRPD’s LUDP. A
large manicured lawn with planted shade trees covers much of this area. Developed facilities in
this area include picnic sites, the swim lagoon, the boat launch, a fishing dock, a fish cleaning
station, restrooms, showers, changing rooms, drinking fountains, a food concession, an
equestrian staging area, and several trails. Most of the parking areas are also located here (Figure
1-2).
Contra Loma Reservoir provides recreational fishing opportunities for children and adult anglers
of varying skill levels. Annual visitation data suggest that angler use has been increasing and will
continue to increase. The reservoir supports 14 species of fish, including eight species of game
fish. EBRPD and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) stock rainbow trout
and channel catfish in the reservoir. The reservoir also supports self-sustaining populations of
largemouth bass, crappie, redear sunfish, and bluegill, which are also popular with anglers. A
state fishing license and an EBRPD Fishing Access Permit are required for all anglers 16 years
and older. Additional details about the reservoir’s fishery are provided in Section 3.11
(Fisheries).
To protect the reservoir’s domestic water supply from pathogens such as Cryptosporidium, the
Department of Health Services (DOHS) (predecessor to California Department of Public Health
[CDPH]) issued a compliance order to CCWD in 1999 requiring CCWD to either cease body
contact activities in the reservoir or discontinue using the reservoir for drinking water supply. In
response to this order, CCWD and EBRPD built the swim lagoon along the south side of the
reservoir in 2001 (Figure 1-2) and swimming is no longer allowed in the reservoir. The swim
lagoon is separated from the reservoir, ensuring that water from the lagoon does not enter the

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

reservoir. The lagoon has a concrete bottom; water is recirculated through filters and is
disinfected and treated before it is returned to the lagoon, similar to a large swimming pool. The
swim lagoon is surrounded on three sides by a manicured lawn, and four permanent umbrellas
installed in the lawn provide shade. The swim lagoon and an adjacent lawn area are surrounded
by a fence. The swim lagoon is staffed with life guards when it is open (seasonally from May
through September) with varying hours throughout the season. Swim lagoon entrance fees are
collected in addition to park entrance fees. Showers, changing rooms, picnic tables, and a food
concession stand are available adjacent to the lagoon outside the fence. Concession stand hours
are the same as swimming hours.
Windsurfing and limited boating are allowed on the reservoir. Body contact with the reservoir is
highly restricted to protect the reservoir’s domestic water supply from pathogens. To minimize
body contact with the water, windsurfers must shower before entering the water and wear wet
suits. Visitors may launch small boats (up to 17 feet long). To protect water quality, only electric
motors are allowed; gasoline-powered engines are prohibited. Kayaks and canoes are allowed on
the reservoir; however, paddlers using self-bailing kayaks must shower before launching and
wear wet suits while boating. To protect against potential infestations of invasive zebra and
quagga mussels, all boats are inspected by trained EBRPD staff prior to launching. All boats and
aquatic gear must be dry prior to entering the reservoir.
A trail network within the Regional Park provides hiking, bicycling, and equestrian access to
most areas of the park, as well as connections to the Community Park and other nearby trail
systems (Figure 1-2). The trail system includes 0.75 mile of paved trails along the east and south
shores of the reservoir. These paved trails provide access to the gravel-surfaced West Shore
Trail, which is wheelchair accessible when trail conditions are favorable with respect to mud and
the quality of the gravel surface. The West Shore Trail has a gravel surface. Several trails on the
south side of the Regional Park connect with the trail system in EBRPD’s Black Diamond Mines
Regional Preserve, which provides connections to Mt. Diablo and other parks and trails within
the EBRPD system.
The East Shore Trail and other trails on the north side of the Regional Park provide access to the
Community Park, the Delta De Anza Regional Trail (also known as the Contra Costa Canal
Trail), and the Mokelumne Trail. Trails in the northwest portion of the park provide access to
adjacent residential communities. Bicycles may be ridden on designated trails and on fire or
service roads, unless otherwise posted. Bicycles are not permitted in areas posted “No Bicycles,”
or on narrow (e.g., single track) hiking or narrow equestrian trails. Horses may be ridden on most
trails within the Regional Park. An equestrian staging area with a hitching post, a horse watering
trough, picnic tables, and a large gravel parking lot for trailers is located near the south shore of
the reservoir.
Dogs are allowed in the Regional Park provided they are leashed and under control while in
developed areas and areas posted with signs requiring use of leashes. Dogs are allowed off-leash
in open space and undeveloped areas of the Regional Park.
Alcoholic beverages are not allowed in the Regional Park.

3-8 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Special events and programs are allowed in the Regional Park with prior authorization from
EBRPD. Running meets and day-camp programs, sometimes including swimming lessons and a
junior lifeguard program, are held at the Regional Park. No camping facilities are provided, and
overnight camping in the park is prohibited.
Antioch Community Park

The Community Park currently receives approximately 50,000 visitors annually. The most
popular activities at the park involve use of the sports fields for softball, soccer, football, league
sports and tournaments. Other popular activities include picnicking, walking, jogging, and
bicycling.
The Community Park includes various facilities that support the recreational uses offered at the
park, such as barbeque pits, picnic areas, restrooms, multi-use sports fields, a children’s play
area, youth play area, horseshoes, trails, and parking areas, as well as management facilities such
as fencing, access gates, and driveways (Figure 1-3). Many, but not all, of the recreational
facilities are in compliance with ADA. The Community Park has potable (drinking) water,
restrooms, and electricity.
Most facilities are located in the western half of the Community Park. The driveway entrance at
the intersection of James Donlon Boulevard and Blythe Drive is the primary access point to the
Community Park. Facilities in this location include the main parking lot with approximately 230
spaces, a large group picnic area known as the Jensen Family Picnic Grove, individual picnic
tables, barbeque pits, three multi-use sports fields (fields 1, 2, and 3; see Figure 1-3) with flood
lights, children’s and youth play areas, and restrooms. A paved trail from the western end of the
parking lot leads to the Regional Park.
The eastern half of the Community Park includes two sports fields (fields 4 and 5), a second
parking lot with approximately 230 spaces, and open space areas. An unpaved trail from the
eastern end of the parking lot leads to the Regional Park. The Contra Costa Canal and the
adjacent Delta De Anza Regional Trail run along the entire northern boundary of the Community
Park.
The Community Park has a total of five sports fields. The three multi-use sports fields in the
western half of the park (fields 1, 2, and 3) have softball diamonds, dugouts, bleachers, water
fountains, nearby restrooms, and flood lights for nighttime use. These fields are used for softball,
baseball, football, soccer, and kickball. The two sports fields in the eastern half of the
Community Park (fields 4 and 5) are used primarily for soccer, but are also used for baseball,
softball, football, rugby, and outdoor volleyball. The City has recently improved these fields by
replacing the grass surface with synthetic turf, installing furnishings, perimeter fencing, concrete
paving, an electrical/storage building, sports field lighting, perimeter irrigation and landscaping,
drainage structures, and pavement. With the installation of lights, these fields are now used at
night.
Sports fields 1, 2, and 3 develop muddy conditions during the rainy season that can render them
temporarily unusable. To protect the turf and public safety, the City does not allow the fields to
be used when wet.

Visitor Access and Circulation

3.4.1

Existing Conditions

Contra Loma is located in Antioch in northeastern Contra Costa County near the junction of
State Route (SR) 4 and SR 160 (Figure 1-1). SR 4 is located approximately 1.5 miles north of
Contra Loma and is the primary freeway serving the recreation area. SR 4 connects with
Interstate (I-) 680 15 miles west of Antioch, providing access to and from other parts of the San
Francisco Bay Area. East of Antioch, SR 4 passes through the City of Brentwood, providing
access to and from the San Joaquin Valley. From Antioch, SR 160 heads north toward Rio Vista.
Lone Tree Way and Contra Loma Boulevard are the primary surface streets connecting SR 4 to
Contra Loma. Lone Tree Way also provides access to Contra Loma from Brentwood.
Vehicle access to the Regional Park is from Contra Loma Boulevard on the south side of the
park. Frederickson Lane provides vehicle access to Contra Loma Boulevard from Golf Course
Road (a major collector road) and several other streets providing access from Lone Tree Way
(Figure 3-2). Vehicle access to the Community Park is from James Donlon Boulevard, which
runs along the northern boundary of Contra Loma. James Donlon Boulevard is a four-lane street
that provides access to Contra Loma Boulevard and Lone Tree Way. Lone Tree Way and James
Donlon Boulevard are primary arterial streets. The section of Contra Loma Boulevard between
SR 4 and James Donlon Boulevard is also an arterial street. Pedestrians and bicyclists may also
reach Contra Loma via the Delta De Anza Trail, which connects to the Mokelumne Trail.
Within the City, peak hour congestion at freeway intersections and other major local
intersections that serve the freeway system or local employment centers generally occurs during
weekday mornings and afternoons (City of Antioch 2003a).
The Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) provides commuter rail service throughout much
of the San Francisco Bay Area. The nearest BART station to Contra Loma is the Pittsburg/Bay
Point station located 7 miles west of Antioch. Tri Delta Transit provides bus service to Antioch
and nearby cities. Tri Delta Transit has several routes serving the Contra Loma area; however,
most of these routes are commuter routes limited to weekdays. Tri Delta Transit has one
weekend route that provides service to Contra Loma and the BART station. The nearest bus stop
to Contra Loma is located at the intersection of Contra Loma Boulevard and James Donlon
Boulevard, about a third of a mile from the Community Park entrance.
Contra Loma Regional Park

Visitor access to the Regional Park is by car, foot, bicycle, or horseback. Car access is from the
southern park entrance and pedestrian access is through one of several pedestrian entrances
(Figure 3-2). Two pedestrian entrances provide access to the Regional Park from the Community
Park. A paved trail leading from the west side of the Community Park provides access to the
Regional Park at the eastern end of Contra Loma Dam. An unpaved trail provides access from
the eastern end of the Community Park to the northeast corner of the Regional Park. Three other
pedestrian entrances are located on the northwest side of the Regional Park, and provide access
to adjacent residential areas. All of these pedestrian entrances have gates that prohibit vehicle
access. Visitors may also access the southern portion of the Regional Park by hiking, bicycling,

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Circulation within the Regional Park is provided by the park’s road and trail network.
Immediately north of the entry kiosk the entrance road splits in three directions. The boat launch
and a parking area are located approximately 500 feet north of the intersection. The road to the
east leads to the east shore of the reservoir and the road to the west leads to the south shore of the
reservoir (Figure 3-2).
The half-mile-long park road that leads to the east shore of the reservoir has a gravel surface.
This road provides access to two parking lots, the east shore, and the trail system in the eastern
portion of the Regional Park. The trails east of the reservoir include Old Ranch Loop, Swale
Trail, and East Shore Trail. These trails provide access to areas north and east of the reservoir,
including the Community Park, the Contra Loma Dam, and the east shore of the reservoir.
The road that leads west from the entry kiosk provides access to the south shore recreation areas.
Parking is available in three lots and the equestrian staging area. Some parking lots are paved,
and others have a gravel surface. The visitor road ends at the western parking lot near the park
office. Several service roads for EBRPD staff continue west, providing access to the park office,
corporation yard, police substation, and storage area. These service roads also serve as walking
trails.
A network of trails provides access to the southern, western, and northwestern areas of the
Regional Park, and connects with trails to the to the east shore (Figure 3-2). These trails include
the West Shore, Stewartville, Ridge, Lake View, and Old Homestead Loop trails. The West
Shore Trail runs along the west shore of the reservoir and provides access to the west shore
fishing dock and the dam. Stewartville Trail runs along the park entrance road south shore of the
reservoir.
The Ridge and Lake View trails provide access to the ridges south and west of the reservoir with
views of the reservoir and beyond. An unnamed paved trail runs along the south shore of the
reservoir from the entry kiosk to the swim lagoon, and provides wheelchair access to the swim
lagoon, park office, several picnic areas, restrooms, and the south shore fishing dock.
The Regional Park has a parking capacity of 1,093 vehicles. Visitation is generally highest on
weekends and holidays from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. Parking shortages are
rare and typically only occur on hot weekend days once or twice every couple of years
(Bondurant, pers. comm. 2011a).
Antioch Community Park

The primary access point to the Community Park is the driveway entrance at the intersection of
James Donlon Boulevard and Blythe Drive. Vehicles entering the Community Park here may
park in the main parking lot, which has approximately 230 spaces. The parking lot provides
access to the Jensen Family Picnic Grove, picnic tables, barbeque pits, play areas, restrooms, and
sports fields 1, 2, and 3. A paved trail from the western end of the parking lot leads to the
Regional Park (Figure 3-2). A second vehicle entrance and another parking lot are located on
James Donlon Boulevard at the northeast corner of the Community Park. This parking lot has
approximately 230 spaces and provides access to sports fields 4 and 5. An unpaved trail from the
eastern end of the parking lot leads to the Regional Park. Several paved trails provide internal

access within the Community Park. The Delta De Anza Regional Trail runs along the entire
northern boundary of the Community Park.

Utilities

Public utilities at Contra Loma include water service, wastewater service, solid waste disposal,
electricity, and telephone and radio service. Information was obtained from staff of the EBRPD
and the City, and from the EBRPD Master Plan and the City’s General Plan.
3.5.1

Existing Conditions

Water Service

Water service at Contra Loma is provided by the City via their contractual agreement with
CCWD for CVP water. Drinking water is available at eight locations in the Regional Park; most
of these locations are near the swim lagoon, park office, concession stand, and boat launch area
(Figure 3-3). A watering station for horses is also provided at the equestrian staging area near the
Lake View Trail between the boat launch area and main parking lot. EBRPD irrigates the cattle
grazing and landscaped portions of the Regional Park from an allocation of up to 100 acre-feet
per year of water from the reservoir (Rivoire, pers. comm. 2010; Miller, pers. comm. 2011).
At the Community Park, the City provides potable water to two restrooms, the concession
building/snack bar, one community picnic area, and five individual picnic areas. Irrigation water
is used over most of the park, which has turf, low ground cover, and approximately 100 mature
trees. The Community Park experiences heaviest use of both potable and irrigation water during
the peak visitor season, May through October (City of Antioch Recreation Department 2010).
Wastewater Service

The Regional Park has eight restroom facilities. These facilities are cleaned and visually
inspected daily by park staff. The restrooms at the park office and the shower facility near the
swim lagoon are connected to the City’s sewer service through a lift station; although EBRPD
drawings do not show the connection, EBRPD believes it may be in the area of Grimsby Drive
(Stoneham, pers. comm. 2011). The other six restrooms are chemical toilets that are visually
inspected daily and pumped biweekly by EBRPD. EBRPD has stated that the existing chemical
toilets are not sufficient for the current level of use (Rivoire, pers. comm. 2010).
All wastewater service at the Community Park is handled by the Delta Diablo Sanitation District
(DDSD) which includes two restrooms and the concession building/snack bar (City of Antioch
Recreation Department 2010).
Solid Waste Disposal

Allied Waste provides solid waste collection, disposal, recycling, and yard waste services to the
City, including Contra Loma (City of Antioch 2003b). Trash bins and recycling bins are
distributed throughout Contra Loma. The park staff gathers the trash and deposits it in one main
dumpster, which is emptied by Allied Waste.

Electricity

Electric service is provided by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to the office, the kiosk, the
police substation, the boat ramp, and several irrigation pumps throughout the recreation area
(Miller, pers. comm. 2011). No electric outlets are available at picnic sites. The Regional Park’s
monthly electrical usage ranges from approximately 25,610 to 70,579 kilowatt hours per month.
PG&E also provide electrical service to the Community Park, but the City receives a combined
electrical bill for all City properties, so electrical usage at the Community Park is difficult to
determine. Separate electrical service is provided by PG&E to the dam.
No natural gas service is provided to Contra Loma.
Telephone and Radio

Telephone service is provided by AT&T to the park office, police substation, and entry kiosk
(via microwave connection to the office phone system). Public telephones are available at the
park office/concession area.
Radio communication is used by public safety personnel and other staff, and communication
problems have been noted (Rivoire, pers. comm. 2010).

3.6

Public Health and Safety

This section addresses existing conditions and management policies regarding public health and
safety at Contra Loma. Specific topics addressed are fire protection, police service, boating and
swimming safety, natural hazards, and general public safety. Safety issues related to wildland
fires, dam failure, and hazardous materials are described in Section 3.16 (Hazards), and safety
issues related to seismicity and other potential geologic hazards are described in Section 3.12
(Geologic and Soils Resources).
3.6.1

Existing Conditions

Fire Protection

Since 1963, the EBRPD Fire Department has provided fire protection and emergency medical
services to visitors of the East Bay regional parks under the authority of California Public
Resources Code Section 5561.6. The fire department is responsible for providing fire protection
in Contra Loma. Strategies include fire abatement and suppression, comprehensive fire
prevention programs, fire investigation services, delivery of pre-hospital emergency medical
care, and emergency medical transportation (East Bay Regional Park District 2011a). The
department has local mutual aid agreements with Contra Costa and Alameda counties and the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and is a party to the Statewide
Master Mutual Aid Program.
In general, EBRPD lands are predominately classified as State Responsibility Areas for fire
protection. Contra Loma, like several other EBRPD parks, is located within a Local
Responsibility Area, meaning that the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District (CCCFPD),
which is the local fire protection district, has the legal responsibility to provide fire protection in
the Regional Park. The EBRPD’s role is to provide a strong secondary wildland fire response in

3-17 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

support of the local fire protection district. EBRPD maintains a Type 4 engine (designed for
wildland fires) at Contra Loma Station 8, located at the west end of Frederickson Lane in
Antioch. The station is usually unstaffed, but when nearby fires or extreme fire danger conditions
occur, three firefighters are stationed there.
EBRPD provides fire suppression, prevention, emergency medical services, rescue, and initial
hazardous materials response to incidents within the parks. From 2006 to 2008, EBRPD
responded to the Regional Park for five fires and 51 emergency medical incidents. Compared
with other EBRPD parks, this is a low rate of fire occurrence and a high rate of medical
responses (Bondurant, pers. comm. 2011a). EBRPD’s Wildfire Hazard Reduction and Resource
Management Plan does not apply directly to Contra Loma, as this park was outside the study
area of the plan. However, EBRPD uses the state-of-the-art fuels treatment methods (including
grazing and mowing), mitigation measures, and BMPs outlined in the plan at Contra Loma (East
Bay Regional Park District 1996). More information about wildfire protection and prevention is
provided in Section 3.16 (Hazards).
Emergency response time standards vary by the level of urbanization of a service area, with
faster target response times for urbanized areas (Burr Consulting 2009). National Fire Protection
Association guidelines call for career fire departments to respond within 6 minutes 90 percent of
the time. The response time guideline established by the California Emergency Medical Services
Authority for emergency medical calls is 5 minutes in urban areas, 15 minutes in suburban or
rural areas, and as quickly as possible in wilderness areas. EBRPD responds to all incidents as
quickly as possible. In 2007, EBRPD’s 90th percentile response time was 18 minutes and its
median response time for all calls was 12 minutes. Although EBRPD met response time
guidelines for suburban or rural areas in most instances, it did not meet the guidelines 90 percent
of the time due to the remote locations of many incidents.
According to Contra Costa Local Agency Formation Commission, EBRPD fire stations have
significant deficiencies, as many are merely unstaffed storage sheds for equipment (Burr
Consulting 2009). Rather than undertaking major improvements to the old stations, EBRPD
prefers to construct new stations and demolish the older stations. This is due in part because none
of the existing fire stations have sleeping quarters, and EBRPD is often requested to perform
overnight fire-watches by Cal Fire.
The CCCFPD provides fire suppression, paramedic emergency medical services, technical
rescue, water rescue, and fire prevention and investigation services to much of the County
(Contra Costa County Fire Protection District 2010). The CCCFPD operates 30 fire stations and
responds to approximately 45,000 incidents annually. CCCFPD’s service area includes the City,
including Contra Loma. The nearest fire stations to Contra Loma are Station 83 at 2717
Gentrytown Drive, approximately 1.5 miles north of Contra Loma, and Station 82 on Bluerock
Drive between Lonetree Way and Boulder Drive, approximately 1.25 miles east of Contra Loma
(City of Antioch 2003b).
Police Service

EBRPD operates an independent Public Safety Division that patrols its entire regional park
system, including Contra Loma. At the height of the summer season, the Public Safety Division
is staffed by approximately 500 personnel, with 67 sworn police officers who derive their

3-18 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

authority under California Penal Code Section 830.1. In addition, the division employs 195
seasonal lifeguards, 175 members in Volunteer Trail Safety Patrols, and 48 firefighters (see “Fire
Protection” above). Specialized units include the Air Support Unit, Marine Patrol, Equestrian
Patrols, K-9 Unit, Special Enforcement Unit, Investigations Unit, and a 24-hour 9-1-1
Communications Center.
Contra Loma is located in Beat 2 of the EBRPD Police Department (East Bay Regional Park
District 2010a). A substation of the EBRPD Public Safety Division is located within the
Regional Park in the former park residence (East Bay Regional Park District 2011b). EBRPD
public safety officers regularly patrol EBRPD parklands. In addition, the park is patrolled by
helicopter as part of EBRPD’s routine park management program. Initial response and reporting
of incidents is generally provided by park rangers performing routine maintenance and safety
patrols, although members of the public sometimes report incidents directly to the Antioch police
or the CCCFPD. The Volunteer Trail Safety Patrol supports the EBRPD staff. Patrol members
educate park visitors about EBRPD resources, programs, facilities, and rules. They operate in an
observe-and-report role, working to foster positive relationships among user groups. Volunteers
also assist with other related services within the parks.
The Antioch Police Department provides crime prevention and law enforcement services within
the City’s boundaries, including backup services to Contra Loma (City of Antioch 2003a).
Operating from a central station at 300 L Street, the Antioch Police Department maintains a
combination of professional sworn officers, non-sworn positions, and volunteer positions. The
City is divided into six geographical areas, or beats. Beat 3 encompasses the western and
southwestern portions of the City, including Contra Loma (City of Antioch 2003b). Police calls
are categorized by the City’s Police Department under the following priorities:
•

Priority 1 designates crimes in progress or life-threatening situations.

•

Priority 2 designates calls that demand immediate attention, but are not crimes in
progress or life threatening situations.

•

Priority 3 designates those calls that do not require immediate response and can be dealt
with as soon as is practical.

In 2000, response times in Beat 3 were 7:02 minutes for Priority 1 calls; 11:27 minutes for
Priority 2 calls; and 27:30 minutes for Priority 3 calls (City of Antioch 2003b). As of July 2011,
the police department reports that the Community Park has been the site of three grand thefts, but
no automobile thefts or personal crimes (City of Antioch 2011a).
Boating and Swimming

Water-related recreation at the Contra Loma Reservoir is managed by EBRPD and is open yearround for anglers and boats up to 17 feet long. CCWD operates the reservoir for domestic water
supply. CDPH prohibits body contact recreation in water supply reservoirs. To comply with this
prohibition, in June 2002 EBRPD placed the following restrictions on activities permitted in the
reservoir (Contra Costa Water District 2009):

3-19 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

No body contact swimming is allowed in the main reservoir. Swimming may only be
done in the swim lagoon.

•

Kayaking (with a self-bailing bilge) and windsurfing are allowed only after an individual
has showered at the installed outdoor shower. Wetsuits must be worn by windsurfers and
float tubers.

•

Recreational boating is only allowed for boats powered by electric motors, sails, or
paddles and oars. No gasoline-powered engines are allowed.

The swim lagoon is separated from the reservoir by a concrete-lined earthen berm that has a
built-in synthetic liner. The lagoon water is circulated through a drainage and pumping system,
which includes an on-site treatment plant; and the water is chlorinated using sodium
hypochlorite. Wastewater from the treatment plant is discharged to the sanitary sewer. The
lagoon water does not mix with the water in the main body of the reservoir at any time.
For safety reasons, swimming is permitted in the swim lagoon only when a lifeguard is on duty.
The lagoon is open daily during summer and on weekends during April, May, and September
(East Bay Regional Park District 2008).
In 2009, there were 956 boaters recorded at Contra Loma Reservoir, and in 2010, there were 911.
Many more people go to Contra Loma to swim than to use boats, with more than 57,000
swimmers recorded in 2010. Table 3-2 provides a summary of lifeguard activity at the swim
lagoon from 2006 to 2010.

Natural Hazards

Hiking trails can bring the public into contact with wildlife and natural pests, including snakes,
ticks, and mosquitoes.

3-20 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

EBRPD has prepared a public information pamphlet on the various types of snakes that are
present on its properties (East Bay Regional Park District 2005). The pamphlet emphasizes how
to avoid snakes, their value to the ecosystem, and emergency procedures in case of snakebite.
General Public Safety

Even though CCWD manages and operates Contra Loma Reservoir, Reclamation maintains
ultimate jurisdiction over the reservoir as a water supply facility of the CVP. The 20-acre
Reclamation Zone north of the dam is reserved for operation and maintenance of the facility.
Access to this area is restricted to authorized personnel only.
The City Office of Emergency Services provides disaster preparedness information and training
to City residents (City of Antioch 2011b). The City maintains a community emergency disaster
warning system using television and radio to address the full range of potential emergencies,
including earthquakes, severe winter storms, wildland fires, and hazardous materials events.
Contra Loma contains paved and unpaved hiking, bicycling, and equestrian trails. EBRPD
strongly encourages all bicycle riders to wear helmets while using trails.
Dogs are allowed off leash in open spaces and undeveloped areas of the Regional Park; these
areas must be at least 100 yards from developed areas or separated by fences. Dogs on leashes
are allowed in parking lots, picnic sites, lawns, and other developed areas. However, dogs are not
permitted at the swim lagoon or on the beach, in wetlands or marshes, or in designated nature
study areas (East Bay Regional Park District 2011c).

3.7

Hydrology

3.7.1

Existing Conditions

Contra Loma Recreation Area generally drains to the north from the foothills of the Diablo
Range toward the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). About 350 acres of the 741-acre
recreation area drains to Contra Loma Reservoir and the remainder drains to the municipal
reservoir east of Contra Loma, the Contra Costa Canal, or the City’s storm drain system.
Contra Loma Reservoir

Contra Loma Dam is 107 feet high, and its crest is 30 feet wide and 1,050 feet long. Contra
Loma Reservoir is classified as an off-stream reservoir, which means that its water is primarily
supplied from a source other than direct surface runoff. The reservoir is impounded by Contra
Loma Dam and by two dikes along its eastern shore (Contra Costa Water District 2009). The
majority of the reservoir’s water originates in the Delta and is made available under Contract No.
175r-3401A-LTR1 between Reclamation and CCWD. Water for the reservoir is diverted from
the Delta at the Rock Slough and Old River intake sites, and is then conveyed by the Contra
Costa Canal to Contra Loma where it is pumped uphill from the canal to the reservoir. The
pumping plant is located near the toe of the dam and uses three pumps that can deliver a
combined maximum of up to 21.16 cubic feet per second of water to the reservoir.
The reservoir also catches a small amount of surface runoff from the Oil Canyon watershed,
which drains a portion of the Diablo Range to the southeast of Contra Loma. Runoff from Oil

3-21 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Canyon comingles with the water pumped from the Contra Costa Canal and is used by CCWD.
Water that flows over the spillway during unusual storm events goes into the City’s storm drain
system and eventually drains to the Delta.
The reservoir’s total watershed is about 680 acres; about 350 acres of which are within the
Regional Park. Most of remaining acres are located in EBRPD’s Black Diamond Mines Regional
Preserve located adjacent to the southern boundary of Contra Loma (Figure 3-4). The portion of
the reservoir’s watershed that lies within the recreation area is roughly bound by the rolling hills
to the west and south, and by the Regional Park’s main entrance road. The Community Park does
not drain to the reservoir and, therefore, is not located within its watershed.
Soils within the reservoir’s watershed are made up primarily of clays, and its land cover is
characterized by grass, brush, and some tree cover. These conditions indicate a good potential for
surface runoff; however, the watershed’s relatively small area limits the amount of precipitation
that is captured.
In order to quantify the amount of surface runoff captured by the reservoir’s contributing
watershed, an approximate hydraulic model was developed using the Soil Conservation Service
(SCS) method outlined in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds (States Department of
Agriculture 1986) in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers’ (Corps) Hydraulic
Modeling Software (HEC-HMS). This method estimates surface runoff using a number of
parameters, including watershed area, watershed length, slope, soil type(s), and rainfall.
The SCS method assigns an empirical parameter called the SCS Curve Number to each
hydrologic soil group to help predict the surface runoff associated with the soil type. The soil
type in this watershed consists mostly of the Altamont-Fontana complex underneath lightly
grazed open pasture and grasslands, resulting in an average curve number of 71 (Department of
Agriculture 1986).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

In general, hydraulic modeling is used to predict the amount of surface runoff for 10-, 20-, 50-,
and 100-year storm events so that downstream facilities can be designed to accommodate those
flow regimes. Because the reservoir’s watershed is relatively small and the only downstream
facility is the reservoir, the hydraulic model was designed to estimate only the total monthly
runoff based on average monthly precipitation for the City (Figure 3-5).

Average Monthly Precipitation (inches)

Figure 3-5.

Average Monthly Precipitation for Antioch, CA

The following worst-case scenario assumptions were built into the reservoir watershed model:
the soil within the watershed is assumed to be saturated before the rainfall event and the average
monthly rainfall is distributed on a continuous basis throughout the entire month. These
assumptions tend to produce a higher estimate of the total runoff volumes, and actual runoff
volumes may be lower depending on existing conditions.

3-25 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

The results from the HEC-HMS model are illustrated in Figure 3-6. As shown, the Contra Loma
Reservoir receives nearly all of its surface runoff from November through March. The total
yearly amount of runoff is only about 106.5 acre-feet, which is equal to about 4 percent of the
reservoir’s total storage capacity.

Average Surface Runoff (acre-feet)

Figure 3-6.

Average Monthly Surface Runoff into Contra Loma Reservoir

The contributing watershed area within the recreation area boundary accounts for approximately
51 percent of the total watershed area. Because the soil types within the recreation area are
generally similar to one another, it is reasonable to assume that about 51 percent of the total
surface runoff volume is generated within the recreation area boundary. Based on this
assumption, runoff from within the recreation area equals about 2 percent of the reservoir’s total
storage capacity.
Other Drainages

About 350 acres of the 741-acre recreation area drains to the Contra Loma Reservoir, and the
remainder drains elsewhere. Approximately 95 acres in the southeast corner of the recreation
area drain to an unnamed creek that parallels Frederickson Lane and which then flows into the
municipal reservoir (Figure 3-4). Another 89 acres on the east side of the recreation area drain
east overland toward the municipal reservoir. Approximately 160 acres in the northeast corner of
the recreation area (including the Community Park) drain northward toward the Contra Costa
Canal. Some of this water may be pumped into Contra Loma Reservoir, and the rest flows
westward toward other CCWD facilities. Approximately 33 acres in the northwest portion of the
recreation area drain to the northwest toward the adjacent neighborhood, where flows join the
3-26 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

City’s storm drain system. Approximately 14 acres drain west toward an unnamed creek that
flows northward to the City’s storm drain system.
Reservoir Operations

Contra Loma Reservoir has a maximum capacity of 2,627 acre-feet at a maximum stage height
of 211 feet (i.e., the spillway elevation). The reservoir surface area is 115 acres at the spillway
elevation (Contra Costa Water District 2009). Under typical operating conditions, reservoir
storage ranges between approximately 690 and 2,000 acre-feet, depending on supply needs and
hydrologic conditions (Contra Costa Water District 2009). From 2005 to 2009 the dam was
operated at stage elevations between 190.80 feet and 205.70 feet (1,179 acre-feet and 2,152 acrefeet, respectively), with an average monthly stage elevation of 202.19 feet (1,887 acre-feet). As
shown in Figure 3-7, stage elevations during that period varied widely during the rainy season
(November to March) but typically remained at an elevation of around 204 feet during dry
months (Contra Costa Water District, unpublished data).

Figure 3-7.

Reservoir Elevation Changes (2005-2009)

Because Contra Loma Reservoir is not a principal water storage reservoir, the dam is not actively
managed on a daily basis. Figure 3-7 is a graphical representaion of the average yearly changes
in reservoir level from 2005 through 2009. As shown in Figure 3-8, reservoir storage did not
change on 46 percent of the days during this period. On days when storage was adjusted, the
most common daily stage differential was about 0.1 feet. This increment equates to between 5
and 8 acre-feet of water exchange per day (depending on stage height), with 8 acre-feet being the
statistical mode (Contra Costa Water District, unpublished data).

Contra Loma Reservoir undergoes an operational change in storage.

The amount of water stored in the reservoir decreases more often than it increases, which
indicates that the water is released from the reservoir more often than it is pumped in (Figure
3-8). However, Figures 3-9 and 3-10 show that reservoir releases occur at lower rates (typically
at 8 acre-feet per day) when compared with storage additions (typically between 9 and 39 acrefeet per day) (Contra Costa Water District, unpublished data).
From 2005 through 2009, most operational activity occurred during the months of April and
May, with reservoir storage decreasing in April by an average of 341.80 acre-feet and reservoir
storage increasing in May by an average of 356.80 acre-feet. During this period, the range of the
elevation change in the reservoir in April and May averaged 4.79 and 5.06 feet, respectively. For
all other months, total monthly storage increases averaged 52.40 acre-feet while monthly
decreases averaged 49.77 acre-feet (Contra Costa Water District, unpublished data).

Water Quality

3.8.1

Existing Conditions

Water quality in Contra Loma Reservoir is heavily influenced by the primary source of its water:
the Delta. Water for the reservoir is diverted from the Delta at the Rock Slough and Old River
intake sites and is then conveyed by the Contra Costa Canal to Contra Loma, where it is pumped
uphill from the canal to the reservoir. The canal also periodically conveys water returned from
Contra Loma Reservoir and other CCWD system storage reservoirs during periods when those
reservoirs are at full storage capacity.
Potential Sources of Contamination within the Reservoir Watershed

The watershed that drains into the reservoir is about 680 acres. About 350 acres of the reservoir’s
watershed are within the Regional Park, and most of the remaining area is located in EBRPD’s
Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve, which is located adjacent to the southern boundary of
Contra Loma. The Community Park does not drain to the reservoir and, therefore, does not
contribute contaminants to the reservoir. Several land uses, activities, and natural sources within
the reservoir’s watershed have the potential to affect the quality of the reservoir water.
Recreational activity in the Regional Park has the potential to affect reservoir water quality,
although EBRPD and CCWD manage recreation in a manner that protects water quality. As
described previously, body contact with the reservoir is highly restricted to protect the reservoir’s
domestic water supply from human-borne pathogens and viruses. The swim lagoon is
hydrologically separated from the reservoir, thereby ensuring that lagoon water does not enter
the reservoir; however, overflow of the swim lagoon could temporarily compromise water
quality within the reservoir if its treatment system fails, although the likelihood of failure and
resulting contamination is remote.
To further minimize body contact with the reservoir, windsurfers must shower before entering
the water and wear wet suits. Kayaks and canoes are allowed on the reservoir, but paddlers using
self-bailing kayaks must shower before launching and wear wet suits while boating. No gasolinepowered engines are allowed on the reservoir to prevent contamination from petroleum products
and exhaust byproducts. All boats are inspected by trained staff prior to launching in order to
protect the reservoir against infestation by non-native quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis
bugensis) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), collectively referred to as dreissenids. No
wet boats or gear are allowed on the reservoir.
Equestrian activities and dog walking have the potential to introduce animal waste into the
reservoir through surface runoff; however, plastic waste bags are provided in various locations
and dog owners are encouraged to dispose of dog waste in garbage cans. In addition, hiking,
biking, and equestrian activities can cause small amounts of localized erosion, and the resulting
sediment can be transported to the reservoir by surface runoff.
Cattle grazing is allowed on 454 acres of grasslands surrounding the reservoir in accordance with
the grazing license issued by EBRPD for the purpose of fire suppression (Figure 1-2). Most of
the grazing in the recreation area is within the reservoir’s watershed. Grazing within the
watershed also occurs in the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve, which is located
upstream from Contra Loma. Cattle grazing can impair water quality not only through transport

3-30 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

of feces from surface runoff, but also through the process of cattle-induced erosion and
subsequent transport of sediment. Within Contra Loma, grazing is rotated between multiple
enclosures, and cattle are not allowed near the reservoir itself to protect water quality; however,
one small ephemeral stream flows through the southern part of the grazed area into the reservoir.
This ephemeral stream could transport fecal matter and sediment directly into the reservoir.
The restrooms and showers at the park office near the swim lagoon are connected to the City’s
sewer service. Chemical toilets are also located in various parts of the Regional Park to
supplement the permanent facilities. All restroom facilities are inspected and maintained at
regular intervals by EBRPD staff or contractors. Restrooms and portable toilets that are properly
used and maintained represent a very limited potential source of biological contamination to the
reservoir. However, improper use, plumbing system failure, or accidental spills or overflow of
portable toilets could cause contamination.
The fish cleaning facility located adjacent to the boat launch area of the marina often
contaminates the reservoir due to improper disposal of fish cleaning waste. EBRPD has proposed
relocating the fish cleaning facility away from the reservoir to prevent this from occurring.
Reclamation is currently preparing separate environmental documentation for this project.
Other potential sources of contamination include chemical and sediment runoff from roads and
parking lots, animal waste from local and transient wildlife, litter, potential spills or runoff from
portable chemical toilets, human waste deposited outside of a designated restroom, and natural
erosion and sedimentation processes.
Water Quality Protection

Section 303 of the Federal Clean Water Act requires states to adopt water quality standards that
designate uses of navigable waters and associated water quality standards. The California Water
Code (Section 13240) requires preparation and adoption of water quality control plans (i.e., basin
plans). Basin plans are implemented by each Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB).
Basin plans consist of a designation or establishment of beneficial uses to be protected for the
waters within a specified area, water quality objectives to protect those uses, and an
implementation program needed for achieving the objectives. Basin plans identify both numeric
and narrative water quality objectives that apply to all surface waters in the basin. Delta waters
and the Contra Loma Reservoir are covered in the Water Quality Control Plan for the
Sacramento River and San Joaquin River Basins prepared by the Central Valley RWQCB
(Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board 2009). This basin plan covers all of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins. Beneficial uses of the Contra Loma Reservoir include
municipal and domestic drinking water supply, recreation, warm freshwater habitat, and wildlife
habitat.
Drinking water quality is regulated at the Federal, state, and local levels. The Safe Drinking
Water Act (SDWA) is the main Federal law that ensures the quality of drinking water in the U.S.
The SDWA authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set national health-based
standards for drinking water to protect against both naturally occurring and man-made
contaminants that may be found in drinking water. The EPA also oversees the states, localities,
and water suppliers who implement these standards. States are given primary enforcement
responsibility for public water systems in their state if they meet certain requirements.

3-31 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

In California, Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR) sets numeric primary and
secondary drinking water standards to protect public health. California’s standards meet or
exceed the standards set forth in the Federal SDWA. The CDPH oversees water quality
regulations for public water systems through its Drinking Water Program. In addition to Title 22
drinking water standards, Section 115825(b) of the California Health and Safety Code prohibits
recreational body contact with reservoirs that store water for domestic use. Much of CCWD’s
water quality monitoring at the Contra Loma Reservoir is performed to ensure compliance with
Title 22 provisions.
Title 22 provides primary drinking water standards, called maximum contaminant levels
(MCLs), for 92 contaminants. Numerical MCLs are provided for 90 of these contaminants, and
treatment techniques are provided for the two contaminants for which MCLs are not feasible.
These primary contaminants include inorganic chemicals such as aluminum, antimony, and
arsenic; radionuclides such as uranium and radium; volatile organic chemicals such as benzene
and carbon tetrachloride; non-volatile synthetic organic chemicals such as chlordane; and
disinfection byproducts such as bromate. Title 22 also includes secondary MCLs for 16
contaminants such as copper and iron as well as physical attributes such as color and odor.
The EPA developed the Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule to provide
additional protection for drinking water from disease-causing microorganisms sometimes found
in surface water sources. These microorganisms include water-borne pathogens such as
Cryptosporidium and Giardia that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, or stomach cramps as well as
other health risks. Cryptosporidium is a significant concern in drinking water because it may
contaminate surface waters used as drinking water sources, it is resistant to chlorine and other
disinfectants, and it has caused waterborne disease outbreaks in other public water systems.
Consuming water with Cryptosporidium can cause gastrointestinal illness that may be severe in
people with weakened immune systems such as infants and the elderly and may be fatal in
people with severely compromised immune systems such as cancer and Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome patients. Other pathogens of concern regulated by EPA and CDPH include
Escherichia coli (E. coli) and other coliform bacteria.
Dreissenids represent another type of hazard to public drinking water systems. Once established,
these non-native mussels can clog water intake and delivery pipes and other infrastructure,
requiring costly maintenance and repairs to drinking water systems. These mussels also adhere to
boats and pilings, foul recreational beaches, compete with native mussels, disrupt natural food
webs, and bioaccumulate toxins. Quagga and zebra mussels were first detected in the Great
Lakes in the late 1980s and have since spread unchecked throughout much of the eastern U.S. In
January 2007, the first population of dreissenid mussels in the western U.S. was discovered in
Lake Mead, and they have recently been found in several California reservoirs.
The Contra Loma Reservoir supports populations of Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea), a
freshwater species native to Asia. Asiatic clams live in many reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and canals
in California, including the Delta. The clam is also found throughout much of the U.S.
(Geological Survey 2011). These clams burrow in reservoir sediments. Certain short-term water
quality conditions can occasionally cause large clam die-offs, causing the clam shells to release
the dead clam bodies, which float to the surface. These die-offs can affect water quality and
create unpleasant odors (Contra Costa Water District 2010a). Asiatic clams have been known to
3-32 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

clog water intake and delivery pipes and other infrastructure in reservoirs, thereby increasing
operating costs (Geological Survey 2011).
Water Quality Monitoring Programs

CCWD has instituted several water quality monitoring programs in support of regulatory
compliance and for operations and maintenance of its water system infrastructure (Contra Costa
Water District 2010b). CCWD monitors water quality in the reservoir for Title 22 primary and
secondary drinking water standards and to meet the requirements of Compliance Order No. 0204-97CO-007 (as amended) pertaining to microbiological (e.g., Cryptosporidium, E. coli,
Giardia) water quality in the reservoir after completion of the swim lagoon. This order was
issued to CCWD by the DOHS (predecessor to CDPH).
Physical analysis and water quality testing for inorganic pollutants and synthetic and volatile
organic chemicals occurs annually in October. Testing for asbestos is performed every 9 years,
with the next sampling event scheduled for 2017. Radiochemistry testing is performed every 3
years, usually during the first week of January. Microbiology testing is performed monthly.
CCWD also tests the reservoir water for physical parameters such as temperature, pH, and
dissolved oxygen; phytoplankton; quagga and zebra mussels; non-native aquatic plant species;
and stratification.
CCWD’s water quality testing indicates that chemical and biological contamination of the
reservoir rarely occurs. Between 2006 and 2010, CCWD sampled and tested for 194 different
water quality analytes, including microbes. Only two of the non-microbial analytes had at least
one sample that was equal to or exceeded its MCL (Contra Costa Water District 2010c). These
analytes are color and iron, and both are derived from natural sources within the reservoir
watershed as shown in Table 3-3.

Every month, CCWD tests for biological pathogens by sampling reservoir water in two
locations: near the dam and near the swim lagoon in the vicinity of the former swimming beach.
This testing helps monitor the effectiveness of the swim lagoon at controlling human
introduction of microbial pathogens into the reservoir. CCWD tests for E. coli, fecal coliform
bacteria, nonsheen bacteria, and total coliform at the former beach. E. coli is an indicator of
possible fecal contamination. Fecal coliform are specific to warm-blooded animals, and serve as

indicators of human waste contamination. Total coliform includes bacteria found not only in
mammal waste, but also in soils. CCWD tests for these pathogens as well as Cryptosporidium
and Giardia at the dam.
CCWD testing data show that pathogens in the reservoir are generally well below standards most
of the time. However, total coliform levels have often exceeded standards and E. coli and fecal
coliform have occasionally exceeded standards (Contra Costa Water District 2010c). As shown
in Table 3-4, E. coli and fecal coliform exceeded standards in at least one sample each from both
the dam and the former beach sites; however, median count values for E. coli and fecal coliform
remained low, indicating that microbial levels for these pathogens remain low most of the time.
It is also important to note that the median and maximum levels for these pathogens at the dam
were equal to or higher than those at the former beach, suggesting that Delta water, which enters
the reservoir at the dam, is the primary source of these pathogens.

Approximately 38 percent of the samples collected at the former beach and 59 percent of the
samples collected at the dam contained total coliform levels above the standard. Importantly, the
median and maximum levels for total coliform were higher at the dam than the former beach,
again suggesting that Delta water is the primary source of these bacteria. Although total coliform
levels are not a direct indicator of microbial contamination, increased counts may indicate fecal
sources of contamination. Giardia and Cryptosporidium counts were well below standards at the
dam and do not appear to cause water quality problems for the reservoir.
CCWD monitoring has not identified any adult quagga or zebra mussels or veligers (the freefloating larval form of dreissenids) in Contra Loma reservoir (Contra Costa Water District
2010c).

Vegetation

3.9.1

Existing Conditions

Contra Loma Recreation Area is designated by the EBRPD as an open space area with developed
recreation occurring in limited areas. As a result, vegetation at Contra Loma has been retained in
or restored to its natural state to the extent feasible for an area that has been cultivated, grazed, or
inhabited by Euro-Americans since the mid-1800s.
Vegetation Communities Assessment

The vegetation communities described in this section are classified based on the habitat
descriptions provided in A Guide to Wildlife Habitats of California (Mayer and Laudenslayer Jr.
1988), which is a component of the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship (CWHR) System
(California Department of Fish and Game 2011) used by CDFW. The CWHR habitat types
present within Contra Loma include annual grassland, blue oak woodland, valley foothill
riparian, fresh emergent wetland, riverine, lacustrine, urban, and barren. Field reconnaissance
surveys of the study area were conducted by Reclamation’s consultant North State Resources,
Inc. (NSR) on October 20 and 22, 2010 by walking meandering transects that covered all
habitats. Observations were made at each distinct habitat unit and the dominant plant species
were recorded. Any areas that appeared suitable for special-status species were noted. Potentially
significant features were also documented with photographs (Appendix F.1). On March 30,
2011, NSR conducted a focused botanical survey for stinkbells (Fritillaria agrestis), a plant
classified by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) as California Rare Plant Rank (RPR)
4.2, uncommon in California. The locations of stinkbells occurrences were mapped using a
Trimble Pathfinder Pro XH GPS capable of sub-foot accuracy.
The descriptions and locations of aquatic, wetland, and riparian habitats are based on the
reconnaissance-level surveys performed in October 2010, which did not include a formal
delineation of these features or a determination of their Corps jurisdictional status. The habitat
assessment is intended to provide a general description of the types of wetland and aquatic
features at Contra Loma, including intermittent streams, seasonal wetlands, fresh emergent
wetlands, riparian habitat, and open water. The jurisdictional boundaries and wetland
classifications of the aquatic features at Contra Loma are subject to refinement if or when a
formal delineation is performed.
Each of the habitats at Contra Loma is described below; Figure 3-11 illustrates the location and
areal extent of these habitats and Table 3-5 provides acreages and percentages for all habitats at
Contra Loma.
Upland Habitats

There are five upland habitats present at Contra Loma: annual grassland, valley foothill riparian,
blue oak woodland, urban, and barren.
Annual Grassland Annual grassland is the dominant habitat at Contra Loma, covering 73
percent of the study area. The annual grassland at Contra Loma has historically been grazed and
is composed primarily of non-native grasses and forbs. Dominant grasses and forbs include
smooth brome (Bromus hordeaceus), slender wild oats (Avena barbata), Italian rye grass

Five very large valley oak trees (Quercus lobata) are present within the annual grassland habitat
near the northeast corner of Contra Loma. These trees are very old (estimated between 50 and
150 years of age) and are important for their habitat value and acorn production. They may also
be historically, culturally, and visually important to the community. The locations of these trees
are shown in Figure 3-11.
Valley Foothill Riparian The valley foothill riparian habitat covers a little more than 1 percent
of Contra Loma, and is primarily present along the intermittent stream corridors downslope from
the Contra Loma and Antioch Municipal reservoirs near the northern boundary of the recreation
area. Narrow fringes of valley foothill riparian habitat also occur along portions of the Contra
Loma Reservoir shoreline. These areas are prone to periodic saturation or inundation from
precipitation, high reservoir levels, irrigation runoff from the sports fields and landscaped areas,
or possibly from seepage from Antioch Municipal Reservoir.
The valley foothill riparian habitat is composed mostly of large valley oaks, cottonwoods
(Populus fremontii), and red willows (Salix laevigata), with an understory of Himalayan
blackberry (Rubus discolor), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and mulefat (Baccharis
salicifolia). The narrow band of riparian habitat along the Contra Loma Reservoir is primarily
composed of willows (Salix spp.) and mulefat.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Blue Oak Woodland Blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland occurs on the north-facing slope
of a hillside in the southwest corner of Contra Loma (Figure 3-11). Blue oak is the dominant tree
species in this scattered woodland. Interior live oak (Q. wislizenii) is a minor component of this
habitat, and the understory is an extension of the surrounding annual grassland. The blue oak
woodland within Contra Loma, which covers approximately 1.8 percent of the study area, is
contiguous with blue oak woodland that is scattered along the hillslopes to the west and south
towards Mount Diablo.
Urban About 6.5 percent of the recreation area is classified as urban. Vegetation communities
found in urban settings vary widely and are typically characterized by areas where the native
vegetation has been mostly or entirely cleared for residential, commercial, industrial,
transportation, or recreational uses. Urban vegetation communities are usually composed of
irrigated lawns, ornamental plantings, and trees that have been retained from the original habitat,
or planted for landscaping or shade.
The CWHR categorizes urban habitat into five different vegetation structure types: tree grove,
street strip, shade tree/lawn, lawn, and shrub cover. Tree groves are often located in urban parks,
green belts, and cemeteries. Urban tree groves may vary in tree height, spacing, crown shape,
and understory conditions, but generally have a continuous canopy. Street strip vegetation is
located along roadsides and typically includes a ground cover of grass. Shade tree/lawn areas are
characteristic residential and recreational landscapes and often mimic the appearance of natural
savannas. Lawns are composed of a variety of grasses that are continuous and are maintained at a
uniform height, irrigated, and fertilized. Shrub cover refers to areas that are commonly
landscaped and maintained with hedges, as typically found in commercial districts.
The five types of urban vegetation structure often occur in various combinations, creating habitat
complexity, which can be more valuable to wildlife than any one individual unit (California
Department of Fish and Game 2011).
At Contra Loma, the urban habitat includes four of the five vegetation structure types: tree
grove, street strip, shade tree/lawn, and lawn. All of these vegetation structure types are shown
collectively as urban habitat in Figure 3-11. The urban habitat is most prevalent in the picnic
areas and sports fields. Native trees that occur within the urban area at Contra Loma include
Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), black walnut (Juglans californica var. hindsii), Fremont
cottonwood, blue oak, valley oak, and interior live oak. Non-native landscaping trees include fig
(Ficus sp.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) associated with a historic residence.
Barren Barren habitat is defined by a relative absence of vegetation. Any vegetation
community with less than 2 percent total herbaceous vegetation cover and less than 10 percent
cover by tree or shrub species is considered barren. Contra Loma is approximately 5 percent
barren. Barren area can include both urban and ruderal (i.e., disturbed or weedy) settings where
the vegetation is sparse, as defined by the percent cover criteria. Two types of barren areas are
defined within Contra Loma (Figure 3-11): gravel/compacted dirt, such as that found in gravel
and dirt roads and parking areas, and hardscape, such as that found in paved roads and paved
parking areas.

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Wetland and Aquatic Communities

Three wetland and aquatic habitats occur within Contra Loma: riverine, fresh emergent wetland,
and lacustrine. These communities cover approximately 11 percent of the study area, and the
location and areal extent of these habitats is shown in Figure 3-11.
Riverine The riverine habitat is typically associated with a linear body of water flowing in a
channel with a defined bed and bank. These linear water bodies can flow perennially,
intermittently, or ephemerally, depending on water input.
•

Perennial streams have flowing water year-round during a typical year, and the water
table is located above the streambed for most of the year. Groundwater is the primary
source of water for stream flow. Runoff from rainfall is a supplemental source of water.

•

Intermittent streams have flowing water during certain times of the year, when
groundwater provides water for stream flow. During dry periods, intermittent streams
may not have flowing water. Runoff from rainfall is a supplemental source of water.

•

Ephemeral streams depend on precipitation, so they typically only flow during and after
rain or other precipitation. Ephemeral streambeds are located above the water table yearround. Groundwater is not an important source of water for ephemeral streams.

Riverine habitat commonly includes hydrophytic (water-loving) vegetation, which can either
grow from the stream bottom or along the banks. This vegetation can be sparse when water
volume and movement are substantial or can be dense in slower moving waterways where plants
can root themselves easily.
A small amount (0.5 percent) of the riverine community within Contra Loma consists of
intermittent streams. Portions of these streams have sufficient water flow and scour to discourage
the colonization of hydrophytic plants. Flatter stream sections have slow-moving water, which
allows water to collect and saturate the soil while promoting the growth of seasonal wetland
plants in and along the margins of these drainages. While still classified as a riverine habitat,
these areas also exhibit characteristics of seasonal wetland habitat. Both the steeper and the
flatter portions of these streams are mapped as riverine in Figure 3-11, with the areas that are
more channelized and lacking vegetation sub-classified as intermittent streams and the areas
where seasonal ponding occurs sub-classified as seasonal wetlands. Common wetland plants in
the riverine habitat include ryegrass (Lolium spp.), curly dock (Rumex crispus), hyssop
loosestrife (Lythrum hyssopifolium), Baltic rush (Juncus balticus), flowering quillwort (Lilaea
scilloides), cattails (Typha spp.), dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum), nutsedge (Cyperus
eragrostis), and cocklebur (Xanthium spp.).
Fresh Emergent Wetland The fresh emergent wetland habitat is typically associated with a
year-round water source. This habitat is typically dominated by plant species that are erect,
rooted, herbaceous, and hydrophytic, and that are adapted to conditions of prolonged inundation.
Common plant species present in this vegetative community include perennial wetland species
such as cattails and tules (Scirpus spp.). In some cases, fresh emergent wetlands can occur in
areas with less frequent inundation where they can often support a wider variety of water-tolerant
plants. Within Contra Loma, dense fresh emergent wetland vegetation is located along several

3-40 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

sections of the reservoir’s southern shoreline. These areas support abundant cattails and tules, as
well as several willow species. In the northeast corner of Contra Loma, there is an area that is
frequently saturated and that supports fresh emergent wetland vegetation. This wetland is similar
in composition to those found around the reservoir shoreline and is composed primarily of
cattails, rushes (Juncus spp.), tules, and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). Approximately 8
acres of fresh emergent wetland are found in the Contra Loma Recreation Area.
Lacustrine. The lacustrine habitat is characterized by open water that is too deep for emergent
vegetation to become established. In Contra Loma, the plant-free portion of the reservoir is
lacustrine habitat, and covers approximately 9.2 percent of the area. Eurasian watermilfoil
(Myriophyllum spicatum) is a non-native aquatic plant which grows along some portions of the
reservoir shoreline. Mats of watermilfoil can inhibit recreational use by entangling boat
propellers and fishing lines.
Restoration Area. Several vegetation restoration areas are treated as inclusions within the
annual grassland habitat (Figure 3-11). These areas are locations where EBRPD has endeavored
to cultivate native plants and/or create quail habitat. Native trees and shrubs have been planted
just south of the gravel/dirt parking areas on the south side of the reservoir. EBRPD has also
placed brush piles adjacent to portions of the restoration area to provide shade and cover for
quails. Another plant restoration area has been designated along the intermittent stream located
near the southwest corner of the reservoir. At this location, the stream has been fenced off with
wire mesh to protect the young plants from damage caused by herbivores such as cows and deer.
Typical restoration plantings include young saplings of ash (Fraxinus sp.), willow, and oaks. The
restoration plantings are treated as inclusions in the annual grassland habitat since they are not
yet well established and provide minimal cover.
Special-Status Plant Species

This section discusses special-status plant species that occur in the region and describes the
potential for these plants to occur within Contra Loma. For the purpose of this evaluation,
special-status plant species include plants that are (1) listed as threatened or endangered under
the California Endangered Species Act or the Federal Endangered Species Act; (2) designated as
rare by CDFW; (3) state or Federal candidate or proposed species for listing as threatened or
endangered; (4) listed by the CNPS as having a California RPR of 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, or 3; or other
special status conveyed by CNPS.
A list of special-status plant species considered in this assessment was compiled by obtaining an
official species list from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Sacramento Office for the
Antioch South, California U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) quadrangle (Fish and Wildlife
Service 2013) (Appendix F.2); performing queries for records contained within the California
Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) for the Antioch South, California USGS quadrangle
(California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a) (Appendix F.3.1) and the CNPS on-line
inventory for the Antioch South, California USGS quadrangle and eight surrounding quadrangles
(California Native Plant Society 2013) (Appendix F.4); by reviewing botanical literature for the
region; and by reviewing existing programmatic documents relating to the use and operation of
Contra Loma. These efforts identified 59 special-status plant species known to occur in the
vicinity of Contra Loma. These plant species were then reviewed to determine the potential for
each species to occur within Contra Loma based on the presence or absence of suitable habitat.

EBRPD botanist Wilde Legard was also consulted as part of the review process as he has
surveyed and monitored the habitats at Contra Loma for over 13 years (Legard, pers. comm.
2011).
No Federally listed or state-listed plants were determined to have the potential to occur within
Contra Loma (Appendix F.5); however, the following five special-status plants were determined
to have a low potential to occur within Contra Loma:
•

big tarplant (Blepharizonia plumosa) (RPR 1B.1);

•

round-leaved filaree (California macrophylla) (RPR 1B.1);

•

Mt. Diablo fairy lantern (Calochortus pulchellus) (RPR 1B.2);

•

Diablo helianthella (Helianthella castanea) (RPR 1B.2); and

•

San Antonio Hills monardella (Monardella antonina ssp. antonina) (RPR 3).

Contra Loma is surrounded by a heavily urbanized community, and professional and lay
botanists visit the park regularly. The East Bay Chapter of CNPS has maintained a database of
regionally occurring rare plants in Alameda and Contra Costa counties since the 1980s (Lake
2010). The five plant species listed above have been reported during the last 20 years within a
few miles of Contra Loma at sites containing habitats that are generally similar to those found
within Contra Loma (California Department of Fish and Game 2011); however, the potential for
these plants to occur within Contra Loma is considered low because none of these plants have
ever been documented as occurring at Contra Loma (California Department of Fish and Game
2011; Legard, pers. comm. 2011). The general habitat requirements of these five plants are listed
in Appendix F.5, and these plants are not discussed further in this document.
Only one special-status plant, stinkbells, is known to occur at Contra Loma, and this species has
been monitored by EBRPD since 1998 (Legard, pers. comm. 2011). Stinkbells is designated as
RPR 4.2 and is ranked as fairly threatened in California (California Native Plant Society 2013).
Although a RPR of 4.2 would not typically result in a plant designation of “special status,” the
East Bay CNPS has designated stinkbells as an A-ranked rare and unusual plant in Alameda and
Contra Costa counties (Lake 2010), hence it is considered a “special status” plant in the
RMP/EIS.
Stinkbells is a perennial wildflower that is endemic to California. It grows primarily in
grasslands on areas of clay soil. The inflorescence is borne on an erect stem less than 2 feet tall
and has several nodding flowers. Stinkbells flower between March and June and have an
unpleasant odor. Known threats to this species include development and grazing. On the March
30, 2011 reconnaissance survey, 19 individual stinkbells were observed within three distinct
clumps. All are within the area of the mapped populations that have been monitored by EBRPD
since 1998 (Figure 3-11). The reported stinkbells population at Contra Loma has averaged about
200 individuals; the apparent decline in 2011 may be caused by more grazing than occurred in
2010 (Legard, pers. comm. 2011).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Invasive Plant Species

Invasive plant species can threaten or disrupt native species and vegetation communities by
altering nutrient cycles, increasing fire hazard (including intensity and severity), and altering
hydrologic cycles; creating changes in sediment deposition and erosion; dominating habitats and
displacing native species; hybridizing with native species; and promoting non-native animal
species (Bossard et al. 2000). Invasive plants, once introduced into an area, spread without
assistance and can alter the native vegetation community or habitat they have invaded.
For the purposes of this evaluation, invasive plant species are defined as vascular plant species
that are (1) rated as an A, B, C, or Q species by the California Department of Food and
Agriculture (CDFA) (California Department of Food and Agriculture 2007); and/or (2) rated as a
High, Moderate, or Limited for invasive properties by the California Invasive Plant Council
(Cal-IPC), which maintains a list of invasive plants that threaten California’s wildlands
(California Invasive Plant Council 2006). Plants rated by the CDFA as A, B, or C are pests of
known economic or environmental detriment. Plants rated as A are either not known to be
established in California or are present in a limited distribution that allows for the possibility of
eradication or successful containment. Plants rated as B, if present in California, are of limited
distribution. Plants rated as C, if present in California, are usually widespread. Plants rated as Q
are suspected to be of economic or environmental detriment, but their status is uncertain because
of incomplete identification or inadequate information.
Reconnaissance surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 identified 23 invasive and/or noxious nonnative plant species occurring at Contra Loma. None of these plants are listed as noxious weeds
in accordance with Section 2814 of the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974; however, they are
rated as noxious or invasive by either the CDFA or Cal-IPC. The native status of all plants
observed at Contra Loma, including CDFA and Cal-IPC noxious weed ratings where
appropriate, included in Appendix F.6. Noxious weed species that were observed or that are
known to occur at Contra Loma during surveys in 2010 and 2011 are listed in Table 3-6.

3.10 Wildlife
3.10.1 Existing Conditions

Contra Loma is designated by the EBRPD as an open space habitat area (East Bay Regional Park
District 1996) with some focused areas designated for developed recreation. As a result, past
management of Contra Loma has been focused on protection of native vegetation communities
and the wildlife species that use them, as well as on active and passive recreation.
Habitat Assessment

As discussed in Section 3.9 (Vegetation), vegetation community types and wildlife habitats
described in this section are classified based on the descriptions provided in A Guide to Wildlife
Habitats of California (Mayer and Laudenslayer Jr. 1988), which is a component of the CWHR
System (California Department of Fish and Game 2011) used by CDFW.
The criteria used for the CWHR query included vegetation community type and geographic area.
All vegetation community stages were included, and no community elements were excluded. The
query results provide a general index of predicted wildlife species occurrences within the
vegetation communities that are present in Contra Loma, which are discussed in detail below.
Table 3-5 in Section 3.9 identifies the various vegetation community types and subtypes present
at Contra Loma. There is significant overlap in the species expected to occur in some of these
vegetation communities because of their close proximity to each other. For this reason, the

3-44 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

precise acreage and percentage of area classified in each vegetation community type is less
meaningful for the evaluation of wildlife species that may occur in the area.
Field reconnaissance surveys of the study area were conducted by NSR on October 20 and 22,
2010. The entire area was walked, and field maps were used to gain bearings and aid in
classifying habitat types. Observations were made at each distinct habitat unit, and animal
species present were recorded. A list of animal species observed within the study area is attached
as Appendix F.7. Any habitats able to support special-status species were noted on field maps
and documented with photographs. Any wildlife observed was photographed (when possible) to
document resident species.
Upland Vegetation Communities

Five upland vegetation communities are present at Contra Loma: annual grassland, valley
foothill riparian, blue oak woodland, urban, and barren. Wildlife species found within each of
these vegetation communities is described below. Figure 3-11 illustrates the location and areal
extent of the corresponding vegetation community types within Contra Loma.
Annual Grassland. Characteristic wildlife species found in annual grasslands include reptiles
such as western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), common garter snake (Thamnophis
sirtalis), and western rattlesnake (Crotalis viridis); mammals such as black-tailed jackrabbit
(Lepus californicus), California ground squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyi), Botta’s pocket gopher
(Thomomys bottae), western harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys megalotis), California vole
(Microtus californicus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus),
and coyote (Canis latrans); and birds such as burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), horned lark
(Eremophila alpestris), and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta). Annual grassland also
provides important foraging habitat for turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), northern harrier (Circus
cyaneus), American kestrel (Falco sparverius), white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus), and redtailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). Wildlife species observed in the annual grassland at Contra
Loma during the reconnaissance-level surveys included numerous coyotes and ground squirrels
as well as several avian species including turkey vulture, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel,
Brewer’s blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus), and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura).
Approximately 30 cattle were observed in the southwest quadrant of the study area during the
surveys.
Valley Foothill Riparian. Valley foothill riparian vegetation communities provide habitat for a
wide diversity of wildlife. The presence of water associated with this upland vegetative
community attracts numerous mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. Common mammals
found in this cover type include mule deer, raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote, striped skunk
(Mephitis mephitis), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), harvest mouse, and dusky-footed
woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes). Numerous birds are also typically found in this cover type,
including yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), white-tailed
kite, Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter cooperii), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), song sparrow
(Melospiza melodia), and black-headed grosbeak (Pheucticus melanocephalus). Some
amphibians and reptiles found in riparian areas include red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), Pacific
tree frog (Pseudacris regilla), sharp-tailed snake (Contia tenuis), California alligator lizard
(Elgaria multicarinata multicarinata), and common garter snake. Wildlife species observed in
the riparian vegetation community at Contra Loma during the reconnaissance-level surveys

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

included northern flicker, red-shouldered hawk, song sparrow, black phoebe (Sayornis
nigricans), and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris).
Blue Oak Woodland. Blue oak woodlands produce acorns which are eaten by a variety of
species, including acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), western scrub-jays
(Aphelocoma californica) and mule deer. Snags and trees containing cavities occur here,
providing nesting habitat for birds such as the western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), tree swallow
(Tachycineta bicolor), and northern flicker, as well as potential roost sites for bats. Raptors,
including the red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, and great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), may
also nest in these woodlands. Coyote and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) may forage here,
and wildlife species dominant in annual grassland habitat (see above) flourish beneath the oak
canopy. Wildlife species observed in the blue oak woodland vegetation community at Contra
Loma during the reconnaissance-level survey included mule deer, western scrub-jay, northern
flicker, red-tailed hawk, and western fence lizard.
Urban. Urban land cover, which at Contra Loma consists largely of landscaped areas
surrounding the developed park facilities, can provide habitat for several mammal, reptile, and
amphibian species and can provide nest, cover, and forage areas for several bird species.
Common bird species in urban areas are the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), northern
flicker, rock dove (Columba livia), American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), dark-eyed junco
(Junco hyemalis), Brewer’s blackbird, house sparrow (Passer domesticus), bushtit (Psaltriparus
minimus), European starling, mourning dove, western scrub-jay, and mockingbird (Mimus
polyglottos). Common mammals using urban habitat include raccoon, opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), striped skunk, black-tailed jackrabbit, ground squirrel, and cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus audubonii). Some amphibians and reptiles expected in urban areas would be the
California slender salamander (Batrachoseps attenuates), Pacific tree frog, alligator lizard,
gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer), and western fence lizard. Wildlife species observed in the
urban areas at Contra Loma during the reconnaissance-level survey included numerous ground
squirrels and domesticated waterfowl (ducks and geese), cottontail rabbit and black-tailed
jackrabbit, as well as several avian species including western scrub-jay, American robin (Turdus
migratorius), and Brewer’s blackbird.
Barren. Within Contra Loma there are two types of barren land cover: hardscape, which
includes roadways and paved parking areas; and gravel/compacted dirt, which includes dirt roads
and trails, as well as some unpaved parking areas. These areas provide minimal habitat value for
animals in Contra Loma. In some cases, mammals such as ground squirrels can use the gravel
and compacted dirt substrates found along roads, trails, and parking lots to help create burrows.
The compacted soils associated with these areas allow for stable burrow walls that tend to hold
their shape effectively. Ground squirrels can burrow under the adjacent hardscape areas, such as
roadways and paved parking areas, which provide additional burrow stability and protection
from predators. Sometimes special-status species such as western burrowing owl and San
Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) use abandoned ground squirrel burrows at these
locations for breeding purposes. Wildlife species observed in the barren areas during the
reconnaissance-level survey at Contra Loma included a grey fox and numerous ground squirrels
along the edges of the barren habitat. Several bird species were observed flying overhead or
perching in trees along the edges of the barren habitat. Some of the birds observed were whitetailed kite, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, and western scrub-jay.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Aquatic Vegetative Communities

Wildlife species that occur in aquatic habitats typically depend on water for all their life
processes or significant portions of their life cycles. Three aquatic vegetative communities are
present in Contra Loma: riverine, fresh emergent wetland, and lacustrine.
Riverine. Like the riparian and wetland vegetation communities, riverine habitat is important
because it provides essential habitat for certain terrestrial and aquatic species. When water is
present, many of the animal species that occur in the fresh emergent wetland and riparian
vegetative communities can be found in the riverine habitat. In addition, amphibians such as
Pacific tree frog, western toad (Bufo boreas), and California tiger salamander (Ambystoma
californiense) and passerine birds such as Brewer’s blackbird, red-winged blackbird (Agelaius
phoeniceus), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) may be present. During the dry
season, a variety of small mammals use riverine areas, including deer mouse, California vole,
and long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata). Raptors such as white-tailed kite, northern harrier, and
red-tailed hawk may also forage in this habitat. Wildlife species observed in the riverine habitat
at Contra Loma during the reconnaissance-level surveys included northern flicker, song sparrow,
black phoebe, and mourning dove.
Fresh Emergent Wetland. The fresh emergent wetland vegetation community is important for
a wide variety of wildlife species. Representative water birds that forage and rest in permanent
wetlands include great blue heron (Ardea herodias), great egret (Ardea alba), mallard (Anas
platyrhynchos), American coot (Fulica americana), common merganser (Mergus merganser),
and double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus). Amphibians and reptiles in this habitat
type include bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), red-eared slider (Chrysemys scripta elegans), garter
snake, possibly western pond turtle (Emys marmorata) and red-legged frog. Some of the wildlife
species observed at Contra Loma in the fresh emergent wetland habitat during the
reconnaissance-level survey were mallard, Canada goose (Branta canadensis), western grebe
(Aechmophorus occidentalis), American coot, red-winged blackbird, great egret, and great blue
heron.
Lacustrine. Amphibians such as California red-legged frog and bullfrog and reptiles such as
western pond turtle and garter snake can use the lacustrine habitat of the reservoir for foraging.
Reservoirs provide important habitat for various ducks, including mallard, green-winged teal
(Anas caroliniensis), cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera), gadwall (Anas strepera), American
wigeon (Anas americana), and American coot. Shore and wading birds, including double-crested
cormorant, great blue heron, great egret, and several gull (Laridae spp.), species can also be
found in reservoirs. Wildlife species observed in the lacustrine habitat during the reconnaissancelevel survey at Contra Loma included double-crested cormorant, Canada goose, western grebe,
and common merganser.
Twenty fish species, including eight species of sport fish, are known to be present in Contra
Loma Reservoir. Many of these species were introduced into the reservoir from the Contra Costa
Canal, which gets its water from the Delta. Primary species found in the reservoir during spring
surveys from 2002 through 2011 are largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill (Lepomis
macrochirus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense),
redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), white catfish

(Ameiurus catus), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). See Section 3.11 (Fisheries) for an
expanded discussion of the reservoir fishery.
Special-Status Wildlife Species

For the purposes of this evaluation, special-status wildlife species include those that are (1)
designated as threatened or endangered by the state or Federal governments (i.e., “listed
species”); (2) proposed for state or Federal listing as threatened or endangered; (3) candidates for
state or Federal listing as threatened or endangered; and/or (4) identified by CDFW as species of
special concern and/or California fully protected species.
A list of special-status wildlife species considered in this assessment was compiled by obtaining
an official species list from the USFWS Sacramento Office for the Antioch South, California
USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle (Fish and Wildlife Service 2013) (Appendix F.2); performing
queries for records contained in the CNDDB for the Antioch South, California USGS 7.5-minute
quadrangle (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a; Appendix F.3.1) and the area
within a 5-mile radius of Contra Loma (Appendix F.3.2); reviewing biological literature
applicable to the Contra Loma region; and reviewing existing programmatic documents relating
to the use and operation of Contra Loma. These efforts identified a total of 29 special-status
animal species known to occur in the vicinity of Contra Loma. Accordingly, these species were
reviewed in depth as part of this assessment to determine the potential for each species to occur
within Contra Loma based on the presence or absence of suitable habitat. Based on a review of
the habitat requirements, 14 special-status wildlife species have the potential to occur in Contra
Loma (Table 3-7). A brief description of the geographic range, habitat requirements, and status
for each of these species is provided in the table and a more detailed description of each of these
species is provided below.
In addition, an analysis was made of bird species which are subject to the Federal Migratory Bird
Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA, 16 U.S. Code [USC] 703-711) that may be present. Birds protected
by the MBTA which are known to be present and may also breed at Contra Loma include great
egret, mallard, American coot, great blue heron, double-crested cormorant, Canada goose,
western grebe, common merganser, northern flicker, song sparrow, black phoebe, mourning
dove, western burrowing owl, white-tailed kite, American kestrel, red-tailed hawk, redshouldered hawk, turkey vulture, western scrub-jay, American robin, red-winged blackbird,
Brewer’s blackbird and various gull species. Many other bird species protected by the MBTA
may be present at Contra Loma periodically; however, site surveys or other documented sources
have not confirmed the presence of these other species.

San Joaquin kit fox. San Joaquin kit fox is Federally listed as endangered and state listed as
threatened. San Joaquin kit fox is associated with open habitats such as arid grasslands, alkali
sinks, and open woodlands of the San Joaquin Valley and the surrounding foothills. San Joaquin
kit fox typically forages in grassland areas. Kit fox is usually associated with loosely textured
soils that are suitable for excavating dens; badgers and coyotes sometimes initiate the excavation.
Dens are typically dug on relatively level slopes, suggesting a preference for deep, friable (easily
crumbled) soils. Den entrances are typically 5 to 10 inches in diameter, with 3- to 6-foot ramps
of excavated soil. The distribution of San Joaquin kit fox populations is thought to be related to
the availability of denning sites, particularly natal denning sites, which are often moved several
times throughout the season. Artificial features such as culverts and roadbeds are occasionally
used for dens. San Joaquin kit fox prey includes ground squirrels, black-tailed jackrabbit,
kangaroo rats, and insects.
Potential foraging and denning habitat is abundant within the annual grassland areas of Contra
Loma. The soil is friable, allowing foxes to excavate dens, and there are numerous ground
squirrel populations upon which to prey. Ten occurrences of San Joaquin kit fox have been
documented by CNDDB within 10 miles of the study area and one occurrence has been recorded
within Contra Loma. Most of the records are from the early 1990s while the most recent
occurrence was in Contra Loma in 1995 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
This record shows that two individuals were observed near the south end of the reservoir near a
small drainage in the annual grassland.
Although the habitat at Contra Loma appears viable for use by San Joaquin kit fox, the presence
of many resident coyotes in the area greatly reduces the site’s suitability for this species. Coyotes
are very aggressive towards foxes. For this reason, San Joaquin kit fox is unlikely to breed within
the study area. If the species is present in Contra Loma, it is most likely to be transitory, as no
natal dens have been found at Contra Loma. Neither San Joaquin kit fox nor sign of kit fox dens,
scat, or tracks were observed during the reconnaissance-level surveys.
California tiger salamander. California tiger salamander is both Federally listed and state
listed as threatened. California tiger salamanders inhabit grasslands and oak savannas in the
valleys and low hills of central and coastal California. Habitat conversion has eliminated the
species from much of its former range (Shaffer et al. 1993; Fisher and Shaffer 1996). Adults
spend most of their lives underground, typically in the burrows of ground squirrels and other
burrowing animals. During winter rains between November and March, adults emerge from
underground retreats to feed, court, and breed. Adults migrate up to one mile from burrows to
breeding sites. Eggs are deposited in seasonal ponds and hatch into larvae. The ponds must
contain water for a minimum of eight weeks to hatch and for metamorphs to leave pools,
although it can take considerably longer for larvae to complete their development (Fish and
Wildlife Service 2004). Following transformation, juvenile salamanders seek refuge
underground where they remain until the next winter rains.
Potential salamander habitat at Contra Loma occurs in intermittent stream corridors with areas of
seasonal ponding. Most of these locations are along the southern half of the study area.
Specifically, the intermittent stream near the northeast corner of the study area and areas just
beyond the southern boundary of the study area contain optimal seasonally wet conditions and
are located near adjacent upland grassland habitat with abundant burrows for adult salamanders.
3-54 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Several CNDDB occurrences document California tiger salamander observations along these
particular waterways. There are 26 CNDDB records within 5 miles of the study area (California
Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
California red-legged frog. California red-legged frog is Federally listed as threatened and is
classified by CDFW as a California species of special concern. This amphibian species inhabits
quiet pools in streams, marshes, and ponds. This species is typically found near breeding sites,
which include coastal lagoons, marshes, springs, permanent and semi-permanent natural ponds,
and ponded and backwater portions of streams, as well as artificial impoundments, such as stock,
irrigation and siltation ponds. Sufficient pond depth (at least 3 feet) and shoreline cover are both
critical habitat components because they provide a means of escape from predators. Eggs are
typically attached to emergent vegetation in permanent pools. Aestivation habitat, which is
required for periods of dormancy, can be up to 300 feet from a stream corridor or pond and
includes natural features such as boulders, rocks, trees, shrubs, and logs.
Potential habitat at Contra Loma may occur in the intermittent stream corridors where pools
remain inundated long enough for frog metamorphosis to occur. Contra Loma Reservoir contains
all of the habitat requirements necessary for successful breeding as well; however, the reservoir
contains a large population of predatory fish and amphibian species that would make it very
difficult for red-legged frog tadpoles to reach adulthood. Sport fish such as bass, green sunfish
(Lepomis cyanellu), bluegill, and catfish can decimate tadpole populations. Similarly, the
bullfrogs at Contra Loma Reservoir can prey heavily on young frogs. This intense predation
typically prevents red-legged frogs from co-existing with species such as bullfrogs and sport fish.
No CNDDB occurrences of red-legged frog are documented within the study area; however,
there are 19 recorded occurrences within 5 miles of the study area, the closest being near and
within the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve, south and west of Contra Loma (California
Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
Alameda whipsnake. Alameda whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus) is both
Federally listed and state listed as threatened. This snake inhabits chaparral and scrub habitats
within Alameda, Contra Costa, and possibly western San Joaquin and northern Santa Clara
counties. The Alameda whipsnake typically prefers shrub communities, but is also found in
adjacent habitats such as grasslands and oak savanna. These snakes are good climbers that can
escape into shrubs or trees. They also seek shelter in rock piles, outcrops, or small mammal
burrows (Stebbins 1985). This fast-moving, diurnal snake hunts primarily small lizards,
especially the western fence lizard, but will also eat frogs, snakes, and birds. Its home range is
typically 5 to 21.5 acres in size and can overlap home ranges of many other individuals.
Although coastal scrub or chaparral communities are not present in Contra Loma, the annual
grasslands present in the study area contain numerous small mammal burrows in which the snake
could take refuge. Additionally, western fence lizards were abundant during site visits, indicating
a robust prey base for the snake. For these reasons, the annual grassland areas within the study
area could provide adequate habitat for the snake. Twenty-four CNDDB occurrences are
documented within 5 miles of the study area (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
These occurrences support the likelihood that whipsnakes occur in the study area.

White-tailed kite. White-tailed kite is a state-designated fully protected raptor, and is also on
the list of birds protected under the MBTA. It breeds between February and October, and feeds
on rodents, small reptiles, and large insects in such habitats as fresh emergent wetlands, annual
grasslands, pastures, and ruderal vegetation. Unlike other raptors, kites often roost, and
occasionally nest, communally; therefore, disturbance of a relatively small roost or nesting area
could affect a large number of birds. Kites tend to nest in large, dense-topped, isolated trees near
suitable foraging habitat.
The annual grassland, riverine, and fresh emergent wetland habitats within the study area provide
ample foraging ground for this species. Several large, dense-topped trees within the Contra Loma
study area could be used as nesting locations. There are abundant small mammals, reptiles, and
insects within the study area. Although there are no CNDDB records within the study area, there
are two CNDDB records within 5 miles of the study area. White-tailed kites were observed
within the study area during the reconnaissance surveys (California Department of Fish and
Wildlife 2013a).
Western pond turtle. Western pond turtle is listed as a California species of special concern
and is found in the quiet waters of ponds, marshes, creeks, and irrigation ditches. This species
requires basking sites such as partially submerged logs, rocks, mats of floating vegetation, or
open mud banks. When water temperatures are low and air temperatures are warmer than water
temperatures, it frequently basks on logs or other objects out of the water. When air temperatures
become too warm, western pond turtles water-bask by lying in the warmer surface water layer
with their heads out of the water. In colder areas, the hibernation period is passed underwater in
the soft mud on the bottom of the lake or waterway. Mating typically occurs in late April or early
May but may occur year-round. Nests are located in upland areas up to 0.25 miles from the
aquatic site. Hatchling turtles are thought to emerge from the nest and move to aquatic habitats in
the spring.
Suitable habitat for the western pond turtle may occur in Contra Loma Reservoir and within the
seasonal ponds along several of the intermittent streams south of the reservoir. Two CNDDB
occurrences are documented within 5 miles of the study area (California Department of Fish and
Wildlife 2013a).
Northern harrier. Northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) is a California species of special concern,
and is also on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. This species is found across most of
North America. In California, the northern harrier is found in grasslands, marshes, and other
open habitats throughout the state. Nests are built on the ground in areas where long grasses or
marsh plants provide cover and protection. Harriers hunt for a variety of prey, including rodents,
birds, frogs, reptiles, and insects, by flying low and slow in a traversing manner, and using both
sight and sound to detect prey items.
Potential nesting and foraging habitat is present in the annual grasslands and fresh emergent
wetlands of Contra Loma. No CNDDB occurrences of this species are recorded within 5 miles of
the study area (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
Tricolored blackbird. Tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) is a California species of special
concern, and is also on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. It is endemic to the Central

3-56 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Valley and coastal valleys of California. This species is highly gregarious, forming large flocks
in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. Nests are built near or over water and occasionally in
agricultural fields. Recently, tricolored blackbirds have displayed increased tendencies toward
nesting in patches of blackberry, willows, mustard, thistles, nettles, and even grasses.
The fresh emergent wetland habitat along the margins of Contra Loma Reservoir may provide
suitable habitat for this species. Foraging habitat is present in the grassland habitat surrounding
the reservoir. No CNDDB occurrences of this species are recorded within 5 miles of the study
area (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
Loggerhead Shrike. Loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is a California species of special
concern, and is also on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. Loggerhead shrike is a
common resident in lowlands and foothills throughout California, and prefers open habitats with
scattered shrubs, trees, posts, fences, utility lines, or other perches. The greatest density of this
species occurs in open-canopied valley foothill hardwood, valley foothill hardwood-conifer,
valley foothill riparian, pinyon-juniper, juniper, desert riparian, and Joshua tree habitats.
Loggerhead shrikes build well-concealed nests on stable branches in shrubs or trees with dense
foliage. The diet of the loggerhead shrike includes small birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles,
fish, carrion, large insects, and various invertebrates. This species forages from a perch that is at
least 2 feet above the ground, but is often much higher. Loggerhead shrikes frequently cache
prey on thorns, sharp twigs, and wire barbs, or in the forks of branches. The breeding season for
loggerhead shrike is from March to August.
Suitable foraging areas are present within the annual grassland and riverine habitat of the study
area. Moderate-quality nesting habitat occurs in some of the trees and shrubs associated with the
riparian areas adjacent to the grassland habitat. No CNDDB occurrences of this species are
recorded within 5 miles of the study area (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
Western Burrowing Owl. Western burrowing owl is a California species of special concern,
and is also on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. Burrowing owls are year-round
residents in generally flat, open, dry grasslands, pastures, deserts, and shrub lands and in grasses,
forbs, and open shrub stages of pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine habitats. In North America
they range from the western Canadian provinces south through southern Mexico. They typically
use the burrows of ground squirrels and other small mammals for nesting and cover, but may
also use artificial structures such as roadside embankments, levees, and berms. They can exhibit
a high degree of site fidelity, often reusing burrows year after year. Occupancy of suitable
burrowing owl habitat can be verified at a site by observation of a pair of burrowing owls during
their breeding season or, alternatively, by the presence of molted feathers, cast pellets
(regurgitated masses of bone, fur, and other indigestible material), prey remains, eggshell
fragments, or excrement at or near a burrow.
Suitable habitat for foraging and nesting occurs within the annual grasslands of the study area.
Numerous burrows in which the owls could nest occur throughout the grassland areas, with
higher concentrations in the southern half of the study area. There are 31 known CNDDB
occurrences for this species within 5 miles of Contra Loma (California Department of Fish and
Wildlife 2013a). Due to the presence of suitable habitat for foraging and nesting, this species is
highly likely to occur within the study area.

Short-eared owl. Short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) is a California species of special concern,
and is also on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. In California, short-eared owls nest at
only a few of their former breeding locations, and in northwestern California they breed only in
coastal areas where conditions are prime. The short-eared owl is a ground nester and lives in
open country, including grasslands, wet meadows, and cleared forests. Current threats to shorteared owls include the decline and degradation of marsh and tall grassland habitats resulting
from grazing pressure.
Potential nesting and foraging habitat is present in the annual grasslands and fresh emergent
wetlands throughout Contra Loma, although nesting is more likely to occur closer to coastal
areas. No CNDDB occurrences of this species are recorded within 5 miles of the study area
(California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
American badger. American badger is a California species of special concern. Badgers are
highly specialized fossorial (adapted for burrowing or digging) mammals found throughout
almost all of California. They are found in a range of habitats that contain friable soils and
relatively open ground, where they dig in pursuit of prey and to create dens for cover and raising
of young. Badgers are carnivorous and prey primarily on rodents, including ground squirrels.
Potential habitat occurs within the annual grasslands present in the study area. Soils in these
areas are friable and numerous ground squirrels are present throughout the grassland areas. There
are three recent CNDDB occurrences documented for this species within 5 miles of Contra
Loma, generally occurring south of the study area (California Department of Fish and Wildlife
2013a). It is likely that this species occurs within the study area boundaries.
Pallid bat. Pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) is a California species of special concern. The pallid
bat is a locally common species in low elevations of California and occurs throughout most of
the state. This species occupies a wide variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands,
woodlands, and forests from sea level up into montane, mixed conifer forests. Pallid bat is most
common in open, dry habitats with rocky areas for roosting. This species is a year-round resident
throughout most of its range. Day roosts include caves, crevices, mines, and occasionally hollow
trees and buildings. This species is very sensitive to disturbance of roost sites.
The pallid bat could use any of the vegetative communities present within the study area as
foraging habitat. Roosting habitat could include park facilities and buildings, rock outcrops in the
hills west of the reservoir, and possibly a few hollow tree cavities observed in some of the
riparian areas near the northeast corner of the study area. No CNDDB occurrences of this species
are recorded within 5 miles of the study area California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).
Townsend’s big-eared bat. Townsend’s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii) is a
California species of special concern. It ranges throughout western North America from British
Columbia to the central Mexican highlands. Recent information suggests that this species is
declining throughout the west. Townsend’s big-eared bat is typically a cave-dwelling species;
however, this species is also found in human-made structures such as old mine workings and
buildings. Unlike many species that take refuge in crevices, this species only roosts in the open,
hanging from walls and ceilings, where it is relatively easily detected, but is also particularly

vulnerable to disturbance (Pierson and Rainey 1998). Maternity roosts and winter hibernacula
are restricted to caves, old mines, buildings, and rock ledges.
Suitable foraging habitat is present throughout Contra Loma in any of the vegetative
communities present within the study area. Suitable roosting habitat is limited in the study area,
but could include some of the park facilities and buildings. No caves are present in the study
area. No CNDDB occurrences of this species are recorded within 5 miles of the study area
(California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013a).

3.11 Fisheries
3.11.1 Existing Conditions

Contra Loma Reservoir is a popular recreational fishing destination. Recreational fishing is
allowed all around the reservoir except for the immediate area of the dam and spillway. As
described previously, a state fishing license and an EBRPD Fishing Access Permit are required
for all anglers 16 and older. Pedestrian access to the reservoir is provided by a network of trails,
and anglers may fish from shore, from two floating fishing docks (Figure 1-2), or from boats.
There is one boat launch and anglers may launch boats of up to 17 feet provided they pay the
boat launch fee and pass a required boat inspection for aquatic invasive species. No gasolinepowered engines are allowed on the reservoir, but electric motors are permitted. Anglers may
also use float tubes, but each angler must possess a life jacket and must wear waders or a wetsuit
to limit body contact. There is a fish cleaning station at the boat launch facility; however,
EBRPD is currently working on relocating this facility further away from the reservoir within the
same area as described in Section 3.8.1 (Water Quality). Park hours are set by EBRPD and adjust
seasonally to daylight hours. Park curfew is from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., however, unauthorized
nighttime fishing sometimes occurs.
Because the fishing docks float, their elevations vary with the reservoir level. When the reservoir
level is sufficiently low, the angle of the ramps leading from the shore down to the docks
becomes too steep for safe passage, and the docks are closed. Sometimes the reservoir level is so
low that the docks cannot float and they rest on the sloping shoreline. Anglers sometimes fish
from the floating boat dock adjacent to the boat launch, especially when the fishing docks are
closed.
CCWD currently has a draft macrophyte (aquatic plants visible with the naked eye) management
plan for Contra Loma Reservoir. The goals of this plan are to (1) control problem macrophyte
beds in order to ensure boat access, and (2) control non-native plant species in the reservoir.
Routine procedures to monitor macrophyte development include annual GPS surveys that
document types of species present as well as the approximate location, coverage, and growth of
existing macrophyte beds. Control of macrophytes has been limited to herbicide applications to
non-native species and specific tule beds along the shoreline (Contra Costa Water District
undated). Short-term treatment have included spot treatment with Sonar® to control non-natives
and spot treatment with Rodeo® to control tules. No long-term treatment procedures have been
developed for Contra Loma Reservoir.

Fisheries Resources

There are currently 20 known fish species, including eight species of game fish, in Contra Loma
Reservoir (Table 3-8). Primary species found in the reservoir during spring surveys from 2002
through 2011 were largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, threadfin shad, redear sunfish,
channel catfish, white catfish, and rainbow trout (Figure 3-12). Other species include bigscale
logperch, common carp, Sacramento blackfish, warmouth, green sunfish, white crappie, goldfish,
prickly sculpin, and inland silversides (Alexander, pers. comm. 2011). Many of these species
occur in small numbers and/or are not self-sustaining in the reservoir.

Many of the fish species present have been unintentionally introduced from the Delta via the
Contra Costa Canal. The recently completed Rock Slough Fish Screen Project at the head of
Contra Costa Canal was constructed to prevent the entrainment of Federally protected species
such as Delta smelt at the Rock Slough Intake of the Contra Costa Canal. The new screen also
minimizes fish entrainment and significantly reduces the potential for fish introductions into
Contra Loma Reservoir from the Contra Costa Canal.

The most popular game fish in Contra Loma Reservoir is rainbow trout. However, since the
reservoir does not provide habitat suitable for self-sustaining, year-round coldwater fish, trout are
stocked as part of a mostly seasonal put-and-take sport fishery. This species is planted and
caught by anglers when the water is relatively cool (less than 72° Fahrenheit [°F]) from midSeptember to mid-June. Hatchery-produced catchable trout are stocked annually through funds
derived from EBRPD fishing access permits and to a lesser extent by the CDFW. EBRPD plants
rainbow trout that average 1 pound each and the CDFW plants trout that average 1/2 pound each.
The stocking records for rainbow trout are provided in Table 3-9.
Although the reservoir is managed as a put-and-take fishery, there is some limited survival and
growth as evidenced by the 17.6-pound lake-record rainbow trout caught in April of 2001.
Unlike warm water game fish in the reservoir, the rainbow trout fishery is not limited by
reservoir operations. The limiting factors for the coldwater fishery are stocking rates and angler
harvest. Rainbow trout stocking rates for Contra Loma Reservoir have fluctuated between 10,500
and 17,406 pounds/year over the past ten years, and have had an average stocking rate of 13,950
pounds.

Contra Loma Reservoir supports the highest largemouth bass densities of any EBRPD reservoir
(Alexander, pers. comm. 2011). Mark-recapture studies have been conducted annually by
EBRPD since 2007 (Figure 3-12) using the Lincoln-Peterson Index estimation method. In the
near-shore habitat of the reservoir between 2007 and 2011, the average estimated number of
largemouth bass greater than 11 inches in total length has been 662, and has fluctuated from a
maximum of 1,235 in 2007 to a minimum of 158 in 2010 (Figure 3-13). Based on the available
data, the largemouth bass abundance in Contra Loma Reservoir fluctuates widely; however,
during the five available years of data, the population has declined (Figure 3-13). Additionally,
the percent composition of bluegill and black crappie has increased during this time period
(Figure 3-12). The observed decline of largemouth bass could be a function of numerous factors
including, but not limited to, a decrease in successful spawning and recruitment, increased angler
harvest, increased competition and/or predation by other fish species (including bluegill and
black crappie), or sampling variation.
Based on the maximum fork lengths of largemouth bass captured during annual electrofishing
surveys between 2001 and 2011 (Figure 3-14), the average and maximum size of fish has
remained relatively stable, with the average bass measuring 9.5 inches with larger fish up to 24
inches (Alexander, pers. comm. 2011). The recent increase in average largemouth bass size
indicates that there may be fewer young fish in the population which suggests there has been less
successful reproduction or survival over the past few years (assuming equal sampling effort and
standardization year-to-year). The maximum size of largemouth bass sampled in the reservoir
has increased from 1.9 pounds in 1999 to 12.9 pounds in 2008. The current record largemouth
bass is 13.1 pounds and was caught by an angler in 2006.

The reservoir’s self-sustaining population of largemouth bass is very popular with a segment of
the sport fishing public but is not augmented by planting; therefore, the reproduction and growth
of this species of game fish is very important in maintaining a successful fishery. Because the
largemouth bass fishery is self-sustaining and is more susceptible to overharvest, EBRPD has

3-63 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

recommended that all bass be released after catching. Largemouth bass and sunfish (such as
black crappie and bluegill) spawn during the spring when water temperatures begin to warm.
Typically, in this region of California, the prime spawning months for bass and sunfish occurs
from late March through early June. Following hatching and initial care by the adults, fry are
attracted to the habitat-rich near shore area of the south and west shoreline of the reservoir.
These areas are dominated by emergent vegetation such as bulrush and cattail, as well as
submerged vegetation such as watermilfoil and pond weed (Elodea spp.) that provide a source of
food and protective cover.
EBRPD has identified seasonal reservoir fluctuations as a limiting factor for the largemouth bass
fishery. EBRPD and CCWD currently have a verbal agreement to limit reservoir fluctuations
during the critical spawning period for largemouth bass and other warm water fish; however,
water supply and reservoir operation and management take precedence over management for
recreation, including fisheries (Alexander, pers. comm. 2011). The magnitude of the reservoir
level increases (within 4 to 6 feet) is not expected to be particularly problematic for warm water
fish in Contra Loma Reservoir because the change is not likely to be sufficient to reduce water
temperatures to less than suitable levels for egg development or to cause nest abandonment.
Conversely, daily reservoir decreases of up to 1.6 feet, particularly for several consecutive days,
could cause nest abandonment by adult bass, which, in turn, could leave spawning nests
susceptible to predation from other fishes, particularly the bluegill and redear sunfish that are
abundant in this reservoir. Under extreme drawdown conditions, nests can be left out of the
water to desiccate and a substantial portion of that year’s reproductive capacity can be lost.
Limiting abrupt and/or large decreases in reservoir elevation during the spring and early summer
spawning period is one way to minimize risks to largemouth bass spawning success and to
ensure a healthy self-sustaining population. Because reservoir operation is outside the scope of
the RMP, reservoir level fluctuations would continue with or without the RMP.
Because sunfish typically spawn in the relatively shallow littoral (shoreline) areas of the
reservoir, their reproductive success can also be affected by large water fluctuations during the
critical months of April and May. As with largemouth bass, large abrupt or sustained fluctuations
can disrupt spawning by taking the spawning nests out of the suitable depth and temperature
ranges and placing them in water that is too shallow, too deep, or not the right temperature for
proper egg maturation. However, based on annual surveys the existing reservoir operations
appear to allow for successful reproduction and recruitment to the sunfish population. Black
crappie are also a popular warm water game fish in the reservoir. They have similar life cycle,
habitat, and cover requirements as largemouth bass and are also susceptible to breeding
disruptions caused by changes in the water level. Even so, it is characteristic for this species to
exhibit substantial population fluctuations.
Black crappie abundance has increased in recent years (Figure 3-12), and many large (>9 inch)
fish have been captured during annual electrofishing surveys and by anglers. The average black
crappie captured during electrofishing surveys between 2009 and 2011 has been 8 to 10 inches
and the maximum size black crappie capture was 15 inches (Alexander, pers. comm. 2011). The
current lake record is 4.1 pounds.
Striped bass also provide a trophy fishery for anglers targeting this species. Before the recent
completion of the Rock Slough Fish Screen Project, striped bass had been pumped into the
3-64 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

reservoir from the Delta. Striped bass within the reservoir have grown to large sizes by preying
on planted trout and other resident fish species. Striped bass numbers are relatively low (Figure
3-12), but the potential for hooking a large specimen creates a very popular fishery. The current
lake record for striped bass is 40 pounds. The Rock Slough Fish Screen will minimize further
introduction of striped bass to the reservoir.
Channel catfish are planted and caught during the warm summer months from June through midSeptember. The planted channel catfish average 1 pound each, but larger catfish are also planted.
The catfish sport fishery is intended to supplement angling opportunities during the warm
summer months when conditions are less conducive for trout and is managed as a put-and-take
fishery. The average size and number of catfish stocked into the reservoir between 2000 and
2010 are provided in Table 3-9. On average, 3,984 pounds of channel catfish are stocked
annually. Stocking rates have remained relatively stable over the past 10 years (Table 3-9) and
many of the planted channel catfish remain in the reservoir and grow to large sizes. The current
lake record is 26.4 pounds. Neither catfish species (channel or white) has been documented to
naturally reproduce in the reservoir; therefore, the primary factors likely limiting the abundance
and growth of catfish in Contra Loma are annual stocking rates and angler harvest. However, no
data are currently available on the harvest rate of catfish.
According to a plaque posted at a Contra Loma information kiosk, a 58-inch white sturgeon was
caught by an angler at the reservoir in 2003; however, annual electro-fish surveys have not found
sturgeon.
Since approximately 1996, Contra Loma Reservoir has provided recreational fishing
opportunities in the form of fishing derbies for the public. These derbies are intended to attract
children with special needs, senior citizens, and children from the surrounding area. New anglers
are invited to participate through the EBRPD’s Parks Express Program and through the Delta
Striped Bass Association’s annual “Learn to Fish” day. In October 2009, over the duration of
these annual events, 147 special-needs children, 87 seniors, and over 528 local children
experienced a special day of trout fishing. These annual fishing events attract more new anglers
each year and are an important component of the recreational opportunities at Contra Loma
Recreation Area.
Fishing regulations for Contra Loma Reservoir are set in part by the State Fish and Game
Commission. Current fishing harvest regulations are provided in Table 3-10. As described above,
EBRPD encourages, but doesn’t require, anglers to practice catch and release with largemouth
bass and catfish.

Largemouth bass is a species of black bass.

Special-Status Fish Species

For the purposes of evaluation, special-status fish species include those that are: 1) designated as
threatened or endangered by the state or Federal government (“listed species”); or 2) proposed
for state or Federal listing as threatened or endangered; and/or 3) candidates for state or Federal
listing as threatened or endangered; and/or 4) identified by the CDFW as species of special
concern and/or California fully protected species. A list of special-status fish species considered
for analysis in this section was compiled through obtaining an official species list from the
USFWS Sacramento Office (Fish and Wildlife Service 2013), informal discussions with the
CDFW and USFWS, and reviewing biological literature applicable to the study area (Table 311).
The Delta provides suitable habitat for many of the species listed in Table 3-11, and because the
reservoir’s water source is the Delta, fish species could have been carried into the reservoir via
the Contra Costa Canal. To date no special-status fish species have been captured or identified in
the reservoir. Furthermore, special-status species that might have made it in to the reservoir are
not likely to have survived due to a lack of suitable habitat that would support most of these
species. In addition, any new entrainment of fish, including special-status species, is highly
unlikely with the installation of the new Rock Slough Fish Screen at the intake pump station for
the Contra Costa Canal. The screen size was designed to be more restrictive than the National
Marine Fisheries Service criteria (i.e., 3/32 inch or 2.25 millimeters) in order to protect larval
Delta smelt and would, therefore, protect the smallest and most vulnerable special-status fish
from entrainment.

3.12 Geologic and Soil Resources
3.12.1 Existing Conditions
Geology

The geology of the Contra Loma area consists of terrestrial and marine Eocene- to Pliocene(Tertiary) aged sandstone with lesser amounts of siltstone, conglomerate, and shale (Graymer et
al. 1994). Minor amounts of igneous rocks are also present.

3-68 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Contra Loma is located in the Diablo Range, which is part of the larger Coast Ranges of
California. Rocks of both marine and terrestrial origin are present in the Contra Loma area. Most
of the rocks that currently form the Coast Ranges were originally oceanic crust and overlying
marine sediments of the Pacific Plate. Tectonic forces, which are still active in the region, have
subducted (moved underneath) and translated (slid) the Pacific Plate under and against the
margin of the North American Plate. This tectonic activity synchronously accreted and uplifted
oceanic crust and marine sediments from the Pacific Plate to the western margin of North
America.
Concurrently, subduction of the Pacific Plate also formed land masses in the Pacific Ocean near
the western margin of North America, either through accumulation of sediment or from the
formation of volcanoes. In the ocean trenches where the Pacific Plate was subducted under the
North American Plate, large blocks of oceanic crust were broken off while material from both
plates was scraped off into these trenches. Continued deposition and uplift brought these rocks
above the surface of the ocean, eventually forming discrete land masses offshore of the North
American coast. In addition, subduction of the Pacific Plate formed volcanoes that jutted out of
the ocean near these trenches. Tectonic activity eventually carried these landforms and their
detritus towards the North American Plate and accreted the rocks to the western margin of the
North American Plate. The accretion of the oceanic crust, overlying sediments, and terrestrial
deposits formed the geology of Contra Loma and its vicinity.
Geologic units in the project vicinity trend west to east and appear as relatively narrow bands of
generally less than 1,000 feet in thickness on the Earth’s surface (Figure 3-15). Therefore, many
geologic units are present near Contra Loma (Table 3-12). Contra Loma Reservoir is flanked by
hills that are composed of the Tulare Formation, a poorly consolidated assemblage of siltstone,
sandstone, and conglomerate. The bases of the surrounding hills and adjacent flat-lying areas are
mostly composed of younger Quaternary-aged surface deposits derived from alluvial deposits
and the detritus of the surrounding terrain. The Lawlor Tuff occupies a narrow band that extends
from the western margin of the reservoir to the western boundary of the Contra Loma Recreation
Area. The higher elevations of Contra Loma south of the reservoir are mainly composed of the
Neroly and Cierbo Sandstone units, with a minor amount of Kirker Tuff exposed near the
southern boundary.
Seismicity and Faults

The San Francisco Bay Area is a seismically active area with numerous well-known active fault
complexes, including the San Andreas, Hayward, and Mt. Diablo fault complexes. The AlquistPriolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in 1972. It requires the California State
Geologist to define earthquake fault zones, and was designed to mitigate the hazards that
earthquakes pose to structures and human life (California Public Resources Code 2009). Fault
zones are established based on the presence of a fault that is traceable and that has exhibited
displacement in the last 11,000 years.
There are no active fault zones identified by the State of California within the Contra Loma
Recreation Area, but several active fault zones exist within 17 miles of Contra Loma (Figure 315 – see inset). Three suspected inactive faults (Figure 3-15) were mapped within Contra Loma
by Reclamation and the Corps between 1962 and 1966 (East Bay Regional Park District 1975b).
However, published maps and geospatial data from the USGS or the California Geologic Survey
3-69 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

(CGS) do not show these suspected faults. A series of pre-Quaternary-aged faults have been
identified approximately 2 miles south of Contra Loma near the southern boundary of Black
Diamond Mines Regional Preserve, but they indicate no evidence of displacement in the last
11,000 years.
Because there are active fault zones within 17 miles of Contra Loma, the recreation area may
experience severe ground shaking and moderate to heavy damage from a nearby earthquake. The
CGS has produced estimates of peak ground acceleration (PGA) values for every given point in
California. PGA is a measure of earthquake acceleration on the ground and is measured in units
of gravity (g); a value of 1.0 is equal to the force of gravity at the Earth’s surface. In general, an
area with a PGA of 0.001 g will experience shaking that can be felt by people and an area with a
PGA of 0.50 g will experience very strong shaking that well-designed buildings and structures
can withstand. PGA values for Contra Loma range between 0.40 g for firm rock and 0.44 g for
alluvium (California Geological Survey 2011), which indicates the area has the potential to
experience severe shaking and moderate to heavy damage to some buildings and structures.
However, well-designed buildings and structures should be able to withstand the expected level
of shaking.

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Mineral Resources

There are currently no mineral development activities in or adjacent to Contra Loma. Some areas
in EBRPD’s adjacent Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve were previously mined for coal,
sandstone, and shale. From the 1860s through the turn of the last century, five coal mining towns
thrived in the Black Diamond area: Nortonville, Somersville, Stewartville, West Hartley, and
Judsonville. As the location of California's largest coal mining operation, nearly four million tons
of coal ("black diamonds") were removed from the earth in the Black Diamond area. After coal
mining ceased, underground mining for sand began near the deserted Nortonville and
Somersville townsites in the 1920s. The Somersville mine supplied sand used in glass and the
Nortonville mine supplied casting sand used in foundries. When sand mining ceased in 1949,
more than 1.8 million tons of sand had been removed from the mines (East Bay Regional Park
District 2011d).
Soils

The soils that cover Contra Loma and adjacent areas are weathering products derived from the
underlying or upslope geologic units, and, as a result, the composition and the properties of soils
vary within the area. A majority of the soils within Contra Loma are clay-rich soils that have
slow infiltration rates and high runoff potential (Figure 3-16 and Table 3-13).
Clay soils in the area exhibit low permeability when compacted, and many of the soils have a
relatively high shrink and swell potential (East Bay Regional Park District 1975b). The clay soils
are fairly erodible when disturbed, but soils with higher sand and silt content have an even higher
potential for erosion when disturbed.
Soil depth to bedrock generally varies by slope grade; soils on steep slopes are generally
shallower than soils on gentle slopes. Within Contra Loma, approximately 70 percent of the land
has slopes of less than 10 percent and 85 percent of the land has slopes of less than 25 percent.
Slopes under 25 percent generally contain soils that are deep (> 40 inches) to moderately deep
(20 to 40 inches), and slopes greater than 25 percent generally contain soils that are moderately
deep (20 to 40 inches) to shallow (< 20 inches). The shallowest soil in the area is the Millsholm
Loam, which is located near the southwest boundary of Contra Loma, while the deepest soil is
the Capay Clay, which is located near the northeast boundary.

Landslides

Landslides include earthflows, slumps, and translational slides. Landslides and related areas of
instability have been mapped within the Contra Loma Recreation Area and adjacent EBRPD
lands (Wentworth et al. 1997). Future landslides are most likely to occur within and around
places where landslides have previously occurred. One area of unstable terrain is mapped within
the eastern half of the Contra Loma Recreation Area (Figure 3-16). The steeper upland terrain of
the EBRPD lands contains numerous areas of mapped landslide activity and associated areas of
instability. Landslides can occur in response to changes in water content, earthquake shaking, or
removal of downslope support. Landslides in the type of terrain that is typically found in the
Contra Loma area tend to be shallow and slow moving, and pose minimal threat to public safety.
Landslides can, however, deform the ground surface and damage infrastructure.

3.13 Climate and Air Quality
3.13.1 Existing Conditions
Climate

The climate in the Bay Area is characterized by dry summers and moderately wet winters, with
75 percent of the average annual rainfall occurring in winter. Precipitation amounts can vary
greatly, sometimes within short distances. Annual rainfall can range from less than 16 inches in
valley areas to 40 inches in mountainous areas (City of Antioch 2003b). In Antioch, the monthly
average precipitation ranges from 0.02 inch (July) to 2.76 inches (January), with an annual
average total of 13.09 inches. No snowfall has been recorded for the period from March 1, 1955
to June 30, 2000 (City of Antioch 2003b).
During the summer months (June, July, and August) the Bay Area experiences little precipitation
and winds tend to blow onshore from the north and northwest. Pollution potential is higher
during the summer months due to strong northwesterly winds (City of Antioch 2003b). During
summer months, the California coast and coastal cities often experience fog and stratus clouds
due to heavy condensation.
For the period from March 1, 1955 to June 30, 2000, average high temperatures in Antioch
ranged from 53.6°F (January) to 90.9°F (July). The annual average maximum was 73.3°F.
During this period, monthly average minimum temperatures ranged from 36.7°F (January) to
57.1°F (July). The annual average minimum was 47.6°F.
Summertime temperatures in the Bay Area are greatly influenced by differential heating between
land and water surfaces. Land areas heat and cool more quickly than water areas. This difference
often creates a large-scale temperature gradient between the coast and the Central Valley. Smallscale local gradients are also produced near shorelines. On summer afternoons, coastal
temperatures can be 35 degrees cooler than inland temperatures. In the winter, the daytime
temperature contrast between coastal and inland areas is usually small but the nighttime
temperature variation is large, with warmer nighttime temperatures near the coast and cooler
nighttime temperatures further inland (City of Antioch 2003b).
Antioch is located on the south side of the Carquinez Strait, the only sea-level gap in the Coast
Ranges of California. Strong, persistent winds usually flow westward through the Carquinez
Strait. Wind speeds are generally highest in spring and summer and lowest in fall and winter.
During the spring and summer, the daily wind speed variation is greatest, with wind speeds
peaking in the late afternoon. During fall and winter, wind speeds and directions are more
variable (City of Antioch 2003b).
Air Quality

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) operates a network of 28 air
monitoring stations that measure air quality levels in the Bay Area. The stations nearest to Contra
Loma are located in Concord (14 miles to the west) and Bethel Island (9 miles to the east). The
Bay Area is in non-attainment for Federal ozone standards, and for particulate matter (PM)
smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) and 10 micrometers (PM10) (Bay Area Air Quality
Management District 2010).

3-78 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

Ozone is harmful to public health when it occurs at high concentrations near ground level where
it can be inhaled. Ozone can damage the tissues of the respiratory tract and lungs. High
concentrations can irritate the nose, throat, and respiratory system, and constrict the airways.
Ozone can also aggravate other respiratory conditions and can have negative cardiovascular
effects.
Ozone is not emitted directly into the air by a source such as a vehicle, but is formed through a
complex series of chemical reactions involving other compounds that are directly emitted. These
directly emitted pollutants (also known as ozone precursors) include reactive organic gases
(ROGs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The principal sources of ROGs and NOx are the combustion
of fuels and the evaporation of solvents, paints, and fuels. The main sources of ozone precursors
in the Bay Area are motor vehicles; evaporation of solvents, fuels, and other petroleum products;
and combustion at industrial and other facilities (Bay Area Air Quality Management District
2010). Ozone levels are usually highest on hot, windless summer afternoons, especially in inland
valleys.
The time period required for ozone formation allows the reacting compounds to spread over a
large area, producing a regional pollution problem. Ozone problems are the cumulative result of
regional development patterns rather than the result of a few significant emission sources.
Depending on meteorological conditions, ozone precursors can be transported well away from
the source area before ozone concentrations peak.
PM can consist of many types of particles, including chemical elements such as carbon and
metals; compounds such as nitrates, sulfates, and organics; or complex mixtures such as diesel
exhaust, wood smoke, and geological dust. Acute and chronic health effects associated with high
particulate levels include the aggravation of chronic respiratory diseases; heart and lung disease;
and coughing, bronchitis, and respiratory illnesses in children. According to the BAAQMD, fine
PM may be the air pollutant that is most harmful to public health in the Bay Area. Additional
effects of PM include reduced visibility and soiling of buildings. PM may also influence climate
change. Sources of PM include combustion of fossil fuels, wood and agricultural burning, and
geological dust, which includes construction dust, road dust, and windblown dust (Bay Area Air
Quality Management District 2010).
The strong, persistent winds in Antioch reduce the atmospheric potential for localized air
pollution. These winds dilute pollutants and transport them to surrounding regions. Pollutants
generated or carried through Antioch by the wind are often carried eastward into the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys. Likewise, pollutants generated in other portions of the Bay Area to the
west are transported to Antioch (City of Antioch 2003b).
Ozone precursors (ROG and NOx) are generated within Contra Loma by fossil fuel combustion
from motorized vehicle and maintenance equipment use and by evaporation of solvents, fuels,
and other petroleum products used for construction and maintenance activities. PM sources
within Contra Loma include fossil fuel combustion, dust generated by construction and
maintenance activities, and windblown dust. Ozone precursors and PM are also generated by
vehicles traveling to and from Contra Loma.

3-79 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Some types of land uses are considered more sensitive to air pollution than others. Sensitive
receptors are facilities that house or attract children, the elderly, people with illnesses, or others
who are especially sensitive to the effects of air pollutants. Examples of sensitive receptors
include hospitals, schools, convalescent facilities, and residential areas. Parks such as Contra
Loma may also be considered sensitive receptors because they attract children and are used for
aerobic recreation activities. Sensitive receptors in the vicinity of Contra Loma include nearby
residential areas.
Particulate air pollutants, from both naturally occurring and human sources, have been monitored
by the BAAQMD at several monitoring stations near Contra Loma, but not within or adjacent to
Contra Loma (Bay Area Air Quality Management District 2013). Monthly average levels of
PM10 (particulates 10 microns and less in size) at the Concord monitoring station in 2012 were
12.6 micrograms per cubic meter (ug-3). In 2012, the maximum 24-hour PM10 level at Concord
was 35 ug-3. In 2012, the monthly average PM10 level at Bethel Island was 14.1 ug-3, with a
maximum 24-hour of PM10 level of 52 ug-3. BAAQMD’s Concord station monitored a monthly
average PM2.5 level of 6.5 ug-3 in 2012 and a maximum 24-hour PM2.5 level of 32.2 ug-3.
California maximum 24-hour standards for PM10 were exceeded on one day in 2012 at Bethel
Island but were not exceeded at Concord. California and National annual standards for PM10
were not exceeded at either station, nor were California or National PM2.5 standards exceeded at
Concord. BAAQMD does not maintain any stations to monitor particulates closer to Contra
Loma than these stations, and does not monitor PM2.5 at Bethel Island.
Climate Change

Various gases in the earth’s atmosphere, classified as atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG), play
a critical role in determining the earth’s surface temperature. Prominent GHGs include carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, and sulfur
hexafluoride. Human-generated emissions of GHGs which exceed natural ambient
concentrations are responsible for intensifying the earth’s natural greenhouse effect and have led
to a trend of unnatural warming of the Earth’s climate, known as global climate change or global
warming (Ahrens 2003).
Evidence for historic warming of the Earth’s climate system, including Earth’s near-surface air
and ocean temperatures, is now considered to be unequivocal, with global surface temperature
having increased approximately 1.33°F over the last 100 years. Future global climate change
trends and implications for the U.S. are projected to include:
•

An increase in global average temperature between 2 and 11°F over the next 100 years;

•

More frequent and longer warm weather extremes across North America;

•

A decrease in mean annual precipitation in the southwestern U.S. but an increase over the
rest of the continent;

•

Widespread increases in extreme precipitation, with greater risks of not only flooding
from intense precipitation, but also droughts from greater temporal variability in
precipitation;

3-80 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

•

Sea level rise from 7 to 23 inches by the end of this century; and

•

Reduced snowpack in the western mountains, more winter flooding, and reduced summer
flows that would adversely affect the supply of water resources (Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change 2007).

In the Bay Area, climate change is expected to increase the number of high heat days and
wildfires, which would likely exacerbate air pollution in the Bay Area and hinder efforts to attain
air quality standards for ozone and PM (Bay Area Air Quality Management District 2010).
Unlike criteria air pollutants, such as ozone and PM, which are pollutants of regional and local
concern, GHGs are global pollutants; consequently, climate change is a global problem. In the
Bay Area, transportation and commercial and industrial sources generate the most GHG
emissions, accounting for about 70 percent of the Bay Area’s GHG emissions. Of these sources,
passenger vehicles are the largest, generating about 27 percent of the Bay Area’s GHGs.
Electricity generated for Bay Area utilities, including electricity imported from outside the Bay
Area, accounts for about 16 percent of the GHGs generated by the Bay Area (Bay Area Air
Quality Management District 2010). GHG sources attributable to Contra Loma’s land uses and
activities include passenger vehicle trips, electricity use, fossil fuel combustion from motorized
vehicles and maintenance equipment, and livestock use.
The City’s baseline community wide GHG emissions inventory was completed in February 2008
as part of the City of Antioch Municipal Climate Action Plan, with a grant from the International
Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (City of Antioch 2011c). The inventory reveals that
for the year 2005, the City released 308,954 metric tons of CO2 (MTCO2e) in 2005 and, if steps
are not taken to achieve reductions, the City is projected to emit 75,000 more MTCO2e in 2020.
The City’s total community-wide GHG emissions in 2005 are equivalent to the emissions
generated by 60,000 passenger vehicles.

3.14 Noise
3.14.1 Existing Conditions

Transportation noise is the most dominant source of noise in the City, followed by noise
generated from other routine activities and equipment use. The overall amount of traffic has less
influence on road noise levels than vehicle speed and the number of trucks (City of Antioch
2003b).
Contra Loma’s noise environment is consistent with its suburban/semi-rural setting. Contra
Loma is surrounded by residential areas to the north and southeast, a golf course to the east, and
open space to the west and southwest. These land uses typically do not generate substantial
volumes of noise. James Donlon Boulevard runs along the northern boundary of the Community
Park and is the dominant off-site noise source. Noise from James Donlon Boulevard is more
noticeable from the Community Park than from the Regional Park. Distance and intervening
topography greatly reduce the level of road noise that is audible from most areas of the Regional
Park. Frederickson Lane generates transportation noise that is audible in the southeast portion of
the Regional Park; however, similar to James Donlon Boulevard, distance and intervening

3-81 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

topography greatly reduce the level of road noise that is audible from most areas of the Regional
Park. Aircraft overflights are an intermittent contributor to overall background noise levels as
there are no major airports near Antioch.
Noise generated within Contra Loma includes vehicle and mechanical equipment noise,
maintenance activities, human voices, sports whistles, wildlife and livestock sounds, splashing
water, and gate sounds. Noise from vehicles and mechanical equipment includes motors, closing
doors and trunks, and tire squeal. Noise from maintenance activities can include equipment and
vehicle noise, trash can handling, mowing, and other activities. Human voices in the area usually
range from typical conversations to cheers, shouting, and crowd noise associated with sports
league play. Noise generated by sports league play at the Community Park includes vehicle
noise, sports whistles, and human voices. Sports league play represents a prominent source of
noise generated within Contra Loma. Boating is restricted to electric and human-powered
vessels; therefore, boat noise is not a substantial noise source within Contra Loma.
The highest noise levels at Contra Loma are located near James Donlon Road and other locations
with a high concentration of human and mechanical activity. These locations include the
Community Park sports fields and parking lots, the high-use recreation areas along the south
shore of the reservoir, parking areas, and trash collection areas. Noise levels generated by
recreational land uses and activities vary depending on the timing and intensity of use and
activity. Most recreational activity, including sports league play, occurs during evenings and
weekends, whereas maintenance activities are typically performed during the day. The intensity
of various types of recreational activities also varies seasonally.
Sensitive noise receptors include residences, schools, hospitals, and places of worship. The only
sensitive noise receptors within ¼ mile of Contra Loma are the residences to the north and
southeast. The nearest residences to the Community Park are north of the park on the opposite
side of James Donlon Boulevard. These single-family residences are located 400 feet from sports
fields 1 through 3 in the western portion of the Community Park, 500 feet from sports fields 4
and 5, and 200 feet from the parking lots. On the east side of the Community Park, single-family
residences are located 1,400 feet from sports fields 4 and 5 and 700 feet from the eastern parking
lot. Multi-family residences are located several hundred feet northwest of the Community Park.
The nearest residences to the Regional Park are the single-family residences directly adjacent to
the northwest boundary of the park and those backing up to Frederickson Lane on the southeast
side of the Regional Park. Visitor use in the northwest and southeast portions of the Regional
Park near these residences is primarily limited to hiking, which is a relatively quiet activity that
does not generate substantial noise. The residential areas within ¼ mile of Contra Loma have
already been completely built-out. Therefore, no new residences are expected to be built in the
vicinity of Contra Loma. Neither EBRPD nor the City has received noise complaints from
nearby residents.

3.15 Visual Resources
3.15.1 Existing Conditions
Visual Character of Contra Loma

The visual setting of the Contra Loma Recreation Area is consistent with its location and
character as a regional and community park on the northern edge of the Diablo Range. Views
from any given location may include rolling grassland, oak woodland, hills and ridges, the
reservoir surface, riparian and wetland habitat, the swim lagoon, park buildings, sports fields,
picnic areas, roads, parking areas, and nearby suburban land uses (see Photographs 1 through 12
and Figure 3-17).
The primary visual elements of the recreation area include rolling hills and ridges supporting
grassland with scattered oaks, grass-covered valleys, the reservoir surface, and the landscaped
recreation facilities along the south side of the reservoir and within the Community Park. The
dam is not a primary element of views from most locations in Contra Loma. The dam face can be
seen from some areas of the Community Park near the dam; but for most of Contra Loma, views
of the dam only include a narrow portion of the rocked dam crest rising above the reservoir
water.
The primary visual features located outside Contra Loma and visible from within Contra Loma
are the grass- and tree-covered foothills of Mt. Diablo to the south and west, and the landscaping,
buildings, and structures of the suburban areas of Antioch to the northwest, north, east, and
southeast.
Views From within Contra Loma

Views from within Contra Loma also vary depending on the viewer’s location. Views from
locations on or near the reservoir can include the reservoir surface and shoreline, fishing docks,
the boat launch, landscaped picnic areas, the swim lagoon, restrooms, shower facilities, the food
concession area, and the EBRPD office. Distant views can also include hills, ridges, and
suburban land uses near Contra Loma (see Photographs 1 through 6 and Figure 3-17).
Views from within the Community Park can include sports fields, play grounds, picnic areas,
parking lots, trails, and restrooms located within the park. Distant views can also include
portions of the Regional Park, and nearby hills, ridges, and suburban land uses. The dam face
may also be seen from some locations in the northwesternmost portion of the Community Park
(see Photographs 7 through 9 and Figure 3-17).
Views to the north and east from the ridge tops along the southern and western margins of
Contra Loma include the reservoir and dam, the landscaped facilities along the southern
shoreline of the reservoir, grassland, and distant views of Antioch and the Delta beyond. Views
to the south and west from these ridges include distant views of suburban land uses and the
grass- and tree-covered foothills of the Diablo Range (see Photographs 10 and 11 and Figure 317).

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Views of Contra Loma from Offsite Locations

Views of Contra Loma from offsite vary depending on the viewer’s location. Views from the
north include the grass-covered face of Contra Loma Dam, the dam facilities, and the
landscaping, sports fields, and parking lots of the Community Park. Elevated views of Contra
Loma from the north also include the grassy ridges south and west of the reservoir (see
Photograph 12 and Figure 3-17). Views from the east, such as from Lone Tree Golf Course or
nearby residences, can include rolling grassland, ridges, landscaping, and sports fields. Views
from the south and west are limited to the grassy ridges that line Contra Loma’s southern and
western margins, although very distant views of other portions of Contra Loma may be available
from higher elevation viewpoints on the flanks of Mt. Diablo.
Nighttime views of the Community Park are generally dark, except when the sports fields in the
western half of the park are illuminated for night time use. Nighttime views of the Regional Park
from offsite locations are generally dark, because nighttime lighting is very limited and nighttime
activity is minimal.

Hazardous Materials

Superfund is the Federal government's program to clean up the nation's hazardous waste sites.
Table 3-14 lists the three active and five archived hazardous waste sites that are located in the
City. The site locations are shown on Figure 3-18. Active sites are sites at which site assessment,
removal, remediation, enforcement, cost recovery, or oversight activities are being planned or
conducted under the Federal Superfund program; the archive designation indicates that the site is
of no further interest under the Superfund program. None of the eight sites in the City are on the
National Priorities List. The nearest active site to Contra Loma is the GBF, Inc. dump site, one
mile northwest of Contra Loma (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011).

Storage and handling of hazardous materials within the Regional Park is limited to relatively
small quantities of fertilizers, pesticides, fuels, oils, solvents, and other chemicals used by
EBRPD for routine operation and maintenance activities. EBRPD employs safe storage and
handling practices in compliance with the standards of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, and the County. The
City does not store hazardous materials at the Community Park. During a recent three-year
analysis period, EBRPD fire personnel responded to two hazardous materials incidents at the
Regional Park. EBRPD considers Contra Loma to have a moderate rate of hazardous materials
occurrence compared to its other parks (East Bay Regional Park District 2010a).
Dam Failure

Contra Loma Reservoir is located above the City. In 1983, Reclamation’s Division of Dam
Safety conducted a safety analysis of the reservoir and determined that “safe performance of the
dam can be expected under all anticipated loading conditions, including the maximum credible
earthquake and probable maximum flood events” (City of Antioch 2003a). The overall safety
classification of the dam is registered as satisfactory (City of Antioch 2003a). The risk from dam
failure to Contra Loma visitors and to the City is low.
In the unlikely event of dam failure, the path of inundation is expected to generally follow the
West Antioch Creek drainage northward from the dam to the San Joaquin River. The inundation
area would be approximately ¾ mile wide and the anticipated maximum depth would range from
19 feet directly north of the dam to 7 feet at the San Joaquin River near the City’s downtown
area (City of Antioch 2003a).

Wildland Fires

Wildland fires can occur in many parts of California, including the Bay Area. Contra Loma is
within the City and, thus is not under the jurisdiction of Cal Fire. Although lands adjacent to the
City limits and surrounding Contra Loma have been mapped by Cal Fire as being Very High Fire
Hazard Severity zones, fire hazard severity in Contra Loma itself has not been mapped. Because
Contra Loma is located within the City, it has been designated by Cal Fire as being a Local
Responsibility Area, meaning that local fire protection agencies (e.g., City and/or County rather
than Cal Fire) are directly responsible for fire suppression (California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection 2009). As discussed in Section 3.6 (Public Health and Safety), EBRPD and
the CCCFPD are responsible for fire management in Contra Loma. During the three-year period
from 2006 through 2008, EBRPD responded to five fires at the Regional Park, which represents
a slightly above-average occurrence of wildland fires when compared to other EBRPD parks
(East Bay Regional Park District 2010a).

3.17 Cultural Resources
3.17.1 Existing Conditions
Cultural Setting

Prehistoric human occupation of California stretches back over 12,000 years to the late
Pleistocene Era (Moratto 1984). Evidence of the earliest known occupation of the Contra Loma
region and San Francisco Bay Area was found during archaeological investigations at Los
Vaqueros Reservoir, located approximately 11 miles southeast of Contra Loma. The excavations
there revealed prehistoric occupation of the East Bay Area from approximately 8,000 years
before the present day (BP) to the historic period as late as 200 BP (Milliken et al. 2007). Native
peoples engaged in their traditional lifeways until the ethnographic and early historic period just
prior to sustained contact with Euro-American groups. The Contra Loma region is situated in an
area formerly occupied by the Karkin Costanoan (Ohlone) and Bay Miwok (Milliken et al.
2007). Some of the earliest accounts of the ethnographic Costanoans date to the 1760s when
Spain was expanding its empire through exploratory expeditions and the establishment of the
mission system in the coastal and inland regions of southern and central California.
Supported by Spanish and later Mexican governments and private individuals the main economic
pursuits in the Contra Loma area during the 19th century consisted of farming, ranching, and
dairying. Several homestead patents in the vicinity of the Area of Potential Effects (APE) were
awarded in the 1870s and were occupied by individuals and families engaged in the agricultural
industry (Hulaniski 1917). At the same time farms and ranches were being established in the
Contra Loma area, the discovery of large deposits of coal in the nearby “Black Diamond” area
further spurred agricultural and industrial activity in the Contra Loma region. Mining towns such
as Nortonville, Somersville, Stewartville, West Hartley, and Judsonville were important centers
from the 1860s through the last years of the 19th century. Although coal mining did not occur
within the boundaries of the APE, transportation routes such as wagon roads and railroads passed
through the area and connected the mines with Antioch and the larger Bay Area markets.
Following the decline of the coal mining industry in the region, agricultural and ranching
pursuits continued to thrive and formed the basis of the regional economy throughout much of

3-96 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

the 20th century. In order to support these industries, provide water to the drier southern regions
of California, reduce seasonal flooding, and foster continued development in the state, the CVP
was established and constructed between the 1930s and 1960s. Part of this state-wide system,
one of the largest public works projects in the U.S., is the Delta Division which includes the
Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir located within the APE. Contra Loma Dam was completed in
1967 and the reservoir serves as an off-stream water storage facility for the Contra Costa Canal
(also a CVP component; Stene 1994). Completed prior to the full adoption of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, no cultural resources investigations were conducted before
the dam and reservoir were built.
Study Methodology

Research into cultural resources issues consisted of several avenues of investigation. These
included, but were not necessarily restricted to, archival research conducted through the
Northwest Information Center of the California Historical Resources Information System, and
reviews of additional sources such as the USGS Historic Topographic Map Collection, the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the California Register of Historical Resources, the
Contra Costa Historical Society, and documents curated by Reclamation. Research also consisted
of Native American community outreach, and a reconnaissance field survey intended to verify
the presence and integrity of cultural resources previously identified within and adjacent to the
APE .
Identified Cultural Resources

Archival research and a reconnaissance field survey resulted in the identification of prehistoric
and historic-era cultural resources within Contra Loma. The survey also updated existing
information on one prehistoric site (CA-CCo-572) and examined its surrounding vicinity for
potentially undocumented components or other unrecorded cultural resources.
This research revealed that 10 cultural resources investigations have been conducted within
Contra Loma. These studies resulted in the archaeological survey of approximately 170 acres
within Contra Loma (approximately 23 percent of Contra Loma lands including the 80 surface
acres of the reservoir) and surveys of about 3.8 miles of roadways and trails within Contra Loma.
These studies, along with historic mapping, Reclamation documents, and other sources, indicates
that 12 prehistoric and historic-era sites and features have been identified within or immediately
adjacent to Contra Loma. These sites represent early Native American use of the landscape and
historic-era activities such as ranching, transportation, and water storage and conveyance in and
around Contra Loma. Additional sites, features, and artifacts associated with prehistoric and
historic-era activities may be present in un-surveyed portions of the APE.
Prehistoric Sites
CA-CCo-572. This site is located within the APE and was originally documented in 2008. A
2011 reconnaissance survey noted the presence of three isolated prehistoric artifacts not
documented in the original 1988 records for this site. These artifacts were discovered over 45
meters away from the site and consisted of a single flake to the northwest and a core fragment
and single flake to the southeast of the site. These artifacts were of the same lithic material as all
the artifacts located on the site: a dark gray to off-white to reddish-yellow cryptocrystalline
silicate. Bedrock outcrops are visible on the site surface suggesting shallow soil development.

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

The site record for CA-CCo-572 was updated following the field survey. The condition of the
previously recorded portions of this site appears to be unchanged from the initial recording and
no indications of midden soils or subsurface deposits were noted. This site has not been assessed
as to NRHP listing eligibility.
CA-CCo-385. This site is located adjacent to but outside of the APE. The site consists of
prehistoric and historic-era components situated on a hill approximately 200 meters east of the
Community Park boundary and north of the Antioch Municipal Reservoir. It is likely that these
sites have been destroyed by the development of the surrounding residential neighborhood. CACCo-385 was a possible midden with fire-affected rock; quartzite, chalcedony, basalt, and
petrified wood debitage; and sandstone and basalt groundstone tools. The site also had a historic
component containing an abandoned cattle watering trough, square nails, ceramics, and redwood
posts. This site was located in a swale that contained an active spring but is now covered and
possibly destroyed entirely by houses and the intersection of Dunes and Andrews Way. This site
was not revisited at the time of the 2011 survey and has not been assessed for NRHP listing
eligibility.
CA-CCo-386. This site, which contains both prehistoric and historic-era artifacts, is located
adjacent to but outside of the APE and was documented in the immediate vicinity of CA-CCo385. A possible midden with fire-affected rock, chert debitage, and sandstone groundstone tools
were recorded along with a historic-era component consisting of a fig tree, metal, ceramics, and
an unspecified trash scatter. As with CA-CCo-385, this site appears to have been destroyed by
residential and roadway construction. Both this site and CA-CCo-385 were situated within lands
included in the 1872 Sale-Cash Entry land patent of Benjamin Hockabout (Bureau of Land
Management, General Land Office 1872). The 1879 Contra Costa County tax roll listed Dr.
Samuel Adams as the landowner. This site was not revisited at the time of the 2011 survey and
has not been assessed for NRHP listing eligibility.
Ranching and Agricultural Sites
Structure Location. A structure (possibly a windmill) noted on the 1898 Mount Diablo USGS
quadrangle (and later maps) within the APE was not relocated. The mapped location of the
structure is currently covered in thick cattails and riparian vegetation along the reservoir shore
and covered in thick grasses on the small hill between the reservoir and the road. Although the
heavy vegetation could be obscuring at least some remains of the windmill, dam and reservoir
construction more than likely destroyed any traces of this structure. This site has not been
assessed for NRHP listing eligibility.
Ranch Complex Location. The 1989 Contra Loma Regional Park Land Use Development Plan
Amendment and Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Assessment (EIR/EA): Antioch
Community Park at Contra Loma (City of Antioch and Bureau of Reclamation 1989) discusses
the presence of an old ranch complex in the APE where the Community Park is now located. The
EIR/EA includes a discussion of integrating the remnant almond orchard, ornamental eucalyptus
trees, and various non-native shrubs into the park infrastructure. The EIR/EA also includes a map
that indicates the presence of an old stock pond and the former location of the ranch house.
However, there is no indication that the historic-era ranch was formally documented through the
California Historic Resource Information System and no evidence of this ranch complex was

3-98 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

noted during the 2011 reconnaissance survey. This site has not been assessed for NRHP listing
eligibility.
Historic-era Building Location. An unidentified building or other structure is depicted on 1898
and 1916 USGS maps of Contra Loma and the surrounding area. This location is presently under
the Contra Loma Reservoir. Any traces of this location were almost certainly destroyed or at
least inundated by the construction of the reservoir in the 1960s. Because the site could not be
visited and has almost certainly been destroyed, it has not been assessed for NRHP listing
eligibility.
Historic Transportation Routes
Empire Railroad. A segment of the old Empire Railroad alignment cut through the southeasternmost portion of the APE. The feature was related to the Empire Company which was founded in
1876 by George Hawxhurst and John C. Rouse to mine the rich coal veins in the Black Diamond
area. Initially, the company transported coal by wagon teams to the coal wharf at Antioch about
six miles to the north. The company built the narrow gauge Empire Railroad in 1877 to improve
the transport of coal to Antioch and from there to the broader Bay Area markets. The Empire
Company ceased operations in 1902 and presumably abandoned their rail line at that time.
This feature has not been recorded as a cultural resource and an examination of the general area
of the APE within which the rail alignment would have extended did not reveal any traces of its
presence. According to USGS mapping, the Empire Railroad line appears to have been partially
realigned and repurposed sometime between 1941 and 1947. The 1941 USGS Mount Diablo
quadrangle shows the alignment as a railroad and following the same route as noted on the 1898
Mount Diablo quadrangle map. However, according to the 1947 USGS Mount Diablo
quadrangle, the line had been straightened and shifted slightly to the east to conform to the
USGS map section line. Around this time the alignment appears to have been converted to a
surface road. Due to its realignment and re-purposing, and the lack of any physical evidence for
its presence, this feature does not retain any physical integrity or integrity of setting. This site has
not been assessed for NRHP listing eligibility.
Oil Canyon Road. An early 20th century alignment of Oil Canyon Road appears to exist within
the APE to the south of the reservoir. It extends due south from the boat launch at the south side
of the reservoir to the edge of Contra Loma as a paved road. The alignment continues to the
south and outside Contra Loma as a graveled access/ranch road onto private undeveloped land
and was noted during the field survey. The portion of the road alignment appears to have been
destroyed or at least inundated by the construction of the Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir. This
site has not been assessed for NRHP listing eligibility.
James Donlon Boulevard. Located along the northern boundary of the APE, this east-west
trending road was first documented on the 1898 Mount Diablo USGS topographic quadrangle
map. This roadway did not constitute a major route but was merely a local access route
throughout much of the 20th century. By the latter half of the 20th century the road was expanded
and ultimately named James Donlon Boulevard presumably in honor of James D. Donlon who
served as Mayor of the City of Antioch and as a councilman for many years in the late 19th
century (Contra Costa County Community Development Department Historic Resources
Inventory 2010). This site has not been assessed for NRHP listing eligibility.

3-99 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Water Conveyance and Storage Sites
Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir. The Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir are components of the
Delta Division of the CVP and constitute an off-stream water storage site for the Contra Costa
Canal. The dam, an earth fill structure, was completed in 1967 and has a structural height of 107
feet and a crest length of 1,050 feet. The reservoir measures approximately 80 acres in surface
area and retains 2,100 acre-feet of water. The dam and reservoir are owned by the U.S.
Government. CCWD has been operating and maintaining the reservoir, under contract with
Reclamation since 1967, as a regulating reservoir for peak or short-term municipal water
supplies for CCWD customers, and also for emergency storage and as a backup water supply.
The Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir is an important element in the Delta Division of the CVP
system. Even though the facility is of fairly recent construction it will reach the minimum age of
50 years per the NRHP criteria during implementation of the Contra Loma Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan. CVP dams such as Contra Loma may be eligible under Criterion A
if they are demonstrably associated with the agricultural development of the state or region,
played a determining role in the history of the CVP or the Bureau of Reclamation, or created key
storage reservoirs associated with the CVP. Reclamation considers and treats the CVP as eligible
under Criterion A for its national and local economic contribution to the development of
California. Therefore, the dam may be determined eligible for NRHP listing as a contributing
property to the CVP (Perry, pers. comm. 2014).
P-07-002695-Contra Costa Canal. The Contra Costa Canal, which forms the northern border of
APE, was constructed by Reclamation and is part of the larger CVP. The canal is 47 miles long
and supplies water along its length from the headgates at Rock Slough in the Delta to the City of
Martinez. Construction on the canal began in 1937 and was completed in 1951. The Canal was
determined eligible for listing on the NRHP, through consensus with the California State Historic
Preservation Officer dated March 9, 2005, due to its association with the CVP and the
development of agriculture and irrigation in California.
Antioch Municipal Reservoir. The Municipal Reservoir was created in the late 1920s to serve
the citizens of the City of Antioch, is not associated in any with the Contra Loma
Dam/Reservoir, and is not situated within or immediately adjacent to the APE. The reservoir was
constructed solely to provide water to the City of Antioch. It was not part of a larger system such
as the CVP and consequently did not contribute to the broader patterns of water acquisition,
conveyance, and distribution. This site has not been assessed for NRHP listing eligibility. The
reservoir is situated to the east and outside of the APE and would not be affected by any projects
within Contra Loma.
Current Condition of the APE
A 2011 reconnaissance survey and archival research indicate that large portions of the APE have
been subjected to intensive developments that would have disturbed or destroyed identified and
presently undocumented cultural resources. These developments consist of the Contra Loma
Dam/Reservoir, recreational facilities and infrastructure associated with the Regional Park,
which are situated primarily along the south side of the Reservoir. This developed area, including
the 80 acres covered by the reservoir, consists of approximately 149.3 acres. Additional
recreational features and construction related to the Community Park in the northeast section of
the APE have disturbed an additional approximately 36.8 acres. In total, approximately 25
3-100 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 3. Affected Environment

percent of the APE has been disturbed by dam/reservoir and recreation-associated developments.
Although many of the individual developments within the APE possess limited footprints (e.g.
roads, trails, boat launch, restrooms, etc.), collectively they have affected a fairly large area and
have reduced the potential for additional discoveries in those areas in both surface and
subsurface contexts. Small intact sites, isolated artifacts, or sparse scatters of archaeological
materials may still exist in these developed areas. However, in general, any larger or potentially
significant (per NRHP criteria) cultural resources in these areas likely would have been
destroyed or at least damaged by construction activities.
In addition, portions of the APE (approximately 170.62 acres [about 23 percent]) have been
subjected to surface archaeological surveys including those conducted in 2011 for this EIS. The
2011 surveys resulted in the identification of only three cultural resources; CA-CCo-572, Contra
Loma Dam/Reservoir, and the Contra Costa Canal which is situated outside but immediately
adjacent to the northern edge of the APE. However, it is important to note that some of these
studies were conducted prior to the development of present-day survey and research
methodologies and may not meet today’s requirements for identification efforts.

The County is among the state’s most populous counties. Major factors contributing to the
County’s population growth over the past two decades include close proximity to major
employment centers in San Francisco and Oakland; development of new employment centers in
the I-680 corridor and the Livermore/Pleasanton area; the availability of rapid transit; and
relatively affordable housing prices compared with other parts of the Bay Area. During the
1990s, the County’s population growth was strongest in the eastern portion of the County,
particularly in Antioch, Brentwood, and Oakley. Over the coming decade, much of the County’s

3-101 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

population growth is expected to occur in the eastern portion of the County in and around
Antioch and in San Ramon (Contra Costa County 2005).
Population growth in the City over the past two decades can be largely attributed to the
expansion of employment centers in the Concord/Walnut Creek and Livermore/Pleasanton areas,
combined with an increasing lack of affordability in locations closer to the major Bay Area
employment centers. The City’s large supply of vacant land, attractive physical setting, and
accessibility to the SR 4 freeway has attracted large numbers of people to the City (City of
Antioch 2003a).
Table 3-18 shows projected growth from 2010 to 2030 (approximately 20 years from present) for
California and the County, and Table 3-19 shows projected growth from 2010 to 2025
(approximately 15 years from present) for the City. From 2010 to 2030, the populations of
California and the County are projected to grow by 32.2 percent and 35.6 percent, respectively,
with average annual increases of 1.6 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. These projections
indicate that the County’s population will increase at a slightly higher rate than that of the state
(California Department of Finance 2011b). From 2010 to 2025, the population of the City is
expected to grow by 16 percent, with an average annual increase of 0.8 percent. This projection
shows that the City is expected to grow at about half the rate of California and the County (City
of Antioch 2003a).

Housing

Table 3-20 presents housing data for California, the County, and the City. Between 2000 and
2010, the total number of housing units and the number of occupied units in the County and the
City increased by more than the state average of 12 percent for total and 9.3 percent for
occupied. The City experienced a higher increase than the state and the County in both total
housing and occupied housing with 15.7 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively. These data
support the fact that the City experienced higher growth rates than the rest of the County during
that time period. Table 3-20 also shows that the City experienced a greater decrease in

occupancy rates (5 percent) than either the state or the County. In other words, the City
experienced a greater percent increase in vacancy rates than both the state and the County
between 2000 and 2010. The City’s 2010 housing occupancy rate (92.5 percent) remains a bit
higher than the state’s rate of 91.9 percent and lower than the County’s rate of 93.8 percent

Employment and Income

Total number of people employed in the County in 2010 was 343,412 (Census Bureau 2010a).
The leading occupational categories include managerial/professional and
sales/technical/administrative. Major industries in the County include petroleum refining,
telecommunications, retail and financial services, steel manufacturing, prefabricated metals,
chemicals, electronic equipment, paper products, and food processing. Over the period between
2000 and 2020, the three largest job growth centers in the County have been, and are projected to
be, San Ramon, Concord, and Richmond. Antioch, San Ramon, and Brentwood are expected to
experience the largest growth in retail employment (Contra Costa County 2005). The countywide
average wage paid per job in 2005 was $51,416 (California Department of Finance 2011d).

In 2000, the Census reported the City’s total civilian labor force to be 43,893; total employment
was 41,598. Most of the City’s employed residents have sales or office-based jobs, and many of
these are located outside the City. Other occupations held by City residents include service
industry, construction, and production/transportation jobs. By 2025, service industry jobs are
expected to comprise around half of the job opportunities within the City (City of Antioch
2003a).
Expenditures for Fishing and Wildlife Viewing

Fishing and wildlife viewing bring visitors and visitor expenditures to recreation areas, such as
Contra Loma, and their surrounding regions. Fishing permits and licenses also generate revenues
for the issuing government agencies. In 2011 in California, $2.3 billion was spent on fishing
recreation, of which $1.6 billion was for trip-related expenditures, $577 million was for
equipment purchases, and $71 million was for the purchase of other items, such as magazines,
membership dues, licenses, permits, stamps, and land leasing and ownership. The average
expenditure per angler was $1,333 and the average angler trip expenditure per day was $68. The
average expenditure per wildlife watching participant was $533 per day with an average trip
expenditure of $65 (Fish and Wildlife Service and Census Bureau 2013). In California, in 2012,
sales generated by sport fishing licenses totaled $56,959,464 (California Department of Fish and
Wildlife 2013b).
Environmental Justice

In order to comply with Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental
Justice in Minority and Low-Income Populations, data was compiled concerning the ethnic
composition and income and poverty levels of the state, the County, and the City. Table 3-22
shows that in 2000, the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities throughout the state was 40.5
percent, and people of Hispanic ethnicity were 32.4 percent of the state’s population. By 2010,
the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities throughout the state had increased to 42.4 percent and
people of Hispanic ethnicity had increased to 37.6 percent of the state’s population. During that
period, the percentage of people of white ethnicity in the state’s population decreased from 59.5
percent to 57.6 percent. People of Hispanic ethnicity represent the largest minority in California
(California Department of Finance 2011e).
Table 3-23 shows that in 2000, the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities in the County was 34.5
percent, and people of Hispanic ethnicity were 17.7 percent of the County’s population. By 2010,
the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities in the County had increased to 41.4 percent and
people of Hispanic ethnicity had increased to comprise 24.4 percent of the County’s population.
During that period, the percentage of white ethnicity in the County’s population decreased from
65.5 percent to 58.6 percent. Similar to California, people of Hispanic ethnicity represent the
largest minority in the County (California Department of Finance 2011e).
Table 3-24 shows that in 2000, the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities in the City was 34.7
percent, and people of Hispanic ethnicity were 22.1 percent of the City’s population. By 2010,
the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities in the City had increased to 51.1 percent and people of
Hispanic ethnicity had increased to comprise 31.7 percent of the City’s population.
During that period, the percentage of white ethnicity in the City’s population decreased from
65.3 percent to 48.9 percent. People of Hispanic ethnicity represent the largest minority in the

City, but represent a smaller percentage of the City population than they do in the County or
throughout the state. Non-Hispanic minorities, however, comprise a substantially higher
percentage of the City’s population than they do in the County or the state (California
Department of Finance 2011e).
The Census Bureau uses a set of income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to
determine which families are living in poverty. If a family’s total income is less than its
threshold, then that family, and every individual in it, is considered to be living in poverty.
Poverty thresholds do not vary geographically, but they are updated annually for inflation using
the Consumer Price Index. For individuals who do not live with family members, their own
income is compared with the appropriate threshold. According to the Census Bureau, the 2010
poverty threshold is $11,344 for an individual under 65 years of age and $22,113 for a family of
four with two minor children (Census Bureau 2010b). Table 3-25 shows estimated median
household income and poverty levels for the County, the City, and the state. According to the
Census Bureau, the percentage of the populations of the County and City at income levels below
the poverty threshold was lower than the state average of 13.2 percent, with 8.6 and 12.5 percent,
respectively. The median household income for the County ($93,400) is higher than the state
($77,596), whereas the median household income for the City ($57,714) is lower than the state
(Census Bureau 2009; Fannie Mae 2011).

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences
4.1
4.1.1

Introduction
Overview of the Impact Analysis

The Contra Loma RMP is a programmatic, planning-level document that provides management
direction at a broad scale and is not intended to provide project-level detail of future
management actions or projects. For this reason, the EIS evaluates the environmental impacts of
each RMP alternative in a programmatic manner. Future actions carried out under the purview of
the RMP beyond the programmatic analysis presented in the EIS would be subject to projectlevel NEPA analysis and compliance.
The Environmental Consequences chapter evaluates the environmental impacts that would result
from implementing each of the alternatives. The chapter is organized in sections by resource
topic. Each resource section begins with a brief description of the resources addressed within the
section and the types of activities that could affect the resource, followed by a list of assumptions
upon which the analysis is based. The impacts of activities common to all of the alternatives are
then discussed, followed by a discussion of impacts unique to each alternative. Where
appropriate and if feasible, the EIS then describes mitigation measures that would avoid and/or
minimize impacts to the resource.
4.1.2

Cumulative Effects

Cumulative effects are discussed at the end of each resource. Cumulative effects are defined as
the direct and indirect effects of a proposed alternative’s incremental impacts when they are
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, regardless of who carries out the
action (40 CFR, Part 14 1508.7). Guidance for implementing NEPA requires that Federal
agencies specify the time frame and geographic boundaries within which they evaluate potential
cumulative effects of an action and the specific past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
that will be analyzed. Effects of past actions and activities on resources are manifested in the
current condition of the affected resources, as described in Chapter 3 (Affected Environment) for
resources on Reclamation-administered lands.
Public documents and data prepared by Federal, state, and local government agencies are the
primary information sources for past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions and for
identifying reasonable trends in resource conditions and land uses. Actions undertaken by private
persons and entities are assumed to be captured in the information made available by such
agencies. Actions included in the cumulative impact analysis do not affect all resources equally:
some resources would be affected by several or all of the described activities, while others would
be affected very little or not at all. The actions that make up the cumulative effect scenario were
analyzed in conjunction with the effects of each alternative to determine if they would have any
additive or interactive effects on a particular resource.

4-1 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

The cumulative impact analysis provided in this EIS is general because decisions about other
actions in the vicinity of Contra Loma would be made by various public and private entities, and
the location, timing, and magnitude of these actions are not well known at this time. The actions
and trends with the highest potential to cumulatively affect the resources discussed in this EIS
include:
•

Improvements at Contra Loma that may be implemented concurrent with preparation of
the RMP (i.e., improvements to sports fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades to
the restroom and fish cleaning station).

•

Reclamation’s issuance of a new license to the City to allow continued use of 5.7 acres of
land on the eastern side of Contra Loma for golf course use.

•

Buildout of the City, the County, and other nearby cities in accordance with their adopted
general plans. The City and County general plans are described below.

Antioch General Plan

The City’s General Plan EIR was prepared in 2003 and the City’s General Plan was adopted in
2003. The planning horizon for the General Plan is 25 years (i.e., 2003-2028). According to the
General Plan EIR:
•

The City has a relatively large amount of open land available for future development.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent
of the land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres)
were vacant in 2003.

•

General Plan build out would result in construction of about 52,000 new dwelling units.

•

Between 2010 and 2025, the City’s population is expected to increase by 15 percent, an
increase of 15,900 people.

•

General Plan build out would result in more daily vehicular trips within the Planning
Area, non-peak hour travel will increase in relation to peak hour traffic, and the “peak
hour” of traffic will lengthen over several hours. However, the transportation policies in
the General Plan would be very effective in maintaining acceptable levels of service on
the City’s roads and highways (City of Antioch 2003b).

Contra Costa County General Plan

The County’s General Plan was adopted in 2005. The planning horizon for the General Plan is
15 years (i.e., 2005-2020; Contra Costa County 2005). The General Plan Housing Element was
updated in 2009 (Contra Costa County 2009). According to the General Plan:
•

The County’s population is expected to grow by almost 19 percent from 2000 to 2020, an
increase of 179,984 people (Contra Costa County 2005).

•

Much of the future growth in the County is planned for the Pittsburg-Antioch-Oakley
areas of East Contra Costa County (Contra Costa County 2005).

4-2 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

In 2000, County residents generated approximately 2 million vehicle trips per day; by
2020, County residents will generate approximately 2.8 million trips per day (Contra
Costa County 2005).

According to the Housing Element Update:
•

The County’s population is projected to grow by almost 9 percent from 2010 to 2020, an
increase of 95,100 people. The population in the unincorporated areas of East Contra
Costa County is expected to grow by almost 20 percent from 2000 to 2020, an increase of
9,569 people (Contra Costa County 2009).

Other Cities in Northeastern Contra Costa County

In addition to Antioch, several other cities are located in the northeastern portion of the County.
These cities include Pittsburg, Brentwood, Oakley, Martinez, Clayton, Concord, and Walnut
Creek. Each of these cities has its own general plan, and the population of each city is expected
to continue growing in the future. The increased population growth within these cities would
increase the amount of land converted to urban uses and the number of vehicles travelling on
regional roadways. The growth estimates for population and traffic are included in the estimates
presented above for the County.
4.1.3

Issues Considered But Eliminated from Further Study

Indian Trust Assets

As a Federal land management agency, Reclamation is responsible for identifying and
considering potential impacts of its plans, projects, programs, or activities on Indian Trust Assets
(ITA). ITA are legal interests in property held in trust by the U.S. for Indian Tribes or
individuals. As the nearest ITA to the Action area is the Lytton Rancheria, located in San Pablo,
California, approximately 28 miles west of Contra Loma, none of the alternatives have the
potential to affect ITA.
Indian Sacred Sites

As a Federal land management agency, Reclamation is required to accommodate access to and
ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites on Federal lands by Indian religious practitioners and to
avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of such sacred sites. Sacred sites are defined in
Executive Order 13007 (May 24, 1996) as "any specific, discrete, narrowly delineated location
on Federal land that is identified by an Indian tribe, or Indian individual determined to be an
appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion, as sacred by virtue of its
established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion; provided that the
tribe or appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion has informed the agency
of the existence of such a site."
On June 23, 2010, Reclamation’s archaeological consultant requested a Sacred Lands File search
and list of appropriate Native American representatives and tribal organizations from the NAHC.
The NAHC responded on July 19, 2010 and indicated that no culturally significant sites or
properties were known to exist within or near the APE. In 2010 and 2013, Reclamation and its
consultant performed outreach to the Native American contacts listed with the NAHC. No
responses have been received. Because no Indian Sacred Sites appear to be located within Contra

4-3 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Loma and the alternatives would not limit access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by
Indian religious practitioners, or significantly adversely affect the physical integrity of such
sacred sites, no impacts to Indian sacred sites would occur.
Paleontological Resources

As a Federal land management agency, Reclamation is responsible for managing and protecting
paleontological resources on the Federal land under its management (PL 111-011). The geology
of the Contra Loma region consists of terrestrial and marine Eocene- to Pliocene- (Tertiary) aged
sandstone with lesser amounts of siltstone, conglomerate, and shale (Graymer et al. 1994). Of the
geologic formations underlying Contra Loma, Cierbo Sandstone is the only formation that is
known to contain abundant paleontological resources, or more specifically marine fossils. Cierbo
Sandstone runs beneath the southernmost portion of Contra Loma, forming the east-west
trending ridge that runs along the southern boundary of the Regional Park (Figure 3-15).
No known paleontological resources have been identified in Contra Loma (Bondurant, pers.
comm. 2013). Due to the relatively steep topography in this area, few new improvements would
be built atop the Cierbo Sandstone formation. Exceptions may include a new communications
tower (both action alternatives) and portions of a disc golf course (Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative). For these reasons, the likelihood of encountering paleontological
resources that provide new information about the history of life on earth is very low. The two
action alternatives would include Management Action 56, which is intended to manage and
protect any important paleontological resources encountered during construction activities in the
portion of the Regional Park underlain by Cierbo Sandstone. This measure would ensure that
impacts on paleontological resources are minor.

4.2
4.2.1

Land Use
Types of Impacts

Land uses at Contra Loma include recreation, grazing, operations and maintenance,
administration, and reservoir management. This section assesses the potential impacts of the
RMP alternatives on land use compatibility with existing uses within Contra Loma.
Potential impacts to land use could result from three general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Facility Improvements

4.2.2

Assumptions

The land use impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

4-4 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing public utilities.

•

No land use changes would occur that do not meet RMP goals.

4.2.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Human Use

Recreational use of Contra Loma would continue under all of the RMP alternatives. Currently,
only occasional minor conflicts arise between user groups. Such activities are likely to increase,
heightening the potential for conflicts between uses. Impacts on land use would be dependent on
the availability and suitability of a particular facility to accommodate the proposed use; the
density of recreational use; and potential impacts imposed on natural resources, the setting, and
other user groups. The managing partner(s) would be expected to continue to manage
recreational use of Contra Loma’s recreational facilities in a manner that minimizes land use
conflicts. Therefore, no additional land use effects would be expected from implementation of
the action alternatives when compared to the current low levels of conflict expected under the No
Action Alternative.
Under all of the RMP alternatives, the Regional Park would continue to be used by the public for
recreational activities. The existing Regional Park trail system would continue to be operated,
managed, and maintained for activities such as hiking, biking, wildlife viewing, and equestrian
uses. Although various user groups (i.e., hikers, bicyclists, equestrians) utilize many of the same
trails, trail users are often widely dispersed and the different user groups have not come into
serious conflict in the past. If conflicts were to occur, they would likely be infrequent, isolated
incidents of relatively minor nature. Increased use of the Regional Park trail system by differing
user groups would slightly increase the potential for conflict.
4.2.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.2.3.
Livestock Grazing
Livestock grazing performed for fire suppression now occurs on 454 acres of grasslands within the Regional Park,
and grazing would likely continue under the No Action Alternative. Under this alternative, no change in the acreage,
location, or intensity of grazing is expected to occur although grazing could decline depending on need. Grazing
would be implemented according to a grazing management plan that would be prepared specifically for Contra
Loma by the managing partner(s) and would require Reclamation approval. Although the potential exists for
recreational activities such as biking or hiking to conflict with grazing, these activities already occur alongside
grazing and any future conflicts are expected to be minor.

4.2.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in Section 4.2.3, this alternative would include more
enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, which could incrementally
increase visitor use. Currently, only occasional minor conflicts arise between user groups. An
incremental increase in visitor use would proportionally increase the potential for conflicts
4-5 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

among user groups, but would not preclude any class of recreational uses that are currently
allowed at Contra Loma. Under this alternative, increased visitor use would only have a minor
impact on land use.
Livestock Grazing

In addition to the impacts caused by livestock grazing under the No Action Alternative,
adjustment of the boundary lines between the Regional Park and Community Park under this
alternative could result in an overall increase of approximately 0.3 acre of grazing in Contra
Loma. Under this alternative, approximately 8.4 acres of land currently located within the
southwest corner of the Community Park could be placed within the Regional Park by future
local managing partner(s). This adjustment would result in introduction of grazing for fire
suppression on approximately 3 acres of land that previously had not been grazed with the
remainder being fenced off to protect riparian vegetation (Figure 2-1). In addition, the
adjustment of 2.7 acres of land in the northeast corner of Contra Loma from the Regional Park to
the Community Park would result in cessation of grazing within this area. This slight increase
would not substantially increase the intensity of grazing, nor would it substantially increase the
potential for recreational activities such as biking or hiking to conflict with grazing. These
activities already occur alongside grazing and future conflicts, if any, are expected to be minor.
Increased grazing under this alternative would only have a minor impact on current land uses.
Facility Improvements

This alternative may include new, expanded, or renovated facilities at the Regional Park to
enhance recreation and improve operations that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative. Examples include a new park residence, classroom facilities near the swim lagoon,
improvements to the park office and police substation, a new fueling station, a radio
communications tower, new restrooms, additional picnic sites, enhanced fishing and boating
facilities, expanded parking areas, a storm water retention basin, and a “safe swim” area or
splash pad at the swim lagoon. These facilities are expected to be designed and located in order
to promote compatibility with existing land uses. For example, the classroom and the “safe
swim” area or splash pad would be located near the swim lagoon and would be designed to
support and complement use of the swim lagoon. Improvements to the boat launch area would be
designed to enhance boating and fishing access and may include a new fishing pier separate from
the boat dock, thereby reducing conflicts between anglers and boaters using the existing launch
ramp. New fishing docks would reduce conflicts by dispersing anglers. New restrooms and
picnic sites would be located where they would best accommodate demand. In addition, the new
park residence, fueling station, and radio communications tower would be situated where they
would be most useful and functional. Future managing partner(s) would be expected to place all
new facilities where they would be compatible with nearby land uses, thereby minimizing the
intensity of any land use conflicts. Therefore, land use impacts from construction and operation
of the new, expanded, or renovated facilities are expected to be minor.
When specific facilities are designed and sited, a site-specific environmental analysis would be
conducted that would include a more focused assessment of the activity’s impact on land use. At
that time, more clearly defined land use impacts may be identified. If substantial land use
impacts were to be identified, the proposed project would be modified, if possible, to reduce
these impacts.

4-6 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

4.2.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in the previous Section 4.2.5 and those expected for the No
Action Alternative, this alternative may include overnight camping as part of the Regional Park’s
current day camp programs and other special events. Existing day use facilities may be modified
to accommodate group campers; however, no new camping facilities would be built. Because
overnight camping would not coincide with daytime recreational activities, potential conflicts
with existing land uses in the park are not anticipated. Under this alternative, increased visitor
use would only have a minor impact on land use.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative may include the expansion of the Community Park into approximately 15 acres
of the Regional Park (see Figure 2-2). Should this occur, the boundaries between the parks would
be adjusted by the local managing partner(s) and current grazing of this area would cease. In
conjunction with the potential boundary change between the parks described in Section 4.2.5
(see Figure 2-1), this expansion would result in a net reduction of grazing in Contra Loma by
14.7 acres. Compared to the No Action Alternative, this would reduce grazing within Contra
Loma by about 3 percent, which is not expected to cause grazing to be uneconomical at Contra
Loma.
Grazing could present conflicts with a new disc golf course that might be built at the Regional
Park under this alternative because some areas within the course may require clearing of grass
and herbaceous vegetation within currently grazed areas to improve visibility for disc golfers.
This could reduce the amount of vegetation available for consumption by livestock. Also,
livestock waste could present a nuisance to players. After implementation of BMPs including
optimized disc golf course siting, construction of a disc golf course would lead to only
occasional conflicts between land uses, including grazing. Therefore, this adverse effect would
be minor. This effect would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded recreational facilities in addition
to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. Expanded
recreational facilities proposed for the Regional Park under this alternative may include
expansion of the swim lagoon, a new angler’s shelter, a playground structure, a disc golf course,
new trails, and a fitness course. These facility improvements and their effects on land use would
not occur under the No Action Alternative. The managing partner(s) would be expected to design
and locate these facilities where they would be compatible with nearby land uses.
The swim lagoon is one of the principal attractions at the Regional Park. A swim lagoon
expansion project would be designed to support and complement existing use of the swim
lagoon, and would therefore be compatible with the lagoon and nearby recreational facilities. An
angler’s shelter and a playground structure may be built along the south or east shore of the
reservoir in locations that would accommodate demand. These facilities would also be
compatible with nearby recreational uses. Swim lagoon improvements would have no effect on
land use because the adjacent recreational uses are compatible with these improvements.

4-7 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Designing and locating these facility improvements where they would be compatible with nearby
land uses would minimize the intensity of any land use conflicts.
This alternative may include construction of new trails that would be open to bicycles and/or
may allow bicycles on portions of trails that are not currently open to bicycles. Expansion of the
bicycle-accessible trail system could conflict with livestock grazing or with other trail users such
as hikers or equestrians. Expansion of the bicycle-accessible trail system would follow BMPs
such as installation of additional signage and optimizing of trail alignment to improve visibility.
This alternative may include establishment of a new fitness course by installing outdoor exercise
stations with stationary equipment and signage along the shoreline trail loop. Use of the
shoreline trail loop would likely increase with establishment of the fitness course; however, the
use of exercise equipment located near the trail would be consistent with existing trail use and is
not expected to create conflicts with other trail users. Conflicts among trail user groups and
between trail and grazing uses are currently minor and relatively infrequent. The managing
partner(s) would be expected to continue to manage recreational use of Contra Loma’s
recreational facilities in a manner that minimizes land use conflicts. Therefore, no additional land
use effects would be expected from these activities.
This alternative may include a new disc golf course at the Regional Park that would be built in a
suitable location so as to minimize conflicts with other park uses; however, such conflicts might
not be completely avoided. If the course is not properly designed and located, errant golf discs
(similar to Frisbees) could interfere with the enjoyment of other park users. Therefore, a disc golf
course would be best suited to areas of the Regional Park that receive less visitation and use. As
discussed previously, grazing could also present conflicts with a disc golf course because some
areas within the course may require clearing of grass and herbaceous vegetation to improve
visibility and because livestock waste could present a nuisance to players. After implementation
of BMPs including optimized disc golf course siting, construction of a disc golf course would
lead to only occasional conflicts between land uses. Therefore, this adverse effect would be
minor.
This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park
south of the two existing sports fields, and increased parking capacity if needed to serve the new
sports fields. This management action would require expansion of the Community Park
boundaries south into the Regional Park and an adjustment of the boundary between the two
parks (see Figure 2-1). The proposed area for the new sports fields is currently undeveloped but
is grazed by livestock. Livestock would be excluded from the expanded Community Park area;
therefore, no land use conflict between grazing and recreation would result from this alternative
because grazing would be excluded from the sport fields’ area. The effect of constructing the
new sports fields would neither increase nor decrease the land use conflicts at Contra Loma.
When specific facilities are designed and sited, a site-specific environmental analysis would be
conducted that would include a more focused assessment of the activity’s impact on land use. At
that time, more clearly defined land use impacts may be identified. If substantial land use
impacts were to be identified, the proposed project would be modified, if possible, to reduce
these impacts. Therefore any land use impacts related to installation of new facilities would be
minimized and would only result in minor adverse effects.

4.2.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation and Concurrent Improvements

Regional Park visitation increased by 20 percent (24,248 visitors) during the six-year period
from 2005 through 2010. Visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives. More visitation is expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative, because the action alternatives would include enhanced or expanded facilities
that would attract more visitors than the No Action Alternative.
A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be attributable to the projected
population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion of the County from
buildout of the City and County general plans. The City’s population is expected to increase by
15 percent (15,900 people) between 2010 and 2025 (City of Antioch 2003b). The County’s
population is expected to increase by 9 percent (95,100 people) between 2010 and 2020 and the
population in the unincorporated areas of East Contra Costa County is expected to grow by
almost 20 percent from 2000 to 2020, an increase of 9,569 people (Contra Costa County 2009).
The improvements to sports fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades would increase
visitation to Contra Loma. However, neither these improvements nor issuance of a license to the
City for continued use of the 5.7 acres of land east of the Regional Park for golf course use
would involve land use changes.
Human Use

The presence of additional visitors to the park would increase the potential for conflicts between
various activities. Given the ability of the current managing partner(s) to manage recreational use
of Contra Loma’s recreational facilities in a manner that minimizes land use conflicts, the
intensity of the projected cumulative increase in visitation is expected to cause minor adverse
cumulative impacts on land use. Because more visitation is expected under the two action
alternatives than the No Action Alternative, the intensity of this effect is expected to be greater
under the action alternatives than the No Action Alternative.
Livestock Grazing

Although the potential exists for recreational activities such as biking or hiking to conflict with
grazing, these activities already occur alongside grazing and any future conflicts caused by the
cumulative increase in visitation are expected to be minor. The intensity of this effect would be
greater under the two action alternatives than the No Action Alternative because visitation would
be higher under the action alternatives.
Facility Improvements

No land use changes would result from the improvements to sports fields 4 and 5, the boat
launch area upgrades, or issuance of a license to the City for continued use of the 5.7 acres of
land east of the Regional Park for golf course use. These actions represent a continuation of
existing uses, although some of these actions would include facility upgrades. Because these
actions do not involve land use changes, there would be no change in their compatibility with
existing land uses (i.e., the land uses under the No Action Alternative). They would also not
change the intensity of the minor adverse land use effects attributable to construction of new
facilities under the two action alternatives.

Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.3.1

Recreation
Type of Impacts

The effects of the RMP alternatives on recreation at Contra Loma would vary depending on the
type and location of the recreational activity. Because recreation is a complex and integral part of
the RMP, some impacts on recreation are assessed according to the effect that RMP alternative
management actions may have on four general categories of recreation found at Contra Loma:
General Recreation (administration, management), Land-Based Recreation, Water-Based
Recreation (swimming, fishing, and boating), and Interpretive Services (public education,
programs, public perception).
As described in sections 2.2.4 and 3.2.1, two distinct management zones based on the WROS
system have been identified for Contra Loma Reservoir. The southern half of the reservoir is
managed as WROS Class S4 while the northern half is managed as WROS Class RD6 (see
Figure 1-2). The attributes that differentiate these WROS management zones have a direct effect
on the type of recreational opportunities and the visitor’s recreational experience. The S and RD
zones under the WROS system are similar, though not identical, to the S and RD zones under the
WALROS system. The 2008 WROS inventory did not identify classifications for the land
portions of Contra Loma. Because Contra Loma has not been re-inventoried under the WALROS
system, each RMP alternative is analyzed below for consistency with the reservoir’s existing
WROS classifications.
The RMP does not address dam and reservoir operations, other than to describe activities
included in the Expanded Recreation Facilities Alternative to manage the reservoir in a manner
that supports and improves recreational fishing and habitat enhancement/restoration along the
shoreline. Responsibilities for dam and reservoir operations are subject to a separate contract
agreement between Reclamation and CCWD and are therefore outside the scope of the Contra
Loma RMP.
Potential impacts to recreation could result from five general types of activities:
•

Facility Management

•

Facility Maintenance

•

Resource Management

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Facility Improvements

4.3.2

Assumptions

The recreation impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:

4-10 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

Visitation to Contra Loma and use of the Regional Park and Community Park recreation
facilities would continue to increase.

•

None of the RMP alternatives include adjustments to the WROS classification zones.
Therefore, management actions included in the RMP alternatives are intended to be
consistent with the existing WROS classifications.

•

No land use changes would occur that do not meet RMP goals.

4.3.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Facility Management

General Recreation Included in all of the RMP alternatives are actions that would support a
diverse range of recreational opportunities within the Regional Park and the Community Park.
Management actions include regulation of park uses, opening and closing of park gates for daily
operations, concessionaire administration, issuance of special use permits, and implementation of
a reservation system for use of the Community Park’s sports fields. These management actions
would be similar to the management activities currently being implemented by the managing
partners (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3) and, therefore, would have no impact on recreation.

The managing partner(s) or other organizations may continue to provide public recreation
programs at the Regional Park, such as low-income youth swim programs, Girl Scout and Boy
Scout events, fundraiser events, and environmental and outdoor educational programs. These
management actions would be similar to the management actions currently being implemented
by the managing partners (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). In addition, management regulations
pertaining to recreation programs would continue to minimize user conflicts. Currently, a small
potential currently exists for conflicts between group recreational activities and the recreational
experience of other park visitors. Continuation of these management actions would not increase
the potential for such conflicts. Therefore, these management actions would have no impact on
recreation.
Under the RMP alternatives, user fees would continue to be collected at the Regional Park.
Parking, day use, and special event fees contribute to the ability of the managing partner(s) to
provide safe and desirable recreation opportunities. The collection of fees also provides a means
to account for the number of users and monitor recreational preferences at the Regional Park.
Fees can also deter some would-be park visitors who cannot afford fees or do not wish to pay
fees. It is assumed however, that those visitors choosing to pay a fee to participate in a particular
recreational activity do so because they find equitable value in the quality of the recreational
experience available at the park. By serving as a limiting factor to visitation, fee payment may
reduce the number of user conflicts and increase the level of satisfaction enjoyed by those
choosing to pay fees; however, those who cannot afford the fees could be prevented from
participating in recreational activities available at the Regional Park. Fees are charged at the
Community Park for group activities where reservation of a specific part of the park may be

4-11 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

desired (e.g., picnic sites, sports fields). Otherwise, use of the Community Park by individuals is
not subject to day use fees. Fee collection would be a continuation of an existing management
activity (see Section 3.3) and, therefore, would have no impact on recreation.
Land-based Recreation Under all of the RMP alternatives, a diverse range of land-based
recreational opportunities would continue to attract large numbers of users to the Regional Park
and the Community Park. It is anticipated that the upward growth trend in the region would
result in the increased use and demand for land-based recreational opportunities at Contra Loma.
Under all RMP alternatives, the Regional Park trail system would continue to be operated,
managed, and maintained for dispersed recreational activities such as hiking, biking, and
equestrian uses, while the areas of concentrated recreation such as the day use areas adjacent to
the WROS S4 zone on the reservoir’s south side and the Community Park sports fields would
continue to be operated, managed, and maintained at levels that would provide visitors with a
positive recreation experience. Similarly, wildlife viewing, artistic pursuits (e.g., painting,
photography), and other passive forms of recreation would not be affected because there would
be no significant changes to existing management activities. Therefore, continued recreation
management and administration would have an inconsequential impact on land-based recreation.
Picnicking, team sports play, and other activities supported by developed recreation facilities at
the Regional Park and the Community Park would continue under all of the RMP alternatives.
Continuation of these activities would have no impact on other forms of land-based recreation.
Water-based Recreation Water-based recreation opportunities including swimming in the
lagoon, boating, and fishing—both on the water and from the shoreline of the reservoir—would
continue to be allowed under all of the RMP alternatives. Consistent with existing conditions,
use of the reservoir for recreational activities would be carefully managed by the managing
partner(s) to protect water quality (see Section 3.3). The WROS classifications for the reservoir
would continue to guide management actions related to recreation in and around the reservoir.
The types of water-based recreation allowed at the reservoir would remain the same under all
alternatives. Prohibition of gasoline-powered engines and swimming within the reservoir would
continue. These prohibitions would continue to be enforced to protect water quality and to
minimize the potential for conflicts between visitors using the reservoir for fishing, kayaking, or
windsurfing and those who visit to Contra Loma to swim. Therefore, continuation of these
activities would have no effect on water quality or conflicts between water-based recreationists.
Under all RMP alternatives, recreational fishing would continue to be allowed at the reservoir.
Fish populations would be managed to maximize angler success and recreational experience.
Fish planting, fish monitoring, angler permit sales, and public education would be some of the
management activities used to maintain the reservoir’s fish populations and satisfy user demand.
The managing partner(s) for the Regional Park would also continue to enforce regulations
against unauthorized fishing (i.e., poaching). Continued recreation management would have no
impact on water-based recreation.
The managing partner(s) for the Regional Park would continue to implement measures to prevent
mussel infestation and/or the introduction of other invasive aquatic pest species in the reservoir.
Public education, pre-launch boat inspections by trained staff, and prohibitions against wet boats
or gear entering the reservoir would be continued under all of the RMP alternatives (see Section

4-12 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

3.3). While such actions by the managing partner(s) may require an added level of intensive
management (i.e., personnel to enforce measures) to respond to visitation increases, the intensity
of these actions would be consistent with present conditions and, thus would have no impact on
water-based recreation.
Interpretive Services Under the RMP alternatives, the managing partner(s) would continue to
provide opportunities for public education and interpretation of natural and cultural resources.
Interpretive opportunities are valuable tools for increasing visitor appreciation of Contra Loma’s
resources. Continued provision of interpretive opportunities would be consistent with existing
conditions (see Section 3.3) and, thus would have no impact on recreation.
Facility Maintenance

Under all of the RMP alternatives, provision and maintenance of public facilities and
infrastructure would continue to be performed by the managing partner(s) at a level suitable to
ensure that visitors have a safe and positive recreation experience and to encourage continued
use of Contra Loma. Regular maintenance benefits users by preserving the quality of park
facilities, although maintenance activities can temporarily restrict or impair public use and access
to certain recreational facilities.
Visitor recreational use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP
alternatives, consistent with the visitation trend over the past few years. Increased visitation
would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities which could
incrementally increase the frequency of temporary restriction or impairment of public use and
recreation access. However, this change would be negligible, resulting in a minor impact on
recreation. In addition, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors
through signage or other means about areas closed for construction. Facility maintenance would
have no impact on the WROS reservoir classifications, because it would not change land uses.
Resource Management

Under the RMP alternatives, the managing partner(s) would continue to operate Contra Loma in
a manner that is consistent with Federal and state laws and regulations that govern the protection
of natural and cultural resources within Contra Loma. The local managing partner(s) for the
Regional Park may also develop programs to protect special-status species likely to occur at the
park. The public could be restricted from certain areas of Contra Loma if necessary to avoid
sensitive natural or cultural resources. Such restrictions could impair recreational activities
within those areas. However, most recreational activity occurs within Contra Loma’s developed
recreation areas, which have little potential to support special-status species or for cultural
resources to be present. Therefore, such restrictions would not substantially impair recreational
activities within Contra Loma. Resource management activities would have a minor impact on
recreation.
Livestock Grazing

Livestock grazing would likely continue in the Regional Park under all of the RMP alternatives.
Grazing would be implemented according to a grazing management plan that would be prepared
specifically for Contra Loma by the managing partner(s) and approved by Reclamation.
Although the potential exists for recreational activities such as biking or hiking to conflict with

grazing, these activities already occur alongside grazing and any future conflicts are expected to
be minor.

4.3.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Facility Management

The impacts would be the same as those for the No Action Alternative and as discussed in
Section 4.3.3.
Facility Maintenance

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and as addressed in Section
4.3.3, this alternative would include new facilities to enhance recreational opportunities. These
facilities would not be built under the No Action Alternative. The new facilities would increase
the need for routine maintenance activities which could increase the frequency of temporary
restriction or impairment of public use and recreation access. Also, because this alternative
would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, it could
result in more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance. Therefore, this alternative
could result in more frequent occurrences of temporary restriction or impairment of public use
and recreation access than the No Action Alternative. However, this change would be negligible,
resulting in a minor adverse effect on recreation. Also, the local managing partner(s) would
implement BMPs to notify visitors about areas closed for maintenance further reducing the
effect.
Resource Management

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and as addressed in Section
4.3.3, this alternative may increase habitat restoration and improvement through construction of
additional quail habitat enhancement projects and installation of additional bat houses and avian
nest boxes. Recreation could be affected if these actions require recreation restrictions in areas
where these actions would occur in order to prevent adverse impacts on habitat restoration and
improvement activities. However, the areas needed for these restoration projects would be
relatively small within the context of Contra Loma, and they would generally be located in areas
that do not receive heavy recreational use. Therefore, restrictions caused by habitat restoration
and improvement activities would have a minor adverse effect on recreation.

4-14 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Livestock Grazing

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and as addressed in Section
4.3.3, this alternative may include new water infrastructure (e.g., pumps, water lines, troughs) to
support grazing. Installation of the new infrastructure could temporarily inhibit recreation in
certain locations during construction. Because such restrictions would be of short duration and
would be located in discrete areas, and because the managing partner(s) would be expected to
carry out the improvements in a manner that minimizes conflicts with recreation, the intensity of
the effect on recreation from grazing facility improvements would be minor. These
improvements would not substantially affect recreation.
Under this alternative, livestock would be grazed within a portion of the 8.4 acres of land
currently within the Community Park that may be managed as part of the Regional Park. This
would not occur under the No Action Alternative. Because no trails or recreational facilities are
located within the potential new grazing area, it likely receives little use. Therefore, no conflicts
between grazing and recreation are expected to occur under this alternative.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include several new facility improvements in various locations throughout
Contra Loma that would not occur under the No Action Alternative. Long-term changes in
visitor use patterns could occur as new facilities become identified by visitors as more preferable
and draw visitors away from the older facilities.
General Recreation Under this alternative, improvements would be made to existing
administrative buildings and recreational facilities. These improvements would enhance
Regional Park operations, public services, and public safety. This alternative requires the
managing partner(s) to design future improvements to comply with ADA accessibility
requirements. This alternative would also include an ADA facility retrofit program that involves
replacing, retrofitting, and restructuring many of the park facilities to meet current ADA
standards. During construction, recreationists may be temporarily excluded from some areas;
however, the short duration of any such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its effect on
recreation resulting in a minor, short-term impact. Enhancement and expansion of existing
facilities and accessibility improvements, however, would have a long-term beneficial impact on
recreation that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Land-based Recreation Under this alternative the East Shore Trail, the West Shore Trail, and
the trail across the dam would be improved by paving the surfaces along the entire reservoir
shoreline loop. Improvements to the trail surfaces that compose the shoreline loop would not
result in any changes in WROS classifications or adversely affect land-based recreational
opportunities adjacent to the reservoir. Trail improvements along the reservoir shoreline would
have a long-term beneficial impact on recreation by making more trails accessible to a variety of
visitors, including the disabled and elderly. During construction, recreationists may be
temporarily excluded from some areas; however, the short duration of any such exclusion would
minimize the intensity of its effect on recreation resulting in a minor, short-term impact. Also,
the local managing partner(s) would notify the public about temporary closures. These impacts
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.

4-15 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

This alternative includes the potential to construct additional individual and group picnic sites in
the vicinity of the Regional Park’s south or east shore recreational clusters. The exact location of
the new picnic sites would be chosen based on usefulness and public demand. The new picnic
sites would be located within an existing recreational cluster where some supporting
infrastructure is already in place, especially along the south shore. Because these improvements
would be consistent with the experience descriptions for the WROS S and RD zones, they would
not affect the reservoir’s WROS classifications. These improvements would have a long-term
beneficial impact on recreation by increasing the availability of picnic facilities. During
construction, recreationists may be temporarily excluded from some areas; however, the short
duration of any such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its effect on recreation resulting
in a minor, short-term impact. Also, the local managing partner(s) would notify the public about
temporary closures. These impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Water-based Recreation This alternative may include renovations to the buildings near the
swim lagoon within the WROS S4 zone. A “safe swim” or splash pad specifically for small
children may also be constructed at the swim lagoon. Because these improvements would be
consistent with the experience description for the WROS S zone, they would not affect the
reservoir’s WROS classifications. These improvements would have a long-term beneficial
impact on recreation by enhancing recreational opportunities at or near the swim lagoon. During
construction, recreationists may be temporarily excluded from some areas; however, the short
duration of any such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its effect on recreation resulting
in a minor, short-term impact. Also, the local managing partner(s) would notify the public about
temporary closures. These impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.3.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Facility Management

The impacts would be the same as those for the No Action Alternative and as discussed in
Section 4.3.3.
Facility Maintenance

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and as addressed in Section
4.3.3, this alternative would include more recreation and infrastructure facilities than the other
two alternatives, which could require more maintenance than the other alternatives. Also,
because this alternative would include more expanded recreation opportunities than the other two
alternatives, it could result in more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance than
the other alternatives. Therefore, this alternative could result in more frequent occurrences of
temporary restriction or impairment of public use and recreation access. However, this change
would be negligible, resulting in a minor adverse effect on recreation. Also, the local managing
partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about areas closed for maintenance further
reducing the effect.
Resource Management

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.3.5.

4-16 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Livestock Grazing

In addition to the impacts caused by livestock grazing addressed in Section 4.3.5, grazing could
present conflicts with use of the disc golf course that might be built under this alternative
because livestock waste could present a nuisance to players. After implementation of BMPs
including optimized disc golf course siting, grazing would lead to only occasional conflicts with
disc golfers. Therefore, this adverse effect would be minor. This impact would not occur under
the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may include the expansion of the Community Park into approximately 15 acres
of the Regional Park. Should this occur, the boundaries between the parks would be adjusted by
the local managing partner(s) and current grazing of this area would cease, thereby avoiding any
conflict between livestock and users of the new sports fields. Grazing would have no effect on
use of the new sports fields.
Facility Improvements

General Recreation The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.3.5.
Land-based Recreation This alternative would include the impacts addressed in Section 4.3.5,
but would also include impacts from facility improvements that would not occur under the other
two alternatives.
The swim lagoon is one of the principal attractions at the Regional Park’s south shore recreation
cluster and may be expanded to accommodate increased future demand. Its expansion would not
likely result in permanent conflicts with adjacent recreational land uses, such as picnic sites or
the shoreline trail system, because these facilities would be considered during project design and
because they could be relocated if necessary to accommodate the swim lagoon expansion.
During construction, however, some areas near the swim lagoon may be temporarily unavailable
for use. However, the short duration of any such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its
effect on recreation resulting in a minor, short-term impact. Also, the local managing partner(s)
would notify the public about temporary closures.
This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields in the Community Park south
of sports fields 4 and 5 and increased parking capacity, if needed. This management action
would require expansion of the Community Park boundary southward into the Regional Park and
a resulting adjustment of the boundary between the two parks (see Figure 2-1). The area where
the new sports fields would be located is currently undeveloped and receives little recreational
use, except for a Regional Park trail that follows the existing Community Park boundary.
Because this area currently receives little recreational use, and because the existing trail could be
rerouted or incorporated into the design of the new sports fields, the addition of two new sports
fields would not adversely affect existing recreational uses and would have a long-term
beneficial impact on land-based recreation. This area would be unavailable for use during
construction, but any adverse effect would be minor considering the temporary nature of the
closure and that the area currently receives little use. Also, the local managing partner(s) would
implement BMPs to notify visitors about areas closed for construction further reducing the
effect.

4-17 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

This alternative may include construction of new trails that would be open to bicycles and/or
allow bicycles on portions of trails that are not currently open to bicycles. Expansion of the
bicycle-accessible trail system could conflict with other trail users such as hikers or equestrians.
However, trail users are often widely dispersed and the different user groups have not come into
serious conflict in the past. If conflicts were to occur, they would likely be infrequent, isolated
incidents of relatively minor nature. Increased use of the Regional Park trail system by differing
user groups would slightly increase the potential for conflict, but would not substantially affect
recreation within the Regional Park adversely. Rather, the overall effect of making more trails
available to recreationists would be a beneficial impact. Expansion of the trail system to include
new trails and to improve interconnection between trail systems would also be beneficial for
recreation and is not likely to conflict with any other user groups. This alternative may also
include establishment of a new fitness course by installing outdoor exercise stations with
stationary equipment and signage along the shoreline trail loop. This would be beneficial for
recreation and, as discussed in Section 4.2.6 above, is not likely to conflict with any other user
groups. During construction, recreationists may be temporarily excluded from some areas;
however, the short duration of any such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its effect on
recreation resulting in a minor, short-term impact. Also, the local managing partner(s) would
implement BMPs to notify visitors about areas closed for construction further reducing the
effect.
This alternative includes a proposal to build a disc golf course in the Regional Park. Potential
locations being considered include undeveloped areas east of the reservoir and in the southeast
part of the Regional Park located within the natural environment unit of the Regional Park.
Although segments of the Contra Loma trail system pass through or near the areas being
considered in the southeast part of the Regional Park, disc golf requires very little infrastructure.
As such, development of a disc golf course is unlikely to conflict with other low-impact
recreational user groups. Overall, the addition of a disc golf course would have a long-term
beneficial impact on land-based recreation due to increased recreational opportunities within
Contra Loma. During construction, recreationists may be temporarily excluded from some areas;
however, the short duration of any such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its effect on
recreation resulting in a minor, short-term impact. Also, the local managing partner(s) would
implement BMPs to notify visitors about areas closed for construction further reducing the
effect.
This alternative may also include periodic overnight camping as part of the Regional Park’s
current day camp programs and other special events. Conflicts with other recreational uses are
not anticipated because overnight camping would not coincide with other recreational activities.
Overnight group camping would create additional recreational opportunities, resulting in a
beneficial impact on land-based recreation. No new camping facilities would be built, but some
existing day use facilities may be modified to accommodate group campers. During construction,
recreationists may be temporarily excluded from some areas; however, the short duration of any
such exclusion would minimize the intensity of its effect on recreation resulting in a minor,
short-term impact. Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors
about areas closed for construction further reducing the effect.

4-18 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Other facilities and improvements that may occur under this alternative such as a playground
structure in the developed recreational areas along the south side of the reservoir and shade trees
to support recreational uses would also have a beneficial impact on land-based recreation.
Water-based Recreation This alternative would include the short-term minor adverse impacts
due to construction activities and the long-term beneficial impacts on water-based recreation that
were identified for the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative in Section 4.3.5. This
alternative would also include facility improvements that would not occur under the Enhanced
Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Expansion of the swim lagoon to accommodate the anticipated increase in future demand would
benefit water-based recreation by improving the quality of the visitor’s recreational experience at
the Regional Park. This would be a beneficial impact that would be consistent with the
experience description for the WROS S zone.
Fishing improvements would include fish habitat and population enhancements, and
improvements to the recreational facilities used by anglers. Such management actions would
benefit recreational fishing activities. Construction of a fisherman’s shelter on the reservoir’s
south or east shore would enhance recreational fishing and improve the visitor experience. The
shelter would be consistent with the experience descriptions for the WROS S and RD zones.
There would be no conflicts with other recreational uses as a result of these actions and these
actions would result in a beneficial impact to recreation.
Interpretation This alternative may include increased use of interpretive signage and programs
to educate the public and improve its interpretation of Contra Loma’s history and natural
resources. This alternative may also include a botanical garden in the Community Park.
Increased interpretive opportunities would have a beneficial impact on recreation. During
construction, however, some areas may be temporarily unavailable for use resulting in a
temporary and minor impact.
4.3.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation and Concurrent Improvements

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans.
The improvements to sports fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades would increase
visitation to Contra Loma. These improvements and issuance of a license to the City for
continued use of the 5.7 acres of land east of the Regional Park for golf course use would affect
recreation.
Facility Management

None of the RMP alternatives would change the manner in which the managing partner(s)
manage Contra Loma for recreation. Nor would such changes be caused by increased visitation

4-19 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

or the concurrent improvements. Therefore, no cumulative impact to facility management would
occur under any of the alternatives.
Facility Maintenance

Under all of the alternatives, provision and maintenance of public facilities and infrastructure
would be performed by local managing partner(s). As discussed previously, visitation to Contra
Loma would increase under all of the alternatives, with more visitation expected under the two
action alternatives than the No Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future
visitor increase would be attributable to buildout of the City and County general plans. The
improvements to sports fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades would also increase
visitation to Contra Loma.
This increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance
activities which could incrementally increase the frequency of temporary restriction or
impairment of public use and recreation access. Also, the new or improved recreational facilities
that would be built under the two action alternatives would increase the need for routine
maintenance activities which could increase the frequency of temporary restriction or
impairment of public use and recreation access. Because the two action alternatives would
include more recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, they could result in more
visitor use, require incrementally more maintenance, and increase the frequency of temporary
restriction or impairment of public use and recreation access. Under all of the alternatives,
however, this increase would be negligible resulting in a minor cumulative adverse effect on
recreation. Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about
areas closed for construction further reducing the effect.
Resource Management

The public could be restricted from certain areas of Contra Loma if necessary to avoid sensitive
natural or cultural resources. The habitat restoration and improvement projects that could occur
under the two action alternatives could increase the number of locations restricted to visitors.
Such restrictions could impair recreational activities within those areas and increased visitation
could increase the number of visitors affected by such restrictions. However, most recreational
activity occurs within Contra Loma’s developed recreation areas, which have little potential to
support special-status species or for cultural resources to be present. Therefore, such restrictions
would not substantially impair recreational activities within Contra Loma. Resource management
activities would have a minor cumulative impact on recreation.
Livestock Grazing

Under all of the alternatives, the potential exists for recreational activities such as biking or
hiking to conflict with grazing. Increased visitation to Contra Loma would increase the potential
for conflicts between recreation and grazing. The potential for such conflicts would be greater
under the two action alternatives than the No Action Alternative, because visitation would be
greater. However, recreation activities already occur alongside grazing and any future conflicts
are expected to have a minor cumulative impact on recreation.
Facility Improvements

The new or improved recreational facilities that would be built under the two action alternatives
would have long-term beneficial impacts on recreation that would not occur under the No Action

4-20 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Alternative. The improvements to sports fields 4 and 5, the boat launch upgrades, and the
renewed lease between Reclamation and the City of the 5.7-acre parcel located outside of Contra
Loma for the existing golf course would have a beneficial cumulative impact on recreation in the
general area.

4.4.1

Visitor Access and Circulation
Type of Impacts

This section assesses the potential impacts of the RMP alternatives on visitor access and
circulation. Because the RMP neither includes nor defines specific projects, the analysis in this
section is qualitative.
Potential impacts on visitor access and circulation could result from four general types of
activities:
•

Increased Human Use

•

Assumptions

The visitor access and circulation impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing visitor access and circulation.

•

The demand for facility management at Contra Loma would continue to increase
regardless of the selected alternative, and would require an increased level of
management to satisfy this demand.

•

The managing partner(s) would continue to provide the standard of care necessary to
ensure the health and safety of visitors to Contra Loma, as well as protect the natural
environment and cultural resources.

•

No land use changes would occur that do not meet RMP goals.

4.4.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Increased Human Use

Visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP alternatives, consistent
with the visitation trend over the past few years. Increased visitation would result in greater
demand for parking within the Regional Park and Community Park, and would increase the
number of vehicles using park roads and parking areas for internal circulation and public roads to
access Contra Loma. Currently, the internal roads and parking areas accommodate increased
visitation on most days, although occasional gate closures to vehicles are necessary when road
and parking capacity is reached. Increased visitation could cause vehicle gate closures to occur
more frequently or earlier in the day than current conditions. However, the increased frequency
of gate closures is expected to be relatively minor. Increased visitation would cause a minor
impact on visitor access and circulation within Contra Loma.
Facility Maintenance and Operation

All of the RMP alternatives have been designed to avoid potential land use conflicts to the extent
possible. Public motorized vehicles would be confined to existing roads and parking areas within
both the Regional Park and the Community Park. Trail system use by private motorized vehicles
would continue to be prohibited throughout Contra Loma. The opening and closing of park gates
for daily visitor access would be the responsibility of the managing partner(s). The managing
partner(s) would continue to maintain and operate publicly accessible roads and parking areas
within Contra Loma. If road closure is required during maintenance activities, the closure would
be short term and the effect on visitor access and circulation would be minor. Also, the local
managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about such closures further
reducing the effect.
Trail system maintenance and operation in the Regional Park would continue under all of the
RMP alternatives. Hiking, equestrian, and bicycle trail system users could encounter trail
sections receiving periodic maintenance activities, such as gravel and rock placement on fire
trails to maintain all-weather access for emergency vehicles. The impact on recreational trail
access and circulation during maintenance would be temporary and of short duration. If trail
closure is required during maintenance activities, the closure would be short term and the effect
on visitor access and circulation would be minor. Also, the local managing partner(s) would
implement BMPs to notify visitors about such closures further reducing the effect.
Natural and Cultural Resource Management and Protection

All of the alternatives include management actions for protecting and managing natural and
cultural resources. Under the RMP alternatives, the local managing partner(s) for the Regional
Park would continue to perform periodic biological surveys to inventory and assess special-status
plant and wildlife species within the Regional Park. Federal and state regulations and laws
governing the protection of special-status plant and animal species may require modification or
closure of trails or roads if public access is determined to have an adverse impact on such
species. Avoiding or minimizing disturbance of special-status plant communities or specialstatus wildlife species (individuals or populations) could affect current and proposed visitor
access and circulation due to road or trail closures, or could influence future road and trail
planning. Cultural resources within Contra Loma would be afforded similar protections.

4-22 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Known populations of special-status plant or animal species, or cultural resource sites are
currently protected by the managing partner(s) as directed by Federal or state regulations. Public
access and circulation in the vicinity of currently known biologically or culturally sensitive areas
would continue to be managed similar to existing conditions (see Section 3.3) and, thus would
incur no new impacts. All future planning improvements in the Regional Park would be
consistent with laws and regulations that govern the protection of natural and cultural resources.
Therefore, conflicts between a visitor access and circulation planning action and a sensitive
resource can be proactively addressed early in the planning process to reduce or avoid conflicts
to the extent possible. Natural and cultural resource management and protection could result in a
minor impact on visitor access and circulation.
4.4.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Increased Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in Section 4.4.3, increased visitation would increase the
number of vehicles using public roads to access Contra Loma. This increased traffic would be
most noticeable on high-volume days and in the immediate vicinity of Contra Loma. Visitation
to the Regional Park is generally highest on weekends and holidays from Memorial Day
weekend through Labor Day. The local roads providing access to the park (i.e., James Donlon
Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, Contra Loma Boulevard) are classified as major collector roads and
primary arterials (i.e., high capacity urban roads) in the local road system. Peak traffic on these
roads generally occurs on weekday mornings and afternoons which correspond with peak
commuting periods. Increased visitation to the Regional Park would mostly occur on the
weekends; therefore, its effect on peak hour traffic would be minimal.
The most popular activities at the Community Park involve use of the sports fields; therefore,
increased visitation to the Community Park would mostly occur on weekday evenings from 4:00
to 10:00 p.m. and on Saturdays. Therefore, increased visitation to the Community Park could
increase traffic on roads leading to the Community Park during the weekday afternoon peak
hour.
Increased vehicle trips to Contra Loma would represent a small proportion of the existing traffic
on local roads serving Contra Loma. According to the City’s General Plan EIR (prepared in
2003), average daily traffic on James Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, and Contra Loma
Boulevard ranges from 13,490 to 27,760 vehicles and volume-to-capacity ratios for these streets
range from 0.53 to 0.82 (City of Antioch 2003b). The Regional and Community parks have a
combined parking capacity of about 1,500 spaces. If daily visitation by visitors driving vehicles
to Contra Loma increases by 20 percent, vehicle trips would increase by about 600 trips per day
(1,500 x 20% x 1 trip each direction [2 trips] = 600) on the busiest days. These additional trips
would increase average daily traffic from 2 to 4 percent of the current traffic volumes and would
increase volume-to-capacity ratios to a range from 0.55 to 0.84. As of 2003, James Donlon
Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, and Contra Loma Boulevards had available remaining capacity of
approximately 6,100 to 15,000 vehicles. The increased trips expected under this alternative (i.e.,
about 600) would be minor in the context of the available capacity of the roads servicing Contra
Loma. It appears that these roads would be sufficient to accommodate increased visitation
expected under this alternative. Increased human use of Contra Loma, therefore, would cause a
minor impact on the capacity of local roads.

4-23 DRAFT – May 2014

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Facility Maintenance and Operation

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.4.3.
Natural and Cultural Resource Management and Protection

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.4.3.
4.4.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Increased Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in Section 4.4.3, this alternative would include more
enhanced recreation opportunities which could result in more visitor use and generate more
vehicle trips to Contra Loma. The internal roads and parking areas would be expected to
accommodate increased visitation on most days; however, gate closures to vehicles when road
and parking capacity is reached could occur more frequently than the No Action Alternative.
Impacts to parking capacity caused by increased human use could be alleviated by the
management action to expand the gravel/overflow parking areas within the Regional Park. Also,
the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about gate closures
further reducing the effect.
If this alternative were to generate 20 percent more new daily visitors than the No Action
Alternative, vehicle trips on the busiest days would increase by about 720 trips per day as
compared to existing conditions (600 trips under No Action Alternative x 120% = 720 trips).
These additional trips would increase average daily traffic from 3 to 5 percent of the current
traffic volumes and would increase volume-to-capacity ratios to a range from 0.56 to 0.84. As of
2003, James Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, and Contra Loma Boulevards had available
remaining capacity of approximately 6,100 to 15,000 vehicles. The increased trips expected
under this alternative (i.e., about 720) would be minor in the context of the available capacity of
the roads servicing Contra Loma. Similar to the No Action Alternative, it appears that these
roads would be sufficient to accommodate the increased visitation expected under this
alternative. Increased human use of Contra Loma, therefore, would cause a minor impact on the
capacity of local roads. The impacts of increased human use on visitor access and circulation
would be minor.
Facility Maintenance and Operation

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and those addressed in
Section 4.4.3, this alternative would include new facilities to enhance recreational opportunities.
The new facilities would increase the need for routine maintenance activities which could
increase the frequency of temporary road or trail closures. Also, because this alternative would
include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, it could result in
more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance. Therefore, this alternative could
result in more frequent occurrences of temporary road or trail closure than the No Action
Alternative. If temporary road or trail closure is required during maintenance activities, the
closure would be short term and the effect on visitor access and circulation would be minor.
Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about such
closures further reducing the effect.

4-24 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Natural and Cultural Resource Management and Protection

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and those
addressed in Section 4.4.3.
Facility Improvements

Under this alternative the East Shore Trail, the West Shore Trail, and the trail across the dam
would be improved by paving the surfaces along the entire reservoir shoreline loop. The
shoreline loop is open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Improvements to the trails that compose
the shoreline loop would make the shoreline loop more accessible to a wider range of pedestrian
and bicycle traffic, including handicap visitors and other recreationists who may have trouble
negotiating unpaved surfaces. Trail improvements along the reservoir shoreline would have a
beneficial impact on visitor access and circulation within the Regional Park that would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative includes the potential to expand or renovate existing buildings or construct new
facilities for the purpose of improving Regional Park operations. These facility improvements
would not occur under the No Action Alternative. Existing roads and parking areas are
anticipated to be sufficient to accommodate any increased vehicle traffic resulting from building
and facilities enhancements, although some existing gravel parking areas may be paved and
overflow parking at the Regional Park may be expanded, if it becomes necessary to
accommodate more vehicles. Facility improvements would not result in permanent impacts on
visitor access or circulation. However, temporary road or trail closures, if needed during
construction, could result in minor, short-term adverse effects on visitor access and circulation.
Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about such
closures further reducing the effect.
Facility improvements at the Regional Park included in this alternative would comply with ADA
accessibility requirements. The local managing partner(s) may implement a management action
that would replace, retrofit, or restructure many of the Regional Park facilities to meet current
ADA requirements resulting in beneficial impacts that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
4.4.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Increased Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in Section 4.4.3, this alternative would include more
expanded recreation opportunities which could result in more visitor use and generate more
vehicle trips to Contra Loma. The internal roads and parking areas would be expected to
accommodate increased visitation on most days; however, gate closures to vehicles when road
and parking capacity is reached could occur more frequently than the other two alternatives.
Similar to the other alternatives, the local roads providing access to Contra Loma would be
sufficient to accommodate increased visitation. The effect of increased human use on visitor
access and circulation would be minor. Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement
BMPs to notify visitors about gate closures further reducing the effect.
If this alternative were to generate 20 percent more new daily visitors than the Enhanced
Recreation and Facilities Alternative, vehicle trips would increase by about 864 trips per day on

4-25 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

the busiest days as compared to existing conditions (720 trips under Enhanced Recreation and
Facilities Alternative x 120% = 864 trips). These additional trips would increase average daily
traffic from 3 to 6 percent of the current traffic volumes and would increase volume-to-capacity
ratios to a range from 0.56 to 0.85. As of 2003, James Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, and
Contra Loma Boulevards had available remaining capacity of approximately 6,100 to 15,000
vehicles. The increased trips expected under this alternative (i.e., about 864) would be minor in
the context of the available capacity of the roads servicing Contra Loma. Similar to the other two
alternatives, it appears that these roads would be sufficient to accommodate the increased
visitation expected under this alternative. Increased human use of Contra Loma, therefore, would
cause a minor impact on the capacity of local roads. The impacts of increased human use on
visitor access and circulation would be minor.
Facility Maintenance and Operation

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and those addressed in
Section 4.4.5, this alternative would include new facilities to expand recreational opportunities.
The new facilities would increase the need for routine maintenance activities which could
increase the frequency of temporary road or trail closures. Also, because this alternative would
include more expanded recreation opportunities than the other two alternatives, it could result in
more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance. Therefore, this alternative could
result in more frequent occurrences of temporary road or trail closure than the other alternatives.
If temporary road or trail closure is required during maintenance activities, the closure would be
short term and the effect on visitor access and circulation would be minor. Also, the local
managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about such closures further
reducing the effect.
Natural and Cultural Resource Management and Protection

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and those
addressed in Section 4.4.3.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded recreational facilities in addition
to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. Expanded
recreational facilities proposed under this alternative would also include expansion of the swim
lagoon and construction of additional sports fields. The swim lagoon is one of the principal
attractions at the Regional Park’s south shore recreation cluster and would be expanded to
accommodate increased future demand. The addition of two new sports fields and increased
parking capacity (if needed) south of the two existing soccer fields located in the Community
Park would attract a substantial number of visitors to the Community Park. Existing roads and
parking areas at both the Regional Park and the Community Park are anticipated to be capable of
providing an adequate level of service to accommodate increased visitor traffic. Facility
improvements would not result in any permanent impacts on visitor access or circulation.
However, road or trail closures, if needed during construction, could result in temporary, minor
effects on visitor access and circulation that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about such
closures further reducing the effect.

4-26 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

This alternative may include construction of new trails that would be open to bicycles and/or
allow bicycles on portions of trails that are not currently open to bicycles. Expansion of the trail
system would improve bicycle, equestrian, and pedestrian access and circulation throughout the
Regional Park. In addition, the expansion of the Community Park trails system to include new
trails and improve interconnection between trail systems would also improve bicycle and/or
pedestrian access and circulation throughout the Community Park. Expanding the trails system in
the Regional Park and the Community Park would be beneficial for visitor access and circulation
that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.4.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation and Concurrent Improvements

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma. In
particular, the installation of flood lights to sports fields 4 and 5 will allow for increased
nighttime visitation to the Community Park.
Increased Human Use

Increased visitation would result in greater demand for parking within the Regional Park and
Community Park, and would increase the number of vehicles using park roads and parking areas
for internal circulation. The internal roads and parking areas would be expected to accommodate
increased visitation on most days; however, gate closures to vehicles when road and parking
capacity is reached could occur more frequently than current conditions. The cumulative increase
in human use of Contra Loma, therefore, would cause a minor impact on visitor access and
circulation within Contra Loma under all of the alternatives. However, the management action
included in the two action alternatives to expand the gravel/overflow parking areas within the
Regional Park could help reduce cumulative impacts to parking capacity caused by increased
human use. Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about
gate closures further reducing the effect.
Increased visitor use of the Regional and Community parks would increase vehicle trips to
Contra Loma; regional population growth would also increase traffic volumes on roads near
Contra Loma. As discussed previously, the increased traffic would be most noticeable on highvolume days and in the immediate vicinity of Contra Loma. Also, increased vehicle trips (up to
about 864 new trips per day) to Contra Loma from implementation of the RMP would represent
a small proportion (up to 6 percent) of the existing traffic on local roads serving Contra Loma.
The two action alternatives would generate more traffic than the No Action Alternative.
According to the City’s General Plan EIR (prepared in 2003), average daily traffic on James
Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, and Contra Loma Boulevard ranges from 13,490 to 27,760
vehicles and volume-to-capacity ratios for these streets range from 0.53 to 0.82. The projected
daily traffic on James Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, and Contra Loma Boulevard after
build out of the General Plan would range from 17,000 to 42,700 vehicles and volume-to-

4-27 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

capacity ratios for these streets would range from 0.50 to 0.84 (City of Antioch 2003b). Although
the traffic volume would increase over time, expected future roadway improvements envisioned
in the General Plan would ensure that the volume-to-capacity ratios for these streets would not
exceed their expected range or capacity. Therefore, these roads would be sufficient to
accommodate cumulative increases in traffic volume, including those attributable to increased
visitation to Contra Loma.
Facility Maintenance and Operation

As previously discussed, hiking, equestrian, and bicycle trail system users could encounter trail
sections receiving periodic maintenance activities under all of the alternatives. The cumulative
increase in visitation would increase the need for trail maintenance, and could also increase the
number of visitors unable to access the sections of trail undergoing maintenance. Under all of the
alternatives, if trail closure is required during maintenance activities, the closure would be short
term and the cumulative effect on visitor access and circulation would be minor. Also, the local
managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to notify visitors about such closures further
reducing the effect.
Natural and Cultural Resource Management and Protection

All of the alternatives include management actions for protecting and managing natural and
cultural resources. Avoiding or minimizing disturbance of special-status plant communities or
special-status wildlife species (individuals or populations) could affect current and proposed
visitor access and circulation due to road or trail closures, or could influence future road and trail
planning. Cultural resources within Contra Loma would be afforded similar protections.
Increased visitation from buildout of the City and County general plans would increase the
number of visitors potentially affected by such protective measures.
However, conflicts between a visitor access and circulation planning action and a sensitive
resource can be proactively addressed early in the planning process to reduce or avoid conflicts
to the extent possible. Natural and cultural resource management and protection could result in a
minor cumulative impact on visitor access and circulation.
4.4.8

Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.5
4.5.1

Utilities
Types of Impacts

As described in Section 3.5.1, public utilities within Contra Loma include water service,
wastewater service, solid waste disposal, electricity, and telephone and radio service available to
personnel and visitors of the Regional Park and the Community Park. All of the RMP
alternatives would have an effect on the availability and the public’s level of demand for utilities.
Potential impacts to public utilities could result from four general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Livestock Grazing

4-28 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

Facility Improvements

•

Communications

4.5.2

Assumptions

The public utilities impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

Neither Reclamation nor its local managing partner(s) are public utilities service
providers.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing public utilities.

•

The demand for public utilities at Contra Loma will continue to increase regardless of the
selected alternative, and an increased level of facilities management will be required to
satisfy this demand.

•

The managing partner(s) would uphold their responsibilities to provide the standard of
care necessary to ensure that utilities are reasonably available and maintained for the
benefit of visitors to Contra Loma. These agencies would provide staff levels
commensurate with recreation visitation to ensure implementation of the policies and
management actions intended to maintain the level and quality of safety and services
expected by visitors to the Regional Park and the Community Park.

4.5.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Human Use

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP
alternatives. Increased visitation would increase the demand for publicly available utilities such
as restrooms, potable water, electricity, and litter and waste disposal. It is anticipated that the
managing partner(s) would provide additional portable chemical toilets if needed to
accommodate increased demand. Also, similar to current practices, routine maintenance of
public utilities, including litter and waste removal, sewage pumping, and plumbing repairs would
be required under all project alternatives to avoid potential public health and safety concerns,
ensure adequate service, and protect water quality (see Sections 3.2, 3.5, and 3.8). The
anticipated increase in human use and corresponding waste disposal needs would be a minor
impact because the managing partner(s) would continue to provide adequate waste disposal
services. Increased demand for electricity would be a minor impact as electricity would continue
to be provided by PG&E under its current electrical generation capacities.
4.5.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.5.3.
4-29 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

4.5.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the
public’s enjoyment and use of the Regional Park and the Community Park. This alternative
would likely attract more visitors than the No Action Alternative, thereby increasing demand for
utilities. Consequently, this alternative would include utilities infrastructure improvements and
renovations. Additional restrooms may be built to accommodate existing and future user needs,
while existing portable chemical toilets may be replaced with permanent restrooms served by
vault systems, septic tanks, or the City’s sewer system. This would be a beneficial impact that
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The greatest potential for water use occurs during the peak visitor season (May through
October). During this peak season, irrigation and potable water use account for the greatest
demand for water. Potable water service at Contra Loma is provided by the City via its
contractual agreement with CCWD. Additional drinking water fountains and spigots may be
installed as a result of this alternative. Extension of City sewer and potable water lines may be
needed to accommodate the new infrastructure. This alternative would generate higher water
demand than the No Action Alternative; however, the City’s water system is expected to have
adequate capacity to serve Contra Loma’s potable water needs. Therefore, the impact of
increased human use on water supply would be minor.
Raw water for irrigation and livestock grazing is derived from the reservoir, with an allocation of
up to 100 acre-feet per year. Under this alternative, the volume of water pumped from the
reservoir to irrigate the Regional Park might be increased from 100 acre-feet per year to 150
acre-feet per year. This water would be purchased from CCWD if the requested water is
available. CCWD would be responsible for reviewing the request for additional water, and would
only approve the request if sufficient water is available. Because CCWD would only provide
additional water to the Regional Park if it is available, the provision of increased raw water
would have a minor impact on water supplies. This impact would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
This alternative would also generate higher demand for other public utilities (i.e., electricity, and
litter and waste disposal) than the No Action Alternative. However, this impact would be minor
because PG&E would be able to provide electricity to serve the increased demand and because
the managing partner(s) would continue to provide adequate litter and waste disposal services.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative could result in 0.3 more acre of grazing area than the No Action Alternative.
This slight increase would not substantially increase the amount of water needed for livestock. If
additional water for livestock grazing is needed, the water would be purchased from CCWD if it
is available. This impact is discussed above (Human Use).
Facility Improvements

This alternative would generate more demand for utilities than the No Action Alternative.
Proposed building expansion or renovation of the existing park offices, the police substation, the
secondary storage yard, and the buildings near the swim lagoon could increase demand for

4-30 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

electricity as well as for wastewater and solid waste disposal. A fueling station and fuel storage
tank facility proposed for use by the managing partner(s) could also result in an increased
demand for utilities. Infrastructure improvements, including a new radio communication tower
and facilities as well as the addition of call boxes and security cameras in the Regional Park,
would require electricity to operate. The anticipated increase in wastewater and solid waste
disposal needs would be a minor impact because the managing partner(s) would continue to
provide adequate waste disposal services. Increased demand for electricity would be a minor
impact because PG&E would be expected to have sufficient capacity to serve the increased
demand.
Communications

The new radio communication tower and supporting facilities proposed under this alternative
would improve communications at Contra Loma, thereby enhancing public service response and
aiding the managing partner(s) and other public service personnel in serving the Regional Park.
Therefore, construction of the radio tower would be a beneficial impact that would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.
4.5.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations beyond those proposed
under the other two alternatives. These improvements would further increase the public’s
enjoyment and use of the Regional Park and the Community Park and would likely attract more
visitors than the other alternatives. Similar to the other two alternatives, however, the impacts of
increased human use on public utilities would be minor because the City’s water system is
expected to have adequate capacity to serve Contra Loma’s potable water needs, PG&E would
be able to provide electricity to serve the increased demand, and the managing partner(s) would
continue to provide adequate litter and waste disposal services.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park
and expansion of the Community Park boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would
be excluded from this area (approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. Therefore, this
alternative could reduce the amount of grazing area within Contra Loma as compared to the
other two alternatives, thereby reducing the amount of water needed for livestock.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include new facility improvements in addition to those that would be
included in the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Some improvements may be needed to accommodate overnight camping, such as installation of
wash basins and electrical outlets. Allowing overnight camping would increase use of potable
water, electricity, and restroom facilities as a result of the change in duration of use by visitors to
the park. The expanded swim lagoon would also require some additional electricity to filter the
larger volume of water. The increased demand for electricity and water as a result of overnight
camping and expansion of the swim lagoon would be a minor impact because the City’s water
system is expected to have adequate capacity to serve Contra Loma’s potable water needs and

4-31 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

PG&E would be able to provide electricity to serve the increased demand. This impact would not
occur under the No Action Alternative.
Proposed improvements to the recreational facilities at the Community Park include two new
lighted sports fields. Power would be provided by PG&E, which already provides electrical
power to the Community Park, including the three lighted sports fields, and the Regional Park.
This increased demand for electricity would be a minor impact that would not occur under the
No Action Alternative.
To help meet the increased demand for energy, this alternative would include installation of solar
panels on shade structures or buildings. Energy derived from these solar panels would be used to
supplement the park’s energy needs, including powering the water pumps at the swim lagoon.
This would be a beneficial impact that would decrease dependency on commercial electricity and
that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Communications

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.5.5.
4.5.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation and Concurrent Improvements

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. This buildout would also
increase regional demand for utilities. The improvements to sports fields 4 and 5 and the boat
launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma and the new flood lights will
increase electrical demand.
Human Use

Increased visitation would increase the demand for publicly available utilities such as restrooms,
electricity, and litter and waste disposal. It is anticipated that the managing partner(s) would
provide additional portable chemical toilets if needed to accommodate increased demand. Under
the two action alternatives, additional restrooms may be built to accommodate existing and
future user needs, while existing portable chemical toilets may be replaced with permanent
restrooms. The anticipated increase in human use and corresponding sanitary and solid waste
disposal needs would result in a minor cumulative impact because the managing partner(s)
would continue to provide adequate waste disposal services. Increased demand for electricity
would have a cumulative minor impact because PG&E would be expected to have sufficient
capacity to serve the increased demand.
Water service at Contra Loma is provided by the City via their contractual agreement with
CCWD for CVP water. The cumulative increase in visitation to Contra Loma and regional
population growth would increase potable water demand within the City. The City’s General
Plan EIR estimates that water usage between 2010 and 2020 will increase by 13 percent (2,832
acre-feet per year). The City’s General Plan includes policies to ensure that adequate water

4-32 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

supply is available for future growth, such as maintaining adequate pumping and storage
capacity, ensuring that adequate water supply infrastructure is in place prior to occupancy or
development, maintaining existing levels of water service, implementing a residential growth
management program development review process for non-residential development to ensure
that adequate long-term water supplies are available, and requiring new development to be
equipped with drought-tolerant landscaping and water conservation devices. The City’s General
Plan EIR concludes that these policies will reduce water supply impacts below a level of
significance (City of Antioch 2003b). Therefore, the City’s water system is expected to have
adequate capacity to serve the cumulative increase in potable water needs for Contra Loma and
the City. Increased visitation would, therefore, have a minor adverse cumulative impact on water
supply.
Wastewater from the Regional Park’s permanent restrooms, the showers near the swim lagoon,
and the restrooms and concession building/snack bar within the Community Park are collected
and conveyed through the City’s sewer lines to the DDSD’s wastewater treatment plant. As of
2010, the plant was operating at 77 percent of its capacity (Delta Diablo Sanitation District
2013). The cumulative increase in visitation to Contra Loma and projected population growth the
DDSD service area (i.e., Antioch, Bay Point, Pittsburg) would increase wastewater demand
within the DDSD service area. DDSD is expected to continue to expand its treatment capacity
consistent with growth projections and the associated demand increase and the City is expected
to continue to expand sewer line capacity to serve increased growth within its service area.
Therefore, the DDSD treatment plant and the City’s sewer lines are expected to have sufficient
capacity to serve the cumulative increase in wastewater generation. Increased visitation would
have a minor adverse cumulative impact with respect to wastewater generation and treatment.
Facility Improvements

The two action alternatives would include facility improvements that are not included in the No
Action Alternative. These improvements would generate increased demand for utilities. Similar
to the cumulative effects described under Human Use above, the increased demand for utilities
caused by the facility improvements and increased visitation would have a minor cumulative
impact on utilities.

Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.6.1

Public Health and Safety
Types of Impacts

Public health and safety issues at the Regional Park and the Community Park include fire
protection, police service, medical response, boating and swimming safety, natural hazards, and
general public safety. Safety issues related to wildland fires, dam failure, and hazardous
materials are described in Section 4.15 (Hazards), and safety issues related to seismicity and
other potential geologic hazards are described in Section 4.11 (Geologic and Soil Resources).
The RMP does not address health and safety issues related to operation of the dam and reservoir,
which is subject to a separate contract between Reclamation and CCWD and is therefore outside
the scope of the Contra Loma RMP.

4-33 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Potential impacts to public health and safety could result from seven general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Emergency Preparedness

•

Facility Maintenance

•

Facility Improvements

•

Enhanced Recreational Facilities

•

Communications

•

Expanded Recreational Facilities

4.6.2

Assumptions

The public health and safety impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing public health and safety.

•

The managing partner(s) would uphold their responsibilities to provide the standard of
care necessary to ensure the health and safety of visitors to Contra Loma. These agencies
would provide staff levels commensurate with recreation visitation to ensure
implementation of the policies and management actions intended to maintain the level
and quality of safety and services expected by visitors to the Regional Park and the
Community Park.

4.6.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Human Use

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP
alternatives. More visitors would result in the increased use of restrooms and other facilities and
infrastructure and would generate more solid and sanitary waste. The current managing partners
manage and maintain sanitary services in a manner that protects public health and safety (see
Section 3.5). Even with increased visitation, the future managing partner(s) would be expected to
manage sanitary services public utilities at levels that would ensure that the RMP’s public health
and safety goal is maintained. It is anticipated that under all of the RMP alternatives, the
managing partner(s) would provide additional portable chemical toilets if needed and would
increase the frequency of solid waste removal and/or provide more waste receptacles, as needed.
Increased human use could also increase the amount of solid waste, discarded food, and other
attractants for unwanted pests (such as rodents or wasps), and could increase the potential for
accidental fires. However, the local managing partner(s) would implement integrated pest

4-34 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

management (IPM) plans to control pests and to reduce fire hazards by mowing and grazing the
grassland areas.
Therefore, impacts of increased human use on public health and safety would be minor.
Emergency Preparedness

The current managing partners provide emergency services, including fire, police, and lifeguard
services. Increased visitation would potentially increase the demand for emergency services, as
well as the number of rescues and assistance responses performed by lifeguards at the swim
lagoon and possibly the reservoir. The managing partner(s) would either implement fire and
emergency preparedness plans for the Regional Park and the Community Park or would contract
the provision of police and fire services to other local agencies. At the Regional Park, continued
operation of the existing police substation and fire station as well as continued provision of
lifeguard services may be included in the proposed management actions common to all
alternatives. Maintenance of the Regional Park trail system would continue to ensure all-weather
access for emergency vehicles. Trail system bike patrols may also be included in management
actions. Use of existing and expanded emergency and safety services, and the development and
implementation of emergency preparedness plans would ensure that increased visitor use of
Contra Loma would have no impact on the public health and safety of park users.
The City’s Office of Emergency Services maintains a community emergency disaster warning
system to notify the public of potential emergencies, including earthquakes, severe winter
storms, wildland fires, and hazardous materials events. The RMP would have no impact on the
City’s emergency disaster warning system.
Facility Maintenance

All of the RMP alternatives include continuation of routine maintenance and repair activities that
could affect visitor health and safety. For example, some maintenance and repair activities
include the use of mechanized equipment that could injure visitors and some activities could
create temporary hazards such as open trenches. Increased visitation could incrementally
increase the amount of facility maintenance required, thereby incrementally increasing the
potential risk to visitors. However, facility maintenance would have a minor adverse impact on
public health and safety because the managing partner(s) would be expected to perform
maintenance and repair activities in a manner that meets the RMP goal of protecting public
health and safety.
4.6.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.6.3.
Emergency Preparedness

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.6.3.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.6.3.

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

4.6.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in Section 4.6.3, this alternative would include facility
improvements and renovations that would increase the public’s enjoyment and use of the
Regional Park and the Community Park. This alternative would likely attract more visitors than
the No Action Alternative, thereby increasing demand for public health and safety services.
However, facilities management actions performed by the managing partner(s) would maintain
public utilities at levels that would ensure that the RMP’s public health and safety goal is
maintained. Also, the local managing partner(s) would implement IPM plans to control pests and
to reduce fire hazards by mowing and grazing the grassland areas. Therefore, the impacts of
increased human use on public health and safety services would be minor.
Emergency Preparedness

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.6.3.
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include more recreation and infrastructure facilities than the No Action
Alternative, which could require more maintenance and repair than the No Action Alternative. In
addition, because this alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the
No Action Alternative, it could result in more visitor use and require incrementally more
maintenance and repairs than the No Action Alternative. Similar to the No Action Alternative,
however, facility maintenance would have a minor adverse impact on public health and safety
because the managing partner(s) would be expected to perform maintenance and repair activities
in a manner that meets the RMP goal of protecting public health and safety.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include a new fueling station and fuel storage tank for use by park
personnel to refuel equipment and vehicles used for Regional Park operations. The new fueling
station and fuel storage tank would not be available for public use and would only be operated by
trained managing partner staff, thereby minimizing the potential for public contact with the fuel.
The facility would be designed with fuel containment devices to protect public health and safety
as well as prevent accidental spills from entering the reservoir or contaminating groundwater;
therefore, the impact on public health and safety would be minor. This impact would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative also includes renovations to the existing park offices, police substation,
secondary storage yard, and buildings near the swim lagoon. These renovations are intended to
better provide for public service and safety by increasing park management efficiency and
creating a place for public education activities such as swim and safety lessons. Renovations to
these existing buildings and structures would have a beneficial impact on public health and
safety that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Under this alternative, the existing portable chemical toilets may be replaced with permanent
restrooms and new or upgraded sewer lines may be built to connect future permanent restrooms
to the City’s sewer and wastewater system. Because the existing restrooms and portable toilets

4-36 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

are properly used and maintained, they represent a very limited potential source of biological
contamination to the reservoir. These improvements, however, would further reduce the potential
for inadvertent spills from the portable restrooms, resulting in a beneficial impact on public
health and safety. This impact would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Enhanced Recreational Facilities

Fishing is a popular recreational activity at the reservoir. During drawdowns, the floating fishing
docks often become unusable and unsafe due to the steep angles of the access ramps and/or the
steepness of the fishing docks themselves, requiring temporary closure. When this occurs, some
anglers choose to fish from the boat dock, which can cause congestion and interfere with boater
access. Fishing from the boat dock poses a safety issue to boaters who could be ensnared in
fishing line or injured by a fish hook while using the dock. This alternative may include the
modification or addition of more fishing docks to provide anglers with safe, continuous fishing
opportunities away from the boat dock during reservoir drawdowns. These improvements would
be a beneficial impact on public safety that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may include a “safe swim” area or splash pad specifically for small children.
This would improve swim safety for small children because it would separate them from older
children and adults, thereby reducing the potential for injurious physical contact. This
improvement would also reduce the potential for small children without proper swimming skills
to venture into deeper water. This improvement would have a beneficial impact on public safety
that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Communications

A new radio communications tower and supporting facilities would be built under this
alternative. Improvements to communications at Contra Loma would enhance emergency
response and preparedness as well as aid the managing partner(s) and other public service
personnel in the management of the park providing a beneficial impact that would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.
Call boxes and/or security cameras may also be installed in the Regional Park. Call boxes would
allow visitors to contact public safety officials in case of an emergency. Security cameras could
help reduce the potential for unlawful activities (e.g., mugging, assault) that could harm visitors.
Installation of these devices would have a beneficial impact on public safety that would not
occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.6.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed in Section
4.6.3, this alternative would include facility improvements and renovations that would increase
the public’s enjoyment and use of the Regional Park and the Community Park. This alternative
would likely attract more visitors than the other two alternatives, thereby increasing demand for
public health and safety services. However, facilities management actions performed by the
managing partner(s) would maintain public utilities at levels that would ensure that the RMP’s
public health and safety goal is maintained. Also, the local managing partner(s) would
implement IPM plans to control pests and to reduce fire hazards by mowing and grazing the

4-37 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

grassland areas. Therefore, the impacts of increased human use on public health and safety
services would be minor.
Emergency Preparedness

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.6.3.
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include more recreation and infrastructure facilities than the other two
alternatives, which could require more maintenance and repair than the other two alternatives. In
addition, because this alternative would include more expanded recreation opportunities, it could
result in more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance and repairs than the other
alternatives. Similar to the other two alternatives, however, facility maintenance would have a
minor adverse impact on public health and safety because the managing partner(s) would be
expected to perform maintenance and repair activities in a manner that meets the RMP goal of
protecting public health and safety.
Facility Improvements

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.6.5.
Expanded Recreational Facilities

This alternative would include expanded recreational facilities and opportunities beyond those of
the other two alternatives. The expanded trail systems, increased interpretive opportunities, and
disc golf course would result in a wider dispersal of park visitors than current conditions and any
of the other alternatives, increasing the potential for visitors to encounter natural hazards such as
snakes and ticks as well as increasing the likelihood of visitors sustaining injuries in more remote
parts of the park. Introducing overnight group camping opportunities to the Regional Park would
increase the potential for injury due to reduced visibility during nighttime hours. Also, an
expanded swim lagoon would increase the number of people using the lagoon, and could
increase the likelihood of water-related accidents. However, the managing partner(s) would
ensure that adequate staff and emergency plans are available to effectively accommodate the
increased risk to public health and safety related to expanded recreational facilities resulting in a
minor impact.
Communications

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.6.5.
4.6.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation and Concurrent Improvements

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.

4-38 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Human Use

More visitors would result in the increased use of restrooms and other facilities and infrastructure
and would generate more solid and sanitary waste, which could create public health and safety
issues. However, facilities management actions performed by the managing partner(s) would
maintain public utilities at levels that would ensure that the RMP’s public health and safety goal
is maintained. It is anticipated that under all of the RMP alternatives, the managing partner(s)
would provide additional portable chemical toilets if needed and would increase the frequency of
solid waste removal and/or provide more waste receptacles, as needed. Increased human use
could also increase the amount of solid waste, discarded food, and other attractants for unwanted
pests (such as rodents or wasps), and could increase the potential for accidental fires. However,
the local managing partner(s) would continue to implement IPM plans to control pests and to
reduce fire hazards by mowing and grazing the grassland areas. Therefore, cumulative impacts of
increased human use on public health and safety would be minor.
Emergency Preparedness

The cumulative increase in visitation would potentially increase the demand for emergency
services. The two action alternatives would likely result in more demand than the No Action
Alternative. Included in all RMP alternatives are management actions that require local
managing partner(s) to meet the anticipated increased demand for emergency services, which
would include additional demand caused by cumulative increases in visitation. Use of existing
and expanded emergency and safety services, and the development and implementation of
emergency preparedness plans would ensure that the cumulative increase in visitor use of Contra
Loma would have no impact on the public health and safety of park users.
Facility Maintenance

All of the RMP alternatives include continuation of routine maintenance and repair activities that
could affect visitor health and safety. The two action alternatives would require more
maintenance than the No Action Alternative. A cumulative increase in visitation could
incrementally increase the amount of facility maintenance required, thereby incrementally
increasing the potential risk to visitors. However, facility maintenance would have a minor
cumulative adverse impact on public health and safety because the managing partner(s) would be
expected to perform maintenance and repair activities in a manner that meets the RMP goal of
protecting public health and safety.
Expanded Recreational Facilities

The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include expanded trail systems,
increased interpretive opportunities, and disc golf course that would result in a wider dispersal of
park visitors than current conditions and any of the other alternatives, increasing the potential for
visitors to encounter natural hazards such as snakes and ticks as well as increasing the likelihood
of visitors sustaining injuries in more remote parts of the park. Increased visitation would
incrementally increase the potential for these effects. However, the managing partner(s) would
ensure that adequate staff and emergency plans are available to effectively accommodate the
increased risk to public health and safety related to expanded recreational facilities. This would
result in a minor cumulative impact with respect to public health and safety.

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

4.7
4.7.1

Water Resources
Types of Impacts

Water resources include groundwater and surface water carried by drainages or stored in the
Contra Loma Reservoir. Potential impacts to water resources could result from five general types
of activities:
•

Human Use and Waste Disposal

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Facility Improvements

•

Construction Activities

•

Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

4.7.2

Assumptions

The water resources impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs when necessary to protect water
resources.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing water resources.

4.7.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Human Use and Waste Disposal

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the
alternatives. Increased visitation would increase the potential for unauthorized human contact
with the reservoir, would increase the volume of solid, human, and domestic animal (e.g., dogs
and horses) waste generated within the recreation area, would increase trail and road use, and
would increase the potential for reservoir infestation by non-native zebra and quagga mussels.
Human-borne pathogens and viruses can affect reservoir water quality through direct bodily
contact; however, body contact with the reservoir is highly restricted to protect the reservoir’s
domestic water supply. These restrictions would continue under all of the alternatives, thereby
ensuring that potential adverse impacts to water quality due to bodily contact would be minimal.
Improper disposal of litter and waste can affect reservoir water quality if introduced to the
reservoir through wind dispersion or other means. Under all of the alternatives, however, litter
and waste reduction programs would continue to be implemented to effectively meet demand. As
a result, adverse impacts to water quality related to litter and waste disposal would be minor.

4-40 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Increased visitation would increase the volume of human sanitary waste generated at Contra
Loma. Improper sanitary disposal, plumbing system failure, accidental spills, or overflow of
portable toilets can affect reservoir water quality. Under all of the alternatives, however, the
restroom facilities would continue to be inspected and maintained at regular intervals, thereby
ensuring that adverse impacts to water quality from human sanitary waste would be minor.
Increased visitation would likely increase boating activity, thereby increasing the potential for
reservoir infestation by zebra and quagga mussels and other non-native species. Under all of the
alternatives, however, the local managing partners(s) would continue to support and complement
CCWD’s programs to prevent zebra and quagga mussel infestation, thereby ensuring that
adverse impacts to water quality from invasive species would be minor.
The public is not allowed to operate gasoline-powered engines on the reservoir to prevent
contamination from petroleum products and exhaust byproducts, and none of the RMP
alternatives would alter this restriction. Therefore, no impacts to water resources would result
from gasoline-powered engines.
Equestrian activities and dog walking have the potential to introduce animal waste into the
reservoir through surface runoff. Under all of the alternatives, however, the local managing
partner(s) would continue to provide plastic waste bags in various locations and encourage dog
owners to dispose of dog waste in garbage cans. Therefore, adverse impacts to water quality
from domestic animal waste would be minor.
Hiking, biking, and equestrian activities can cause small amounts of localized erosion, and the
resulting sediment can be transported to the reservoir by surface runoff. Chemical runoff from
roads and parking lots can also be transported to the reservoir by surface runoff. Under all of the
alternatives, however, the local managing partner(s) would continue to manage and maintain the
trail and road system in a manner that maintains proper drainage and controls erosion and
chemical runoff. Therefore, adverse impacts to water quality from trail and road use would be
minor.
4.7.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Human Use and Waste Disposal

The water quality impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.7.3. Because the
No Action Alternative would not involve new facilities or land uses, it would have no impact on
hydrology.
Livestock Grazing

Livestock grazing can impair water quality not only through transport of feces from surface
runoff, but also through the process of livestock-induced erosion and subsequent transport of
sediment. Within Contra Loma, grazing is rotated between multiple enclosures and livestock are
not allowed near the reservoir to protect water quality. One small ephemeral stream flows
through the southern part of the grazed area into the reservoir. This ephemeral stream has a
limited potential to transport fecal matter and sediment directly into the reservoir. Grazing would
likely continue under all of the alternatives, subject to preparation of a Reclamation-approved
grazing management plan by the local managing partner(s). Under this alternative, the acreage,

4-41 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

location, and intensity of grazing are not likely to change. Continuation of grazing at current
livestock levels would have no impact on water resources beyond the existing limited effects of
this activity described above.
4.7.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use and Waste Disposal

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed in Section
4.7.3, this alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities which could result
in more visitor use. Increased visitation would increase the potential for water quality impacts
caused by unauthorized human contact with the reservoir; generation and disposal of solid,
human, and domestic animal waste; trail and road use; and introduction of non-native zebra and
quagga mussels into the reservoir. As discussed in Section 4.7.3, the proposed management
actions would ensure that these impacts are minor.
This alternative would include new infrastructure and facility improvements that could affect
water resources. For example, the existing portable chemical toilets may be replaced with
permanent restrooms. Because the existing portable toilets are properly used and maintained (see
Section 3.5), they represent a very limited potential source of contamination to the reservoir.
This improvement, however, would further reduce the potential for inadvertent spills from the
portable restrooms, resulting in a beneficial impact on water resources. This impact would not
occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may include new, expanded, or renovated buildings and structures to improve
operations. Examples include a new park residence, classroom facilities near the swim lagoon,
and a radio communication tower. This alternative may also include new or renovated
recreational facilities, such as new or reconstructed fishing docks, and improvements at the boat
launch area to enhance boating and fishing access. Operation of these improvements would be
substantially similar to use of the existing facilities and would result in minor impacts on water
resources that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may include a new fueling station and fuel storage tank for Regional Park
vehicles and equipment as well as for public safety officers. The managing partner(s) would be
required to implement substantial design and operational measures to protect surface water (e.g.,
reservoir) and groundwater quality. Only staff trained to safely use the station would be allowed
to operate it, thereby reducing the potential for spills caused by improper use. The managing
partner(s) must design the facility with fuel containment devices to prevent any spilled fuel from
reaching the natural ground surface (i.e., soil), entering the reservoir, or otherwise impairing
surface water or groundwater quality. This facility may only be built and operated in compliance
with applicable federal and federally-mandated laws, regulations, and permits. As a condition of
Reclamation’s approval of this facility, the local managing partner(s) will ensure that spill
prevention and decommissioning plans are prepared or amended to address operation of this
facility. By implementing these measures, this facility would have a minor adverse impact on
water quality. This impact would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may include a new “safe swim” area or splash pad at the swim lagoon for small
children and expansion of the pumping and filtration facility to accommodate this additional

4-42 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

swim/splash area. Similar to the swim lagoon, these additional swim/splash areas would be
hydrologically separated from the reservoir, ensuring that water from the lagoon does not enter
the reservoir; therefore, the new swim/splash area would have no impact on water quality.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative could change the locations of some grazing areas and could increase the total
grazing area by 0.3 acre. The changes to the grazing areas would not be located within the
reservoir’s watershed, so grazing in those areas would not affect reservoir water quality. Also,
the relatively small increase in grazing acreage would not adversely affect water quality and
hydrology beyond the existing effects of this activity. Therefore, livestock grazing would have
no impact on water quality and hydrology beyond the existing effects of this activity. These
effects would be similar to the grazing effects under the No Action Alternative.
Facility Improvements

Under this alternative, a storm water retention basin may be built to improve the quality of water
carried by the Regional Park’s storm drain system before it reaches the reservoir. This would
have a beneficial impact on reservoir water quality that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
Construction Activities

This alternative would include construction of new, expanded, or renovated facilities and
supporting infrastructure that would not occur under the No Action Alternative. This alternative
may also include drainage improvements to sports field 3. Construction activities and drainage
improvements can affect water quality through erosion and sedimentation, a temporary increase
in turbidity due to runoff from construction areas, or inadvertent spilling of construction-related
chemicals. However, this alternative includes a management action requiring a focused sitespecific assessment of any potential impact on water quality when specific construction activities
are proposed. If required by Federal regulations, the local managing partner(s) proposing a
construction activity would submit a plan that identifies the sources of sediment and other
pollutants on site and ensures the reduction of such pollutants in stormwater discharged from the
construction site. The plan will provide descriptions of BMPs selected to control erosion,
sediment discharge, turbidity, and other pollutant sources during construction. If appropriate
needed, BMPs would be implemented prior to construction and would be continued through the
duration of construction activities. This management action would ensure that construction
activities and drainage improvements would result in minor adverse effects on water quality.
These effects would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

Under this alternative, the volume of water pumped from the reservoir for irrigation of the
Regional Park might be increased from 100 acre-feet per year to 150 acre-feet per year. This
water would be purchased from CCWD if the requested water is available.
Because the additional water would be drawn from the reservoir, it would have the same water
quality as the reservoir water and therefore, would have no impact on the water quality of the
reservoir. CCWD uses the reservoir in combination with other raw water storage supplies to
meet peak summer demand. The net reservoir drawdown of 50 acre-feet would be withdrawn
from the reservoir gradually over a 3-4 month period of time during the summer irrigation

4-43 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

season. It should also be noted that some of the irrigation water not lost to evaporation or
evapotranspiration would return to the reservoir via surface flow and subsurface seepage. CCWD
would be responsible for reviewing the request for additional water, and would only approve the
request if sufficient water is available. Because CCWD would only provide additional water to
the Regional Park if it is available, the provision of increased raw water would have a minor
impact on water supplies that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.7.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Human Use and Waste Disposal

This alternative would include more expanded recreation opportunities than the other two
alternatives which could result in more visitor use. Increased visitation would increase the
potential for water quality impacts caused by unauthorized human contact with the reservoir;
generation and disposal of solid, human, and domestic animal waste; trail and road use; and
introduction of non-native zebra and quagga mussels into the reservoir. As discussed in Section
4.7.3, the proposed management actions would ensure that these impacts are minor.
This alternative may include expanding the size and capacity of the swim lagoon. However, the
swim lagoon is hydrologically separated from the reservoir, ensuring that water from the lagoon
does not enter the reservoir. Because the enlarged portion of the swim lagoon would also be
separated from the reservoir, it would have no impact on water quality.
This alternative may introduce overnight group camping to the Regional Park on a discretionary
basis as part of the current day camp programs or other special events. Group camping would
require event-specific authorization, oversight, and regulation by the Regional Park’s local
managing partner to ensure protection of the park’s facilities and natural resources, including
water quality. As with all of the alternatives, body contact with the reservoir would remain
highly restricted to protect the reservoir’s domestic water supply. Because camping would be
discretionary and would receive oversight from the Regional Park’s local managing partner, and
because body contact restrictions would continue to be enforced, adverse impacts to water
quality from overnight group camping would be minor. These impacts would not occur under the
No Action Alternative.
Livestock Grazing

In addition to the changes described in Section 4.7.5, this alternative may include the addition of
two new sports fields within the Community Park and expansion of the Community Park
boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would be excluded from this area
(approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. Therefore, this alternative could reduce the
amount of grazing area within Contra Loma. This area is not located within the reservoir’s
watershed, so elimination of grazing in this area would not affect reservoir water quality.
Reducing grazing in this area could have a minor beneficial effect on the water quality of
receiving waters that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Facility Improvements

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.7.5.

4-44 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Construction Activities

This alternative would include construction of new infrastructure and facility improvements in
addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Therefore, this alternative would have more potential to adversely affect water resources from
construction activities than the other alternatives would. Similar to the Enhanced Recreation and
Facilities Alternative, however, this alternative includes a management action requiring a
focused site-specific assessment of any potential impact on water quality when specific
construction activities are proposed, preparation of a construction stormwater plan, and
implementation of water quality BMPs as appropriate. This management action would ensure
that construction activities and drainage improvements would result in minor adverse effects on
water quality. These effects would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.7.5.
4.7.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses, increasing the potential for water quality impacts.
Human Use and Waste Disposal

Increased visitation would increase the potential for unauthorized human contact with the
reservoir, would increase the volume of solid, human, and domestic animal (e.g., dogs and
horses) waste generated within the recreation area, would increase trail and road use, and would
increase the potential for reservoir infestation by non-native zebra and quagga mussels. The two
action alternatives would have greater potential for this effect than the No Action Alternative.
However, body contact restrictions on reservoir use would ensure that potential adverse impacts
to water quality due to bodily contact would be minimal, litter and waste reduction programs
would continue to be implemented to effectively meet demand, restroom facilities would
continue to be inspected and maintained at regular intervals, the local managing partners(s)
would continue to support and complement CCWD’s programs to prevent zebra and quagga
mussel infestation, prohibitions on public use of gasoline-powered engines on the reservoir
would continue, the local managing partner(s) would continue to provide plastic waste bags in
various locations and encourage dog owners to dispose of dog waste in garbage cans, and the
local managing partner(s) would continue to manage and maintain the trail and road system in a

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

manner that maintains proper drainage and controls erosion and chemical runoff. For these
reasons, the cumulative effect on water quality from increased human use would be minor.
Facility Improvements and Construction Activities

About 350 acres of the 741-acre recreation area drains to the Contra Loma Reservoir, and the
remainder drains elsewhere. The reservoir’s total watershed is about 680 acres. About half of its
watershed lies within Regional Park and nearly all of the remainder is located in EBRPD’s Black
Diamond Mines Regional Preserve located adjacent to the southern boundary of Contra Loma.
No foreseeable land use changes or other activities are expected to occur within Black Diamond
Mines Regional Preserve that would substantially alter the water quality of the reservoir or its
watershed. The RMP, therefore, would not contribute to a cumulative impact on the water
quality of the reservoir or its watershed.
As discussed above, certain RMP activities could have minor impacts on water quality. Some of
those activities would occur within the areas located outside the reservoir’s watershed, which
drain either toward the municipal reservoir at the golf course, the Contra Costa Canal, or the City
storm drain system. Development needed to accommodate project regional population growth
could also impair the water quality of the receiving waters. For example, erosion and inadvertent
chemical spills from construction activities could pollute these waters. Also, increased
urbanization would increase the amount of fertilizers, pesticides, and other pollutants washed
into streams by storm events and other means. These related activities could cumulatively affect
the water quality of receiving waters.
As discussed above, RMP management actions would protect water quality and ensure that RMP
activities result in only minor impacts on water quality. In addition, the City’s General Plan
includes policies to protect water quality from contaminated runoff. These measures include
working with the Contra Costa County Flood Control District to ensure that runoff from new
development is adequately handled; requiring new developments to provide erosion and
sedimentation control measures to protect water quality; requiring implementation of BMPs in
the design of drainage systems to reduce discharge of nonpoint source pollutants originating in
streets, parking lots, paved industrial work areas, and open spaces involved with pesticide
applications; requiring the implementation of BMPs to minimize erosion and sedimentation
resulting from new development; opposing proposals with the potential to increase the salinity of
the Delta; and, participating in the Contra Costa Clean Water program to reduce stormwater
pollution and protect the water quality of the City’s waterways (City of Antioch 2003a). The
County’s General Plan also includes policies to protect water quality including identification and
control of point sources of pollution to protect beneficial uses of water; cooperating with other
regulatory agencies to control point and non-point water pollution sources to protect beneficial
uses of water; requiring that grading, filling and construction activity near watercourses be
conducted in a manner that minimizes impacts from increased runoff, erosion, sedimentation,
biochemical degradation, or thermal pollution; preserving watersheds and groundwater recharge
areas by avoiding the placement of potential pollution sources in areas with high percolation
rates; discouraging runoff of pollutants and siltation into marsh and wetland areas from outfalls
serving nearby urban development; encouraging public ownership of lands bordering reservoirs
to safeguard water quality; and, taking an active role in reviewing regional, State, and Federal
programs that could affect water quality (Contra Costa County 2005).

4-46 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

The RMP management actions to protect water quality, City and County water quality protection
policies, and project specific compliance with applicable water quality regulations would ensure
that cumulative water quality impacts would be minor.
4.7.8

Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.8
4.8.1

Vegetation
Types of Impacts

Vegetation communities within Contra Loma have been classified according to habitat types
defined by the CWHR System (California Department of Fish and Game 2011). These habitat
types include annual grassland, blue oak woodland, valley foothill riparian, fresh emergent
wetland, riverine, lacustrine, urban, and barren. Inasmuch as the classification of barren is
defined as the absence of vegetation due to hardscape such as paving, sidewalks, curbs, and
gravel roads and parking lots, impacts to vegetation within this category are considered
inconsequential and no further discussion of impacts to this habitat type is needed.
Potential impacts to vegetation resources could result from seven general types of activities:
•

Wildland Fire

•

Protection or Conservation of Special Status Plant Species

•

Human Use at Public Sites and Trails

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Introduction of Invasive Species

•

Construction Related Surface Disturbance (Temporary or Permanent)

•

Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

Impacts to vegetation can be direct, as in the case of trampling or removing rooted vegetation as
a part of construction activities, or may be indirect, as in the case of introduction of invasive
weeds by various vectors.
4.8.2

Assumptions

The vegetation resources impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing protection of special-status plants and upland and wetland plant communities.

4-47 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

Reclamation and the managing partner(s) would continue to manage, protect, and restore
Contra Loma’s vegetation resources in a manner consistent with current management
trends as articulated in existing management and policy documents and ordinances.

•

The local managing partner(s) would implement BMPs to protect vegetation from
chemical spills or other storm-water runoff pollutants.

4.8.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Wildland Fire

Wildland fire can have temporary negative impacts on annual grasslands, especially native
bunchgrasses and special status plants. However, wildland fire was commonly employed by
Native Americans in the coastal prairies of California to enhance wildlife habitat. California’s
native coastal prairies have adapted to this historic occasional fire regime. Thus, occasional
grassland fire does not necessarily lead to lasting negative impacts on native grasslands. In
Contra Loma, occasional grassland fires may have a beneficial impact by controlling certain
noxious weeds, most notably star thistle.
The risk of catastrophic wildland fire in Contra Loma is low because existing wildland fire
management facilities provided by the CCCFPD are maintained at high response levels near
Contra Loma, with 2 stations located within 1.5 miles. The current local managing partner for the
Regional Park also provides backup fire suppression with satellite stations and a wildland fire
truck located at the southern park boundary. Included in all RMP alternatives are management
actions that require the local managing partner(s) to meet the anticipated demand for fire
suppression services. The managing partner(s) would either implement fire preparedness plans
for the Regional Park and the Community Park or would contract the provision of police and fire
services to other local agencies. Wildland fire risk is further reduced because the management
actions common to all alternatives would include periodic mowing and livestock grazing of the
grassland areas to reduce fire hazard. Vegetation fire risk within the developed areas of Contra
Loma is very low due to the scarcity of dry vegetation and the predominance of landscaped or
wetland vegetation types.
Under all management alternatives, the potential temporary negative impacts of wildland fire on
vegetation resources in Contra Loma would be moderated by the potential long term beneficial
impacts of isolated or occasional wildland fire.
Protection or Conservation of Special Status Plant Species

Under all RMP alternatives, the local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park would continue
to perform periodic biological surveys to inventory and assess special-status plant and wildlife
species. Known populations of special status plants in Contra Loma are limited to stinkbells,
which are located adjacent to one trail in the northwest corner of Contra Loma. Effects on the
native vegetation resources resulting from special status plant conservation and protection, as
called for in the management actions, is expected to be beneficial.
4.8.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Wildland Fire

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.8.3.
4-48 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Protection or Conservation of Special Status Plant Species

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.8.3.
Human Use at Public Sites and Trails

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the
alternatives. This increased visitation would predominantly be in the developed portions of
Contra Loma such as the picnic areas, fishing access areas, and sports fields which currently
experience the most visitor use. Additional use of these areas could increase the potential for
trampling of sensitive habitats near the developed areas (e.g., wetland and riparian habitat)
should visitors venture into them for fishing access or other purposes. Trampling can damage
vegetation through direct contact and by increased soil compaction or erosion that can impair
plant growth. However, environmental conditions such as the density of vegetation, soil moisture
(i.e., muddy) conditions, and the risk of contact with insects, blackberry prickles, or poison oak
reduce the attractiveness of entering these areas, thereby reducing the potential for trampling of
sensitive habitats.
The trails in the undeveloped portions of Contra Loma would also receive increased visitation,
although in fewer numbers than the developed areas. The trails in the undeveloped areas now
pass through annual grasslands and provide access to areas supporting other vegetation types
(e.g., wetlands, riparian, oak woodland). Increased pedestrian traffic on these trails could
increase foot traffic within the annual grassland in the vicinity of the trails causing increased soil
compaction and erosion that could impair the growth of the grassland species. Trail users can
also damage other vegetation types (e.g., wetlands, riparian, oak woodland) by trampling them
when poor trail conditions (e.g., muddy or eroded sections) cause them to leave the trail to
bypass the problem sections or when venturing off the trail for other reasons. Increased visitation
would increase the potential for trampling; however visitors are less likely to leave trails adjacent
to wetlands due to the density of vegetation and soil moisture conditions.
RMP management actions would require the local managing partner(s) to manage and maintain
the trails, thereby reducing the likelihood of visitors leaving the trails to avoid poor trail
conditions. These management actions, and the fact that existing trails have been routed to avoid
direct incursion into sensitive habitats would reduce but not eliminate the likelihood of
trampling.
Impacts on vegetation caused by human use are expected to be similar to existing conditions, but
increased visitation would incrementally increase the potential for vegetation impacts.
Livestock Grazing

Unmanaged grazing can contribute to degradation of vegetation through excessive trampling,
soil erosion, sedimentation, and over-harvest. As discussed below (Introduction of Invasive
Species), however, livestock grazing can control the growth of non-native grasses and herbs.
Grazing would likely continue under all management alternatives, subject to a Reclamationapproved grazing management plan prepared by the managing partner(s). Under this alternative,
no change in the acreage, location, or intensity of grazing would occur. Therefore, the overall
effect of livestock grazing on vegetation would be similar to current conditions.

4-49 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Introduction of Invasive Species

Reconnaissance surveys conducted in 2010 and 2011 identified 23 invasive and/or noxious nonnative plant species occurring at Contra Loma. None of these plants are listed as noxious weeds
in accordance with Section 2814 of the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974; however, they are
rated as noxious or invasive by either the CDFA or Cal-IPC. Invasive plant species can threaten
or disrupt native vegetation species and communities by altering nutrient and hydrologic cycles,
increasing fire hazard, creating changes in sediment deposition and erosion, displacing native
species, or hybridizing with native species. Invasive plant species can spread via natural
dispersion, or they can be spread by humans, horses, livestock, or vehicles.
The RMP includes management actions requiring the local managing partners(s) for the Regional
Park to continue implementation of pesticide management plans and IPM plans for weeds, which
are subject to review and approval by Reclamation prior to implementation.
The current grazing practices at Contra Loma may also serve to successfully control some
species of invasive grasses and other weeds, including oat species, bromes, ryegrass, and
burclover. Livestock grazing can control the growth of non-native grasses and herbs so that other
desirable plants (e.g., wildflowers, native grasses) can regenerate and coexist with them (East
Bay Regional Park District 2012a). Grazing can favor native annual forbs and can control nonnative species (Immel et al. 2012). Under this alternative, no change in the acreage, location, or
intensity of grazing would occur and grazing would likely continue under all RMP alternatives,
subject to a Reclamation-approved grazing management plan prepared by the managing
partner(s). The grazing management plan would address means to control the introduction of
invasive plants when livestock first enter a grazing area or are moved from one grazing area to
another within Contra Loma. Therefore, the effect of livestock grazing on control of non-native
species would be similar to current conditions.
4.8.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Wildland Fire

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.8.3.
Protection or Conservation of Special Status Plant Species

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.8.3.
Human Use at Public Sites and Trails

The impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.8.4; however, this alternative
would include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the public’s enjoyment
and use of Contra Loma. This alternative would likely attract more visitors than the No Action
Alternative, thereby increasing the potential for human use to impact vegetation.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative could increase the total grazing area by 0.3 acre. This small change in grazing
area would incrementally increase the potential for degradation of vegetation as compared to the
No Action Alternative, resulting in a minor adverse impact.

4-50 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Introduction of Invasive Species

The impacts are similar to those addressed in Section 4.8.4; however, this alternative could
increase the total grazing area by 0.3 acre as compared to the No Action Alternative. This small
change in grazing area would incrementally increase the potential for introduction of invasive
species, resulting in a minor adverse impact.
Construction Related Surface Disturbances (Temporary or Permanent)

This alternative would include construction of new, enhanced, or renovated facilities and
supporting infrastructure that would not be built under the No Action Alternative. Most
construction proposed under this alternative is expected to be on sites that are already altered or
developed, in areas where a vegetation component is either entirely lacking or has been replaced
by hardscape (i.e. barren), or in areas that are urban in nature. The management action to provide
drainage improvements to sports field 3 includes a provision to minimize the effects on the
adjacent riparian habitat caused by placement of fill, removal of vegetation, transport of
chemicals and fertilizers, or changes in hydrology.
This alternative potentially includes some construction on undisturbed or unoccupied sites,
including the construction of a new park residence near the park office and a new fueling station
and fuel storage tank.
New construction can cause impacts to vegetation from vegetation removal on the structure
footprint, from ground disturbance due to equipment operations, or from covering due to spoils
deposition or erosion and siltation. Most of the affected vegetation is expected to be non-native
annual grassland. Management Action 53 provides that future improvements should be
consistent with laws and regulations that govern the protection of natural resources. However,
this provision alone would not necessarily prevent impacts without specific knowledge of the
risk to wetlands, potentially present rare plants, or other sensitive vegetation for each
construction site. Incorporation of Mitigation Measures Vegetation-1 and Vegetation-2 (Section
4.8.8) within this alternative would reduce impacts to the no impact or minor impact level. These
impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

Under this alternative, reservoir water pumping for irrigation of vegetation within developed
areas may be increased from 100 acre-feet per year to 150 acre-feet per year. The additional
irrigation can be expected to have a beneficial impact on vegetation resources in developed areas
of Contra Loma, including managed landscaping.
The increase in irrigation water of 50 acre-feet would represent a net additional reservoir
drawdown of approximately one foot, occurring most likely during the hot months of July and
August. The additional reservoir drawdown would cause a small decrease in the reservoir’s
wetted perimeter adjacent to existing wetland vegetation at the reservoir high water mark,
resulting in a minor impact to wetland vegetation resources that would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.

4.8.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Wildland Fire

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.8.3.
Protection or Conservation of Special Status Plant Species

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.8.3.
Human Use at Public Sites and Trails

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the
public’s enjoyment and use of Contra Loma beyond those of the other two alternatives. This
alternative would likely attract more visitors than the other two alternatives, thereby increasing
the potential for human use to impact vegetation.
This alternative may also include expanding the trail system for hiking, equestrian, and bicycle
use, and allowing bicycle use on existing trails not currently open to bicycles. Expansion of the
trail system would improve access to certain areas of Contra Loma beyond those already
accessible by trail. Therefore, trail system expansion may increase the potential for trampling of
vegetation communities. RMP management actions would require the local managing partner(s)
to manage and maintain the trails and to implement future improvements in a manner that is
consistent with laws and regulations that govern the protection of natural resources. This
alternative also includes an interpretive signage and education program intended to both instill an
appreciation of the region’s natural resources and motivate conservation of natural resources.
Despite these measures, however, this alternative may result in a major adverse impact on
vegetation resources resulting from increased human use at public sites and trails. With
incorporation of Mitigation Measures Vegetation-3 and Vegetation-4 (Section 4.8.8) into this
alternative, human use impacts would be reduced to a minor level. These impacts would not
occur under the No Action Alternative.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park
and expansion of the Community Park boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would
be excluded from this area (approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. Therefore, this
alternative could reduce the amount of grazing area within Contra Loma and the potential for
degradation of vegetation. This would result in a minor beneficial impact that would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.
Introduction of Invasive Species

The impacts are similar to those addressed in Section 4.8.4; however, this alternative could
reduce the grazing area by 15 acres, thereby reducing the potential for introduction of invasive
species. This would result in a beneficial impact that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
Construction Related Surface Disturbances (Temporary or Permanent)

This alternative would include construction of new infrastructure and facility improvements in
addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
4-52 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Therefore, this alternative would have more potential for construction activities to adversely
affect vegetation resources than the other alternatives. New facilities under this alternative could
include an anglers’ shelter along the south or east reservoir shore, a fitness course along the
shoreline trail loop, a disc golf course, and additional multi-use sports fields directly south of the
two existing sports fields which would include additional parking. Some or all of these facilities
could potentially be constructed on previously undisturbed sites with grassland vegetation, or
adjacent to sensitive riparian or wetland vegetation. New construction can cause impacts to
vegetation from vegetation removal on the structure footprint, from ground disturbance due to
equipment operations, or from covering due to spoils deposition or erosion and siltation.
Management actions would serve to lessen potential impacts. Despite these measures, however,
this alternative may result in a major adverse impact on vegetation resources resulting from new
construction. Incorporation of Mitigation Measures Vegetation-1 and Vegetation-2 within this
alternative would reduce impacts to the no impact or minor impact level. These impacts would
not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.8.5.
4.8.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses, increasing the potential for regional impacts on vegetation.
Wildland Fire

Increased visitation to Contra Loma could increase the potential for accidental wildland fires to
start. However, the potential temporary negative impacts of wildland fire on vegetation resources
in Contra Loma would be moderated by the potential long term beneficial impacts of isolated or
occasional wildland fire. Increased visitation, therefore, would have a minor cumulative effect
with respect to wildland fires.
Human Use at Public Sites and Trails

Visitation to Contra Loma would increase under all of the alternatives, with more visitation
expected under the two action alternatives than the No Action Alternative. Regional population
growth would further increase visitation to Contra Loma and the addition of flood lights to sports
fields 4 and 5 will increase nighttime visitation to the Community Park. This cumulative increase

4-53 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

in visitation would result in greater potential for trampling of vegetation and the spread of
invasive weeds.
As discussed in Sections 4.8.4 and 4.8.5, the No Action and Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
alternatives would result in minor adverse effects on trampling of vegetation and all three
alternatives would result in minor adverse effects on the spread of invasive weeds. Increased
visitation is expected to cause minor cumulative impacts. Increased development from buildout
of the City and County general plans could facilitate introduction and spread of invasive weeds,
contributing to this cumulative adverse effect.
Because the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include expansion of the trail
system and would generate more visitation than the other two alternatives, it would contribute
more to this adverse cumulative impact than the other two alternatives. As discussed in Section
4.8.6, the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would result in a major adverse impact
with respect to trampling of vegetation. Increased visitation could have a major cumulative
impact. With incorporation of Mitigation Measures Vegetation-3 and Vegetation-4 (Section
4.8.8) into this alternative, cumulative human use impacts would be reduced to a minor level.
Construction Related Surface Disturbance (Temporary or Permanent)

The two action alternatives would include construction of new, enhanced, expanded or renovated
facilities and would, therefore, result in vegetation removal. The Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative would remove the most vegetation. The improvements to sports fields 4
and 5 would replace several acres of annual grassland with artificial turf. Development needed to
accommodate the projected regional population growth would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urban uses. Such development would remove a substantial amount of native and
non-native vegetation, increasing habitat fragmentation. These actions could result in major
adverse cumulative impacts on vegetation.
As discussed above, RMP management actions and Mitigation Measures Vegetation-1 through
Vegetation-4 would protect Contra Loma’s vegetation, especially sensitive plant communities,
and ensure that RMP activities result in only minor impacts to vegetation. In addition, the City’s
General Plan includes policies to preserve sensitive habitats and habitats supporting rare and
endangered species of plants. The County’s General Plan includes policies to preserve and
enhance areas important for the maintenance of natural vegetation and wildlife populations.
These management actions, mitigation measures, and general plan policies would reduce
cumulative impacts on vegetation.
4.8.8

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure Vegetation-1: Perform wetland delineations for construction related
impacts to wetland and riparian vegetation communities.

When specific construction activities are proposed, site-specific environmental analysis would be
conducted that would include a more focused assessment of any potential impact on vegetation
resources. If deemed necessary by Reclamation, the local managing partner(s) proposing a
construction activity will perform a delineation of wetland and riparian vegetation of all areas
potentially affected by temporary or permanent construction-related activities. The delineation
will fully describe all areas classified as Waters of the U.S. (Federal Clean Water Act). Feasible

4-54 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

mitigation shall be proposed for any temporary or permanent losses of wetlands or for any
wetland or riparian vegetation communities impacted. Such project-specific mitigation could
include impact avoidance, minimization or compensatory measures, or a combination thereof.
Mitigation Measure Vegetation-2: Perform protocol level surveys for presence of specialstatus plants.

When specific construction activities are proposed, site-specific environmental analysis would be
conducted that would include a more focused assessment of any potential impact on vegetation
resources. If deemed necessary by Reclamation, the local managing partner(s) proposing a
construction activity will perform protocol level surveys for the presence of special-status plants.
The surveys will follow protocols as directed by Reclamation, which may elect to use
standardized protocols, and may include those developed by CDFW. The surveys shall propose
feasible mitigation for any temporary or permanent losses of special-status plants. Such projectspecific mitigation could include impact avoidance, minimization or compensatory measures, or
a combination thereof.
Mitigation Measure Vegetation-3: Incorporate signage along equestrian and bicycle trails
to prevent horses and bicycles from leaving trails.

All new or expanded trails proposed under the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative,
and any expansion of equestrian or bicycle use on existing trails as proposed under this
alternative, shall incorporate signage at reasonable intervals (subject to Reclamation approval)
prescribing no equestrian or bicycle use off established trails.
Mitigation Measure Vegetation-4: Route any new trails to avoid sensitive vegetation
communities, and provide for an educational leaflet program.

All new trails or trail connectors proposed under the Expanded Recreation and Facilities
Alternative shall be routed to provide a minimum 50 foot buffer from wetland and riparian
communities, quail restoration areas, and known rare plant communities. Additionally, if new
trails, trail connectors, or expanded facilities are proposed within 100 feet of such vegetation
communities, an educational leaflet program will be developed to provide information to the
public on the sensitive nature of the vegetation communities adjacent to the proposed trail or
improvement and to encourage users to limit human disturbance within and adjacent to such
sensitive areas. The leaflets will be available at each visitor kiosk at the park entrances and from
leaflet stands where trails leave parking areas, and adjacent to wetland and riparian vegetation
communities.

Wildlife
Type of Impacts

A wide variety of reptile, amphibian, mammal and bird species are known to or highly likely to
be present in Contra Loma, as described in Section 3.10.1.
Potential impacts to wildlife resources could result from five general types of activities:

Wildland Fire

•

Human Use

•

Impacts to wildlife under the RMP can be direct impacts to wildlife populations or individuals
resulting from direct mortality or displacement, or may be indirect impacts due to habitat
removal or alteration. Impacts can also be temporary or permanent.
4.9.2

Assumptions

The wildlife resources impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing protection of special status wildlife and upland and wetland wildlife habitats.

•

Reclamation and the managing partner(s) will continue to manage, protect, and restore
Contra Loma’s wildlife resources consistent with current management trends as
articulated in existing management and policy documents and ordinances.

4.9.3

Impacts Common to All Alternatives

Wildland Fire

Wildland fire can have temporary negative impacts on wildlife through initial mortality and by
removal or reduction of annual grassland habitat. However, as described in Section 4.8.3,
California coastal prairies have adapted to historic occasional fire regimes as commonly
employed by Native Americans. Thus occasional grassland fire would not necessarily lead to
lasting negative impacts on wildlife from habitat loss.
The risk of catastrophic wildland fire in Contra Loma is low because existing wildland fire
management facilities provided by CCCFPD are maintained at high response levels near Contra
Loma, with 2 stations located within 1.5 miles. EBRPD also provides backup fire suppression
with satellite stations and a wildland fire truck located at the southern park boundary. The
managing partners would be expected to continue to provide these services under all
management alternatives. Wildland fire risk is further reduced because management actions
common to all alternatives would perform periodic mowing and continue livestock grazing of the
grassland areas adjacent to trails to reduce fire hazard and implement plans for fire and
emergency preparedness. The risk of fire which can be damaging to wildlife within the
developed areas of Contra Loma is very low due to the scarcity of dry vegetation and the
predominance of landscaped or wetland vegetation types. Thus, under all management
alternatives, wildland fire would have minor effects on wildlife resources in Contra Loma.

4-56 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

4.9.4

Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative

Wildland Fire

Impacts would be the same as those described in Section 4.9.3.
Human Use

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the
alternatives. Increased visitation would result in more pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian traffic
on trails, causing an increase of human disturbance to wildlife which relies on adjacent habitats
such as annual grasslands, upland riparian, blue oak woodland, and wetlands. Increased traffic on
trails may disturb wildlife from noise impacts or simply from human presence. Similar to
existing conditions, however, the additional visitors would tend to be concentrated in the
developed portions of Contra Loma such as the picnic areas, swim lagoon, fishing access areas,
and sports fields. In undeveloped portions of Contra Loma, visitation increases are expected to
be more modest. Hikers on trails in the undeveloped areas through grasslands and near wetland
or riparian habitats are less likely to cause sustained loud noise more commonly associated with
high use recreational amenities such as the swim lagoon, picnic areas, and sports fields. Hence,
impacts to wildlife from increased noise or human presence on trails would be minor.
Wildlife can be affected by direct conflict with maintenance equipment, disturbance from
equipment noise, and contact with inadvertent hazardous materials spills. Increased visitation
would increase the need for operation and maintenance activities by the managing partner(s)
over existing conditions. This could incrementally increase the potential for these activities to
adversely affect wildlife. Operation and maintenance activities would need to be coordinated
with programs implemented to protect special status species. Management actions call for the
local managing partners(s) to perform ongoing routine maintenance activities and repairs of the
existing facilities that would not involve ground-disturbance or otherwise have the potential to
cause significant environmental effects. The incremental increase in the potential for these
activities to adversely affect wildlife would result in a minor adverse impact.
Increased trail use could also increase the potential for visitors to leave the trail and investigate
sensitive habitats, especially wetland or riparian habitats. Therefore, increased trail use could
increase the potential for visitors to affect wildlife through incidental harassment or disturbance,
or displacement due to trampling of sensitive habitats, especially wetlands. Impacts could also
result from increased introduction of exotic species related to increased human traffic. The
expected visitation increase would incrementally increase the potential for wildlife disturbance,
resulting in a minor adverse impact.
In developed high activity areas of Contra Loma adjacent to sensitive wetland and riparian
wildlife habitats, existing trails have been routed to avoid direct incursion into such areas.
Visitors are unlikely to leave trails adjacent to wetlands due to the density of vegetation, soil
moisture (i.e., muddy) conditions, and the risk of contact with insects, blackberry prickles, or
poison oak. These environmental conditions would continue to reduce the attractiveness of
entering these areas, thereby reducing the potential for wildlife disturbance and resulting in a
minor adverse impact.

The local managing partner(s) for the Regional Park would continue to perform periodic
biological surveys to inventory and assess special-status plant and wildlife species, and would
continue to develop and implement programs to protect special-status species likely to occur at
the park. Such programs would be coordinated with operation and maintenance programs and
would be consistent with the RMP goals of protecting and enhancing natural resources and
maintaining the natural setting of Contra Loma. Thus, increases in human use would cause only
minor impacts to wildlife.
Livestock Grazing

Livestock grazing controls the growth of non-native grasses and herbs so that other desirable
native grasses can regenerate and coexist with them (East Bay Regional Park District 2012a).
This serves to maintain the condition of native wildlife habitat within the annual grasslands.
Grazing would likely continue under all management alternatives, subject to a Reclamationapproved grazing management plan prepared by the managing partner(s). Grazing in Contra
Loma is currently limited to cattle; however, other species (e.g., sheep, goats) could be permitted
subject to the grazing management plan. Potential impacts on wildlife habitat may be less for
sheep or goats than cattle due to their smaller weight and size per animal unit, as they have
smaller impacts on soils and vegetation, particularly when soils are damp (Oregon State
University, 2013). Conversely sheep are able to browse closer to the soil surface, potentially
resulting in greater damage to soils and the root zone than cattle. Relative impacts and merits of
grazing different livestock species would need to be considered during preparation of the grazing
management plan. Although unmanaged grazing can contribute to degradation of grassland
wildlife habitat through excessive trampling and soil erosion, a well-managed grazing program
within the annual grasslands of Contra Loma would have positive effects on wildlife resources.
Under this alternative, no change in the acreage, location, or intensity of grazing would occur.
Therefore, the overall effect of livestock grazing on wildlife would be similar to current
conditions.
4.9.5

Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Wildland Fire

Impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed in
Section 4.9.3.
Human Use

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.9.4; however, this alternative would
include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the public’s enjoyment and
use of Contra Loma. This alternative would likely attract more visitors and would require more
maintenance than the No Action Alternative, thereby increasing the potential for human use to
impact wildlife.
Livestock Grazing

The impacts are similar to those addressed in Section 4.9.4; however, this alternative could
increase the total grazing area by 0.3 acre. This small change in grazing area would
incrementally increase the potential for the positive effects on wildlife resources derived from a
well-managed grazing program. This would be a minor beneficial impact that would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.

4-58 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Construction Activities

This alternative would include construction of new, expanded or renovated facilities and
supporting infrastructure that would not occur under the No Action Alternative. Most
construction proposed by this alternative is on altered or developed sites, within areas where
habitat is either urban in nature and thus of limited value to wildlife or entirely lacking due to
replacement by hardscape (i.e., barren). Consequently there would be no impact to wildlife from
expanded or renovated facilities in areas of urban or barren habitat.
This alternative may include some new construction on undisturbed or unoccupied sites,
including the construction of a new park residence near the park office. Underground utility
extensions to provide renovated water and sewer line and communications facilities could also
be constructed on undisturbed sites.
New construction and related ground disturbing activity can cause impacts to wildlife from direct
mortality or habitat removal due to equipment operations, overcovering by placement of spoils,
or erosion. If special status birds such as burrowing owl are nesting within the area of
construction impacts, their potential resulting mortality or reproductive failure would be a major
impact. Similarly, if special status wildlife such as San Joaquin kit fox occupy the construction
site or its margins, their potential mortality or displacement would be considered a major impact.
If new construction were to result in take of Federally-listed species, formal consultation with the
FWS would be required.
Management Action 53 provides that future improvements should be consistent with laws and
regulations that govern the protection of natural resources. However, this provision alone would
not necessarily prevent impacts, lacking specific knowledge of the risk to nesting birds or other
special status wildlife for each construction site. Incorporation of Mitigation Measures Wildlife-1
and Wildlife-2 (Section 4.9.8) into this alternative would reduce impacts to a no impact or minor
impact level. These impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

Under this alternative, reservoir water pumping for landscape irrigation within developed areas
may be increased from 100 acre-feet per year to 150 acre-feet per year. This increase would not
occur under the No Action Alternative. The additional irrigation would have a positive impact on
the urban habitat component in developed areas of Contra Loma, and hence may have a small
positive impact on wildlife there. The additional irrigation of managed landscaping may also
help maintain the hydrology of certain wetland and stream corridor wildlife habitats that receive
runoff from the landscaped areas. Conversely, fertilizers and pesticides applied to non-native
landscape plantings could be transported to aquatic habitats by the additional landscape irrigation
and adversely affect wildlife and aquatic resources. Management actions requiring preparation of
non-aquatic pesticide management plans and consistency with laws and regulations protecting
natural resources would be implemented; therefore, the additional landscape irrigation would not
result in major impacts on wildlife resources.
The increase in irrigation water of 50 acre-feet would represent a net additional reservoir
drawdown of approximately one foot, most likely occurring during the hot months of July and
August. The additional reservoir drawdown would cause a small decrease in the reservoir’s

wetted perimeter adjacent to existing wetland vegetation at the reservoir high water mark,
resulting in a minor impact to wildlife that benefit from wetland vegetation.
4.9.6

Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative

Wildland Fire

Impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed in
Section 4.9.3.
Human Use

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.9.5; however, this alternative would
include facility improvements and expansion of trail use that would increase the public’s
enjoyment and use of Contra Loma beyond those of the other two alternatives. This alternative
would likely attract more visitors than the other alternatives, thereby increasing the potential for
human use to impact wildlife.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park
and expansion of the Community Park boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would
be excluded from this area (approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. Therefore, this
alternative could reduce the amount of grazing area within Contra Loma. This reduction would
reduce the potential for the positive effects on wildlife resources derived from a well-managed
grazing program. This would be a minor adverse impact that would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
Construction Activities

This alternative would include construction of new infrastructure and facility improvements in
addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Therefore, this alternative would have more potential to adversely affect wildlife resources from
construction activities. New facilities under this alternative may include a fishermen's shelter
along the south or east reservoir shore, a fitness course along the shoreline trail loop, a disc golf
course, and additional multi-use sports fields directly south of the two existing sports fields,
including additional parking. This alternative also allows for underground utility extensions to
provide new water and sewer line and communications facilities, and new or expanded trails and
additional trail connectors to allow trail system looping. These facilities could either be
constructed on previously undisturbed sites with annual grassland habitat, or adjacent to sensitive
riparian, blue oak woodland or wetland wildlife habitats.
New construction and related ground disturbing activity can cause impacts to wildlife from direct
mortality or habitat removal due to equipment operations, overcovering by placement of spoils,
or erosion. If special status birds such as burrowing owl are nesting within the area of
construction impacts, their potential resulting mortality or reproductive failure would be a major
impact. Similarly, if special status wildlife such as San Joaquin kit fox occupy the construction
site or its margins, their potential mortality or displacement would be considered a major impact.
If new construction were to result in take of Federally-listed species, formal consultation with the
FWS would be required. Mitigation Measures Wildlife-1 and Wildlife-2 would reduce such
adverse impacts to the no impact or minor impact level.

4-60 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Construction of new trails to allow increased pedestrian, equestrian, and bicycle use may result
in increased impacts on adjacent habitats of special status wildlife. Existing trails generally are
routed to avoid sensitive habitats, however, new trails and trail connectors could be routed such
that unexpected stress on special status species results. New trails routed too close to sensitive
habitats could also result in an increased tendency for humans to venture into sensitive habitats.
Management Action 53 requires future improvements to be consistent with laws and regulations
that govern the protection of natural resources. Developing and implementing design and
construction BMPS that include minimizing the number of trail crossings of streams, wetlands,
and other sensitive habitats; providing clear span bridges, reinforced fords, or other small
crossing structures to minimize the direct effect of foot and bicycle traffic passing through the
sensitive habitats; revegetating sensitive habitat disturbed during the trail construction process;
and following project-specific conditions of any regulatory agency permits and approvals
required for the project would further lessen potential impacts on wildlife resources from
construction and use of new trails and connectors. This alternative may still result in a major
adverse impact on wildlife resources resulting from these activities. With incorporation of
Mitigation Measure Wildlife-3 into the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative (Section
4.9.8), impacts to wildlife resources would be minor. These impacts would not occur under the
No Action Alternative.
Increased Withdrawal of Reservoir Water

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.9.5.
4.9.7

Cumulative Impacts

Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses, increasing the potential for regional impacts on wildlife habitats.
Wildland Fire

Increased visitation to Contra Loma could increase the potential for accidental wildland fires to
start. However, the potential temporary negative impacts of wildland fire on wildlife resources in
Contra Loma would be moderated by the potential long term beneficial impacts of isolated or
occasional wildland fire. Increased visitation, therefore, would have a minor cumulative effect
with respect to wildland fires.

4-61 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Human Use

Visitation to Contra Loma would increase under all of the alternatives, with more visitation
expected under the two action alternatives than the No Action Alternative. Regional population
growth would further increase visitation to Contra Loma and the addition of flood lights to sports
fields 4 and 5 will increase nighttime visitation to the Community Park. This cumulative increase
in visitation would result in greater potential for effects on wildlife caused by disturbance from
human presence, maintenance activities, increased introduction of exotic species, and
displacement due to trampling of sensitive habitats. Because the Expanded Recreation and
Facilities Alternative may include expansion of the trail system and would generate more
visitation than the other two alternatives, it would contribute more to this cumulative impact than
the other two alternatives. For reasons similar to the RMP-specific impacts discussed above,
these cumulative effects are expected to be minor.
Construction Activities

The two action alternatives would include construction of new, enhanced, expanded or renovated
facilities and could, therefore, cause impacts to wildlife from direct mortality or habitat removal.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would involve the most new construction.
The improvements to sports fields 4 and 5 would replace several acres of annual grassland with
artificial turf. Development needed to accommodate the projected regional population growth
would convert a substantial amount of vacant land to urban uses. Such development would
remove a substantial amount of native and non-native vegetation, would increase habitat
fragmentation. These actions could have a major adverse cumulative effect on wildlife.
As discussed above, RMP management actions and Mitigation Measures Wildlife-1 through
Wildlife-3 would protect Contra Loma’s special-status wildlife species and their habitats and
reduce impacts from RMP activities to a no impact or minor impact level. In addition, the City’s
General Plan includes policies to preserve sensitive habitats and habitats supporting endangered
species of animals. The County’s General Plan includes policies to preserve and enhance areas
important for the maintenance of natural vegetation and wildlife populations. These management
actions, mitigation measures, and general plan policies would reduce cumulative impacts on
wildlife.
4.9.8

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure Wildlife-1: Perform nest surveys for construction related impacts to
special status birds within riparian, wetland, woodland, or grassland wildlife habitats or
their margins

When specific construction activities are proposed, a site-specific environmental analysis would
be conducted that includes a more focused assessment of the activity’s impact on special status
avian wildlife resources. If deemed necessary by Reclamation, the local managing partner(s)
proposing a construction activity will perform surveys for special status bird nests or burrows in
all areas potentially affected by temporary or permanent construction related activities. The
surveys will be conducted at times selected to target all special status bird species potentially
affected by a construction activity and shall propose feasible mitigation for any temporary or
permanent impacts to special status wildlife or reproductive success. Such project-specific
mitigation could include impact avoidance (which could include removal of nest materials prior

4-62 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

to the applicable reproductive cycle), minimization (which could include appropriate buffers),
compensatory measures, or a combination thereof that does not lead to take of migratory birds.
Mitigation Measure Wildlife-2: Perform protocol level surveys for presence of special
status wildlife species.

When specific construction activities are proposed, a site-specific environmental analysis would
be conducted that includes a more focused assessment of the activity’s impact on special status
wildlife resources. If deemed necessary by Reclamation, the local managing partner(s) proposing
a construction activity will perform protocol level surveys for presence of special status wildlife
species. The surveys shall propose feasible mitigation for any temporary or permanent losses of
special status wildlife species or their habitat. Such project-specific mitigation could include
impact avoidance, minimization or compensatory measures or a combination thereof.

Mitigation Measure Wildlife-3: Incorporate signage along equestrian and bicycle trails to
prevent horses and bicycles from leaving trails.

To protect special status wildlife species, all new or expanded trails and any expansion of
equestrian or bicycle use on existing trails shall incorporate signage adjacent to sensitive wildlife
habitats at reasonable intervals, subject to Reclamation approval, prescribing no equestrian or
bicycle use off established trails.

4.10 Fisheries
4.10.1 Type of Impacts

As described in Section 3.10.1, there are currently 20 known fish species, including eight species
of game fish, in Contra Loma Reservoir (Table 8, Chapter 3). Potential impacts to fishery
resources from implementation of the RMP could result from three factors or activities:
•

Fishing Pressure

•

Invasive or Exotic Species

•

Construction Activities

Fishery resource impacts under the RMP can be direct impacts to fish populations due to direct
mortality or displacement, or can be indirect impacts due to habitat manipulation such as
reservoir drawdown. Impacts can also be temporary or permanent in nature.
4.10.2 Assumptions

The fishery resources impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
pertaining to fishery resources and recreational sport fishing.

4-63 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

Reclamation and the managing partner(s) would continue to manage, protect, and restore
Contra Loma’s fishery resources consistent with current management trends as
articulated in existing management and policy documents and ordinances.

•

The risk of inadvertent introduction of fish species not known to be present in the
reservoir has been greatly reduced because of the recent completion of the Rock Slough
Fish Screen Project described in Section 3.11.1.

4.10.3 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Fishing Pressure

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the
alternatives. Fishing pressure can be expected to increase at rates similar to the increase in
overall visitation, due to the increased popularity of the Regional Park but also due to the
increased popularity of and demand for the unique recreational fishing opportunities that Contra
Loma provides.
Increased fishing pressure may result in overharvest of existing sport fishing stocks. This is often
a self-limiting effect, as fishing pressure tends to decrease in response to decreased angler
success. Nonetheless, in the case of put and take fisheries such as the reservoir’s trout and catfish
fisheries, overharvest could lead to spikes in populations of prey species such as threadfin shad
which can in turn upset fishery population balances. Fishing pressure for these species tends to
fluctuate consistent with the chances for success, so a quality put and take trout or catfish fishery
depends on meeting demand with adequate stocking rates. Trout and catfish plants at Contra
Loma have typically been scheduled to address existing demand, such that the fishery provides a
reasonable chance of success and remains popular. Management actions would serve to ensure
that planting rates would adequately keep pace with demand; hence the impact of increased trout
or catfish fishing pressure on the fishery resources of Contra Loma would have a minor adverse
impact.
Overharvest could also cause adverse impacts on the population of largemouth bass and
adversely affect the ability of this fishery resource to remain self-sustaining. Current regulations
allow anglers to harvest largemouth bass larger than 12 inches. Annual EBRPD monitoring
efforts over the last 10 years using electrofishing reveals moderate declines in overall bass
populations. Harvest rates of largemouth bass may be a contributing factor in these declines.
However, impaired reproductive success may have a much larger impact than harvest rates. A
recent increase in average largemouth bass size from under 10 inches to approximately 13 inches
(measured in fork length) coupled with the overall decrease in population during the 2007-2011
period indicates significantly fewer young fish are in the population, which suggests there has
been less successful reproduction or survival over this period. Low survival could be due to poor
conditions for fry survival as well as predation by other fish.
EBRPD encourages anglers to practice catch and release when fishing for bass through its
educational and press release literature available on-line, and with signs posted at fishing and
boat launching docks and at the lakeshore. EBRPD also requests anglers to report fishing success
and harvest rates upon exiting the park, using a “creel census” card issued with each daily fishing
permit (Alexander, pers. comm. 2012). These current practices are embodied in the RMP as

4-64 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

management actions common to all alternatives. Hence the intensity of increases in fishing
pressure over time and resulting potential for overharvesting of largemouth bass would have a
minor adverse impact on fishery resources.
Although less popular with most anglers than trout, catfish or bass, several other species of
panfish at Contra Loma provide an additional quality recreational fishery, including white and
black crappie, bluegill, and redear and green sunfish. Annual population surveys of these species
indicate a very viable self-sustaining fishery. Historic and current fishing pressure on these
species is relatively light, and there is no indication that overharvest has occurred. Management
actions common to all alternatives would insure that this fishery is monitored and remains viable
in spite of future increases in fishing pressure and harvest rates. Consequently, increased fishing
pressure over time would have a minor adverse impact on panfish populations under all RMP
alternatives.
Invasive or Exotic Species

Invasive or exotic species that could be introduced into Contra Loma Reservoir include various
species of bait fish or crayfish introduced by fishermen, zebra and quagga mussels potentially
introduced by water craft users, and introduction or proliferation of aquatic plants (macrophytes)
such as Eurasian milfoil and other pond weed species of the Potamogetonaceae family, and
various bulrush and cattail species. As noted in Section 4.10.2 above, the risk of introducing
exotic species into the reservoir from the Contra Costa Canal would be very low due to the
completion of the Rock Slough Fish Screen Project. The screen mesh is sufficiently small to
reduce the introduction of fish species from the canal.
Bait fish or crayfish when used in a reservoir as live bait can under certain circumstances become
established, upsetting population balances of desirable species. Increased use of the reservoir for
fishing would increase the potential for introduction of exotic or invasive species. Currently,
Ordinance 38 of the EBRPD does not allow the use of wet or live baits in any EBRPD reservoir,
except worms or nightcrawlers, whether from commercial sources, imported from other waters
or captured in Contra Loma Reservoir. RMP management actions would allow the Regional
Park’s managing partner(s) to implement similar restrictions, which would continue to reduce the
potential for introduction of exotic or invasive species. Additionally, management actions
common to all alternatives call for monitoring and annual electrofishing, which can be expected
to detect infestation of exotic or invasive species. Hence the increased risk of introduction of
exotic species of baitfish or crayfish into the reservoir from increased fishing would be a minor
impact.
Introduction of zebra and quagga mussels poses a major threat to the viability of the fisheries
resources of Contra Loma Reservoir, although none have been observed in the reservoir. Zebra
or quagga mussels have invaded other reservoirs in California and can have very detrimental and
disruptive effects on other resources and species (including fish), due to their explosive
reproductive capabilities, and their propensity to alter water chemistry and filter out important
food chain nutrients (Benson 2012). Currently, all vessels are subject to pre-launch inspections
by trained staff and wet boats and gear are prohibited from entering the reservoir (see Section
3.3). Management actions common to all alternatives call for the local managing partners(s) for
the Regional Park to continue to support and complement CCWD’s programs to prevent
introduction of zebra and quagga mussels. Elements of this program may be modified or
4-65 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

expanded as necessary to improve the program’s effectiveness in preventing mussel infestation.
Hence, the risk of introduction of zebra or quagga mussels, although never completely
eliminated, would be minor.
The reservoir already contains certain exotic macrophyte species that may pose risks to the
reservoir’s fishery resources and to angler access, including milfoil and various other submergent
macrophytes, and various bulrush or tule (family Cyperaceae) and cattail (family Typhaceae)
emergents. Some of the tule and cattail emergents present in the reservoir may be California
natives, or may have been introduced. Although current populations of these macrophyte
communities provide important positive habitat and cover attributes for many resident fish
species, their unchecked proliferation and expansion could cause imbalances in water chemistry
and temperature, restrict boat launching and reduce or seriously limit open water fishing
opportunities and shoreline angler access. CCWD has an unpublished draft macrophyte
management plan for Contra Loma Reservoir calling for periodic treatment of shoreline
vegetation including tules and cattails that restrict fishing access, particularly to benefit annual
fishing derbies (East Bay Regional Park District 2011d). Macrohpyte control activities have been
limited to occasional spot herbicide treatments in the littoral zone and to specific tule beds, and
have only been necessary several times in the last 6 years (Nakagawa, pers. comm. 2012). The
treatments are timed such that the herbicide is absorbed by the root rhizome during the plant’s
dormant period so that physical removal of dead plant biomass is not generally necessary. No
long-term treatment procedures have been developed or deemed necessary to date. Due to
existing management activities of CCWD, as monitored by the Regional Park’s managing
partner(s), invasive macrophytes represent a minor risk to fishery resources. It may become
necessary to employ more aggressive measures to control macrophytes in the future, which could
have further impacts on fishery resources. For example, drawdown of the reservoir may be an
option for controlling an exotic species that could have more than a minor risk to fishery
resources. However, future implementation of such measures would have to be analyzed further
for their impacts on fisheries at the time they are proposed. All the RMP alternatives would have
similar levels of impact with respect to this issue.
Reservoir Levels

Contra Loma Reservoir levels are managed by CCWD under a separate agreement with
Reclamation and are outside the scope of the RMP. The primary purpose of the reservoir is water
supply; recreation is a secondary purpose. Therefore, water supply and reservoir operation and
management take precedence over management for recreation, including fisheries. Contra Loma
Reservoir is not a principal water storage reservoir. Water to meet CCWD customer demands is
not drained from the reservoir on a daily basis, but instead the reservoir storage is used to meet
periodic peak system demands. Water is pumped into the reservoir from the Contra Costa Canal
for storage and returned to the canal when CCWD operational needs dictate. In the spring, in
preparation for peak summer demands, water is cycled out of and back into the reservoir to
address taste and odor concerns. Hence, the water level in the reservoir fluctuates as operational
demands require.
During fall and winter of some years, the reservoir is drawn down as part of CCWD’s operations.
This drawdown can leave fishing docks out of the water, forcing fishermen to use the boat dock
or to fish only from shore. Additionally, winter drawdown can make it harder for anglers to reach
open water that is free of macrophyte vegetation from shore. During these seasons, however,
4-66 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

fishing pressure is generally lighter than in spring and summer. Opportunities for anglers to
reach open water at limited shore locations still exist during fall and winter. Also, as noted
elsewhere in this section, CCWD performs a periodic macrophyte control program which
typically responds to the need to provide shore access to anglers during fall or winter drawdowns
and for fishing derbies. These activities reduce the adverse effect of fall and winter drawdown.
4.10.4 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Fishing Pressure

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.10.3; however, this alternative would
include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the public’s enjoyment and
use of Contra Loma. This alternative would likely attract more visitors than the No Action
Alternative, thereby increasing fishing pressure and resulting in a minor adverse impact.
Invasive or Exotic Species

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.10.3; however, this alternative would
include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the public’s enjoyment and
use of Contra Loma. This alternative would likely attract more visitors than the No Action
Alternative, thereby increasing the potential for introduction or spread of invasive or exotic
species.
Reservoir Levels

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.10.3; however, this alternative would
include improvements that would enhance angler access. These improvements include
modification, reconstruction, or replacement of the existing fishing piers to allow safe,
continuous fishing during reservoir drawdowns. More fishing piers may also be added if needed
to accommodate increased demand. Also, a number of fishing pier and boat ramp improvements
may be completed to enhance ADA access, including ADA compliance for rest room facilities,
paving of parking areas, and paved trails to the boat launch and fishing pier areas. These
improvements would serve to partially compensate for the existing adverse effects on the angler
experience during fall and winter low water conditions and would have a beneficial impact that
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Construction Activities

This alternative would include modification, reconstruction, or replacement of existing fishing
piers to allow safe, continuous fishing use during reservoir drawdowns. In addition, more fishing
piers may be added if needed to accommodate increased demand. In addition, several
improvements may be implemented at the boat launch area to enhance boating and fishing
access. The improvements may include reconstruction of the boat ramp and providing for ADA
accessibility compliance. Some of the new or rehabilitated docks may require new pilings.
Construction activities of this type may cause temporary impacts on lake water quality, may
adversely affect fish resources especially young panfish and bass and may temporarily
inconvenience anglers. As discussed in Section 4.7.5, this alternative includes a management
action requiring a focused site-specific assessment of any potential impact on water quality when
specific construction activities are proposed. If required by Federal regulations, the local
managing partner(s) proposing a construction activity would submit a plan that identifies the

4-67 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

sources of sediment and other pollutants on site and ensures the reduction of such pollutants.
This management action would reduce the effects of in-water construction activities on fisheries.
In addition, the construction would of necessity be carried out during lower water level periods
in the late fall or winter, thus siltation of reservoir waters could be kept at a minimum. This
would reduce the intensity of any effects caused by siltation. No special status aquatic species or
fish are known to inhabit the reservoir, so no adverse impacts to special status species would
result. Also at these times, fishing pressure would be lower, so inconvenience to anglers would
be minimal. Finally, the resident panfish and bass species are known to spawn in the spring, so
there would be no impacts to these species due to spawning disruption. Hence, construction
activities would cause minor adverse impacts on fishery resources under this alternative that
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.10.5 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Fishing Pressure

In addition to the impacts expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed in Section
4.10.4, this alternative may include construction of a fishermen's shelter along the south or east
shore and may improve fish habitat to increase fish populations. These management actions
would result in positive impacts on the sportfishing experience at Contra Loma, and partially
compensate for the minor adverse impacts on fishery resources expected from increased fishing
pressure.
Invasive or Exotic Species

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.10.3.
Reservoir Levels

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.10.3; however, this alternative may
include creation or modification of fish habitat if desirable to increase fish populations. If
implemented, this management action would serve to partially compensate for the existing
adverse effects on the angler experience during fall and winter low water conditions and would
have a beneficial impact that would not occur under the No Action Alternative or the Enhanced
Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Construction Activities

Additional improvements under this alternative may include construction of a fishermen's shelter
along the south or east shore and improvement or creation of additional fish habitat to increase
fish populations. Similar to the discussion in Section 4.10.4, in-water construction activities
would most likely be undertaken in the fall or winter, while lake levels are drawn down and
fishing pressure is somewhat lighter. Also, the management action requiring a focused sitespecific assessment of any potential impact on water quality and preparation of a plan that
ensures the reduction of such pollutants would reduce the effects of in-water construction
activities on fisheries. Consequently, these additional improvements would result in minor
temporary adverse impacts on fishery resources that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.

4-68 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

4.10.6 Cumulative Impacts
Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Fishing Pressure

Visitation to Contra Loma would increase under all of the alternatives, with more visitation
expected under the two action alternatives than the No Action Alternative. Regional population
growth would further increase visitation to Contra Loma. This cumulative increase in visitation
would result in greater pressure on Contra Loma’s fisheries. Increased fishing pressure may
result in overharvest of existing sport fishing stocks.
The RMP includes management actions requiring the managing partner for the Regional Park to
manage recreational fisheries through fish planting (i.e., stocking) programs, continued
monitoring of fish populations, and provision of educational information to the public. These
actions may also include catch-and-release practices for certain fish species, tracking of stocking
rates and angler permit sales, and periodic evaluation and adjustment of stocking rates to
maximize angler success and experience. These management actions would ensure that the
cumulative impact of increased fishing pressure from regional population growth would be
minor.
Changes to future conditions at other similar nearby lakes and reservoirs could also contribute to
a cumulative increase in fishing pressure at Contra Loma. Nearby fresh water fish bearing
reservoirs managed by EBRPD include Lake Chabot near Castro Valley, Lake Temescal near
Oakland, and Shadow Cliffs near Pleasanton. These water bodies provide similar fishing
opportunities, with catchable trout and catfish as well as bass and panfish opportunities. A
number of smaller reservoirs add somewhat to the available opportunities. However, Contra
Loma provides the highest quality bass fishing of any large water body in the region, and is very
popular for put and take trout fishing as well. Other lakes or reservoirs of the region (e.g., Del
Valle in Livermore) are likely to be too distant to be considered as providing comparable sport
fishing for the local population. Fishery resources in these reservoirs are successfully managed
by EBRPD and CDFW in a similar manner as Contra Loma. EBRPD’s Master Plan includes a
policy to develop aquatic facilities, where appropriate, to create a wide variety of fisheries; to
monitor fisheries resources to determine species composition, size, population and growth rates;
and to cooperate with CDFW to conserve, enhance and manage EBRPD fisheries resources for
ecological and recreational benefit for all fish bearing lakes and reservoirs it manages (East Bay
Regional Park District 2013). There are no known projects or changes planned for these other
lakes that would adversely affect their fishery resources and result in cumulative impacts to
Contra Loma fisheries (Alexander, pers. comm. 2013), nor is there any available information to
indicate that fishing pressure impacts on these lakes when combined with Contra Loma would
result in additional unmitigated effects.

Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Invasive or Exotic Species

The cumulative increase in visitation could also increase the potential for the introduction or
spread of invasive or exotic species such as bait fish, crayfish, zebra mussels, and quagga
mussels. The RMP includes a management action to allow the managing partner for the Regional
Park to impose restrictions on the use of certain live baits. Hence the increased risk of
introduction of exotic species of baitfish or crayfish into the reservoir from a cumulative increase
in fishing would be a minor impact.
RMP management actions call for the local managing partners(s) for the Regional Park to
continue to support and complement CCWD’s programs to prevent introduction of zebra and
quagga mussels. With these management actions, the risk of introduction of zebra or quagga
mussels from a cumulative increase in visitation, although never completely eliminated, would
be minor.
4.10.7 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.11 Geologic and Soil Resources
4.11.1 Types of Impacts

This section assesses the potential impacts of the RMP alternatives on the geologic and soil
resources found in Contra Loma. Impacts related to soil erosion caused by construction activities
are addressed in Section 4.7 (Water Resources).
Potential impacts to geology and soils could result from three general types of activities:
•

Facility Maintenance

•

Fire Suppression

•

Facility Improvements

4.11.2 Assumptions

The geology and soils impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing geologic hazards, structure stability and erosion protection.

•

Negative impacts on geology and soil resources would be greatest from direct, large-scale
disturbance activities such as earthquakes or large-scale construction projects which
require use of heavy equipment such as bulldozers, scrapers, large excavators or drilling
and blasting.

4-70 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

All buildings and structures at Contra Loma would meet City and/or state building code
standards pertaining to geologic hazards and stability.

4.11.3 Impacts Common to All Alternatives
Facility Maintenance

Ongoing routine maintenance activities and repairs of existing facilities by the managing
partner(s) at the Regional Park and the Community Park would, in general, not involve ground
disturbance or otherwise have the potential to cause significant environmental effects. However,
trail maintenance activities in the Regional Park may include annual grading of fire roads and
trails using machinery and hand tools in order to maintain the quality of the road or trail surface
as well as maintain proper drainage. Vegetation management activities may include mowing of
grasslands adjacent to trails to aid in fire suppression, potentially exposing soils to erosion.
However, vegetation would not typically be removed in a manner that exposes bare soil, and
removal of dead tree stumps causing soil disturbance would be a rare occurrence. All of the RMP
alternatives would have a minor but long-term beneficial impact on soils by managing and
reducing the potential for erosion.
Fire Suppression

Wildland fire can have temporary negative impacts on soils due to soil erosion caused by offroad fire equipment use and temporary loss of grasslands. Management actions common to all
alternatives would include periodic mowing and livestock grazing of the grassland areas adjacent
to certain trails, hence reducing grassland fire hazards and the erosion effects which can result.
These maintenance activities would be similar to current practices. Vegetation fire risk within the
developed areas of Contra Loma is very low due to the scarcity of dry vegetation and the
predominance of landscaped or wetland vegetation types, hence soil erosion resulting from fire
would be very unlikely in the developed areas of Contra Loma.
4.11.4 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.11.3.
Fire Suppression

The impacts would be the same as those described in Section 4.11.3.
4.11.5 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and described
in Section 4.11.3.
Fire Suppression

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and described
in Section 4.11.3.

4-71 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Facility Improvements

Improvements to the boat launch area that are proposed in this alternative include the installation
of concrete trails from the reservoir shoreline to the boat launch area in order to improve access.
This action would also decrease the potential for erosion along the shoreline, resulting in a
beneficial impact that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative also includes paving of the unpaved portions of the East Shore Trail, the West
Shore Trail, and the trail across the dam. Paving these trail sections would create a shoreline loop
trail system that could be used year-round without increasing the potential for soil erosion and
the subsequent potential for sediment to reach the reservoir, resulting in a beneficial impact that
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Finally, this alternative would include construction of new or expanded buildings and facilities,
such as restrooms, utility lines, offices, the police substation, a park residence, a communication
tower, and fishing and boating facilities. All new buildings and facilities at Contra Loma would
meet City and/or state building code standards pertaining to geologic hazards and stability.
Therefore, these facility improvements would have a minor impact with respect to geology and
soil resources that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Section 4.7 (Water Resources) assesses impacts related to soil erosion caused by construction
activities, and includes mitigation measures to control construction-related erosion and
sedimentation.
4.11.6 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and described
in Section 4.11.3.
Fire Suppression

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and described
in Section 4.11.3.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded buildings and facilities in
addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Additional buildings and facilities proposed under this alternative include expansion of the swim
lagoon, an anglers’ shelter, additional sports fields, and solar panels. Similar to the Enhanced
Recreation and Facilities Alternative, all new buildings and facilities at Contra Loma would meet
City and/or state building code standards pertaining to geologic hazards and stability. Therefore,
these facility improvements would have a minor impact with respect to geology and soil
resources that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative may include construction of new trails that
would be open to bicycles and/or would allow bicycles on portions of trails that are not currently
open to bicycles. This alternative may also include establishment of a new fitness course by
installing outdoor exercise stations with stationary equipment and signage along the shoreline
trail loop. Construction of new trails or fitness trail equipment and signage would result in soil
4-72 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

disturbance. However, newly constructed trails and existing trails opened for bicycle use would
be built in a manner that minimizes erosion, resulting in a minor impact that would not occur
under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative includes a proposal to build a disc golf course in the Regional Park that would
not be built under the No Action Alternative. Potential locations being considered for the disc
golf course include areas east of the reservoir and in the southeast part of the Regional Park.
Steep, unstable terrain has been mapped in the eastern half of the Regional Park (see Figure 315), indicating that there is a potential for landslides to occur in response to changes in water
content, earthquakes, or the removal of downslope support. Construction of the disc golf course,
including the infrastructure associated with disc golf would involve relatively little earthwork,
limited to the construction of tee pads. Tee pads are typically 5-feet to 6-feet wide and 12-feet to
18-feet long and have a level surface of textured cement, asphalt, grass, or earth. Construction of
the tee pads would not require any major ground disturbance associated with heavy equipment
use; therefore, this impact would be minor.
4.11.7 Cumulative Impacts
Concurrent Improvements and Land Use Changes

Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would cause a substantial amount of
ground disturbance. The improvements to the boat launch area would cause a small amount of
ground disturbance.
Facility Improvements

The proposed construction activities proposed under the two action alternatives could
temporarily increase the potential for soil erosion. Construction activities carried out by others in
the vicinity of Contra Loma, including the sports field improvements at the Community Park,
could also increase the potential for soil erosion, which could cause a cumulative increase in soil
erosion and sedimentation in local waterways. However, Section 4.7 (Water Resources) includes
mitigation measures to control construction-related erosion and sedimentation attributable to the
RMP, thereby reducing the RMP’s contribution to a potential cumulative soil erosion impact.
4.11.8 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.12 Climate and Air Quality
4.12.1 Types of Impacts

This section assesses the potential impacts of the RMP alternatives on climate change and on
regional air quality. Because the RMP neither includes nor defines specific projects, the analysis
in this section is qualitative.
Potential impacts related to air quality and climate change could result from three general types
of activities:

4-73 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

Human Use

•

Facility Maintenance

•

Facility Improvements

4.12.2 Assumptions

The air quality and climate change impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

4.12.3 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Human Use

Vehicle emissions of air pollutants generated by park visitation would have minor adverse
impacts on air quality in the Contra Loma region. Ozone precursors (i.e., ROG, NOx), PM10 and
PM2.5, and GHGs are currently generated by vehicles traveling to and from Contra Loma.
Although increased visitation to Contra Loma would increase the volume of air pollutants
generated by visitors’ vehicles, this increase is not likely to result in levels of park visitation high
enough to cause exceedance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
Although the primary access road into the Regional Park is paved, some of the parking areas in
the Regional Park as well as the road leading to the east side of the reservoir have gravel
surfaces. Use of gravel roads and parking areas may generate a small but insubstantial amount of
dust because the gravel provides a protective ground surface and because the speed and number
of vehicles driving in unpaved areas within the Regional Park are generally low. The recreational
trail system in the Regional Park is closed to privately operated motorized vehicles. Therefore,
dust generated by recreational trail use would result from activities such as mountain biking,
hiking, and equestrian use. However, these types of recreational transportation activities are not
usually fast enough or dense enough to generate a substantial amount of dust. Three of the
Community Park’s sports fields have baseball diamonds with dirt infields. Use of these fields
generates a small, insubstantial amount of dust. Increased visitation to Contra Loma would
increase the amount of dust generated by human use but is not expected to substantially increase
the amount of dust emissions generated within Contra Loma due to reasons described above
resulting in a minor impact on air quality.
Smoke from barbecue grills used by park visitors is a source of PM. However, the amounts of
smoke generated by occasional day use activities typically only occur seasonally, primarily on
weekends, resulting in temporary minor impacts to air quality. Increased visitation would
incrementally increase the amount of PM generated by barbecue grills. However, this
incremental increase would not be substantial and would result in a minor impact on air quality.
Facility Maintenance

Ongoing routine maintenance and management activities and repairs of existing facilities at the
Regional Park and the Community Park by the managing partner(s) would continue to involve
the use of motorized vehicles and equipment such as staff vehicles, mowers, graders, and various
4-74 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

landscaping equipment. Increased visitation could incrementally increase the amount of facility
maintenance required. These maintenance and repair activities could generate dust and
hydrocarbon emissions, including PM, ozone precursors (ROG, NOx), and GHGs. It is
anticipated that equipment would be properly maintained by the managing partner(s) to reduce
exhaust emissions. Dust would continue to be generated by mowing and other landscaping
activities and by park vehicles traveling on dirt fire roads (see Section 3.13); however, mowing
and landscaping activities would be short term and park maintenance vehicles would reduce dust
generation by complying with park road speed limits. Annual fire road grading and maintenance
activities would likely involve the use of heavy construction equipment that would generate dust.
Such activities, however, are temporary and of short duration. It is anticipated that maintenance
activities requiring substantial ground disturbance would include use of water trucks to minimize
dust emissions and that the managing partner(s) or their contractor would maintain mechanized
equipment in accordance with local and state emissions guidelines; therefore, facility
maintenance and repairs would have a minor impact on air quality and climate change.
4.12.4 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

Impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.12.3; however, this alternative would
include facility improvements and renovations that would increase the public’s enjoyment and
use of Contra Loma. This alternative would likely attract more visitors and would, therefore,
generate more air pollutants than the No Action Alternative. For the reasons discussed in Section
4.12.3, air quality and climate change impacts from human use would be minor.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.12.3; however, this alternative
would include more recreation and infrastructure facilities than the No Action Alternative, which
could require more maintenance than the No Action Alternative. In addition, because this
alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action
Alternative, it could result in more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance than
the No Action Alternative. For the reasons discussed in Section 4.12.3, air quality and climate
change impacts from facility maintenance would be minor.
Facility Improvements

This alternative includes expansion or renovation of existing buildings and structures as well as
construction of new facilities within the Regional Park that would occur under the No Action
Alternative. These actions may include mechanical ground-disturbing activities that could
generate dust and create conditions conducive to wind erosion. Because the managing partner(s)
would adhere to BAAQMD control strategies for reducing air pollutants, dust control measures
such as frequent watering and/or covering of stockpiled soils would reduce potential impacts on
air quality to a minimum; resulting in a minor impact on air quality.
Construction activities for facility improvements would also temporarily generate air pollutants,
including PM, ozone precursors, and GHGs, through fuel combustion and the evaporation of
solvents, paints, and fuels. Diesel particulate emitted from heavy equipment is an identified toxic
air contaminant. However, construction emissions would be temporary and primarily localized
around the construction areas. Project operations would adhere to local and statewide efforts

4-75 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

aimed at minimizing GHG emissions, including measures recommended in BAAQMD’s 2010
Clean Air Plan (CAP). Efforts to reduce tailpipe emissions and diesel exhaust produced by
combustion engines would be included in all construction activities at Contra Loma; therefore,
impacts on air quality and climate change would be minor.
Potential expansion of the pumping and filtration facility at the swim lagoon is proposed under
this alternative. Operation of the pump(s) and filtration system needed for this expansion would
be a permanent source of exhaust emissions. However, this would have a minor impact on air
quality since equipment would be operated and maintained at levels consistent with BAAQMD
stationary source measures resulting in minor impacts on air quality and climate change that
would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may include a new fueling station and fuel storage tank for Regional Park
vehicles and equipment as well as for public safety officers. The managing partner(s) would be
required to design and operate the facility in a manner that minimizes its impact on air quality
and the facility may only be built and operated in compliance with applicable federal and
federally-mandated air quality laws, regulations, and permits. Even with these measures, some
petroleum vapors (air pollutants) would escape to the atmosphere during equipment fueling and
fuel handling. The amount of air pollutants generated by the fueling facility would likely be
similar to the amount of pollutants currently emitted when the current managing partner for the
Regional Park fuels its vehicles at offsite fueling stations. If the new fueling station were to
generate more air pollutants than the current managing partner’s fueling practices, the air quality
measures described above would ensure that the fueling station would only have a minor adverse
impact on air quality. This impact would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.12.5 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.12.3; however, this alternative
would include facility improvements and expansion of trail use that would increase the public’s
enjoyment and use of Contra Loma beyond those of the other two alternatives. This alternative
would likely attract more visitors and would, therefore, generate more air pollutants than the
other two alternatives. For the reasons discussed in Section 4.12.3, air quality and climate change
impacts from human use would be minor.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be similar to those addressed in Section 4.12.3; however, this alternative
would include more facility and trail improvements than the other two alternatives, which could
require more maintenance. In addition, because this alternative would include more enhanced
recreation opportunities than the other alternatives, it could result in more visitor use and require
incrementally more maintenance. For the reasons discussed in Section 4.12.3, air quality and
climate change impacts from facility maintenance would be minor.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded buildings and facilities in
addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
These activities would generate PM through mechanized ground disturbance and wind erosion.

4-76 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Construction activities would comply with guidelines contained in the BAAQMD CAP and the
construction contractor would be required to minimize airborne dust to the extent possible,
resulting in a minor impact on air quality that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The increased construction that would occur under this alternative would also increase the
volume of temporary, construction-related vehicle and equipment exhaust emissions. However,
construction emissions would be temporary and primarily localized around the construction
areas. Project operations would adhere to local and statewide efforts aimed at minimizing GHG
emissions, including measures recommended in BAAQMD’s CAP. Efforts to reduce tailpipe
emissions and diesel exhaust produced by combustion engines would be included in all
construction activities at Contra Loma; therefore, impacts on air quality and climate change
would be minor. These impacts would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Expansion of the Regional Park’s recreational trail system is included under this alternative.
Impacts on air quality as a result of dust generated by low-impact recreational use of the
expanded trail system would be similar to those described in Section 4.12.4. There would be no
impact on air quality as a result of expanded recreational trail use.
This alternative would also include installation of solar panels to supplement the Regional Park’s
energy needs. Solar panels would reduce the Regional Park’s demand for conventionally
generated electricity, thereby slightly reducing air pollutant emissions generated at the power
plants that serve Contra Loma. This would be a beneficial impact that would not occur under the
No Action Alternative.
4.12.6 Cumulative Impacts
Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses, increasing the potential for air pollutant emissions.
Discussion

Cumulative air quality impacts typically occur when multiple projects affect the same air basin at
the same time, or when sequential projects extend the duration of air quality emissions over a
longer period of time. Because attainment of NAAQS for ozone and PM require evaluation of
conditions over a three-year period, air pollution emissions that occurred in the recent past can
affect attainment or nonattainment designations.
Cumulative construction-related air quality impacts would occur if projects approved or carried
out by other government entities were constructed concurrently with construction being
4-77 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

performed under the proposed RMP. The City and the County both expect future population
increases, accompanied by new construction on public and private lands. Some of this
construction activity is likely to occur concurrently with RMP-related construction activity. PM
and ozone precursors generated during RMP construction activities could contribute to the
existing violations of PM in the Bay Area and could exceed state ambient air quality standards.
Therefore, the construction contractor would be required to minimize airborne dust, PM, ozone
precursors, and GHG emissions to the extent required by applicable air quality plans and
guidelines.
Cumulative operational air quality impacts would occur if projects approved or carried out by
other government entities were to combine with emissions from Contra Loma operations and
generate emissions that conflict with applicable air quality plans. Management activities
associated with the RMP alternatives could have some minor adverse impacts on air quality and
climate change, but the overall contribution of the actions proposed at Contra Loma to air quality
and climate change would be minimal. Aside from the motor vehicles used by many park visitors
to access Contra Loma, recreational activities at the Regional and Community parks do not
generate substantial emissions. Low impact, non-motorized activities that produce minimal
amounts of airborne dust typify recreational pursuits at Contra Loma.
The expected regional population growth would increase the number of vehicles traveling
regional roads, leading to increased vehicle emissions. Federal vehicle emission control
programs could offset the increased emissions from population growth.
Because the two action alternatives would include more facilities and would experience more
visitation than the No Action Alternative, they would contribute most to cumulative air quality
impacts.
4.12.7 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.13 Noise
4.13.1 Types of Impacts

This section describes potential impacts on existing noise levels as a result of management
actions included in the RMP alternatives. The impacts of the RMP alternatives on noise levels
are evaluated qualitatively considering the existing noise environment and the duration and
anticipated magnitude of noise level changes. Although a number of sensitive noise receptors
(i.e., residences) are located within ¼ mile of the north and southeast boundaries of Contra
Loma, to date, neither of the current managing partners has received any noise complaints from
nearby residents.
Noise impacts could potentially result from three general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Facility Maintenance

4-78 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

Facility Improvements

4.13.2 Assumptions

The noise impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable policies and
regulations governing noise.

•

The public’s use of Contra Loma would continue to increase regardless of the selected
alternative, and would require an increased level of facilities management to satisfy this
demand.

4.13.3 Impacts Common to All Alternatives
Human Use

Visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP alternatives, consistent
with the visitation trend over the past few years. As a result, visitor generated noise from sources
such as vehicles or human voices is expected to increase incrementally. Although noise levels
within Contra Loma would likely increase, the impact would occur over limited time periods and
would typically occur in areas of concentrated human use such as the swim lagoon, the south
shore of the reservoir, and the Community Park recreational facilities. Most of the noise
generated by human use within Contra Loma would occur during daytime hours, although
nighttime use of the currently lighted Community Park sports fields would continue. Such noises
are generally an accepted part of the ambient noise levels experienced by park visitors and
nearby residents. Noise level increases from non-vehicular human use are not expected to be
noticeable; therefore, noise impacts resulting from increased non-vehicular human use would be
minor.
Increased visitor use would increase vehicle trips to Contra Loma, resulting in a small increase in
vehicle noise on roads leading to Contra Loma. Typically, traffic volumes must double before
traffic noise increases are noticeable. According to the City’s General Plan EIR, traffic volumes
on the local roads providing access to Contra Loma (i.e., James Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree
Way, Contra Loma Boulevard) would not double by the year 2020, even with build out of the
General Plan (2020 is the study horizon of the General Plan EIR traffic analysis; City of Antioch
2003b). Therefore, the addition of vehicles from Contra Loma visitors is also not expected to
cause vehicle traffic to double. For this reason, vehicle noise level increases from increased
visitation are not expected to be noticeable and would result in a minor noise impact.
Facility Maintenance

Increased visitation would incrementally increase the need for routine maintenance activities
such as waste disposal, facility repairs, vehicle patrols, and emergency response by the managing
partner(s) or others. Similar to current practices, most noise generated by maintenance activities
within Contra Loma would occur during daytime hours. In addition, such noises are generally an
4-79 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

accepted part of the ambient noise levels experienced by park visitors and nearby residents.
Noise level increases caused by maintenance activities are not expected to be noticeable;
therefore, noise impacts resulting from increased facility maintenance would be minor.
4.13.4 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.13.3.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.13.3.
4.13.5 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

In addition to the impacts addressed in Section 4.13.3, this alternative would include more
enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, which could incrementally
increase visitor use and vehicle trips to Contra Loma. An incremental increase in visitor use
would proportionally increase noise from human activity.
Facility Maintenance

In general noise impacts would be the same as those described in Section 4.13.3; however, this
alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action
Alternative, which could require more facility maintenance. Unlike the No Action Alternative,
this alternative would also include the replacement of existing portable chemical toilets with
permanent restrooms, which would reduce or remove the need for periodic waste water pumping,
and would therefore minimize or remove this common maintenance activity as a source of noise.
Facility Improvements

This alternative may include new, expanded, or renovated facilities at the Regional Park to
enhance recreation and improve operations. Examples include a new park residence, classroom
facilities near the swim lagoon, improvements to the park office and police substation, a new
fueling station, additional picnic sites, a storm water retention basin, and a “safe swim” area or
splash pad at the swim lagoon. Expanded pumping and filtration facilities may also be needed to
operate the additional swim facilities. Use of these facilities could increase ambient noise levels
within the Regional Park at certain times. However, the impact would occur over limited time
periods, would typically occur in areas of concentrated human use such as the swim lagoon and
south shore of the reservoir, and would not occur near noise-sensitive land uses located outside
Contra Loma. In addition, such noises are generally an accepted part of the ambient noise levels
experienced by park visitors; therefore, noise level increases from these improvements are not
expected to be noticeable.
Construction of the facility improvements would temporarily increase noise levels within Contra
Loma, which could be distracting to some park visitors. Construction noise may also be audible
from some offsite areas, depending on the location and the nature of the construction activity.
However, construction activities would be short-term. Also, the managing partner(s) can limit
construction activities to days and times that reduce noise-related effects on visitors and on
sensitive receptors near Contra Loma. For these reasons, noise increases attributable to facility
4-80 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

improvements would have a minor adverse impact. This impact would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
4.13.6 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

In general, noise impacts would be similar to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Overnight group camping at the Regional Park would increase the potential for noise,
particularly nighttime noise. However, overnight camping would be allowed only in the Regional
Park, and would most likely occur in the developed picnic area along the south shore of the
reservoir. Noise generated in this location is buffered from residential areas by distance and
topography. In addition, event-specific authorization, oversight, and regulation by the managing
partner(s) would be required, thereby ensuring that group camping would not generate excessive
noise; therefore, the noise impact from this activity would be minor. This impact would not
occur under the No Action Alternative. Under this alternative, all other types of human use
would result in minor adverse impacts similar to those described in Section 4.13.3.
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include the routine maintenance activities needed for operation of the
Regional Park and Community Park that are included in the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
Alternative. In addition, this alternative would include more expanded recreation opportunities
than the other two alternatives, which could require more facility maintenance and generate more
noise than the other two alternatives.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded facilities in addition to those that
would be built or enhanced under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. Except as
discussed below, construction and use of new or expanded facilities under this alternative would
be the same as described under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields and increased parking capacity
in the Community Park. The sports fields would have floodlights to allow evening use in
addition to those currently used within sports fields 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, this alternative may
expand sports field use, including evening league play, at the Community Park. Noise generated
by sports league play at the Community Park includes vehicle noise, sports whistles, and human
voices such as cheers and shouts. Noise generated at the new sports fields could be noticeable to
some residents near the eastern portion of the Community Park, although the closest residence
would be approximately 800 feet away on the north side of James Donlon Boulevard. In
addition, the homes closest to the Community Park are routinely exposed to vehicle noise from
James Donlon Road, and vehicle noise associated with use of the new sports fields would be
similar. The magnitude of noise levels experienced at nearby residences from sports field use is
currently buffered and would continue to be buffered by topography and distance. Also, noise
generated by the new sports fields would typically be of short duration, lasting no more than a
few hours on any given day. Therefore, the intensity of the additional noise generated by the new
sports fields is not expected to be substantial. Also, human noise generated by use of the new
fields would be similar to noise generated by use of Fields 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, when
considering the context and intensity of additional noise generated by new sports fields, the new

4-81 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

fields would have a minor noise impact. In addition, the local managing partner(s) for the
Community Park would have the ability to adjust the hours of use to accommodate the needs of
nearby residents. This minor impact would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.13.7 Cumulative Impacts
Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses, increasing noise within the project region.
Human Use and Facility Maintenance

Increased visitation would cumulatively, though incrementally, increase the volume of noise
generated by visitors and maintenance activities. This impact would occur over limited time
periods and would typically occur in areas of concentrated human use such as the swim lagoon,
the south shore of the reservoir, and the Community Park recreational facilities. Most of the
noise generated by human use within Contra Loma would occur during daytime hours, although
installation of floodlights at sports fields 4 and 5 would increase nighttime use of the Community
Park sports fields. The intensity of the additional noise generated by the new sports fields is not
expected to be substantial. Also, such noises are generally an accepted part of the ambient noise
levels experienced by park visitors and nearby residents. Therefore, when considering the
context and intensity of additional noise generated by a cumulative increase in visitation and
nighttime use of sports field 4 and 5, the cumulative noise impact would be minor. Because the
two action alternatives would experience more visitation and would include more new facilities
than the No Action Alternative, they would result in higher noise levels attributable to human use
and facility maintenance than the No Action Alternative.
Increased visitor use would increase vehicle trips to Contra Loma, resulting in a small increase in
vehicle noise on roads leading to Contra Loma. Regional population growth would also increase
traffic volumes and resulting vehicle noise on roads near Contra Loma. Typically, traffic
volumes must double before traffic noise increases are noticeable. According to the City’s
General Plan EIR, traffic volumes on the local roads providing access to Contra Loma (i.e.,
James Donlon Boulevard, Lone Tree Way, Contra Loma Boulevard) would not double by the
year 2020, which corresponds with the study horizon of the General Plan EIR traffic analysis
(City of Antioch 2003b). The addition of vehicles from Contra Loma visitors is not expected to
cause vehicle traffic to double. Therefore, cumulative vehicle noise level increases from
increased visitation are not expected to be noticeable and would result in a minor cumulative
noise impact.

4-82 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Facility Improvements

Sports fields 1 through 5 currently generate noise from sporting activities. Sports fields 1, 2, and
3 have floodlights for nighttime use and floodlights have recently been installed at sports fields 4
and 5. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative would include two new sports fields
with floodlighting. When combined, use of these fields would cause a cumulative noise level
increase during the daytime and early nighttime hours in the vicinity of the Community Park.
The greatest noise increase would be in the eastern portion of the Community Park near Fields 4
and 5 and the two proposed sports fields because Fields 4 and 5 will soon be usable at night and
because the new fields would represent new noise sources. The cumulative noise increase at the
new sports fields could be noticeable to some residents near the Community Park. The closest
residences would be approximately 360 feet away from Fields 1, 2, and 3, 575 feet away from
Fields 4 and 5, and 800 feet away from the two new sports fields. All of these residences are on
the north side of James Donlon Boulevard. These residences are routinely exposed to vehicle
noise from James Donlon Road, and vehicle noise associated with use of the new sports fields
would be similar. The magnitude of noise levels experienced at nearby residences from sports
field use is currently buffered and would continue to be buffered by topography and distance.
Also, noise generated by the new sports fields would typically be of short duration, lasting no
more than a few hours on any given day. Therefore, the intensity of the cumulative noise
increase generated by the existing sports fields, nighttime use of sports fields 4 and 5, and the
proposed new fields is not expected to be substantial. Also, human noise generated by use of the
new fields would be similar to noise generated by use of Fields 1, 2, and 3 and daytime use of
fields 4 and 5. Therefore, when considering the context and intensity of additional cumulative
noise levels, the increase would have a minor noise impact. In addition, the local managing
partner(s) for the Community Park would have the ability to adjust the hours of use to
accommodate the needs of nearby residents.
4.13.8 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.14 Visual Resources
4.14.1 Types of Impacts

This section describes potential effects on visual resources from management actions and other
resource uses. This analysis focuses on direct and indirect effects from actions that would change
the visual resources by introducing intrusions into the landscape.
Potential impacts to visual resources could result from three general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Physical Improvements to the Regional Park

•

Physical Improvements to the Community Park

4.14.2 Assumptions

The visual resources impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:

4-83 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

Reclamation would only provide project-specific authorization for activities, including
construction and operation of new facilities that have undergone appropriate
environmental review.

•

The size and/or severity of surface disturbance proportionally increases the magnitude of
the resulting effect on scenic quality.

•

Visual quality and opinions about the effect of changes within the visual environment are
highly subjective to the viewer.

4.14.3 Impacts Common to All Alternatives
Human Use

As described previously, visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the
alternatives, consistent with the visitation trend over the past few years. Increased visitation
would increase the potential for littering, trampled vegetation, scarred terrain, vandalism, and
facility deterioration, which could impair the visual quality of the landscape. Under all of the
alternatives, however, litter and waste reduction programs will continue to be implemented to
effectively meet demand, thereby reducing the possibility that litter will impair visual quality. In
addition, the local managing partner(s) will continue to be responsible for performing landscape
maintenance and management activities that regulate park uses in order to minimize trampling of
vegetation, scarring of terrain, and vandalism. The managing partner(s) will also continue to
repair and maintain facilities before they deteriorate and can adversely affect Contra Loma’s
visual character. These maintenance and management activities would ensure that the intensity
of any visual change caused by increased human use and the resulting impacts to visual
resources would be minor.
4.14.4 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.14.3.
4.14.5 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.14.3.
Physical Improvements to the Regional Park

This alternative may include new, expanded, or renovated buildings and structures to improve
operations. These improvements would not be built under the No Action Alternative. Examples
include a new park residence, new permanent restrooms to replace existing portable chemical
toilets, classroom facilities near the swim lagoon, and a radio communication tower. This
alternative may also include new or renovated recreational facilities, such as new or
reconstructed fishing docks, improvements at the boat launch area to enhance boating and fishing
access, a “safe swim” area or splash pad at the swim lagoon, additional shade structures on the
swim lagoon lawn, additional trail signs, and additional picnic sites.

4-84 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Some of the new or renovated facilities would improve the visual quality within the Regional
Park. Examples include new permanent restroom facilities to replace portable chemical toilets
and renovated fishing docks to replace deteriorating docks. Such improvements would result in a
beneficial impact on localized views in the vicinity of these improvements.
Some of the proposed improvements would represent noticeable changes to the visual
environment but would not impair the visual quality or character of the Regional Park because
they would be consistent with the existing visual character of the Regional Park. For example,
park visitors are accustomed to seeing picnic areas, shade structures, trail signs, and restrooms
when visiting the Regional Park, and consider such facilities to be important components of their
recreational experience. Similarly, improvements to the swim lagoon area such as a “safe swim”
area or splash pad for children would be consistent with views in the vicinity of the swim lagoon.
Such improvements, therefore, would have no impact on visual resources within the Regional
Park.
Other proposed improvements, however, have the potential to impair visual resources. These
include the larger and more prominent improvements such as a new park residence, classroom
facilities, and a new radio communication tower. These larger facilities would be visible from
various locations within the Regional Park and some facilities, such as a radio communication
tower, could be visible from offsite locations. Because the specific designs and locations of these
facilities are not yet known, the potential impact on visual resources could vary in intensity.
Improvements that are designed to blend well with the visual environment would result in minor
adverse impacts. Alternatively, improvements that appear inconsistent with the visual
environment could impair the visual character of Contra Loma from viewpoints within the
recreation area and from viewpoints outside the recreation area, resulting in major adverse
impacts.
When specific facilities are proposed, site-specific environmental analysis would be conducted
that includes a more focused assessment of the potential impact on visual resources. When
feasible and appropriate, the proposed activity would be modified or mitigation measures would
be implemented to reduce impacts on visual resources (see Section 4.14.8, Mitigation Measure
Visual-1).
4.14.6 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.14.4.
Physical Improvements to the Regional Park

This alternative would include new, expanded, or renovated infrastructure or recreational
facilities in addition to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
Alternative. Therefore, this alternative would have more potential to change the visual character
of the Regional Park than the other alternatives.
Some of the proposed improvements would represent noticeable changes to the visual
environment but would not impair the visual quality or character of the Regional Park because

4-85 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

they would be consistent with the existing visual character of the Regional Park. For example,
park visitors are accustomed to seeing trails, shade structures, picnic tables, wash basins,
electrical outlets, interpretive signage, fitness courses, and playground structures when visiting
the Regional Park or other similar recreation areas. Similarly, an expanded swim lagoon would
be consistent with existing views of the swim lagoon. Such improvements, therefore, would have
no impact on visual resources within the Regional Park.
This alternative may also include installation of shade structures in the parking and picnic areas,
and solar panels may be installed on top of the shade structures or on buildings to supplement the
Regional Park’s energy needs. Shade structures in picnic areas are common in many recreation
areas and would be visually consistent with the Regional Park’s recreational setting. Therefore,
shade structures would have no impact on visual resources. Solar panels and parking area shade
structures are widely used within non-recreational land uses, but are less commonly seen in park
settings. Therefore, solar panels and parking lot shade structures would likely be more noticeable
to park users than many of the other proposed improvements. The intensity of the visual change,
however, would not be substantial and, thus, would not impair the visual quality or character of
the Regional Park. Such improvements, therefore, would have no impact on visual resources
within the Regional Park.
This alternative may also include installation of disc golf course in an undeveloped location that
is suitable for disc golf and that minimizes conflicts with other park uses. Potential locations may
include the gently rolling land east of the reservoir and west of the Lone Tree Golf Course,
gently sloping land near the southwest corner of the reservoir, and the level or gently sloping
land in the southeast portion of the Regional Park directly north of Frederickson Lane. These
locations are undeveloped and currently support grazed annual grassland.
Disc golf courses typically have a relatively low visual prominence because they require minimal
ground disturbance and infrastructure. A typical disc golf course includes either 9 or 18 holes,
and consists of a tee pad and a target for each hole and simply-designed signage. Tee pads are
typically 5-feet to 6-feet wide and 12-feet to 18-feet long and have a level surface of textured
cement, asphalt, grass, or earth. Disc golf targets are approximately 5-feet high and 27-inches in
diameter and consist of a metal pole supporting a metal basket and several metal chains. Some
areas within a disc golf course may require clearing of grass and herbaceous vegetation. The
course would be noticeable to viewers in some locations, but would have no adverse impact on
visual resources because the intensity of the visual change from annual grassland to a disc golf
course would be relatively minor, and because a disc golf course at the Regional Park would be
visually consistent with other recreational land uses within the Regional Park, the Community
Park, and the adjacent Lone Tree Golf Course.
This alternative would also include the management actions proposed for the Enhanced
Recreation and Facilities Alternative, including some proposed improvements that have the
potential to impair visual resources. As discussed for the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities
Alternative, when specific facilities are proposed, site-specific environmental analysis would be
conducted that includes a more focused assessment of any potential impact on visual resources.
When feasible and appropriate, the proposed activity would be modified or mitigation measures
would be implemented to reduce impacts on visual resources (see Section 4.14.8, Mitigation
Measure Visual-1).
4-86 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Physical Improvements to the Community Park

This alternative would include new, expanded, or renovated infrastructure or recreational
facilities that would not be included in the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative.
Therefore, this alternative would have more potential to change the visual character of the
Community Park than the other alternatives.
This alterative may include new trails and a botanical garden within the Community Park. These
improvements would represent noticeable changes to the visual environment but would not
impair the visual quality or character of the Community Park because they would be consistent
with the existing visual character of the Community Park which includes trails and landscaping;
therefore, these improvements would have no impact on visual resources.
Additional multi-use sports fields may be built directly south of the two existing sports fields on
the east side of the Community Park and additional parking areas may be developed nearby (see
Figure 2-1). The new sports fields may include floodlights to allow evening use. These
improvements would represent noticeable changes to the visual environment of the Community
Park. During the day, the new fields would be visible to Contra Loma visitors. However, they
would be consistent with the existing visual character of the Community Park, which currently
has five multi-use sports fields and two parking lots.
The new sports fields would be approximately 800 feet away from the nearest residences, located
on the north site of James Donlon Boulevard, and would be screened by vegetation and
topography. At night, glare or general skyglow from the floodlights may be visible from some
residences. However, the additional nighttime lighting would be visually consistent with the
lighting used at Fields 1, 2, and 3 and with the street lights along James Donlon Boulevard.
Within this context, the new lighting would be less noticeable. Also, the distance between the
lighted fields and the residences would reduce their intensity as observed from the residences. In
addition, the lights would be shut off each night after their use, and the local managing partner(s)
for the Community Park would have the ability to adjust the hours of use to accommodate the
needs of nearby residents. For these reasons, the sports field lights would result in a minor
adverse impact on visual resources. This impact would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
4.14.7 Cumulative Impacts
Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses, changing the visual appearance of the project region.

4-87 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Human Use

Increased visitation would increase the potential for littering, trampled vegetation, scarred
terrain, vandalism, and facility deterioration, which could impair the visual quality of the
landscape. For the reasons presented in Section 4.14.3, the intensity of any visual change caused
by the cumulative increase in human use and the resulting impacts to visual resources would be
minor.
Physical Improvements

Sports fields 1, 2, and 3 currently have floodlights for nighttime use and floodlights are currently
being installed at sports fields 4 and 5. The Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
would include two new sports fields with floodlighting. When combined, lighting for these
sports fields would cause a cumulative increase in nighttime lighting in the vicinity of the
Community Park. However, this nighttime lighting would be visually consistent with the lighting
used at Fields 1, 2, and 3 and with the street lights along James Donlon Boulevard. Within this
context, the combined lighting would be less noticeable. Also, the distance between Fields 4 and
5 and the residences would reduce their intensity as observed from the residences. In addition, all
of the lights would be shut off each night after their use, and the local managing partner(s) for
the Community Park would have the ability to adjust the hours of use to accommodate the needs
of nearby residents. For these reasons, the sports field lights would result in a minor cumulative
impact on visual resources.
Very few land use changes are expected to occur in the vicinity of Contra Loma that could
contribute to a cumulative impact on visual resources when considered in combination with the
visual changes proposed in the RMP. The land to the north of Contra Loma has largely been built
out with suburban land uses. The land directly to the east of Contra Loma is occupied by the
Lone Tree Golf Course. The land east of the golf course has also largely been built out with
suburban land uses. The residential land directly adjacent to the southeastern boundary of Contra
Loma has largely been built out. The land southwest of Contra Loma is owned and managed by
EBRPD as the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. Therefore, no land use changes are
expected to occur in these areas that would contribute to a cumulative impact on visual
resources.
Only the land on the southern portion of the western boundary of Contra Loma has the potential
for further development. The City’s General Plan designates this land as Estate Residential with
a density of two dwelling units per acre. However, most of this area is visually separated from
Contra Loma by the ridgeline that runs along the eastern boundary of Contra Loma and is,
therefore, not visible from most locations within Contra Loma. Therefore, it is highly unlikely
that buildout of the residential area and the management actions proposed in the RMP would
combine to contribute to a cumulative impact on visual resources.
4.14.8 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation Measure Visual-1: Implement design measures to reduce visual impacts from
new development.

When a specific project is proposed, a site-specific environmental analysis would be conducted
that includes a more focused assessment of the potential impact on visual resources. When

4-88 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

feasible and appropriate, the proposed activity would be modified to reduce impacts on visual
resources. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to:
•

Design all new development to be visually compatible with Contra Loma’s visual
character and quality.

•

Use building materials that are visually compatible with Contra Loma’s natural setting.

•

Avoid removal of native vegetation to the extent possible.

•

Minimize grading of slopes to the extent possible.

•

Revegetate cut and fill slopes with native plants.

•

Avoid the placement of infrastructure, including communications facilities, on ridges and
peaks in order to maintain open viewsheds.

4.15 Hazards
4.15.1 Type of Impacts

This section addresses the potential hazards related to the use of hazardous materials and
wildland fire associated with the RMP alternatives. Hazards related to visitor use and safety are
described in Section 4.6 (Public Health and Safety) and hazards related to seismic events or other
geologic issues are described in Section 4.11 (Geologic and Soil Resources).
The RMP does not address hazards related to operation of the dam and reservoir, which is
subject to a separate contract agreement between Reclamation and CCWD and, therefore, outside
the scope of the Contra Loma RMP. It is important to note, however, that Reclamation has
determined that the overall safety classification of the dam is considered satisfactory and the risk
from dam failure is low (City of Antioch 2003a).
Four general types of activities involve management actions intended to reduce potentially
hazardous situations or that could result in exposure of the public or environment to hazardous
situations or materials:
•

Facility Maintenance

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Fire And Emergency Preparedness

•

Facility Improvements

4.15.2 Assumptions

The hazards impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:

4-89 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
related to hazards.

•

The managing partner(s) would uphold their responsibilities to provide the standard of
care necessary to ensure the health and safety of visitors to Contra Loma as well as the
natural environment.

4.15.3 Impacts Common to All Alternatives
Facility Maintenance

All of the RMP alternatives include continuation of routine maintenance and repair activities that
sometimes require the use of potentially hazardous materials (e.g., cleaning solutions, petroleum
products). Increased visitation could incrementally increase the amount of facility maintenance
required. The local managing partners(s) will be required to prepare a hazardous waste/spill
prevention plan subject to review and approval by Reclamation. Therefore, the potential for
accidental release of potentially hazardous materials or for public exposure to such materials in
toxic amounts is minimal and would not substantially increase. Continued use of potentially
hazardous materials (see Section 3.16), although at a slightly greater level, would result in a
minor impact with respect to hazards.
All of the RMP alternatives include continuation of mowing in the Regional and Community
parks and grazing in the Regional Park to reduce the potential for ignition and spread of wildland
fire. Mowing of grassland areas would continue to reduce fine fuels (e.g., dry grass, small twigs)
that ignite readily and are consumed rapidly. Mowing activities in the Regional Park and the
Community Park by the managing partner(s) would continue to be an important safety practice
(see Section 3.6), but would not reduce hazards below the current conditions and, therefore,
would have no impact with respect to hazards.
Livestock Grazing

Livestock grazing would likely continue in the Regional Park under all of the RMP alternatives.
Grazing of grasslands in the natural environment unit (i.e., the grasslands and rolling hills that
surround the reservoir) of the Regional Park reduces fine fuels (e.g., dry grass, small twigs) that
ignite readily and are consumed rapidly. Grazing in the Regional Park would continue to reduce
fire hazard, but would not reduce hazards below the current conditions and, therefore, would
have no impact with respect to hazards.
Fire and Emergency Preparedness

Included in all RMP alternatives are management actions that require the preparation of fire and
emergency preparedness plans for the Regional Park and the Community Park. Fire and
emergency services will continue to be implemented by the managing partner(s) or they may be
contracted with other local agencies. Use of existing fire and emergency services, and the
development and implementation of fire and emergency preparedness plans, would ensure that
the managing partner(s) and/or other local responsible agencies would continue to provide an
adequate fire suppression strategy and respond appropriately to accidental hazardous materials
spills. The managing partner(s) would continue to provide effective fire and emergency services
to Contra Loma (see Section 3.6). These management actions, therefore, would have no impact
with respect to hazards.

4-90 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Continued maintenance of the Regional Park trail system and annual grading of fire roads would
ensure that all-weather access is provided for fire trucks and other emergency responders into the
Regional Park’s natural environment unit. Continuation of these maintenance activities would
not increase the potential for impacts from hazards beyond the current conditions.
4.15.4 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.15.3.
Livestock Grazing

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.15.3.
Fire and Emergency Preparedness

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.15.3.
4.15.5 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include more recreation and infrastructure facilities than the No Action
Alternative, which could require more maintenance than the No Action Alternative. In addition,
because this alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No
Action Alternative, it could result in more visitor use and require incrementally more
maintenance than the No Action Alternative. Similar to the No Action Alternative, however, the
local managing partners(s) will be required to prepare a hazardous waste/spill prevention plan
subject to review and approval by Reclamation. Therefore, the potential for accidental release of
potentially hazardous materials or for public exposure to such materials in toxic amounts is
minimal. Continued use of potentially hazardous materials for routine facility maintenance and
repairs (see Section 3.16), although at an incrementally greater level, would result in a minor
impact with respect to hazards.
Livestock Grazing

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.15.3; however, this alternative
could increase the total grazing area by 0.3 acre. This small change in grazing area would
incrementally increase the positive effects of grazing on reducing wild fire hazards as compared
to the No Action Alternative. This would be a minor beneficial impact.
Fire and Emergency Preparedness

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and as
discussed in Section 4.15.3.
Facility Improvements

This alternative may include a new fueling station and fuel storage tank for Regional Park
vehicles and equipment as well as for public safety officers. The managing partner(s) would be
required to implement substantial design and operational measures to reduce the potential for the
station to cause an environmental hazard. Only staff trained to safely use the station would be
allowed to operate it, thereby reducing the potential for spills caused by improper use. The
managing partner(s) must design the facility with fuel containment devices to prevent any spilled
4-91 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

fuel from reaching the natural ground surface (i.e., soil), entering the reservoir, or otherwise
causing an environmental hazard. This facility may only be built and operated in compliance
with applicable federal and federally-mandated laws, regulations, and permits. As a condition of
Reclamation’s approval of this facility, the local managing partner(s) will ensure that spill
prevention and decommissioning plans are prepared or amended to address operation of this
facility. These measures would substantially reduce the likelihood of large spills, would ensure
that small spills are cleaned up quickly and effectively, and would ensure that the facility is
decommissioned properly. By implementing these measures, this facility would have a minor
adverse impact with respect to environmental hazards. This impact would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
4.15.6 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include more recreation and infrastructure facilities than the other
alternatives, which could require more maintenance than the other alternatives. In addition,
because this alternative would include more expanded recreation opportunities than the other
alternatives, it could result in more visitor use and require incrementally more maintenance than
the other alternatives. Similar to the other alternatives, however, the local managing partners(s)
will be required to prepare a hazardous waste/spill prevention plan subject to review and
approval by Reclamation. Therefore, the potential for accidental release of potentially hazardous
materials or for public exposure to such materials in toxic amounts is minimal. Continued use of
potentially hazardous materials for routine facility maintenance and repairs (see Section 3.16),
although at an incrementally greater level, would result in a minor impact with respect to
hazards.
Livestock Grazing

In addition to the changes in grazing area described in Section 4.15.5, this alternative may also
include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park and expansion of the
Community Park boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would be excluded from
this area (approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. Therefore, this alternative could
reduce the amount of grazing area within Contra Loma. The new sports fields would either have
an artificial turf surface or would be mowed by the managing partner(s) for the Community Park
to maintain a playing surface. Therefore, the sports fields would pose a similar risk of fire hazard
to grazed annual grassland.
Fire and Emergency Preparedness

The impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action Alternative and addressed
in Section 4.15.3.
Facility Improvements

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.15.5.
4.15.7 Cumulative Impacts
Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
4-92 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Approximately 38 percent of the land within the City (6,383 acres) and nearly 46 percent of the
land within the unincorporated portion of the General Plan study area (2,240 acres) were vacant
in 2003. Buildout of the City and County general plans would convert a substantial amount of
vacant land to urbanized uses.
Facility Maintenance

Increased visitation could incrementally increase the amount of facility maintenance required.
The two action alternatives would require more maintenance than the No Action Alternative. The
local managing partners(s) will be required to prepare a hazardous waste/spill prevention plan
subject to review and approval by Reclamation. Therefore, the potential for accidental release of
hazardous materials or for public exposure to such materials in toxic amounts is minimal and
would not substantially increase. Continued use of potentially hazardous materials, although at a
slightly greater level, would result in a minor cumulative impact with respect to hazards.
Fire And Emergency Preparedness

Increased visitation would incrementally increase the potential for wildland fires. Also, new
housing developments that could be built along the urban/wildland interface could increase the
need for immediate fire suppression and increase the potential for wildfires to spread into Contra
Loma.
Included in all of the alternatives, however, are management actions that require the preparation
of fire and emergency preparedness plans for the Regional Park and the Community Park. Fire
and emergency services would be implemented by the managing partner(s) or they may be
contracted with other local agencies. Use of existing fire and emergency services, and the
development and implementation of fire and emergency preparedness plans, would ensure that
the managing partner(s) and/or other local responsible agencies would continue to provide an
adequate fire suppression strategy. In addition, the City and other surrounding communities
would be expected to maintain adequate service ratios for fire protection, with new staff and
facilities funded through developer fees, bond monies, and taxes on new development. For these
reasons, increased visitation and additional urban growth in surrounding communities would
have a minor cumulative impact with respect to hazards.
4.15.8 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.16 Cultural Resources
4.16.1 Type of Impacts

Cultural resources include prehistoric, historic-era, architectural, and traditional cultural
properties. Cultural resources documented within the APE consist of traces of prehistoric
occupation such as lithic debitage and implement deposits and scatters, and the remains of

4-93 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

historic-era ranching and agricultural activities such as building foundations. Other historic-era
resources found within and near the APE include transportation routes such as the Empire
Railroad, and water storage and conveyance facilities including the Contra Costa Canal and the
Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir. Similar resources could also be present in areas of the APE
not previously subject to archaeological surveys.
Historic properties are defined as prehistoric or historic-era cultural resources that are presently
listed or are eligible for listing on the NRHP. Impacts on historic properties occur when a
management action causes damage or loss of such resources or important contextual aspects of
their character and setting. This section assesses the potential impacts of the RMP alternatives on
historic properties. None of the known cultural resources in Contra Loma have been evaluated
for NRHP eligibility although the dam may be determined eligible for NRHP listing as a
contributing property to the CVP. Also, communication with Native American Tribes did not
yield any specific information about traditional cultural properties or other pertinent Native
American cultural interests in the immediate area. During recent efforts to relocate previously
recorded cultural resource sites, Reclamation’s archaeological consultant observed that some of
these resources had already been affected by previous management activities, such as
construction of the reservoir, the sports fields, and other facilities. However, new impacts in
already-developed portions of the APE (including the Contra Loma Dam and Reservoir) are not
likely to further affect cultural resources. Potential impacts on presently undocumented cultural
resources would be most likely to occur in areas of the APE that have not been subjected to
cultural resources surveys and in subsurface contexts for proposed activities that would require
excavation.
Potential impacts on historic properties could result from four general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Facility Maintenance

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Facility Improvements

4.16.2 Assumptions

This impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

Cultural resources identified in future investigations would be similar to the types already
known to exist within the APE and the immediate surrounding area.

•

The proposed management actions would comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing historic properties.

•

Portions of Contra Loma have been inventoried for historic properties; however, historic
properties may be present in unsurveyed areas or may have remained undiscovered by
previous-surveys;

•

No changes are proposed that would affect Contra Loma Dam.

4.16.3 Impacts Common to All Alternatives
Human Use

Increased visitation would increase the potential for visitors to adversely affect known or
unknown cultural resources. However, none of the known cultural resources in Contra Loma
have been evaluated for NRHP eligibility and outreach with Native American Tribes did not
yield any specific information about traditional cultural properties or other pertinent Native
American cultural interests in the immediate area. Therefore, no adverse impacts on historic
properties or traditional cultural properties are anticipated because no such resources have been
identified within Contra Loma.
If any unidentified historic properties are located within Contra Loma, visitors could affect them
through inadvertent trampling or the unauthorized collecting of archaeological materials. The
majority of human use is concentrated near the developed recreational facilities located along the
south side of the reservoir and within the Community Park. These areas have undergone
substantial alteration, and the likelihood that unidentified historic properties exist in these areas
is very low. In the more remote parts of the Regional Park, visitors are typically dispersed and
practice low-impact activities such as hiking. Therefore, human use in these areas would be less
likely to adversely affect unidentified historic properties than in the more developed recreation
areas. In summary, human use would have a minor impact on unidentified historic properties.
Facility Maintenance

Ongoing routine maintenance activities and repairs of existing facilities by the managing
partner(s) at the Regional Park and the Community Park would, in general, not involve ground
disturbance or otherwise have the potential to cause adverse effects on unidentified historic
properties. Trail maintenance activities in the Regional Park may include annual grading of fire
roads and trails using machinery and hand tools to maintain the quality of the road or trail
surface and maintain proper drainage. Soil disturbance and vegetation removal could
inadvertently impact unidentified historic properties, if any are present. However, it is unlikely
that periodic, routine maintenance activities such as these would have an impact on unidentified
historic properties, because there is no indication that past and present maintenance practices
have adversely affected historic properties. Therefore, no impacts on unidentified historic
properties are anticipated as a result of routine facility maintenance.
4.16.4 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.16.3.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.16.3.
Livestock Grazing

Livestock grazing would likely continue in the Regional Park under the No Action Alternative.
Trampling by livestock and an increased potential for grazing-induced erosion could have an
adverse impact on unidentified historic properties, if present. No substantial change in the
acreage, location, or intensity of grazing is anticipated under this alternative. Continuation of

4-95 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

livestock grazing would not increase the potential for impacts to historic properties beyond the
current condition.
4.16.5 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

The impacts of human use on historic properties are addressed in Section 4.16.3. This alternative
would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action Alternative, which
could result in more visitor use, thereby increasing the potential for visitors to adversely affect
unidentified historic properties.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts of facility maintenance on historic properties are addressed in Section 4.16.3. This
alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the No Action
Alternative, which could require more facility maintenance than the No Action Alternative.
However, it is unlikely that periodic routine maintenance activities such as these would have an
impact on unidentified historic properties for the reasons described above.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative could increase the total grazing area by 0.3 acre. This small change in grazing
area would incrementally increase the potential for impacts to historic properties as compared to
the No Action Alternative, resulting in a minor adverse impact.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded buildings and facilities, such as
restrooms, utility lines, offices, the police substation, a park residence, a communication tower,
and new picnic facilities. While most construction or renovation activities would occur within
the footprint of existing buildings or structures where there would be no impacts on historic
properties, new construction activities such as expansion of parking areas or installation of a new
radio communications tower could affect unidentified historic properties, if any are present.
When specific construction activities are proposed, site-specific environmental analyses would
be conducted that include a more focused assessment of any potential impact on historic
properties. If impacts are identified, the proposed activities may be modified or other mitigation
measures may be implemented to eliminate these impacts when possible (see Section 4.16.8,
Mitigation Measure Cultural-1). These impacts would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
4.16.6 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

The impacts of human use on historic properties are addressed in Section 4.16.3. This alternative
would include more expanded recreation opportunities than the other two alternatives, which
could result in more visitor use. This alternative, therefore, could increase the potential for
visitors to adversely affect unidentified historic properties beyond what is expected under the
other two alternatives, if any are located where a disc golf course or new trails might be built.
Please refer to the discussion of Facility Improvements later in this section for an analysis of this
issue.
4-96 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Facility Maintenance

The impacts of facility maintenance on historic properties are addressed in Section 4.16.3. This
alternative would include more enhanced recreation opportunities than the other two alternatives,
which could require more facility maintenance. However, it is unlikely that periodic routine
maintenance activities such as these would have an impact on unidentified historic properties for
the reasons described above.
Livestock Grazing

The impacts of grazing on historic properties are addressed in Section 4.16.3. However, this
alternative may also include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park
and expansion of the Community Park boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would
be excluded from this area (approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. Therefore, this
alternative could reduce the amount of grazing area within Contra Loma, thereby reducing the
potential for grazing to adversely affect unidentified historic properties. The construction of new
sports fields, however, could affect unidentified historic properties. This issue is discussed in
Facility Improvements section below. These effects would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction of new or expanded recreation facilities in addition
to those that would be built under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. This
alternative may include signage and/or kiosks and programs that provide interpretive
opportunities focusing on historic areas within Contra Loma and natural resources of importance
to local Native American groups.
Other facilities proposed under this alternative include expansion of the swim lagoon in the
Regional Park and construction of two additional sports fields in the Community Park. Most
expansion activities would occur in previously disturbed areas and would likely have no impact
on unidentified historic properties. However, construction of the new sports fields and related
parking areas would require substantial grading and other soil disturbance activities in previously
undisturbed areas. Construction of these facilities could potentially affect unidentified historic
properties, if any are present. Such effects would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative may also include construction of a disc golf course in an unimproved part of the
Regional Park. Potential locations may include the gently rolling land east of the reservoir,
gently sloping land near the southwest corner of the reservoir, and the southeast portion of the
Regional Park directly north of Frederickson Lane. Construction of the disc golf course would
involve a small amount of ground disturbance, and its use would increase visitation in lessfrequently used areas of the Regional Park. A known prehistoric site (CA-CCo-572) is located in
an area where the disc golf course may be built and it could be affected by construction and use
of the disc golf course. This site has not been assessed as to NRHP listing eligibility; however,
there is a possibility that presently unidentified components of CA-CCo-572 exist in subsurface
contexts that could contribute to the site being eligible for NRHP listing. Construction activities
could disturb or destroy such materials and adversely affect the site’s NRHP eligibility.
Consequently, unnecessary effects to this resource should be avoided if possible. Avoiding
unnecessary effects on this site would be consistent with RMP goals.

4-97 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

This alternative may also include construction of new recreational trails for bike, equestrian, and
pedestrian use. New trail construction could cause ground disturbance that could adversely affect
unidentified historic properties, and could affect the known prehistoric site (CA-CCo-572). Also,
construction of a new trail in the vicinity of this prehistoric site could increase public access to
this area and increase the potential for unauthorized collecting of or damage to archaeological
materials.
When specific construction activities are proposed, site-specific environmental analyses would
be conducted that include a more focused assessment of any potential impact on historic
properties. If impacts are identified, the proposed activities may be modified or other mitigation
measures may be implemented to eliminate these impacts when possible (see Section 4.16.8,
Mitigation Measure Cultural-1). These impacts would not occur under the No Action
Alternative.
4.16.7 Cumulative Impacts

Cultural resource surveys, data base reviews, and tribal outreach efforts have not identified
cultural resources that have been determined or recommended eligible for NRHP listing or
traditional cultural properties. Unless unidentified historic properties are present within Contra
Loma that would be affected by management actions included in the RMP, none of the
alternatives would contribute to a cumulative impact on historic properties.
4.16.8 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation Measure Cultural-1: Implement measures to protect unidentified historic
properties during construction activities.

Prior to the implementation of undertakings incorporating potential ground-disturbing activities
in un-surveyed areas of Contra Loma, Reclamation and the local managing partner(s) proposing
the activity will follow the Section 106 process as outlined in 36 CFR, Part 800. These
regulations, which describe implementation of Section 106 of the NHPA, call for consultation
with the State Historic Preservation Officer, Indian Tribes, and interested members of the public
throughout the Section 106 compliance process. The four principal steps are:
•

initiate the Section 106 process (36 CFR, Part 800.3),

•

identify historic properties (36 CFR, Part 800.4),

•

assess the effects of the undertaking on historic properties within the APE (36 CFR, Part
800.5), and

•

resolve adverse effects (36 CFR, Part 800.6).

The identification step would consist of a cultural resources inventory to document any historic
properties that could be affected by the proposed activities. Reclamation is responsible for Native
American community and public consultation and will modify undertakings if possible to avoid
historic properties and make every effort to avoid other cultural resources. In addition,
Reclamation, in cooperation with local managing partner(s) will ensure compliance with Section
106 of the NHPA prior to undertaking authorization.

4-98 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Cultural resources and human remains are also protected according to the provisions of the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) and the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The ARPA strengthened the permitting procedures
required for conducting archeological fieldwork on federal lands, originally mandated by the
Antiquities Act of 1906. It also establishes rigorous fines and penalties for unauthorized
excavation on or the removal of archaeological materials from federal land.
ARPA is important from the standpoint of managing archeological collections because it:
•

acknowledges federal ownership of objects excavated from federal lands;

•

calls for the preservation of objects and associated records in a "suitable" institution and,

•

prohibits public disclosure of information concerning the nature and location of
archeological resources that require a permit or other permission under ARPA for their
excavation or removal.

NAGPRA requires federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funding to return Native
American "cultural items" to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native
organizations. NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned
excavation of Native American cultural items and human remains on federal or tribal lands.
While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the
collection provisions of NAGPRA may apply to Native American cultural items if they come
under the control of an institution that receives federal funding. In addition, NAGPRA makes it a
criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in
Native American cultural items obtained in violation of NAGPRA.

4.17 Socioeconomics
4.17.1 Types of Impacts

This impact analysis includes consideration of the local and regional demographic characteristics
and economies that could be affected by existing and proposed land management actions within
Contra Loma. This section assesses the potential impacts of the RMP alternatives on
socioeconomics with regard to proposed management actions and resource use. For the purpose
of this assessment, socioeconomic impacts were not modeled quantitatively and were not derived
using dollar values. Rather, impacts are described in qualitative terms.
Potential impacts on socioeconomics could result from four general types of activities:
•

Human Use

•

Facility Maintenance

•

Livestock Grazing

•

Facility Improvements

4-99 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

4.17.2 Assumptions

The socioeconomic impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:
•

The managing partner(s) would uphold their responsibilities to provide the standard of
care necessary to ensure that public recreation facilities are reasonably available and
maintained for the benefit of visitors to Contra Loma. These agencies would provide staff
levels commensurate with recreation visitation to ensure implementation of the policies
and management actions intended to maintain the level and quality of safety and services
expected by visitors to the Regional Park and the Community Park.

•

Visitation to Contra Loma would continue to increase regardless of the selected
alternative, requiring an increased level of facility management.

•

Because Contra Loma is a regional facility, most visitors live within about a one-hour
driving radius. Therefore, the effect of visitation to Contra Loma on the local economy is
limited to incidental expenditures such as gasoline, occasional meals, and consumable
recreational supplies as opposed to tourism involving overnight stays and multiple,
successive meals.

•

Staffing of Contra Loma creates employment, thereby improving the local and regional
economies.

•

Facility and recreational improvements create temporary construction-related jobs,
thereby improving the local and regional economies.

•

Increased population growth would stimulate economic activity and improve local
economies.

•

None of the RMP alternatives would result in a direct change in population or the
demand for housing, schools, public facilities, or public services outside of Contra Loma.

4.17.3 Impacts Common to All Alternatives
Human Use

Visitor use of Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP alternatives.
Management actions included in all the RMP alternatives would be implemented to ensure
continued public health and safety as well as continued operation of existing facilities and
activities, thereby ensuring a positive recreation experience for park visitors. Positive visitor
experiences would encourage continued or increased visitation. Use fees charged for various
visitor use activities (e.g., boat launch, swim area, parking, league sports) would continue to be a
consistent source of revenue that keeps pace with ever-increasing park use (see Section 3.3).
Increased human use of Contra Loma would likely require increased levels of staffing and
concessions, thereby creating jobs and stimulating business opportunities within Contra Loma.
Increased employment and business revenues would directly and indirectly benefit many sectors
of the local and regional economies. Increased human use of Contra Loma would have a net
beneficial socioeconomic impact, although increasing use fees could impair the affordability of
some uses for members of low-income populations.

4-100 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

Included in all RMP alternatives is a commitment by the managing partner(s) to provide and
manage a recreational fishing program at the Regional Park’s reservoir. The local managing
partner(s) for the Regional Park will continue to provide a recreational fishing program in the
reservoir and to manage fish populations through fish planting (i.e., stocking) programs. In 2011
in California, $2.3 billion was spent on fishing recreation, of which $1.6 billion was for triprelated expenditures, $577 million was for equipment purchases, and $71 million was for the
purchase of other items, such as magazines, membership dues, licenses, permits, stamps, and
land leasing and ownership. The average expenditure per angler was $1,333 and the average
angler trip expenditure per day was $68. In California, in 2012, sales generated by sport fishing
licenses totaled $56,959,464 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2013b). Fishing at
Contra Loma contributes to the local economy through sales of fishing supplies such as bait,
tackle, and equipment resulting in a beneficial socioeconomic impact.
Facility Maintenance

In order to maintain existing land uses, all RMP alternatives would include ongoing routine
maintenance activities and repairs of existing facilities by the managing partner(s) at the
Regional Park and the Community Park. Anticipated increases in visitation would increase the
frequency and amount of maintenance that would be required to meet the public’s expectations
and enjoyment of park facilities and recreational opportunities. Increased facility maintenance
and repair could have a minor beneficial socioeconomic impact on the region because the
managing partner(s) would need to purchase additional supplies and services.
4.17.4 Impacts Specific to the No Action Alternative
Human Use

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.17.3.
Facility Maintenance

The impacts would be the same as those addressed in Section 4.17.3.
Livestock Grazing

Livestock grazing would likely continue in the Regional Park under this alternative. The local
managing partner(s) for the Regional Park would likely continue to collect fees to cover
administrative costs; however, no increase in grazing acreage or intensity would occur.
Consequently, there would be no change from current socioeconomic conditions.
4.17.5 Impacts Specific to the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations that could increase the
public’s enjoyment and use of the Regional Park and the Community Park. These improvements
would likely attract more visitors than the No Action Alternative. Although there could be an
increase in visitor use, the impacts would be the same as those expected under the No Action
Alternative and addressed in Section 4.17.3.
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations that could increase the
public’s enjoyment and use of the Regional Park and the Community Park. These improvements
4-101 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

would likely attract more visitors and require more maintenance than the No Action Alternative.
Increased facility maintenance and repair could have a minor beneficial socioeconomic impact
on the region because the managing partner(s) would need to purchase additional supplies and
services similar to the No Action Alternative.
Livestock Grazing

Under this alternative, adjustment of the boundary lines between the Regional Park and
Community Park could result in an overall increase of approximately 0.3 acre of grazing in
Contra Loma. This would represent a negligible increase in grazing area of 0.07 percent. Any
increase in grazing revenue from this additional grazing area would also be negligible and would
not change socioeconomic conditions.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include construction, expansion, or renovation of recreation and
infrastructure facilities for the purpose of improving operation and enjoyment of Contra Loma.
These improvements would not be built under the No Action Alternative. Recreational facility
improvements may include structures and facilities for classes, such as a low-income youth swim
program; improved fishing docks, cleaning stations, and a boat launch that would increase the
desirability of fishing opportunities at the reservoir; the addition of picnic sites within the
reservoir’s recreation cluster; and improvements to the Community Park sports fields. These
improvements would increase Contra Loma’s attractiveness to a wide variety of visitors,
including minority and low-income populations, and may increase the desirability of buying or
renting a home in the local area. This, in turn, could increase housing costs in the local area. This
effect would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
This alternative also includes a management action to increase the frequency of fish stocking in
the reservoir from current levels in order to meet demand. Fishing at the reservoir provides
important social benefits for some populations in the region. Increasing fisheries resources would
benefit the local economy by increasing the desirability of the reservoir as a fishing destination;
therefore, resulting in a beneficial socioeconomic impact that would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
Facility improvements at the Regional Park and Community Park would create temporary
construction-related jobs and increase the amount the services and supplies purchased by the
local managing partner(s). Facility improvements would contribute to the local and regional
economies, resulting in temporary beneficial socioeconomic impacts that would not occur under
the No Action Alternative.
4.17.6 Impacts Specific to the Expanded Recreation and Facilities Alternative
Human Use

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations beyond those proposed
under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative, such as a new disc golf course,
expansion of the swim lagoon at the Regional Park, and two new sports fields at the Community
Park. These improvements would further increase the public’s enjoyment and use of the
Regional Park and the Community Park and would likely attract more visitors than the other
alternatives. Increased human use would have a beneficial socioeconomic impact through

4-102 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

increased job creation potential and revenue generation at Contra Loma and in the surrounding
communities that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
Facility Maintenance

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations beyond those proposed
under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. These improvements would likely
attract more visitors and require more maintenance than the other alternatives. Increased facility
maintenance and repair could have a beneficial socioeconomic impact on the region because the
managing partner(s) would need to purchase additional supplies and services that would be
needed under the No Action Alternative and as described in Section 4.17.3.
Livestock Grazing

This alternative may include the addition of two new sports fields within the Community Park
and expansion of the Community Park boundaries south into the Regional Park. Livestock would
be excluded from this area (approximately 15 acres), which is currently grazed. In conjunction
with the potential boundary change between the parks, this expansion would result in a net
reduction of grazing in Contra Loma by 14.7 acres. This would reduce grazing within Contra
Loma by about 3 percent, thus reducing grazing revenues by about 3 percent. This reduction of
grazing land would cause a negligible (about 0.01 percent) decrease in the amount of active
pasture and range land within the County as compared to the No Action Alternative. This
alternative would have a minor adverse socioeconomic effect with respect to livestock grazing.
Facility Improvements

This alternative would include facility improvements and renovations beyond those proposed
under the Enhanced Recreation and Facilities Alternative. These improvements would likely
attract more visitors and require more maintenance than the other alternatives. Facility
improvements would cause beneficial impacts that would not occur under the No Action
Alternative for the same reasons discussed in Section 4.17.5.
4.17.7 Cumulative Impacts
Increased Visitation, Concurrent Improvements, and Land Use Changes

As discussed previously, visitation to Contra Loma is expected to continue to increase under all
of the alternatives with more visitation expected under the two action alternatives than the No
Action Alternative. A substantial portion of the expected future visitor increase would be
attributable to the projected population increase expected to occur within the northeastern portion
of the County from buildout of the City and County general plans. The improvements to sports
fields 4 and 5 and the boat launch area upgrades will increase visitation to Contra Loma.
Human Use

The cumulative increase in visitation would likely require increased levels of staffing and
concessions, thereby creating jobs and stimulating business opportunities within Contra Loma.
Increased employment and business revenues would benefit many sectors of the local and
regional economies. This would result in a beneficial cumulative impact. The Expanded
Recreation and Facilities Alternative would have a greater effect than the other alternatives
because it would attract more visitors.

4-103 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Facility Maintenance

Increased visitation would increase the need for facility maintenance and repair, which could
have a minor cumulative beneficial socioeconomic impact on the region because the managing
partner(s) would need to purchase additional supplies and services. The two action alternatives
would have a greater effect than the No Action Alternative because they would require more
facility maintenance.
Facility Improvements

The two action alternatives would include construction, expansion, or renovation of recreation
and infrastructure facilities. These improvements, along with the improvements to sports fields 4
and 5 and the boat launch area, would increase Contra Loma’s attractiveness to a wide variety of
visitors, including minority and low-income populations, and may increase the desirability of
buying or renting a home in the local area. This, in turn, could increase housing costs in the local
area. This cumulative adverse effect would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
The facility improvements included in the two action alternatives, along with the boat launch
improvements, would create temporary construction-related jobs and increase the amount the
services and supplies purchased by the local managing partner(s). Facility improvements would
contribute to the local and regional economies, resulting in temporary beneficial cumulative
impacts that would not occur under the No Action Alternative.
4.17.8 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.18 Environmental Justice
4.18.1 Types of Impacts

This impact analysis considers whether the RMP alternatives could cause disproportionately high
and adverse impacts to minority and/or low-income populations. Federal agencies are required to
include analysis of environmental justice in their EISs.
Potential impacts to environmental justice populations could result from four general types of
activities:
•

Human Use

•

Facility Improvements

•

Facility Maintenance

•

Low-Income Recreational Programs

4.18.2 Assumptions

The environmental justice impact analysis is based on the following assumptions:

4-104 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

•

“Minority population” is defined as including all non-white racial groups and Hispanics
of any racial group. “Low-income” population is defined based on federal poverty
thresholds (Council of Environmental Quality 1997).

•

The managing partner(s) would uphold their responsibilities to provide the standard of
care necessary to ensure that public recreation facilities are reasonably available and
maintained for the benefit of visitors to Contra Loma. These agencies would provide staff
levels commensurate with recreation visitation to ensure implementation of the policies
and management actions intended to maintain the level and quality of safety and services
expected by visitors to the Regional Park and the Community Park.

•

Visitation to Contra Loma would continue to increase regardless of the selected
alternative.

•

Facility and recreational improvements create temporary construction-related jobs.

4.18.3 Impacts – All Alternatives

Although some residents in the general vicinity of Contra Loma have incomes below the poverty
level, the proportion of low-income households within the community is not high enough to be
considered a low-income population. According to the Census Bureau, the proportions of
households within the County and the City that have incomes below the poverty level are
relatively low at 8.6 and 12.5 percent, respectively, and do not constitute a majority. These
percentages are lower than the state average of 13.2 percent (Census Bureau 2009; Fannie Mae
2011). Therefore, none of the alternatives would disproportionately affect low-income
populations.
According to the Council on Environmental Quality, minority populations should be identified
where either: (a) the minority population of the affected area exceeds 50 percent; or, (b) the
minority population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully greater than the minority
population percentage in the general population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis
(Council of Environmental Quality 1997).
The minority population in the City exceeds 50 percent, which is a higher proportion than the
County. In 2010, the percentage of non-Hispanic minorities in the City totaled 51.1 percent and
people of Hispanic ethnicity comprised 31.7 percent of the City’s population. In comparison, the
percentage of non-Hispanic minorities in the County totaled 41.4 percent and people of Hispanic
ethnicity comprised 24.4 percent of the County’s population in 2010. Although the population in
the general vicinity of Contra Loma includes a relatively high proportion of minorities, none of
the alternatives would cause dislocation, adverse changes in employment, or increase flood,
drought, or disease and none would disproportionately impact economically disadvantaged or
minority populations in an adverse manner.
No private residences are located within Contra Loma; therefore, none of the alternatives include
any land use changes that would directly cause people to move or otherwise be dislocated from
their residences. Offsite effects of the RMP alternatives include minor noise increases near
Contra Loma and more vehicles using public roads to access Contra Loma. As discussed in
Sections 4.4 and 4.13, these offsite impacts would be minor; therefore, they would not be

4-105 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

expected to indirectly cause people to move from their residences. None of the census tracts
nearest Contra Loma (i.e., those most likely to be affected by these offsite effects) are comprised
of more than 50 percent minorities (Census Bureau 2010c). Therefore, these minor impacts
would not disproportionately affect minority populations.
As discussed previously, all of the alternatives have the potential to increase employment and
business opportunities within Contra Loma and in the surrounding communities. None of the
alternatives would reduce or eliminate employment opportunities.
All of the alternatives would include management actions that encourage continued use of
Contra Loma’s recreational facilities by low-income groups (e.g., low-income youth swimming
programs), thereby benefiting low-income individuals.
4.18.4 Cumulative Impacts

None of the alternatives would disproportionately affect low-income populations or cause
dislocation, adverse changes in employment, or increase flood, drought, or disease and none
would disproportionately impact economically disadvantaged or minority populations in an
adverse manner. Therefore, none of the alternatives would contribute to a cumulative adverse
impact with respect to environmental justice.
4.18.5 Mitigation Measures

No need for mitigation has been identified.

4.19 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts
NEPA Section 102(2)(c)(ii) requires the environmental analysis in an EIS to identify any
unavoidable adverse impacts, defined as those impacts of an action that cannot be avoided, either
by changing the nature of the action or through mitigation if the action in undertaken. Based on
the analysis presented in EIS Sections 4.2 through 4.17, the RMP would result in several
unavoidable adverse impacts, although all adverse impacts would be minor or could be mitigated
to a minor level.
Visitor use to Contra Loma is expected to increase under all of the RMP alternatives for the
foreseeable future. Increased visitation would result in many types of unavoidable adverse
impacts, such as increased risk of conflict between various user groups and between recreational
activities and grazing; increased vehicle congestion on internal park roads and public roads
leading to Contra Loma; increased demand for parking spaces; increased volumes of air
pollutants, including GHGs, generated by visitor vehicles; increased volumes of PM generated
by additional use of trails and barbecue grills; increased demand for utilities such as water,
wastewater disposal, and electricity; increased risk of littering, trampled vegetation, scarred
terrain, vandalism, and facility deterioration, which could impair the visual quality of the
landscape; increased risk of accidental releases or inadvertent public contact with potentially
hazardous materials used for construction and maintenance activities; increased risk of damage
to known or unknown cultural resources; increased risk of water quality impacts from
unauthorized human contact with the reservoir; increased risk of water quality and public health
impacts from increased volumes of solid, human, and domestic animal (e.g., dogs and horses)

4-106 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

waste; increased erosion and sedimentation from trail use; increased risk of damage to sensitive
vegetation communities and wildlife habitats; increased risk of introduction or spread of invasive
or noxious non-native plant or animal species (e.g., zebra or quagga mussels); increased risk of
human disturbance to wildlife caused by noise impacts or simply by human presence; and
increased pressure on the recreational fishery resources.
Maintenance activities would continue under all of the alternatives. The two action alternatives
would include construction of new or renovated facilities which, in turn, would require
additional maintenance. Maintenance and construction activities can cause short-term and longterm unavoidable adverse impacts. New construction can cause impacts to vegetation from
vegetation removal within the structure footprint, overcovering for spoils deposition, or erosion.
Ground disturbing activity can also affect wildlife through direct mortality, noise, contact with
inadvertent chemical spills, and impacts to habitat. Most of the affected vegetation is expected to
be non-native annual grassland; however, other sensitive vegetation communities could be
affected.
Construction activities could affect water quality through erosion and sedimentation, a temporary
increase in reservoir turbidity due to runoff from construction areas, or inadvertent spilling of
construction-related chemicals. Increased use of mechanized equipment would generate
additional air pollutants, including GHGs and PM. Ground disturbance could also damage
known or previously undiscovered cultural resources.
The new or renovated facilities proposed under the two action alternatives could also cause other
unavoidable adverse impacts. Some of the facilities would convert vegetation communities to
recreational or administrative land uses, thereby reducing the amount of wildlife habitat within
the Regional Park. Most of the affected vegetation is expected to be non-native annual grassland;
however, other sensitive vegetation communities could be affected. Some of the facility
improvements would change Contra Loma’s visual setting and possibly impair its visual
character in some locations. For example, a new communications tower could be visible from
viewpoints in many areas of Contra Loma, and from some offsite locations. Also, floodlights for
the proposed sports fields could produce nighttime glare or a general skyglow that may be visible
from some nearby residences. The new sports fields would increase ambient noise in the vicinity
of the Community Park and would exclude livestock grazing from about 15 acres of land that is
currently grazed. This would permanently reduce the amount of grazing land available within
Contra Loma. New or expanded facilities would increase demand for utilities such as water,
wastewater disposal, and electricity and would increase energy demand, which could generate
increased volumes of air pollutants, including GHGs.

4.20 Irreversible or Irretrievable Commitment of Resources
NEPA Section 102(2)(c)(v) requires the environmental analysis in an EIS to identify any
irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources that would be involved in the proposed
action should it be implemented. Reclamation and other Federal agencies have interpreted
irreversible and irretrievable commitments to mean the use of nonrenewable resources and the
effects this use would have for the future.

4-107 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

An irreversible commitment of resources refers to a loss of future opportunities associated
primarily with nonrenewable resources, such as mineral, soils, or cultural resources. The effects
of project actions on nonrenewable resources are usually permanent, although in some cases the
resource could be restored over a long period of time and possibly at great expense. Mineral
extraction, destruction of cultural resources, and species extinction are examples of irreversible
commitments.
An irretrievable commitment of resources occurs when there is a loss of opportunity for
production, harvest, or use of nonrenewable resources. Typically, these opportunities are
forfeited while the proposed action is being implemented. During this period, use of the resource
cannot be realized. Land conversion to a use that would prevent extraction of underground
minerals and construction of a levee preventing beneficial flooding of flood plains to replenish
soil fertility are examples of irretrievable commitments.
The principal nonrenewable resources within Contra Loma include cultural resources and
special-status species. Open space and views of undeveloped, natural landscapes may also be
considered nonrenewable resources within Contra Loma. Coal and sand mining historically
occurred within the adjacent Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve until unfavorable market
conditions caused the mines to cease production. Coal, sand, and other mineral resources could
also underlie Contra Loma.
Implementation of the RMP would not result in an irreversible or irretrievable commitment of
cultural resources or special-status species because the RMP includes goals and management
actions to effectively manage these resources, because none of the alternatives includes actions
that would require use or elimination of these resources, and because the EIS includes mitigation
measures to protect cultural resources and special-status species.
The RMP would irretrievably commit open space and views of undeveloped, natural landscapes
within Contra Loma because many of the RMP management actions would include recreation or
facility improvements. Most of the improvements would be visible to varying degrees and
depending on their location and setting, some improvements would irreversibly change views of
undeveloped, natural landscapes to other uses consistent with the management and operation of a
public recreation area. However, the RMP includes management actions requiring certain
improvements (i.e., radio communication facilities) to be sited and designed in a manner that
minimizes impacts to the Regional Park’s aesthetic character. In addition, the EIS includes
mitigation measures requiring the managing partner(s) to implement design measures to reduce
visual impacts from new development.
If coal, sand, or other mineral resources underlie Contra Loma, the RMP would cause an
irretrievable commitment these resources because the RMP would not allow mining to occur
within Contra Loma. Similar to the historic mining that occurred within Black Diamond Mines
Regional Preserve, however, market conditions would likely not be favorable for extracting these
resources even if they were present and mining were allowed in Contra Loma.
The RMP would not cause any other irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources.

Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences

4.21 Relationship of Short-Term Uses of the Environment to
Long-Term Productivity
NEPA Section 102(2)(c)(iv) requires an EIS to discuss the relationship between local short-term
uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity. In
other words, an EIS should include a discussion of long-term effects versus short-term effects,
regardless of whether such effects are adverse or beneficial. Short-term effects are expected to
occur while various management actions are being implemented (i.e., constructed). Long-term
effects are those effects expected to continue for an extended period after implementation of a
management action. They may or may not extend beyond the 25-year planning horizon of the
RMP.
The previous sections of Chapter 4 evaluated the environmental impacts of implementing each of
the alternatives and identified short-term effects and long-term effects, when applicable.
Regardless of which alternative is selected, certain management activities would result in various
short-term adverse effects from construction activities such as increased localized soil erosion,
air pollutant emissions affecting air quality, damage to vegetation and to fish and wildlife habitat,
and decreased visual resource quality. These short-term adverse effects from construction
activities would lead to long-term beneficial effects such as improved recreational opportunities,
replacement of portable chemical toilets with permanent restrooms, improved radio
communications for public service personnel, the use of solar panels to decrease dependency on
commercial electricity, improved safety from construction of a “safe swim” area or splash pad
for small children at the swim lagoon, improved accessibility from ADA upgrades, improved
aesthetics from replacement of deteriorating facilities, and socioeconomic benefits from facility
improvements, maintenance, and increased visitation. Therefore, the short-term adverse effects
from temporary construction activities would improve the productivity of Contra Loma’s
recreational resources, the ability of the local managing partner(s) to manage Contra Loma, and
the economic productivity of the local economy.
Many of the proposed management actions would result in long-term adverse effects. For
example, construction of new facilities would convert wildlife habitat and grazing land to
recreational or administrative uses, thereby causing a long-term reduction of the productivity of
Contra Loma’s wildlife habitat and grazing land. Construction of new facilities would also
change Contra Loma’s visual setting and possibly impair its visual character in some locations.
However, these long-term adverse effects would improve the productivity of Contra Loma’s
recreational resources, the ability of the local managing partner(s) to manage Contra Loma, and
the economic productivity of the local economy.
As discussed in the previous sections of Chapter 4, most of the RMP’s long-term adverse effects
would be minor and the remainder would be mitigated to a minor level.

Chapter 5. Consultation, Coordination, and Cooperation

Chapter 5. Consultation, Coordination, and
Cooperation
This chapter describes the history of relevant public involvement and agency coordination
activities that have taken place and that will take place during the planning and preparation of
this RMP/EIS.

5.1

Public Involvement

Public involvement is a critical element in developing the RMP. Reclamation’s goal is to gain
input from a cross section of the user public and stakeholders, including the current local
managing partners. A Notice of Intent to prepare the RMP/EIS was published in the Federal
Register on November 12, 2009. Reclamation conducted public outreach in 2010 and 2011 to
explain the scope and objectives of the Contra Loma RMP and to encourage comments from the
public and stakeholders, including EBRPD, the City, CCWD, about the issues that should be
addressed in the RMP and evaluated in the EIS. Reclamation held a scoping meeting for the
Contra Loma RMP/EIS on February 8, 2010, at the Nick Rodriguez Community Center in
Antioch. Reclamation also held a public workshop on August 4, 2010, at Sutter Elementary
School in Antioch to seek ideas, concerns, and comments to inform development of the
RMP/EIS. Written scoping comments were solicited by Reclamation from February 8 through
22, 2010 and from August 4 through 31, 2010. On March 3, 2011, Reclamation held a second
public workshop at Prewett Community Center in Antioch to solicit comments on the conceptual
draft packages of RMP actions and alternatives.
Attendance at the three public meetings/workshops totaled 59 participants: 20 people attended
the scoping meeting, 26 attended the August 4, 2010 workshop, and 13 people attended the
March 3, 2011 workshop. Some participants attended more than one meeting or workshop. Some
attendees at the scoping meeting and the March 3, 2011 workshop provided verbal comments,
which were recorded by hand and are summarized in Appendix D. Written comments were
received from the following public agencies and elected officials:
•

The Office of U.S. Congressman John Garamendi

•

The Office of County Supervisor Federal D. Glover

•

East Bay Regional Park District

•

Contra Costa Water District

•

Antioch City Council

•

Antioch Parks and Recreation Commission

•

City of Antioch Recreation Department

5-1 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

Comments were received from the following nongovernmental organizations or representatives
of such organizations:
•

Delta Youth Soccer League

•

Turf and Track Group

•

St. Anthony Church

•

Village Community Resource Center

In addition, Reclamation developed a mailing list (and accompanying database), produced and
distributed flyers and public notices, and posted project updates and information on
Reclamation’s Contra Loma RMP/EIS website and the EBRPD website listed below.
•

www.usbr.gov/mp/nepa/nepa_projdetails.cfm?Project_ID=6396

•

www.ebparks.org/

Based on the comments received and its own review of the issues, Reclamation identified the
following primary issue areas to be addressed in the RMP:
•

recreational facilities and opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park,

•

infrastructure and administrative facilities at Contra Loma Regional Park,

•

facility management at Contra Loma Regional Park,

•

recreational facilities and opportunities at Antioch Community Park,

•

facility management at Antioch Community Park,

•

reservoir management and reservoir water quality, and

•

pasture vegetation management at Contra Loma Regional Park.

Reclamation also identified the following sub-issue areas within the primary issue areas:
•

swim lagoon;

•

fishing;

•

reservoir recreation (non-fishing);

•

trail system;

•

sports fields;

•

other recreation;

•

restrooms;

•

buildings, structures, and other infrastructure;

5-2 DRAFT – May 2014

Chapter 5. Consultation, Coordination, and Cooperation

•

litter, animal feces, and graffiti;

•

staffing and security;

•

reservoir level fluctuation;

•

reservoir water quality; and

•

aquatic invasive species.

In December 2010, Reclamation prepared an Issues and Opportunities Report that provided a
summary of public comments and the issues that were raised during the scoping meeting and the
first public workshop in August 2010.
Reclamation prepared an Issues and Opportunities Report summarizing the public comments and
issues raised during the scoping meeting and the first public workshop in August 2010. The
report is included as Appendix A and provides a summary of written and verbal comments
provided by agencies, organizations, and individuals (Bureau of Reclamation 2010).
Summaries of the public meetings and workshops and copies of the public notices are provided
in Appendix D.
Reclamation will post the Draft RMP/EIS for a 60-day public review period to solicit written
comments. Reclamation will also hold a public meeting to receive public comments on the Draft
RMP/EIS. Comments received and responses to public comments will be included in the Final
RMP/EIS.

5.2

Cooperating Agencies

No cooperating agencies were invited to formally participate in preparation of this EIS.
However, Reclamation coordinated extensively with the EBRPD, the City, and CCWD
throughout the course of the RMP planning process. These agencies contributed to the RMP/EIS
by providing data, planning documents, technical expertise, and anecdotal information based on
many years of experience managing natural and cultural resources at Contra Loma. In addition,
all of these agencies attended the scoping meeting and participated in the RMP workshops. In
addition, federally-recognized Indian Tribes were consulted during preparation of the Contra
Loma Recreation Area Cultural Resources Technical Report.

5.3

Other Environmental Compliance

The RMP includes recommendations for various resource management actions and facility
improvement projects. These are specific actions that may be implemented at Contra Loma to
meet the RMP goals. These management actions and projects are defined at a conceptual or
programmatic level in the RMP. More detailed descriptions of the actions and projects will be
developed during the planning horizon of the RMP. The responsibility for funding, designing,

5-3 DRAFT – May 2014

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement

and implementing (or constructing) the management actions and improvement projects will be
specified in financial assistance agreements with the local managing partner(s).
Should the local managing partner(s) choose to implement management actions that involve new
or expanded recreational activities or facilities identified in the RMP, such as new fishing docks
in the reservoir or new sewer lines to connect the Regional Park sanitary facilities to the City’s
wastewater treatment system, they would be required to conduct an appropriate site specific
environmental review. The local managing partner(s) would need to receive Reclamation
approval and project-specific environmental documentation would be prepared to meet NEPA
and other Federal environmental requirements. In addition, local managing partner(s) will need
to satisfy CEQA requirements.
The actions described in this RMP/EIS have been analyzed at a programmatic level. Given this
level of specificity additional environmental compliance maybe required when specific projects
described in this document are implemented. Consultations with the State Historic Preservation
Office and affected Indian Tribes pursuant to the NHPA could be required during
implementation of individual projects. Consultation with the USFWS would be initiated if
Reclamation determines that any proposed projects, when identified, may affect listed species.

Introduction
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is developing a Resource
Management Plan (RMP) for the Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
(Contra Loma) in Antioch, Contra Costa County, California. The Contra Loma
RMP will be a long-term plan to guide management of the reservoir, the
recreation areas, and surrounding lands owned by Reclamation. The RMP is
being developed based on a comprehensive inventory of environmental
resources and facilities; input from the current local managing partners (i.e., the
East Bay Regional Park District [EBRPD], the City of Antioch [the City], and
the Contra Costa Water District [CCWD]); and input from the public. The
primary emphasis of the RMP is to protect water supply, water quality, and
natural resources, while enhancing recreational uses.
The overall objective of this RMP is to establish a set of management
objectives, goals, and actions to be implemented by Reclamation, either directly
or through its management agreement(s) that will:
•

establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote
organized use, development, and management of the Contra Loma
Reservoir and the surrounding recreation area lands compatible with
applicable federal and state laws;

•

protect the water supply and water-quality functions of Contra Loma
Reservoir;

•

protect and enhance natural and cultural resources in and around the
reservoir, consistent with federal law and Reclamation policies;

•

provide recreational opportunities and facilities to enhance and develop
management strategies, consistent with Reclamation policies, and state
water policies; and

•

provide guidance for future decision making.

Contra Loma Reservoir was constructed as part of the Central Valley Project
and is managed by Reclamation’s Mid-Pacific Region through its South-Central
California Area Office. The reservoir receives water from the Contra Costa
Canal and stores it until it is released back to the canal via gravity flow. The
reservoir is primarily used as a regulating reservoir for peak or short-term
municipal water supplies for CCWD customers, for emergency storage, and as a
backup water supply during maintenance of upstream facilities. The CCWD
operates and maintains the reservoir and manages its water level. EBRPD is
responsible for managing the surrounding recreational lands as provided for

1

under a management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD. On
September 19, 1972, Reclamation transferred responsibility of land use
management and development, construction, and maintenance of public
recreational facilities to EBRPD. The City operates and manages the Antioch
Community Park in the northwestern portion of Contra Loma under a license
agreement with EBRPD, granted in January 1990. EBRPD, CCWD, and the
City are the current managing partners for Contra Loma.
The management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD expires on
December 31, 2010. Reclamation issued an extension on December 6, 2010 to
extend the agreement with EBRPD through completion of the RMP process,
which is scheduled for early 2013. After completion of the RMP process,
Reclamation will negotiate a new long-term management agreement with one or
more local managing partner(s). The managing partner(s) may include EBRPD,
the City, and/or other local partner(s). The RMP will provide the overall
resource and recreation management direction and framework for Contra Loma
and will serve as a guidance document for the local managing partner(s) for
day-to-day operations and long-range planning.
The purpose of this issues and opportunities report is to provide an overview of
the facilities and the natural and cultural resources that will be addressed in the
RMP and to identify potential issues, constraints, and opportunities relating to
management of the resources. Under each resource topic, the discussion
includes a brief description or overview of the resource, identification of any
gaps in information currently available, an approach to collecting the additional
information, and the potential issues and opportunities that should be considered
during development of the RMP. If it is anticipated that specific technical
studies will be required, these are identified under the appropriate resource
topic. The information presented in this report will be used to help identify
issues and opportunities in developing alternatives and will become the basis for
the existing conditions/affected environment chapter of the RMP and
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

Summary of Topics and Issues Identified
Through Scoping and Public Workshops
Reclamation held the first scoping meeting for the RMP/EIS on February 8,
2010, at the Nick Rodriguez Community Center in Antioch. Reclamation held a
public workshop on August 4, 2010, at Sutter Elementary School in Antioch to
seek ideas, concerns, and comments that will inform the development of the
RMP/EIS. Reclamation also solicited written scoping comments between
February 8 and 22, 2010, and solicited written comments to inform the RMP
between August 4 and 31, 2010.

Overview of Affected Environment
Contra Loma is part of the Central Valley Project and is one of EBRPD’s
regional parks that they currently manage on behalf of Reclamation. It
encompasses approximately 776 acres of grasslands, scattered woodlands, and
park facilities and includes an 80-acre reservoir on the northern edge of the
Diablo mountain range in the north-central portion of Contra Costa County.
Land uses in the vicinity of Contra Loma include development associated with
the City of Antioch to the north and east; the City’s Lone Tree Golf Course to
the east; and undeveloped, rolling hills associated with the Black Diamond
Mines Regional Preserve to the south and west. The Sacramento–San Joaquin
Delta is less than 5 miles north of Contra Loma, and the San Francisco Bay is
30 miles west. The Contra Costa Canal forms the northern boundary.
This section of the report contains an overview of the resources and facilities at
Contra Loma and identifies resource management constraints and potential
opportunities for resolving the resource management issues listed in Section 2.2
above. This section is not intended to provide a detailed description of each
resource topic, but to present a summary of available information on each topic.
Additional details on each resource and additional discussion of potential issues,
constraints, or opportunities identified through the public involvement process
will be available in the resource inventory report and the RMP/EIS. Resources
that are not present at Contra Loma are described below and will not be
discussed in detail in subsequent documents.

Operational Conditions
Operational conditions include recreational uses, recreational and operational
facilities, utilities, and public health and safety. Fishing is a primary
recreational activity at Contra Loma and will be discussed in this section. The
primary use of the reservoir is to meet customer water demands during
shortages as discussed further below.
Summary of Current Conditions
EBRPD operates the recreational component of Contra Loma Regional Park,
including reservoir recreation, and the City manages the community park.
Common recreational activities at the regional park include fishing, hiking,
swimming (only at the swim lagoon), windsurfing, kayaking, canoeing,
picnicking, and horseback and bicycle riding. Visitation is about 160,000
annually. The regional park contains various facilities that support the
recreational uses offered at the park (e.g., trails, picnic tables, food concession,
parking areas, fishing docks, boat launch) and provide means to manage the
land (e.g., fencing, access gate, roads). Many, but not all, of the recreational
facilities are in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
EBRPD has offices, maintenance equipment and facilities, and law enforcement

11

vehicles onsite. The regional park has potable (drinking) water, restrooms and
showers with a septic tank, portable chemical toilets, electricity, telephones, and
a radio communication system.
Fishing is a very popular activity at Contra Loma. The reservoir supports 14
species of fish including 8 species of game fish. EBRPD and California
Department of Fish and Game plant (i.e., stock) rainbow trout and channel
catfish in the reservoir. The reservoir also supports self-sustaining populations
of largemouth bass, crappie, redear sunfish, and bluegill, which are also popular
with anglers. A state fishing license and an EBRPD Fishing Access Permit are
required for all anglers 16 years and older.
Some regional park users have expressed specific concerns related to
recreational fishing. Some believe fluctuations in the reservoir level in April
and May conflict with the reproductive cycles for largemouth bass, crappie, and
other fish, thereby inhibiting reproduction and reducing fish populations and
catches. Fish population data for the past several years would be needed to
understand population trends for these species. Even with accurate trend
information, it may be difficult to precisely identify the causes of population
changes. Fluctuations in water level during the spawning season, water
temperature, and excessive legal and illegal harvesting can all contribute to
reduced fish populations.
The primary uses of the community park are baseball, softball, soccer,
picnicking, group activities, and hiking. Because of the community park’s
proximity to the regional park, its trails serve as pathways into the regional
park. The community park has two parking lots.
CCWD manages and operates the Contra Loma Reservoir for water supply and
emergency storage. The Contra Loma Dam is on the northern side of the
reservoir and contains a pumping system to collect water from the Contra Costa
Canal. Water returns to the canal via gravity flow. Operation of the reservoir
entails periodic pumping from and releases to the canal, which can cause
reservoir levels to fluctuate substantially.
Potential Constraints and Opportunities
The following operational constraint must be considered when developing the
RMP. Its relative level of sensitivity is shown in parentheses.
•

Compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies (high sensitivity)

The following list describes opportunities for resolving the operational issues
that should be considered when developing the RMP:
•

Available space could be used to expand recreational and administrative
facilities in the vicinity of the reservoir.

12

•

Flat, disturbed grazing land east of the reservoir could be used for additional
ball fields

•

Existing ball fields could be reconfigured to accommodate a variety of
sports.

•

Underused shoreline could accommodate additional fishing docks.

•

Additional fish stocking could be done.

•

Fish habitat could be created or modified to increase the numbers of desired
fish.

•

Sewer trunk lines serving nearby City neighborhoods might accommodate
park wastewater.

Approach to Resolving Issues
In addition, general information gathering via websites, agency contacts, and
literature reviews will be ongoing as the RMP/EIS is developed to obtain
background information on various topics relating to operational conditions.
The agencies responsible for managing Contra Loma have provided
documentation from previous studies and analyses, and they will continue to
provide valuable information to describe and characterize the environment at
Contra Loma.
With respect to the relationship between fish populations and water level
fluctuations, Reclamation will review available EBRPD data to better
understand population trends of potentially affected species. Even with
accurate trend information, it may be difficult to precisely identify the causes of
population changes without additional investigation. The time and expense of
performing such investigations are likely not warranted for the purposes of the
RMP. Instead, the RMP will identify cost-effective opportunities for improving
the reservoir’s recreational fishery, if desirable.

Natural Resources
Natural resources include climate, air quality, hydrology, water quality,
geology, soils, vegetation, and wildlife. Fisheries are discussed in Section 3.1.
Summary of Current Conditions
The climate of the region is hot and dry during the summer and mild and wet
during the winter. The strong predominance of westerly winds blowing through
the Carquinez Strait disperses air pollutants, reducing the atmospheric potential
for air pollution in the vicinity of Antioch. Federal and state air quality
standards occur primarily are exceeded during meteorological conditions

13

conducive to high pollution levels, such as cold, windless winter nights or hot,
sunny summer afternoons (Antioch 2003).
Although most of Contra Loma is relatively flat, the surrounding hills to the
west create a barrier between San Francisco and the reservoir and recreation
area. Some hills in Contra Loma have fairly steep slopes (greater than 10
percent grade) and, when combined with the high clay content of the soils,
create unstable building conditions. The drainage pattern of the area is to the
north toward the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. The western half of Contra
Loma drains into the reservoir, while the eastern half follows the former
drainage pattern of the area and flows north away from the reservoir and
through the community park. Maintaining reservoir water quality is very
important because of its use for water supply. Sediment and pollutants draining
from the surrounding uplands have the potential to affect water quality. Litter,
animal feces (e.g., cattle, dogs, wildlife), and human contact with the reservoir
can also affect water quality.
Contra Loma is dominated by grasslands and the reservoir, while also
supporting scattered woodlands, riparian habitat, wetlands, and landscaped
areas. The less-developed areas of Contra Loma support a variety of plant and
wildlife species, which may include several special-status species. Some of the
special-status species that are known or suspected to occur at Contra Loma are
Alameda whipsnake, California tiger salamander, burrowing owl, and San
Joaquin kit fox. California quail are also present.
Potential Constraints and Opportunities
The following list describes natural resources constraints that must be
considered when developing the RMP. The relative level of sensitivity is
shown in parentheses.
•

Comply with existing contracts/agreements with CCWD about reservoir
operations (high sensitivity)

•

Protect and maintain the water quality of the reservoir (high sensitivity).

•

Protect the water supply function of the reservoir (high sensitivity).

•

Enforce body contact restrictions for the reservoir (high sensitivity).

•

Avoid conflict with EBRPD's future HCP/NCCP (high sensitivity).

•

Avoid/protect wetland and riparian habitat (high sensitivity).

•

Avoid/protect special-status plant and wildlife species (high sensitivity if
present).

14

•

Avoid/protect California quail habitat and EBRPD’s quail habitat
enhancement programs (high sensitivity).

•

Avoid conflict with EBRPD's barn owl project to control pocket gophers
(medium sensitivity).

•

Steep slopes across much of the recreation area constrain development (high
sensitivity).

•

Clay soils have high degrees of shrink-swell, which make them susceptible
to erosion and slumping (medium sensitivity).

•

Clay soils have high runoff potential (low sensitivity).

The following list describes opportunities for resolving the natural resources
management issues that should be considered when developing the RMP:
•

The expansive natural areas are suitable for habitat restoration.

•

EBRPD’s planned HCP/NCCP may represent an opportunity to expand
resource stewardship.

Approach to Resolving Issues
The primary approach to resolving issues about natural resources at Contra
Loma is to compile and review available information on the resources. Existing
data and reports from the agencies, personal communications with agency
specialists, and literature reviews will provide the majority of the information
for the RMP/EIS. To supplement this information, reconnaissance-level field
surveys of Contra Loma will describe current habitat conditions, identify
suitable habitat for special-status species, and identify areas in the park that
might be restored or enhanced to improve habitat conditions, if needed.
Focused surveys are not anticipated at this level, but may be a component of the
alternatives or a requirement for subsequent plans or projects.
The information review and surveys will guide alternatives development by
identifying plant and wildlife species that should be more actively managed or
protected, identifying soils or geologic constraints, providing information on
water-quality goals and ways to protect water quality, and providing other
useful information to set the framework for overall management of Contra
Loma. Public input regarding natural resources from the scoping process will
also be considered, and input from technical experts will be valuable.

Socioeconomic Conditions
Socioeconomic conditions include population, demographics, socioeconomics,
and environmental justice.

15

The purpose of the RMP is not to encourage or induce growth in nearby
communities, but to manage natural, cultural, and other resources at Contra
Loma. The RMP would not remove obstacles to growth in the nearby
communities. By its nature, the RMP would not induce growth; therefore,
growth-inducing effects will not be discussed further.
Summary of Current Conditions
Contra Costa County, one of nine counties in the San Francisco–Oakland bay
area, is a fairly populous county with more than 1 million residents. The City of
Antioch is located in eastern Contra Costa County and has more than 100,000
residents. The City offers a variety of employment opportunities, affordable
housing, shopping, and recreational activities.
Contra Loma is entirely in the City boundary. Residential developments around
Contra Loma are primarily single-family homes with some multi-family homes.
Visitors to the reservoir and recreation area include local residents, Bay Area
residents, and, to a lesser extent, people traveling from more than 100 miles
away. Contra Loma attracts visitors of all ethnicities and backgrounds and
often receives non–English-speaking visitors.
Management of the regional park is funded by EBRPD, with partial funding
from Reclamation in accordance with the management agreement, and the City
of Antioch funds operation of the community park. CCWD funds operation of
the reservoir to maintain water quality and use it for water supply and has
provided funding for some improvements at the regional park (e.g., the swim
lagoon).
Potential Constraints and Opportunities
The following socioeconomic constraint must be considered when developing
the RMP. Its relative level of sensitivity is shown in parentheses.
•

Some park users may not be able to communicate effectively in English
(medium constraint).

The following opportunity for resolving socioeconomic issues should be
considered when developing the RMP:
•

Increase the use of multi-lingual written and verbal communications
techniques.

Approach to Resolving Issues
Few socioeconomic issues are anticipated, but those listed above will be
addressed similarly to operational conditions (Section 3.1.3). Reclamation will
develop a reasonable range of alternatives that considers the issues and
opportunities of each resource topic and takes into account public and agency
input.

16

Existing Land Uses and Management
Existing land uses and management topics include land use, ownership,
transportation, parking access, noise, special uses, and visual resources.
No hazardous materials or cleanup sites have been reported at Contra Loma,
although several sites are in various stages of cleanup throughout the City of
Antioch (Department of Toxic Substances Control 2010). These sites would not
be expected to affect management of Contra Loma, and the RMP would not
need to address cleanup of hazardous material sites. This topic will not be
discussed further.
State Routes 680 and 24 in southeastern Contra Costa County have been
officially designated by the State as scenic highways. Both of these routes are
on the opposite side of Mount Diablo from Contra Loma and do not offer views
of Contra Loma. A segment of State Route 4 in eastern Contra Costa County is
eligible for designation, but it is also distant from Contra Loma and does not
offer views of the park. The RMP will not need to address management of
scenic highways; therefore, this topic will not be discussed further.
Summary of Current Conditions
Contra Loma is owned by Reclamation but is managed by EBRPD, CCWD, and
the City of Antioch via a subcontract from EBRPD. It is designated as open
space by the City’s general plan (City of Antioch 2004). Surrounding uses
include residential and open space (Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve
and Lone Tree Golf Course). EBRPD adopted a land use development plan for
the regional park in the mid-1970s (East Bay Regional Park District 1977). The
land use plan established a natural environment unit, recreation cluster, and
reclamation zone for purposes of managing the recreation area. Certain special
uses, such as group or community events, are allowed with a permit.
Access to Contra Loma is via State Route 4 and surface streets in the City.
Contra Loma Boulevard provides the only vehicle entrance to the regional park,
and James Donlon Boulevard provides vehicle access to the community park.
Multi-use trails in the vicinity connect the reservoir and recreation area to other
parks and locales in the City and County. Portions of Contra Loma are fenced,
the recreation area and reservoir are open to the public during daylight hours.
The area immediately below (north of) the dam is restricted to authorized
personnel only. Sources of noise at Contra Loma are primarily visitors, traffic,
and occasional airplanes. Natural sounds, such as water, wind, and wildlife,
also occur in the area.
The rolling hills and grasslands of the region create scenic views around the
reservoir. The reservoir at normal water levels and riparian and woodland
vegetation also contribute to the aesthetic values of the area.

17

Potential Constraints and Opportunities
The following land use constraints should be considered during development of
the RMP. The relative level of sensitivity is shown in parentheses.
•

Ensure that lighting, noise, traffic, and parking are compatible with nearby
land uses (low sensitivity).

•

Consider the rural open space character of a regional park (high sensitivity).

The following opportunity for resolving land use issues should be considered
when developing the RMP:
•

Locating additional ball fields in the land east of the reservoir and south of
the existing soccer fields would reduce land use compatibility impacts for
nearby residences.

Approach to Resolving Issues
Primary land use and management issues revolve around the agreements
between Reclamation and the other agencies. These agreements will be a
subject of discussion during development of the RMP/EIS and will need to be
renewed or rewritten to meet the needs of the agencies and management
strategies and objectives identified in the RMP. Other issues will be addressed
similarly to operational conditions (Section 3.1.3). Reclamation will develop a
reasonable range of alternatives that considers the issues and opportunities of
each resource topic and takes into account public and agency input.

Cultural Resources
Cultural resources are the tangible and intangible elements of past and present
human socio-cultural systems and can include sites, structures, landscapes,
objects, districts, and artifacts of importance to a culture or community for
traditional, religious, historical, and scientific reasons.
Indian Trust Assets are legal interests in property held in trust by the United
States for Indian tribes or individuals. Examples of such assets are land,
mineral rights, hunting and fishing rights, and water rights. No Indian Trust
Assets are known to exist at Contra Loma; therefore, this topic will not be
discussed further.
Summary of Current Conditions
Prehistoric human occupation of California dates back more than 10,000 years
during the late Pleistocene Era. The earliest known occupation of the Bay Area
region dates from approximately 8,000 BC to circa AD 1800 (the Historic era)
and was recorded in the Los Vaqueros reservoir area approximately 11 miles
southeast of Contra Loma (Milliken et al. 2007). The Karkin Costanoan
(Ohlone) and Bay Miwok occupied the Contra Loma region during this period,

18

until the Spanish Empire expanded into the region as early as the 1760s to
establish missions and convert the local people to Christianity. Several land
grants were established by the Spanish during the expansion of the Spanish
Empire, and these were maintained by Mexico after the missions were
disbanded in the 1820s. Two land grants are in the vicinity of Contra Loma:
the Rancho de los Medanos north of Contra Loma in the Antioch and Pittsburg
area and the Rancho los Mejanos southeast of Contra Loma (Hulaniski 1917).
The ranchos focused primarily on the hide-and-tallow trade and cattle ranching.
With the discovery of gold in the region, the 1850s were a period of rapid
settlement of agricultural and industrially important lands in the Bay Area.
Towns such as Antioch grew quickly, and the hinterlands around the towns
became dominated by ranches and farms. In the last half of the 19th century,
the main industries and economic focus of the region in and around Contra
Loma were farming, ranching, and dairying (Hulaniski 1917). Several
homestead patents in the park were awarded in the 1870s, and evidence of
occupation may still exist. Coal mining was an important local industry
between the 1860s and the 1890s. Although mining did not occur in the park
boundaries, trails and roads through Contra Loma were used for travel between
Antioch and the mines (e.g., wagon road, railroad).
Several cultural resource surveys and studies were conducted at Contra Loma
between 1983 and 2008. The surveys covered the entire recreation area, but the
most recent surveys were completed in the 1980s. Two formally recorded and
archived archaeological resources (a prehistoric use site and the Contra Costa
Canal) relate to Contra Loma.
The previous surveys were conducted more than 20 years ago, and site
conditions since then may have changed to expose more resources or modify the
conditions of the recorded sites. If cultural resources have become exposed, the
proximity of recreational activities near archaeological deposits can create an
atmosphere of casual souvenir taking in which people remove small artifacts
(e.g., projectile points, unusual colored rocks or glass, etc.). Also, some of
these resources may be in locations where future recreation and infrastructure
improvements may be considered. In addition, changes in archaeological
techniques and research interests, coupled with the passage of time, might bring
academic and public interest to archaeological deposits that were previously
overlooked.
Potential Constraints and Opportunities
The following issues and constraints regarding cultural resources should be
considered during development of the RMP:
•

Protect and enhance cultural resources (sensitivity to be determined).

The following opportunity for resolving cultural resource issues should be
considered when developing the RMP:

19

•

Contra Loma’s history offers opportunities for interpretation and education
related to cultural resources, such as through interpretive signs or kiosks.

•

Interpretive opportunities could be designed around known sites to
incorporate information about them while protecting them from the public.

•

Natural resources such as plants of importance to local Native American
groups could be promoted as areas of interest to the general public through
the use of signs, or could be protected and made available for practitioners
of traditional tribal practices.

Approach to Resolving Issues
Similar to natural resources, the approach for resolving issues about cultural
resources at Contra Loma is to compile and review information on the
resources. Because of the age of the most recent surveys, at a minimum, known
archaeological sites should be revisited to monitor and record current
conditions.

Conclusions and Next Steps
Conclusions
Some of the key issues and opportunities to consider regarding operational
conditions are improvements to recreational facilities, expansion of recreational
opportunities, and modification of park utility systems. Bilingual
communications is an important key issue to consider under socioeconomic
conditions, and Contra Loma’s location near the City of Antioch provides an
excellent opportunity to attract local and regional residents to the park. Land
use and management of Contra Loma will be a primary topic for the RMP/EIS
and will focus on the best ways for each agency to manage the resources and
benefit the public. Coordination between the agencies will be important during
development of the alternatives. Additional public involvement and outreach
and collection of additional background information will provide the means
necessary to develop alternatives that reflect the various options for
management of operational and socioeconomic conditions and land use.
Sensitive habitats, special-status plant and wildlife species, steep slopes, and
water quality are key issues to consider for management of the natural resources
of Contra Loma. The Contra Loma area has a rich history with potential for the
presence of resources dating from 8,000 BC to the Historic Era, and cultural
resources have also been documented at Contra Loma. Much information is
available about these resources, and known archaeological sites should be
revisited to monitor and record current conditions.

20

Potential Goal Statements
Based on the preliminary issues identified through the public involvement
process and this report, the following goal statements might be considered to
guide development of the alternatives:
1. Promote responsible stewardship of federal land and water resources for the
public benefit.
2. Protect and maintain water quality.
3. Protect and enhance the natural and cultural resources at Contra Loma.
4. Protect and maintain existing recreational uses and educational
opportunities.
5. Provide for enhanced or new recreational uses and facilities that are
compatible with other RMP goals.
6. Maintain the character and ambience of Contra Loma’s setting.
7. Promote continued compatibility with nearby land uses.

Next Steps
On December 8, 2010, Reclamation conducted a conference call with the
current managing partners to present conceptual draft alternatives packages for
the RMP and solicit comments from these agencies. Written comments from
these agencies are due January 7, 2011. Reclamation will consider these
comments and then refine the conceptual draft alternatives packages and present
them at a public workshop that will take place in February 2011. After the
February public workshop, Reclamation and North State Resources will further
refine the alternatives and flesh out details and descriptions for inclusion in the
Draft RMP. The RMP alternatives will include different strategies and
objectives to achieve the management goals and will provide a reasonable range
of management opportunities to reflect public and agency input. These
alternatives will then be evaluated in the EIS.
Prior to preparation of the Draft RMP, Reclamation will prepare a resource
inventory report (RIR). The RIR will provide a detailed description of the
resources at Contra Loma and will serve as the affected environment section of
the RMP/EIS. While the RIR is being prepared, Reclamation will develop
alternatives to evaluate in the RMP/EIS. In addition to the alternatives and
affected environment sections, the RMP/EIS will include sections required by
Reclamation and the Council on Environmental Quality for compliance with the
RMP Guidebook and National Environmental Policy Act. The issues and
opportunities presented in this report and identified through additional public
21

outreach will feed directly into the alternatives and will be summarized in the
RMP/EIS. Additional opportunity for public involvement will occur when the
Draft RMP/EIS is released for public review and when the RMP/EIS is
finalized.

Reclamation to Hold Public Scoping Meeting on a Proposed
RMP/EIS for Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
The Bureau of Reclamation will hold a Public Scoping Meeting on Monday, February 8, 2010, to solicit comments on the
preparation of a Resource Management Plan (RMP) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Contra Loma
Reservoir and Recreation Area (CLRRA). The EIS will be developed consistent with requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act. A Notice of Intent to prepare the RMP/EIS was published in the Federal Register on
November 12, 2009.
Located in Antioch, California, Contra Costa County, Contra Loma Reservoir is part of the Central Valley Project and is
managed by the Mid-Pacific Region’s South-Central California Area Office. The CLRRA is operated and maintained by
the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) under a Management Agreement with Reclamation. The Management
Agreement includes multiple subleases issued by EBRPD that will expire on December 31, 2010. The EBRPD is
interested in renewing the CLRRA Management Agreement with Reclamation.
The RMP/EIS would establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote an organized use,
development, and management of the Contra Loma Reservoir and the surrounding recreational area lands compatible with
applicable Federal and State laws. The RMP would incorporate all information pertinent to the future guidance of the
CLRRA and would serve as the basis for future decisionmaking for the area. Through the scoping meeting, Reclamation
will solicit public input on concerns, issues, and alternatives to be addressed in the RMP/EIS. The meeting will be held:
Monday, February 8, 2010, 6:30-8:30 p.m.

are summarized in the following table.
Commenter
Roy Immekus, DYSL

Contra Loma RMP/EIS Scoping Meeting

Comment Summary


Community growth needs to be considered to
ensure enough ball fields are available for youth into
the future.



The City does not currently have enough ball fields
for youth soccer.



The area south of the existing fields at the
community park should be considered for expansion
of the soccer fields at the park.



Ball fields require little to establish—just a flat area
and grass.

Allen Payton, Turf and Track
Group

Contra Loma RMP/EIS Scoping Meeting

Comment Summary


Current use of the soccer fields at the park includes
60‐150 children each weekday and approximately
400 children on Saturdays.



Some children must travel to Pittsburg to play
because of fields in Antioch being unavailable.



DYSL wants all children to have the opportunity to
play, but does not want them to have to travel
outside the community to play.



Youth baseball is also sometimes restricted at the
park because there are not enough fields.



The City wants the opportunity to expand the fields
and extend its agreement to continue maintaining
the park.



The County recommends renewing the agreement
with the City.



Soccer fields should be expanded and have turf
instead of grass.



Increased youth sport opportunities would benefit
the community.



The park improvements would be consistent with
ongoing infrastructure and Highway 4
improvements being implemented by the County.



Fields in Antioch close when it rains, and youth must
drive to Danville or other communities to play.



Turf surface is preferred to allow all‐weather play,
and it has low water needs.



Fields in Brentville are also used on occasion if the
fields in Antioch are not available.



Fields are not always watered due to water supply
shortages, which poses a hazard to players because
of dry or barren patches and uneven surfaces.



Teams are not able to practice enough because local
fields are not always available.



Fields in poor condition create safety concerns.



No current turf fields exist in Antioch; turf fields
would expand opportunities for youth practice.



Turf surface should be considered for safety
reasons. It requires little maintenance and provides
year‐round opportunities.

Shari Gayle

Contra Loma RMP/EIS Scoping Meeting

Comment Summary


Existing fields pose safety concerns—potholes,
gopher holes, uneven surfaces, slopes, dry grass.



Opportunities appear to be available at the regional
park to provide more fields for the community park.



Use of turf could alleviate safety concerns.



Turf fields are recommended to alleviate safety
concerns.



As a soccer coach, Will would like to see turf fields at
the park to expand opportunities for youth sports.



Lights on fields would also provide more
opportunities for playing.



Available land near the community park should not
be used for another purpose that could permanently
convert it into a non‐compatible use, resulting in the
lost opportunity to expand soccer fields.



DYSL’s goal is to provide opportunities for more
children to play soccer.



Existing fields could be replaced with turf, but
expansion on available land should also be
considered.



Youth are not currently able to practice in evenings
(after dark) or if it rains because the fields at the
community park are shut down. This forces kids to
leave the area in order to get more playing
opportunities.



Turf would expand opportunities for soccer, softball,
and football and provide year‐round opportunities.



The City is currently applying to put turf and lights
at the existing soccer fields at the community park.



The City is working with EBRPD to implement the
upgrades.



These field improvements would help, but they
would not expand opportunities, which are needed
to provide more children with the opportunity to
play locally.



Water quality is a concern in the reservoir.



Invasive species, such as carp and mussels, are also a
concern.



CCWD is aware of the issues with zebra and quagga
mussels and New Zealand mud snails.

Page 3

Commenter

Douglas Young

Janet Gomes, EBRPD

Contra Loma RMP/EIS Scoping Meeting

Comment Summary


Carp are currently removed annually when
biologists survey the reservoir during draw downs.



The current economy increases the potential for
pests to be introduced to the reservoir.



Carp is a concern, but not necessarily a major issue.



Mussels may clog the outlet pipes.



Reclamation programs to manage mussels will need
to be considered.



Largemouth bass may be affected by reservoir draw
downs, resulting in a reduced bass population,
which affects the recreational fishery.



The timing of the draw downs may coincide with
bass spawning and may prevent bass from
spawning.



A study should be done to evaluate these effects.



Additional fishing docks are needed to support the
fishermen.



Opportunities should be provided for children to
fish and use the reservoir.



Organized group camps would be beneficial for
boyscouts and other children’s groups.



A year‐round surface should be considered for the
lake trail because of inaccessibility during wet
weather (muddy conditions).

Reclamation is preparing a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for Contra Loma. The RMP will
be the guide for future land and water resources management decisions at Contra Loma. The
RMP is intended to establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote organized use, development, and management of Contra Loma while protecting water quality, water
supply, and natural and cultural resources. Reclamation will also prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of implementing the RMP. The RMP and EIS will be prepared as a single
document. A draft of the RMP/EIS will be available for public review
by the fall of 2012.

What is the format of the August 4th workshop?
The workshop will begin with an overview presentation by the project
team, followed by an opportunity for participants to visit topic stations
(including current and future uses, natural resources, and others),
learn more about the process, and submit comments on those topics.

Why should I attend?
Engaged participation by the public, user organizations, and agencies
is critical to the success of this planning effort. Your ideas, concerns,
and comments will inform the development of the RMP/EIS for management of Contra Loma’s valuable resources.

What if I can’t attend the workshop in person?
If you are not able to attend the workshop, the presentation and meeting materials will be available at www.ebparks.org/planning. You may provide your comments, questions and concerns on
these issues to Ben Gettleman at: (415) 391-7900, bgettleman@kearnswest.com.
A second public workshop will take place in the winter of 2010 to summarize the results of the
public involvement process, to present possible alternatives for the RMP, and seek comments
about those alternatives. Visit the program website for more details as they become available:
www.ebparks.org/planning.

Resource Management Plan Public Workshop
Wednesday, August 4, 2010
Sutter Elementary School • Antioch, CA

FINAL MEETING SUMMARY
I.

Workshop Purpose

A public workshop was convened by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) on August 4, 2010 in Antioch,
California to solicit input for development of a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for the Contra Loma Reservoir
and Recreation Area (Contra Loma). The purpose of the public workshop was to provide an overview of the planning and environmental review process, identify key resource and land use issues, solicit input (i.e., comments
and information) about Contra Loma, and identify opportunities, and constraints to manage the resources at Contra Loma. The workshop agenda is attached as Appendix A.

II. Welcome and Project Overview
Sheryl Carter, Reclamation, welcomed participants and provided an overview of Reclamation and the RMP process. Ms. Carter noted the following key points: Reclamation owns Contra Loma and manages it in partnership
with the City of Antioch, East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD), and Contra Costa Water District (CCWD); the
current management agreement with EBRPD will expire in December 2010, and a new agreement will be needed
that incorporates decisions in the RMP; and the goal of the workshop is to solicit comments on how the public
would like to see Contra Loma and its resources managed in the future.
Scott Goebl, NSR, further described Contra Loma, its managing partners, and the RMP process. Mr. Goebl clarified that Contra Loma includes three main areas: Antioch Community Park, Contra Loma Reservoir, and Contra
Loma Regional Park. He also noted the following key points regarding the current management and use of Contra
Loma: Antioch Community Park is managed by the City of Antioch, and it includes many recreational opportunities including softball fields, picnic areas, and trails; the reservoir is operated by CCWD and its main purpose is to
supply drinking water (and therefore water quality is the highest priority); and Contra Loma Regional Park is managed by EBRPD and provides recreational activities including a swim lagoon, fishing, and hiking.
Mr. Goebl clarified that the RMP is a land use management plan that will guide the future management of resources of this area for at least the next 10 years and that the input received at this workshop would inform the development of RMP alternatives. He added that these alternatives would be available for review at a second public
workshop planned for January 2011, and that based on public comments received at that time, the alternatives
are expected to be refined to three alternative management scenarios.

III. Workshop Topic Stations
Ben Gettleman, Kearns & West, explained the structure and flow of the four topic stations. He noted that at each
station, participants would be asked to provide feedback on what is working (priorities), what is not working (concerns), and how it could be improved (opportunities). Each topic station was staffed by a lead and at least one
representative from the managing partner agency to answer questions about the RMP process or the area being
managed.

The public comments received at each topic station are summarized below:
1. RMP/EIS Process
A. What is working (priorities)?
• Sincere appreciation and enjoyment of the park.
B. What is not working (concerns)?
• One commentor recently observed an abundance of dead clams around the reservoir shoreline.
The commentor is concerned that the dead clams are an indication of poor water quality.
• Over the past 2 years, fewer dragonflies and small fish have been observed along the shoreline.
• Fish catches appear to be down recently.
• Water levels appear to be lower recently.
• Black bass and crappie populations appear to be decreasing. Water level fluctuations may be
inhibiting regeneration. These fish lay eggs on the reservoir bottom in April/May. Lowering the
reservoir level below the level of the eggs causes egg mortality.
• Algae blooms appear in backwater areas. They are unsightly and promote neglect.
• Apparent abundance of animal feces (geese, horses, dogs) is noticeable around the reservoir,
which could reduce reservoir water quality. The feces is unsightly and promotes neglect of reservoir and recreational area.
C. How could it be improved (opportunities)?
• Water quality sampling locations should be distributed more widely around the reservoir.
• Maintain water level at a constant elevation in April/May to allow black bass and crappie eggs to
hatch. After April/May water level fluctuations would not affect these fish.
• One solution to the feces issue would include abundant signage with telephone contact information to report problems. Suggest placing at least 10 dog feces bag stations throughout the park
and adding more garbage cans on NW shore, east shore and dam.
2. Contra Loma Regional Park
A. What is working (priorities)?
• Job opportunities – L.G./swim instructors (EBRPD)
• Swimming lessons
• Jr. lifeguard program
• Swimming test – maintains safety
• Swim instructors – very helpful
• Picnic areas – kept clean
• Management of capacity in lagoon area
• Swim program
o Keeping children safe/life skills
o A place for families to bond
o Job placement (JG’s)
• Public safety (police/fire) coverage
• Jr. lifeguard program builds self worth and confidence for children

Community enrichment
Friday naturalist programs
Trail quality (much improved)
Great park for dogs

B. What is not working (concerns)?
• The trails around the west shore get muddy.
• More shade is needed around the lawn at the swim lagoon.
• There is not enough parking at lagoon.
• The swim lagoon is too small.
• There are not enough restroom facilities.
• Children ages 0-5 need a separate safe pool for improved safety (or a portion of existing lagoon
should be roped off for toddlers ages 0-5).
• Animal (dog/horse) feces is noticeable along trails around the reservoir.
• There is not enough shade along the trails.
• There is not enough defined off-leash dog areas.
• Horses near the reservoir may pose water quality concerns (feces)
• Restrictions on kayaking to reduce human contact are too severe.
• There are limited mountain bike loop trail opportunities.
C. How could it be improved (opportunities)?
• Placing gravel along the west shore trails could keep them from getting muddy.
• More trees around the park, and especially on the west shore would increase shade.
• Add building/facilities for classes and better bathrooms.
• Expand gravel/overflow parking.
• Have more public clean-up days.
• Issue more littering tickets.
• Add a secure locked “donation box” for walk-ins.
• Expand lagoon or add additional swim areas.
• Improve communication between kiosk attendants/lagoon kiosk attendant/lifeguards/rangers and
naturalist programs.
• Create multi-use trail connectors in the following locations:
o Between the bulletin board at the stop sign area and the gravel road
o Between the boat ramp and the creek side bridge along the water
o A full circle around the island (should be gravel)
o Bewteen the boat ramp and the east shore trail
o At the entrance road
• Make lagoon “non-smoking only” and designate smoking area down-wind from swimmers.
• Patrol and clean up trails at least daily to remove feces/garbage.
• Place more garbage cans along trails.
• Place at least 10 dog feces bag stations at garbage cans and along trails.
• Improve signs about cleaning up feces,,using large text that is easy to understand.
• Plant trees along trails for shade.
• Designate more off-leash dog areas, perhaps including:
o A dog park within the park
o An off-leash area SE of the reservoir in the grassy area (#1 or #2)2
• Educate users about keeping the park clean, especially the picnic areas.
• Use rangers to patrol and talk to users about keeping the park clean. Consider using bilingual
rangers.
• Add more signs to clean up picnic areas. These signs should:
o Be at each table
o Be bilingual
o Notify park users about about fines/non-compliance
• Expand trails available to mountain bikes,

3. Contra Loma Reservoir
A. What is working (priorities)?
• Water and open space matter to:
o People: health, fitness, spirituality, fun
o Flora & fauna: habitats, ecosystems
• The lagoon’s separation from the reservoir maintains the primary objective of maintaining water
quality.
B. What is not working (concerns)?
• Lake levels are inconsistent and no warning or notification is provided about fluctuations.
• Trash is exposed or trapped during low water levels.
• Algae is observed on the lake and the shore.
• Fish carcasses are observed along shore, possibly left by birds, fishermen, or nature.
• Restrictions on kayaking to reduce human contact are too severe.
C. How could it be improved (opportunities)?
• Consider removing trash and dead tules from the reservoir when water levels are low.
• Remove fish carcasses daily.
• Explain the source of the algae and whether it is caused by neglect.
• Clean up will prevent bad odors from algae and reduce the appearance of neglect.
• Relax restrictions on kayaking.
4. Antioch Community Park
A. What is working (priorities)?
• The park is clean and well-maintained in general. Some exceptions include garbage, excrement,
and graffiti.
• The park offers abundant team sports with good schedules.
• The facilities are effectively used.
• There is great shade at picnic and play areas.
B. What is not working (concerns)?
• There should be less focus on baseball fields and more focus on mixed-use fields. The third baseball diamond should be converted to a multi-use field.
• There is a lack of community presence (e.g., not enough sign-up sheets for special events)
• There is a lack of ranger presence.
• There are not enough garbage bins along the dam.
• There is a lack of dog-waste bags.
• There should be more public input regarding marketing of recreation programs on the site.
• Play structure cleanliness could be improved.
• Car break-ins have increased recently.
• The area between the parking lot and the trail on the west side of the park is unfinished and suffers from erosion.
• The grass area on the west side of the park is not complete and becomes muddy.
• Gate closure times should be specific.
• The gate attendant can be grumpy.
• The soccer fields should be better maintained to address drainage, gophers, and turf quality.
• The soccer fields are not usable in wet weather
• The soccer and multi-use fields are not lighted, which limits use in the winter.
C. How could it be improved (opportunities)?
• Reduce flooding at map location #13.
• Increase police patrols in parking lots.
• Increase trails along the creek and riparian area and improve interconnection between trail systems.
• Improve playground cleanliness, possibly with power washing.
• Eliminate the playground sand or replace the sand with clean sand
• Increase police presence.
• Improve muddy areas with grass or gravel.
• Clear figs on the play area more regularly.

IV. Workshop Recap and Next Steps
Following the topic station session, the leads for each station reported back to the group on key themes.
1. RMP/EIS: There were general concerns about water quality issues, citing increased sightings of dead
clams on the shoreline and fewer sightings of insects and small fish. The suggestion to keep the reservoir’s
water level steady in April/May was also noted.
2. Contra Loma Regional Park: Participants enjoy the park in general, particularly the swimming area and
job opportunities. This park could benefit from improved trails, picnic areas, and additional signage.
3. Contra Loma Reservoir: This area is used a lot and is important. People wanted to know more about
when water levels will change and whether this reservoir is regularly patrolled or cleaned.
4. Antioch Community Park: This park is well maintained and enjoyed by users. Participants would like to
see the trails better connected, the multi-use facilities and areas increased, and police presence increased.
Comments during this round will be received until August 31, 2010. To receive a Comment Form or additional
information, please email or call Ben Gettleman: bgettleman@kearnswest.com, (415) 391-7900. A second public
workshop is planned for January 2011, where Reclamation will solicit feedback on the alternative RMP packages.

Reclamation is preparing a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for Contra Loma. The RMP will be the guide for future land and water resources
management decisions at Contra Loma. The RMP is intended to establish uniform policy and land
management guidelines that promote organized use, development, and management of Contra Loma
while protecting water quality, water supply, and natural and cultural resources. Reclamation will also
prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of implementing the RMP. The RMP and EIS will be prepared as a single document.

What is the purpose of the March 3 workshop?
Over the past year, members of the public and managing partner agencies have provided Reclamation with ideas, concerns, and comments
that have helped inform the development of the RMP. Based on this
information, Reclamation has developed conceptual draft packages of
future actions, or alternatives, to be included in the RMP. This workshop
provides an opportunity to learn about the conceptual draft alternatives
and to provide additional input. Following the workshop, Reclamation will
further refine and flesh out the details and descriptions of the alternatives, and prepare the full draft RMP which will be circulated for public
review and comment by the fall of 2012.

What is the format of the March 3 workshop?
The workshop will begin with an overview presentation of the RMP
development process, including public comments to date. This will be followed by break-out stations
where members of the public can provide input on the draft actions and alternatives being considered
for inclusion in the draft RMP.

Why should I attend?
Engaged participation by the public, user organizations, and agencies is critical to the success of this
planning effort. Your ideas, concerns, and opinions will continue to inform the development of the
RMP/EIS for management of Contra Loma’s valuable resources.

What if I can’t attend the workshop in person?
If you are not able to attend, materials from the workshop will be available at
www.ebparks.org/planning#contraloma. You are encouraged to provide your ideas, questions and
concerns on these issues to Christine Lim at: (415) 391-7900, clim@kearnswest.com.

Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area
Resource Management Plan Public Workshop
Thursday, March 3, 2011
Prewett Family Park and Community Center
Antioch, CA
MEETING SUMMARY1

Summary
I.

Workshop Purpose

A public workshop was convened by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) on March 3,
2011 in Antioch, California to solicit input for the development of a Resource Management Plan
(RMP) for the Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area (Contra Loma). The purpose of the
workshop was to provide an overview of the planning and environmental review process, share
how community input has informed the process to date, solicit input (i.e., comments and
information) on possible future management actions, and identify additional opportunities to
improve the management of resources at Contra Loma. The workshop agenda is attached as
Appendix A.
II.

Welcome and Project Overview

Sheryl Carter, Reclamation, welcomed participants and provided an overview of Reclamation
and the RMP process. Ms. Carter noted that Reclamation owns Contra Loma and manages it in
partnership with the City of Antioch, East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD), and the Contra
Costa Water District (CCWD), and that new agreements will be established that incorporate
recommendations from the RMP.
Scott Goebl, NSR, further described Contra Loma, its managing partners, and the RMP
process. Mr. Goebl clarified that Contra Loma includes three main areas: Antioch Community
Park, Contra Loma Reservoir, and Contra Loma Regional Park. He also noted the following key
points regarding the current management and use of Contra Loma: Antioch Community Park is
managed by the City of Antioch, and it includes many recreational opportunities including
softball fields, picnic areas, and trails; the reservoir is operated by CCWD and its main purpose
is to supply drinking water (and therefore water quality is the highest priority); and Contra Loma
Regional Park is managed by EBRPD and provides recreational activities including a swim
lagoon, fishing, and hiking.
Mr. Goebl clarified that the RMP will provide guidance for the future management of resources
to achieve the desired future condition of the project area. He added that the RMP primarily
focuses on protecting water supply, water quality and natural resources, and that enhancing
recreational uses is a secondary emphasis.

Summary – Contra Loma Public Workshop, March 3, 2011

Mr. Goebl noted that, to date, the RMP has been informed by feedback from two public
workshops, input from managing partner agencies, and additional research on existing
environmental resources and facilities. This information has been considered against a set of
planning criteria to develop conceptual, draft management actions which can be implemented to
meet the goals of the RMP.
The 71 conceptual, draft management actions are packaged into three conceptual draft
alternatives:
1. “No Action” Alternative: Continues current management practices with no substantive
changes.
2. Enhanced Alternative: Enhances current recreation, with minimal changes to Contra
Loma’s aesthetic character.
3. Expanded Alternative: Expands recreation substantially with new infrastructure; this
alternative would include management actions from the Enhanced Alternative as well.
Mr. Goebl shared that the RMP will have a preferred alternative, which could be one of the
alternatives listed above or a combination of alternatives. The outcome will depend on the
findings of the related environmental processes, public comments and input from managing
partners. He added that the RMP is a planning level document, not a project level document,
and that specific descriptions and improvements will not be defined at this stage.
Mr. Goebl stated that the purpose of this workshop was to receive comments on the draft
alternatives before they are further developed. Regarding the project timeline, Mr. Goebl shared
that the next revision of the draft RMP alternatives will be available for public comment in
December 2012, and that the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for these alternatives
will be available for public comment in January 2013. Based on this feedback, a preferred RMP
alternative will be identified in January 2013, leading to the development of a final RMP and
EIS.
III.

Workshop Comment Stations

Ben Gettleman, Kearns & West, explained the structure and flow of the comment stations.
Station 1: Review Input Receive to Date
Participants were asked to review comments provided to date and provide input on whether the
management action adequately addresses the corresponding comment, and whether the
management action could be revised to better address the comment.
Station 2: Provide Input on Draft Management Actions
Participants reviewed the management actions under the three different management
alternatives. They were asked to provide feedback on whether they supported the management
action, how the management action could be improved, and what additional management
actions should be considered.
The public comments received are summarized below:
Station 1 Comments
• Trail safety should be increased through bicycle patrols or call boxes.
• A disc golf course should be considered because people would use it.

Prepared by Kearns & West (March 8, 2011)

Summary – Contra Loma Public Workshop, March 3, 2011

Station 2: Common Alternative Comments
• Advertisement of the different events taking place at Contra Loma should be better
coordinated.
• MA 6: One central phone number for the Contra Loma area should be established; it is
currently unclear which agency should be called to report an issue.
• MA 7: Enforce self-pay entrance fees.
• MA 8: Work with city volunteers to address litter, waste and graffiti.
Station 2: Enhanced Alternative Comments
• MA 35: Provide a separate, small child area during high volume days.
Station 2: Expanded Alternative Comments
• Additional signage of trails, distances, and locations are needed.
• Spanish speaking staff should always be present during the summer months to assist
guests.
• The snack bar should also supply pampers, a first aid kit, etc.
• Security cameras should be installed throughout Contra Loma, but particularly in the
most heavily trafficked areas.
• MA 54: Additional docks are needed, and not just for fishermen’s use.

Introduction

1.1

Resource Management Plan Overview

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is developing a Resource Management Plan (RMP) for
the Contra Loma Reservoir and Recreation Area (Contra Loma) in Antioch, Contra Costa County,
California. The Contra Loma RMP will be a long-term plan to guide management of the reservoir,
recreation area, and surrounding lands owned by Reclamation. The RMP is being developed based on a
comprehensive inventory of environmental resources and facilities; input from the current managing
partners (i.e., the East Bay Regional Park District [EBRPD], City of Antioch [the City], and Contra Costa
Water District [CCWD]); and input from the public. The primary emphasis of the RMP is to protect
water supply, water quality, and natural resources, while enhancing recreational uses.
The overall objective of this RMP is to establish a set of management objectives, goals, and actions to be
implemented by Reclamation, either directly or through its management agreement(s) that will:
1. Establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote an organized use,
development, and management of the Contra Loma Reservoir and the surrounding recreational
area lands compatible with applicable federal and state laws.
2. Protect the water supply and water quality functions of Contra Loma Reservoir.
3. Protect and enhance natural and cultural resources in and around the reservoir, consistent with
federal law and Reclamation policies.
4. Provide recreational opportunities and facilities consistent with EBRPD’s current management
strategies, Reclamation policies, and state water policies.
5. Provide guidance for future decision making.

1.2

Purpose of the Preliminary Draft Alternatives

Reclamation has drafted planning criteria that help establish the sideboards and parameters for
development of the RMP and help highlight major areas of concern, management objectives for the RMP,
and goals that will provide overall guidance for the RMP management direction and actions. Reclamation
has also drafted three conceptual RMP alternatives. Reclamation sought technical comments from
EBRPD, the City, and CCWD (i.e., the current managing partners) on the draft planning criteria, draft

Contra Loma RMP Preliminary Draft Alternatives

management objectives, draft goals, and the draft alternatives before presenting them to the public at a
workshop to be held on March 3, 2011. The alternatives are conceptual at this stage, and are not intended
to include substantial detail. After receiving comments from the current managing partners and the
public, Reclamation will develop the draft alternatives in more detail, and circulate the draft RMP for
public comment together with the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that will evaluate the
environmental effects of each alternative.

2. Draft Planning Criteria, Objectives, and
Goals
2.1

Draft Planning Criteria

As described in Reclamation’s RMP Guidebook, planning criteria are short and concise statements that
help establish the sideboards and parameters for development of the RMP and help highlight major areas
of concern. Planning criteria are intended to assist Reclamation in formulating and selecting
combinations of land uses and management actions that will be considered in the RMP. Reclamation has
drafted the following planning criteria for the Contra Loma RMP.









Protect the water supply and water quality functions of the reservoir
Protect and enhance natural resources
Protect cultural resources
Recognize community concerns and values about Contra Loma
Encourage an appropriate range of recreational uses
Ensure consistency with federal policies, laws, and regulations
Protect public health and safety
Limit alternatives to those with reasonable certainty that:
−
−
−

the management actions can be implemented within the 20-year planning period;
Reclamation or managing partner(s) can fund the management actions; and
Reclamation or managing partner(s) are committed to seeking financial, program, and
staffing resources necessary to implement the management actions.

2.2 Draft Management Objectives
The overall objective of this RMP is to establish a set of management objectives, goals, and actions to be
implemented by Reclamation, either directly or through its management agreement(s) that will:


Establish uniform policy and land management guidelines that promote an organized use,
development, and management of the Contra Loma Reservoir and the surrounding recreational
area lands compatible with applicable federal and state laws.



Protect the water supply and water quality functions of Contra Loma Reservoir.

federal law and Reclamation policies.



Provide recreational opportunities and facilities consistent with EBRPD’s current management
strategies, Reclamation policies, and state water policies.



Provide guidance for future decision making.

Reclamation has drafted the following management objectives to fulfill the purpose and meet the overall
objective of the RMP:


Develop and implement a comprehensive land use strategy considering uses of Contra Loma and
adjacent lands.



Identify long-term resource programs and implementation policies to manage and develop
recreational, natural, and cultural resources.



demand.

2.3 Draft Goals
Reclamation has drafted the following primary goals of the Contra Loma RMP to provide overall
guidance for the RMP management direction and actions. The degree to which the various RMP
alternatives meet these goals will be described in RMP/EIS.





Formulation of Alternatives

3.1 Introduction
This section describes the conceptual draft RMP alternatives designed to address the planning issues,
opportunities, and constraints at Contra Loma. Reclamation’s intent is to develop a broad range of
management actions to address alternatives that would represent the varied interests pertaining to Contra
Loma. The No Action Alternative and two action alternatives are as follows:


No Action (Alternative 1)—This alternative manages land and activities with the continuation of
current management practice.



Enhanced Recreation and Facilities (Alternative 2)—This alternative enhances recreation
opportunities and existing facilities, but limits expansion of recreation and facilities to minimize
changes to park character and adverse effects on natural resources.



Expanded Recreation and Facilities (Alternative 3)—This alternative emphasizes expanded
recreation opportunities and facilities.

Several management actions would be common to all alternatives. Unique management actions for each
alternative are detailed in Sections 4.3 through 4.4.

3.2 Roles of Reclamation and Local Managing Partner(s)
Reclamation will negotiate a long-term agreement with one or more local managing partner(s) for Contra
Loma. The local managing partner(s) will have overall responsibility for managing public access,
recreation, infrastructure and public services, and natural resources in Contra Loma, excluding the dam.
Responsibilities for dam and reservoir operations are subject to a separate contract between Reclamation
and CCWD; therefore, these operations would not be affected by the RMP. The RMP will provide the
overall resource and recreation management direction and framework for Contra Loma. It will be a
guidance document for the local managing partner(s) for day-to-day operations and long-range planning.
Reclamation will have overall responsibility for ensuring that all actions in Contra Loma by Reclamation
and its managing partner(s) are consistent with the RMP. The managing partner(s) must ensure that its
actions in managing Contra Loma and associated land, recreation facilities, and infrastructure, are
consistent with the RMP.
The agreement with managing partner(s) will require that the managing partner(s) use the RMP as the
primary land use, natural resource, and recreation management guidance document to be followed during
the management of Contra Loma. A term of the agreement will specify that any other agreements
affecting management of Contra Loma that preceded the RMP will be not be changed or invalidated by
the RMP, and that any agreements that occur after the agreement, or any new agreement, will include the
RMP or an amended RMP (if modified by Reclamation).

Contra Loma RMP Preliminary Draft Alternatives

Page 4

February 2011

3.3 Implementation Approach
The RMP will be implemented through recommendations for specific management actions and
improvement projects.

3.3.1

Management Actions and Projects

The RMP includes recommendations for various resource management actions and facility improvement
projects. These are specific actions that may be implemented at Contra Loma to meet the RMP goals.
These management actions and projects are defined at a conceptual or programmatic level in the RMP.
More detailed descriptions of the actions and project will be developed during the planning horizon of the
RMP. The responsibility for funding, designing, and implementing (or constructing) the management
actions and improvement projects will be specified in a long-term agreement with the local managing
partner(s).
It should be noted that the RMP will not require the local managing partner(s) to implement all the
recommended management actions and facility improvements. Implementation of some management
actions, however, may be required. The local managing partner(s) will have the option of implementing
the optional management actions and improvements based on considerations of the following factors: (1)
sufficient public demand, (2) sufficient staffing and funding to manage any new or modified facilities in
accordance with the RMP, and (3) potential for increased public benefits and use. New facilities or
activities allowed under the RMP may also be discontinued in the future at the discretion of the local
managing partner(s) if demand decreases, the activity is not economically viable, new security or safety
considerations arise, and/or unforeseen significant environmental impacts occur that cannot be mitigated.
It should be noted that the local managing partner(s) will be required to conduct an appropriate site
specific environmental review for most of the new or expanded recreational activities or facilities
identified in the RMP such as new sports fields at the Antioch Community Park or new sewer lines to
connect the regional park sanitary facilities to the City’s wastewater treatment system. The projectspecific environmental documentation would need to be prepared to meet National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) requirements because the projects would occur on federal land, and may need to satisfy
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements if the projects are partially funded or
managed by the local managing partner(s).

3.3.2

Amendments to the RMP

Reclamation can amend the RMP at any time if the need arises. Conditions that may require an
amendment could include, but are not limited to, (1) changed environmental conditions; (2) unforeseen
events; (3) changes in policies and land use plans that have been determined to be infeasible, impractical,
or have undesirable consequences; and (4) change in applicable laws and regulations. Reclamation would
initiate the amendment process, which would include appropriate NEPA environmental review tiered
from this document.
The RMP can be updated to reflect any changed environmental or institutional circumstances; and new
laws, regulations, or policies; and changes in Contra Loma operations. Reclamation would conduct
public meetings and an environmental review when updating the RMP.

Preliminary Draft Alternatives

4.1 Common Infrastructure, Operational Improvements, and
Management Actions for All Alternatives
Each alternative has different components and management actions that would achieve the objectives of
that alternative. However, several components and management actions are common to all alternatives.
These are consistent with the current resource and recreation management direction and practices at
Contra Loma and are listed in this section. The remaining management actions are listed as they apply to
each alternative.

4.1.1

Administrative and Operational Activities

All RMP alternatives include the following administrative and operational activities.

Facilities Management at Contra Loma Regional Park
Litter and Waste
1. Continue to implement a litter and waste reduction program to effectively meet demand.
Elements of this program will include staff outreach and public education, routine litter and
nuisance pickup and removal, and availability of sufficient litter cans and dog feces bag stations.
Elements of this program will be modified or expanded as necessary to meet demand.

Other Facility Management
2. Continue to perform routine maintenance and repairs of existing facilities.
3. Continue programs to manage zebra and quagga mussels, New Zealand mud snails, and carp.
Elements of this program will be modified or expanded as necessary.
4. Continue to implement pesticide management plans, and an integrated pest management plan for
weeds, pest rodents, and wasps.
5. Continue to implement plans for fire and emergency preparedness and to provide public safety
through EBRPD’s police and fire departments. Continue to operate the existing EBRPD police
substation and Fire Station 8 at Contra Loma and continue to provide lifeguard services at the
swim lagoon with emergency response capability at Contra Loma reservoir.
6. Clarify law enforcement and public safety roles for each managing partner agency.
7. Consider adding new donation boxes for walk-in users at key locations.

4.1.2

Management Actions for Alternative 1: No Action (Status Quo)

Objectives
Under this alternative, the current resource and recreation management direction and practices at Contra
Loma would continue unchanged, consistent with EBRPD’s current Reservoir Area Management plan
(RAMP; dated 1975), the current management agreement between Reclamation and EBRPD, the license
agreement between EBRPD and the City, and EBRPD land use plans pertaining to Contra Loma. The
local managing partner(s) would implement and manage the administrative and operational activities
listed in Section 4.1.1, however, no additional management actions would be implemented. The
managing partner(s) would be allowed to implement any of these activities that do not require permits or
environmental review under NEPA or CEQA without the need for additional review or authorization by
Reclamation or CCWD. This alternative addresses certain public comments that no further substantive
improvements will be made at Contra Loma.

4.1.3

Management Actions for Alternative 2: Enhanced Recreation
and Facilities

Objectives
The objective of this alternative is to enhance current recreational uses and facilities at Contra Loma to
fulfill the evolving needs of the public who recreate at Contra Loma and to implement several basic
infrastructure improvements while minimizing changes to Contra Loma’s aesthetic character and adverse
effects on natural resources. Alternative 2 involves no major expansion of recreational facilities, and
would therefore retain more undeveloped land within the regional park than Alternative 3 (Expanded
Recreation and Facilities).

Management Actions and Improvements at Contra Loma Regional Park
Restrooms
22. Provide more and better restroom facilities to accommodate existing and future user needs.
23. Replace the existing chemical toilets with modern vault restrooms.

Contra Loma RMP Preliminary Draft Alternatives

Page 8

February 2011

24. Provide a restroom facility near the northwest shore fishing dock.
25. Consider installing sewer lines that connect the regional park to the City's wastewater system.

Buildings and Structures
26. Expand or renovate the existing park offices, the EBRPD police substation, the secondary storage
yard, and the buildings near the swim lagoon to better provide for public service and safety.
27. Add structures and facilities for classes, including swim and safety lessons, near the swim lagoon.
28. Build a new park residence near the park office.
29. Expand gravel/overflow parking.
30. Pave some existing gravel parking areas.
31. Add a fueling station and storage tank at or near the maintenance yard for park staff and public
safety officers.

Other Infrastructure
32. Add a radio communication tower and other needed facilities to improve communications for
EBRPD and public service providers. This tower will be sited and designed in a manner that
minimizes aesthetic impacts on the park character.
33. Install water infrastructure to support grazing.
34. Comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility requirements for future
improvements at the Regional Park. Continue implementation of an ADA facility retrofit program
that includes replacing, retrofitting, and restructuring many of the park facilities to meet the
current standards of the ADA requirements.

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park
Swim Lagoon
35. Provide a safe swim area or splash pad for small children.
36. Provide more shade around the swim lagoon lawn.
37. Add benches in the swim lagoon area.
38. Prohibit smoking at the lagoon and designate smoking areas down-wind from swimmers.

Fishing
39. Replace aging fishing docks.

Contra Loma RMP Preliminary Draft Alternatives

Page 9

February 2011

40. Modify or reconstruct existing fishing docks to allow safe, continuous fishing use during
reservoir drawdowns.
41. Increase fish stocking.
42. Control vegetation within the reservoir to enhance the fishing experience.
43. Repair or reconstruct the fish cleaning facility.

Trail System
44. Improve the existing East Shore-West Shore trails loop with an all-season surface.

Other Recreation
45. Construct more picnic sites where useful and appropriate.

Facilities Management at Contra Loma Regional Park
46. Increase EBRPD's irrigation allotment of 100 acre-feet per year by 50%.
47. Remove trash and dead tules from the reservoir when water levels are low.

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Antioch Community Park
Sports Fields
48. When new or modified sports fields are planned, the types of sports desired by the public will be
considered. Mixed-use sports fields will be considered.
49. Improve maintenance of the existing soccer fields to reduce drainage problems, eliminate gopher
holes and uneven surfaces, and improve turf quality.
50. Improve existing soccer fields to allow use in wet weather.
51. Improve drainage on the south side of the southern sports field while reducing impacts on the
adjacent riparian habitat.

Other Facility Management
52. Comply with ADA accessibility requirements for future improvements at the Community Park..

4.2 Management Actions for Alternative 3: Expanded Recreation and
Facilities
Objectives
The objective of this alternative is to expand recreational uses and facilities to accommodate increasing
demand, especially for additional all-weather sports fields, while protecting natural and cultural resources.

Contra Loma RMP Preliminary Draft Alternatives

Page 10

February 2011

This alternative is included to demonstrate a scenario in which recreational uses and facilities at Contra
Loma are substantially expanded while still meeting the RMP goals related to protection of natural and
cultural resources to the extent feasible. This alternative builds upon and is in addition to the
management actions listed under Alternative 2.

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Contra Loma Regional Park
Swim lagoon
53. Increase the size of the swim lagoon, if needed to accommodate increased demand.

Fishing
54. Add more fishing docks if needed to accommodate increased demand, possibly on the east shore.
55. Improve shoreline access for fishing by managing shoreline vegetation in areas not used for
wildlife nesting or breeding.
56. Construct a fishermen's shelter.

Trail System
57. Plant shade trees along trails.
58. Increase the number and length of trails available for mountain biking.
59. Increase loop trail opportunities for mountain biking.
60. Create multi-use trail connectors in several locations.

Other Recreation
61. Install shade structures to support recreational uses and to provide shade in parking areas. Some
shade structures may include solar panels that would supplement the Regional Park’s energy
needs.
62. Provide a playground structure.
63. Consider overnight group camping as part of the current day camp programs or special events
that require event-specific EBRPD authorization, oversight, and regulation.

Recreational Facilities and Opportunities at Antioch Community Park
Sports Fields
64. Expand the area for multi-use sports fields by adding fields directly south of the two existing
soccer fields on the east side of the community park. This would require expansion of the
community park boundaries south into the Regional Park and adjustment of the boundary
between the two parks.

Contra Loma RMP Preliminary Draft Alternatives

Page 11

February 2011

65. Increase parking if additional sports fields are built.
66. Increase the size of some soccer fields to accommodate older youth and adults (i.e., 70 yards x
110 yards).
67. Replace or install natural turf with artificial turf or a more robust grass.
68. Install lighting for the unlit sports fields to enable evening use throughout the year.

Other Recreation
69. Increase trails along the creek and riparian area and improve interconnection between trail
systems.
70. Create a botanical garden in the open space adjacent to the soccer fields.

Reservoir Management and Reservoir Water Quality
Reservoir Level Fluctuation
71. EBRPD and CCWD will work together toward developing a plan for managing reservoir levels in
a manner that reduces conflict with the reproductive cycle for fish, birds, waterfowl, and other
aquatic life along the shoreline; reduces occurrence of algae blooms and clam mortality along
shoreline; and improves recreational fishing and increase catches. The plan will be consistent
with the RMP management objective of protecting the water supply and water quality functions
of Contra Loma Reservoir.
