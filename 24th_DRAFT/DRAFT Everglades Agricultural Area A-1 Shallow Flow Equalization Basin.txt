EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA SHALLOW FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT
Responsible Agency: The lead agency is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District.
Cooperating Agencies include the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
Abstract: The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) proposes to construct and
operate a Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB) in Palm Beach County, Florida. The Shallow
FEB is an above-ground 60,000 acre-foot impoundment with a maximum operating depth of 4
feet. The Shallow FEB would be constructed on 16,152 acres of land situated north of
Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) 3/4 and between the Miami and North New River Canals in
the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). As proposed, construction of the Shallow FEB would
place fill within 296.5 acres of freshwater marsh wetlands to construct levees, place fill within
164.5 acres of canals to create appropriate wetland elevations, and excavate 75.8 acres of
canals and ditches. Operation of the Shallow FEB would inundate 10,517 acres of jurisdictional
wetlands and 1,147.65 acres of uplands to create an emergent marsh habitat. The SFWMD is
required to obtain a Department of the Army permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act. This Draft Environmental Impact Statement evaluates the environmental effects of
four (4) alternatives: the No Action Alternative, the SFWMD’s Preferred Alternative (the
Shallow FEB), a deep FEB Alternative, and a Stormwater Treatment Area Alternative. The
overall project purpose, as defined by the USACE, is to achieve the Water Quality Based Effluent
Limit at the STA 2 and STA 3/4 discharge points in the Central Flowpath of the Everglades
Protection Area. To achieve this, the Shallow FEB project would retain and deliver water at
improved timing to the STAs so that the STAs perform at a more optimized efficiency.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT
EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA A-1 SHALLOW FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
IN PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA
A.

BACKGROUND

The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) is requesting regulatory authorization
from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in the form of a Department of the
Army (DA) permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, to construct a shallow Flow
Equalization Basin (FEB) on the A-1 project site in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). The A1 project site is approximately 16,152 acres and bordered to the east by US Highway 27, to the
south by Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) 3/4, to the west by an area known as the Holey
Land Wildlife Management Area and to the north by agricultural lands.
The Shallow FEB is designed to improve the phosphorus treatment performance in STAs 2 and
3/4 by retaining and then delivering water to the STAs with improved flow and timing, which is
expected to increase the effectiveness of phosphorus treatment in the STAs prior to discharge
in the Everglades Protection Area (EPA). Since the A-1 Site was purchased with Farm Bill Funds,
the SFWMD will request approval for a land use change from the United States Department of
the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

B.

NEED FOR PROPOSED ACTION

The SFWMD is required to meet a numeric discharge limit, referred to as the Water Quality
Based Effluent Limit (WQBEL), that is contained in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit for discharges from the STAs into the EPA. The WQBEL was developed
to assure that such discharges do not cause or contribute to exceedances of the 10 parts per
billion (ppb) total phosphorus (TP) criterion (expressed as a long-term geometric mean [LTGM])
established under 62-302.540, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) (SFWMD – Final Technical
Support Document for the WQBEL 2012). The TP criterion is measured at a network of stations
across the EPA marsh and is intended to prevent imbalances of aquatic flora and fauna. The
WQBEL is measured at the discharge points from each STA and requires that the total
phosphorus concentration in STA discharges shall not exceed: 1) 13 ppb as an annual flowweighted mean in more than three out of five water years on a rolling basis; and 2) 19 ppb as
an annual flow-weighted mean in any water year. Excess phosphorus discharged into the EPA
has caused ecological impacts within the Everglades.

Although phosphorus levels in the discharges from STA 2 and STA 3/4 have been reduced
during the years that these STAs have been operating, these STA discharges have not achieved
the WQBEL. As a result of technical discussions in early 2010, the SFWMD, Florida Department
of Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
developed a plan to ensure that discharges into the EPA do not cause or contribute to
exceedances of the State of Florida’s 10 ppb TP numeric phosphorus criterion entering into the
EPA. The above agencies identified a suite of water quality projects that would work in
conjunction with the existing Everglades STAs to meet the WQBEL at the discharge points from
the STAs. As a result of these technical discussions, on September 10, 2012, FDEP issued NPDES
and Everglades Forever Act (EFA) permits and consent orders establishing the WQBEL and the
suite of water quality improvement projects to be constructed. The Shallow FEB at the A-1
project site is the project proposed by the SFWMD to achieve the WQBEL within the Central
Flowpath of the EAA.
The SFWMD is proposing to meet the WQBEL in flows from STA 2 and STA 3/4 by using a
shallow FEB at the A-1 project site to temporarily store excess water from within the central
EAA, collected by the North New River and Miami Canals. This water is then delivered from the
Shallow FEB to STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4 at an improved rate. By managing
basin runoff in the Central Flowpath in a more advantageous manner, the impacts of storm
driven events would be reduced for STA 2 and STA 3/4. The proposed projects will also
improve operations of the STAs in the dry season by providing water during the periods of
drought and low water conditions. Attenuating and managing excess water flows in the Central
Flowpath is intended to enhance operations and improve phosphorus treatment performance
in STA 2 and STA 3/4 so that these STA discharges meet the WQBEL.
The goals and objectives are to assist STA 2 and 3/4 in achieving the WQBEL at the STA
discharge points in three ways:
1. Attenuate peak water flows and temporarily store runoff from the central EAA,
thereby minimizing the discharge of untreated water into the EPA,
2. Improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4, thereby providing enhanced
operation and phosphorus treatment performance, and
3. Assist in maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout
conditions within STA 2 and STA 3/4, which will sustain phosphorus treatment
performance.
The overall project purpose, as defined by the USACE, is to achieve the WQBEL at the STA 2 and
STA 3/4 discharge points into the Central Flowpath of the Everglades Protection Area. The

C.

SCOPE OF ANALYSIS

The USACE determined that the scope of this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
includes the A-1 project site, the STAs that the proposed project would assist (STAs 2 and 3/4),
and the Everglades Water Conservation Areas that receive the STAs discharges (WCA 2A and
3A). The A-1 project site was originally purchased using Department of the Interior’s (DOI)
Farm Bill funds for the Central Everglades Restoration Plan EAA A-1 Storage Reservoir project
and is subject to land use restrictions; therefore, the land use of the site is a major component
of the scope of analysis. The EAA was historically Everglades wetlands, which has now been
ditched and drained. Much of the EAA canal system, including the extensive network of ditches
and canals along the perimeter of the site, is considered to be “navigable waters of the United
States” under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbor Act.
The lands within the A-1 project site have been previously farmed. However, the lands were
taken out of agricultural use and the wetland hydrology, hydric plants, and hydric soils have
returned. Therefore, the US!E’s regulatory jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act includes the project site as well as wetlands and aquatic resources that will be affected as a
result of the project. A number of federally listed species utilize the project site as well as other
natural areas that will be affected by the project. Taking these factors into consideration, the
proposed project is subject to substantial federal control and responsibility and the scope of
analysis is extended over the entire site.

D.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

This Draft EIS evaluates construction of the applicant’s (SFWMD) preferred alternative, which is
a shallow FEB on the A-1 project site. The USACE will analyze a range of alternatives to
determine if the applicant’s preferred alternative is the least environmentally damaging
practicable alternative, and if the applicant’s preferred alternative is not contrary to the public’s
interest. The range of alternatives considered in this EIS include the No Action Alternative, the
!pplicant’s Preferred Alternative (Shallow FEB), a Deep FEB, and an STA. The potential effects
of the Alternatives would largely be a function of the manner in, and degree to which, the
Alternative features are used in the context of other regional water management infrastructure
and system operations made possible by the presence of the enhanced water management
options and phosphorus treatment performance. The No Action Alternative and Alternatives 2
(Shallow FEB), 3 (Deep FEB), and 4 (STA) are presented to compare the differences in regional
water management infrastructure to effectively meet the project purpose.

DESCRIPTION OF ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Alternative 2 is a 15,000-acre shallow FEB, with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4
feet, and is SFWMD’s Preferred !lternative to be evaluated in this EIS. The shallow FE was
assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:









Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee heights for 4 feet
maximum operating depth)
Interior levees to convey inflows to the north end of the FEB (8.7+/- miles)
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA-3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

The majority of the shallow FEB outflows (approximately 80%) will be directed to STA 3/4 for
treatment while the remaining flows (approximately 20%) will be conveyed to STA 2 (including
Compartment B) via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Alternative 3 is a 15,000-acre deep FEB, with a maximum operating depth of approximately
12.5 feet. Alternative 3 was assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:










Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 20-30 feet levee heights for a maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet)
Inflow Pump Station to direct North New River Canal flows into the FEB to the maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
A cutoff wall to minimize or eliminate seepage impacts to adjacent areas
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA 3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

The majority of the deep FEB outflows (approximately 60%) will be will be directed to STA 3/4
for treatment while the remaining flows (approximately 40%) will be conveyed to STA 2
(including Compartment B) via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Alternative 4 is a 15,000-acre STA, with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4 feet.
The proposed STA would have a normal operating depth of approximately 1.25 – 1.5 feet and a
maximum operating depth of approximately 4 feet. Alternative 4 would operate in parallel with
STA 2 and STA 3/4. Alternative 4 was assumed to include the following components, at a
minimum:









Perimeter Levees around the STA (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee height for 4 feet maximum
operating depth)
Interior levees dividing the STA into cells
Inflow canals to direct inflows from the North New River and Miami Canals to the STA
Discharge canal to direct outflows from the STA to the L-5 Canal
Internal distribution canals to facilitate sheetflow through the cells
Internal collection canals to assist in conveying water out of the cells
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect STA seepage and return to STA
Operable water control structures to control water levels and flows into and out of all
STA cells

In order to operate the new STA, construction of conveyance features in addition to
construction of the STA itself will be required. Specifically, a discharge canal would need to be
constructed within the Holey Land Wildlife Management Area to connect the STA discharge
canal to the L-5 Canal. This would enable the delivery of discharges with low phosphorus from
the proposed STA to WCA 2A and/or WCA 3A via existing infrastructure, without interfering
with the existing operations of STA 2, STA 3/4 and the North New River and Miami Canals.

F.

SUMMARY OF SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

The effects of the alternatives on the environment were evaluated. Many of the environmental
effects were similar between Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. However, changes to the affected
environment are seen in land use, soils/total phosphorus removal, surface water, water quality,
and wetland impacts as a result of the Alternatives and discussed further in Chapter 4.

The evaluation of environmental impacts indicates that among the alternatives that are
projected to meet the WQEL at both ST!s, the SFWMD’s Preferred !lternative (the shallow
FEB) is the least expensive and also has the lowest wetland impact. The changes in hydroperiod
in the downstream Everglades (WCA 2A and WCA 3A) in each of the Action Alternatives is
negligible.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTROVERSY

This project is being developed with input and consensus from federal and state agencies, local
agencies and the public. There is currently ongoing coordination with the Seminole Tribe of
Florida, Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, USFWS, DOI, USEPA, Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FFWCC), and Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) to address concerns regarding impacts such as wetlands, water quality, flood protection,
wildlife and habitat, and threatened and endangered species. Numerous meetings have
occurred with the various agencies and the public in the context of identifying areas of
potential controversy and resolving or mitigating for those concerns. At this time, an area of
potential controversy that has been identified is mitigation for wetland impacts.
H.

LIST OF OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REQUIRED

The SFWMD shall be responsible for obtaining federal, state and local permits, licenses and
meet other consultation requirements for the proposed project, as described in this section and
Chapter 8 of the main report.
The US!E’s permitting decision is required to comply with many federal requirements
including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Endangered
Species Act (ESA), Rivers and Harbors Act, Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), Fish and
Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, and the National Historic Preservation Act. The USACE will
consider other relevant environmental laws as well as protection of wetlands, floodplain
management, environmental justice, and invasive/exotic species.
State requirements that will need to be satisfied for this project include Comprehensive
Everglades Restoration Plan Regulation Act (CERPRA) permit, a consumptive use evaluation
during the CERPRA Permitting process, Florida Department of Transportation Access Permit,
Clean Air (Title V) Permit, Petroleum Storage Tanks Permit, Hydrostatic Testing Permits, a Dam
Safety Permit, and possibly a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits.
Local permitting authority for the proposed EAA A-1 shallow FEB project resides with several
county Departments and Divisions. Primary coordination of local permit review will be
administered by Palm Beach ounty’s Planning, Zoning and uilding (PZ) Division.

February 2013

The SFWMD will be required to obtain approval from the DOI/USFWS for a land use change on
the A-1 project site.
The US!E made a determination that the SFWMD’s proposed shallow FE project may affect,
but is not likely to adversely affect the !udubon’s crested caracara, the Florida panther, the
Everglade snail kite, and the wood stork; and may adversely affect the eastern indigo snake.
Formal consultation will occur with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

I.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES

The US!E has concerns with the SFWMD’s proposed mitigation plan for the Deep FEB and the
STA alternatives. The SFWMD proposes to obtain ecological lift within the boundary of either
the Deep FEB or STA for hydrologic and vegetation benefits expected from the additional
retained water. The STA would function for water quality purposes while the Deep FEB would
operate at depths that would preclude rooted wetland vegetation from establishing. The
USACE does agree that the Shallow FEB would provide wetland benefits and therefore, does
not have concerns with recognizing the environmental benefits of the project to offset the loss
of wetland function and value.
The USACE has concerns with utilizing potential excess functional credits for future impacts on
other SFWMD’s Restoration Strategy projects. The shallow FEB will accept water during storm
events, and supply water to the STA during the dry season. This will leave the Shallow FEB
more susceptible to changes in water elevations, including deeper high water events and longer
dry-out conditions as the FEB is managed to attenuate flow to the STAs. The USACE does
believe that the post-project conditions on the Shallow FEB site would be ecologically beneficial
as compared to the existing site conditions and accepts utilizing those credits to offset the
impacts associated with the construction of the Shallow FEB. However, this habitat may not
provide appropriate mitigation (e.g. in kind) for potential future impacts on other SFWMD
Restoration Strategy projects.
The FDEP, the USFWS and the USEPA have raised questions with the Unified Mitigation
Assessment Methodology scores, the time lag, and risk associated with the Compensatory
Mitigation Plan as described in Chapter 5. Further discussion with the agencies will occur prior
to finalizing the UMAM scores.

J.
COMPENSATORY MITIGATION TO OFFSET THE LOSS OF WETLAND
FUNCTION AND VALUE
The SFWMD’s compensatory wetland mitigation plan for !lternatives 2, 3, and 4 includes
hydrologic and vegetation benefits within the footprint of the project. By retaining additional
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

water on the site, it is anticipated that the hydrology and the vegetation community within the
footprint of the project would improve from the current condition. In assessing the pre- and
post-project conditions of the wetlands with Unified Mitigation Assessment Methodology
(UMAM), the project results in an environmental benefit (or excess credits). The SFWMD is
proposing to create a ledger system to utilize any excess credits generated as a result of this
project for future SFWMD Restoration Strategies projects. The SFWMD’s proposed surplus is
approximately 2,670 credits.

K.

COORDINATION

Throughout the evolution of project design alternates, federal and state agencies, county
officials, and the public have been kept informed through a scoping meeting, social media,
news release, and public notices designed to inform, gather input, and respond to questions
regarding the proposed project. The public, government agencies, federally-recognized Native
American Tribes, and interested parties are afforded the opportunity to provide input regarding
this project by reviewing and commenting on the draft and final EIS. Project information,
schedules, documents, and presentations to the public are also kept updated and available on
the USACE website: http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/ItemsofInterest.aspx.

1.0 PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION
1.1

INTRODUCTION

The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) has submitted an application to the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, Regulatory Division (USACE) for a
Department of the Army (DA) permit authorizing the discharge of dredge or fill material into
waters of the United States (US), including wetlands under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
(CWA) for construction of a shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB). The FEB is proposed in
western Palm Beach County, Florida, on land designated as Compartment A-1 (A-1 project site)
within the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) (Figure 1.1). The A-1 project site is approximately
16,000 acres and bordered to the east by US Highway 27, to the south by Stormwater
Treatment Area (STA) 3/4, to the west by an area known as the Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area (Holey Land) and to the north by agricultural lands.
Water flowing south from Lake Okeechobee can be separated into three flowpaths: the
Western flowpath that extends beyond the EAA to the west, the Central flowpath, which is the
bulk of the EAA, and the Eastern flowpath (Figure 1-2). These flowpaths are delineated by the
source basins that route flows into the existing Everglades STAs. The project site is in the
southern portion of the Central EAA flowpath. The Central EAA is mainly comprised of the S-2,
S-3, S-6, S-7, and S-8 drainage basins and also includes the following independent water
management or drainage districts established by Chapter 298 Florida Statutes (commonly
referred to as 298 Districts): South Florida Conservancy District and South Shore Drainage
District (Figure 1-3). Currently, the North New River and Miami Canals route flows from these
basins and 298 Districts into STA 2, Compartment B, and STA 3/4 for phosphorus treatment
prior to discharging into Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A and WCA 3A. On occasion, water
is diverted around the STAs and discharged directly into the WCAs. During extreme storm
events, “diversions” could occur as water is sent directly from the canals into the W!s without
entering into the STAs if the water volumes in the canals exceed the capacity of the STAs.
Alternately, when dry conditions in the Lower East Coast may lead to salt water intrusion, water
is delivered directly from the canals into the WCAs to help maintain the freshwater gradient in
the coastal wells. Water diversions in the dry season are referred to as urban water supplies.

Purpose and Need

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT REQUIREMENTS

The USACE anticipates a decision on the proposed activities which would constitute a Major
Federal Action in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 1501.8 and is
preparing documentation to comply with requirements of the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 United States Code (USC) §§ 4321 et seq.]. NEP! is the “basic national
charter for protection of the environment” [40 CFR §1500.1(a)] and requires federal agencies to
be fully informed about the environmental consequences of their decision to provide financial
assistance, exercise permit or regulatory authority, or to conduct an action that may
significantly affect the environment. In addition, NEPA mandates that the public be informed of
the proposed actions, the consequences of the actions, and the ultimate agency decision.
Based on the size of the project area, the current purpose for the site, and the potential
positive and negative environmental effects, both individually and cumulatively, of the
anticipated action (the proposed A-1 Shallow FEB), the USACE has determined that the project
would “significantly” affect the human environment; Therefore, an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) is necessary to inform any final decision on the permit application. The
US!E’s decision will be to either issue, issue with modifications to the applicant’s proposal, or
deny a DA permit for the proposed action.
This document is an EIS that provides a comprehensive environmental analysis to aid in the
decision making process for the DA permit application for the proposed Shallow FEB. The
USACE has prepared this EIS in accordance with the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ)
Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B “National Environmental
Policy Act Implementation Procedures for the Regulatory Program”, and 40 FR §230.10(a),
which implement the procedural provisions of the NEPA (42 USC §§4321 et seq.) for the USACE.
The CEQ regulations implementing the NEPA mandate that Federal agencies responsible for
preparing NEP! analyses and documentation do so “in cooperation” with other agencies with
jurisdiction by law or special expertise (40 CFR §§ 1501.6 & 1508.5). The proposed project
would require authorization from the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA and would be
subject to U.S. Department of Interior (DOI)/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) approval for
a land use change for construction of a Shallow FEB on the A-1 Project Site. Therefore, the
USACE requested that the DOI be a cooperating agency on this EIS, and the DOI agreed on
October 30, 2012. Since the USFWS and the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
have expertise in threatened or endangered species and water quality, respectively, the USACE

Purpose and Need

EIS. Because the authorization from the USACE is the major federal action, the USACE is the
lead federal agency for this NEPA process and is responsible for preparation of the EIS.
This particular chapter of the EIS will cover the project background and purpose, and a
description of the project as proposed by the SFWMD. This chapter is designed to provide a
concise description to the public and to decision makers about what the essential needs and
goals are for the project; The project’s purpose and need is presented in Section 1.5. Section
1.6 describes the permit decision to be made while Section 1.7 discusses issues raised by the
public. Finally, Section 1.8 discusses the environmental documents related to the proposed
permit action.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Section 1.3.1 provides background information to describe the history of actions that have
focused on managing phosphorus levels in the Everglades Protection Area (EPA) as defined in
the 1994 Everglades Forever Act (EFA), including the adoption of the phosphorus Water Quality
Based Effluent Limits (WQBEL) for the STAs, and the development of Regional Water Quality
Plan. The EPA includes WCA 1, otherwise known as Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National
Wildlife Refuge (the Refuge), WCA 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and the Everglades National Park. Section
1.3.2 describes the prior permitting history associated with the previously permitted A-1
Reservoir project. Finally, Section 1.3.3 describes the history and need to obtain approval for a
land use change on the A-1 project site.

1.3.1 HISTORY OF PHOSPHORUS MANAGEMENT IN THE EVERGLADES
In 1988, the federal government filed a complaint in federal court against the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and SFWMD for alleged violations of state
water quality (U.S. v. FDER and SFWMD, Case No. 88-1886-CIV-MORENO). The lawsuit was
settled in 1991. In 1992, a Consent Decree was entered embodying the terms of the 1991
settlement agreement. The 1992 Consent Decree identified a number of specific actions the
State needed to undertake to address excess phosphorus in discharges from the EAA into the
Everglades. These include the development of a regulatory program for implementation of
performance-based best management practices (BMPs) to reduce phosphorus in outflows from
EAA farms, and creation of the initial 32,600 acres of STAs with 34,700 total acres to be
purchased. STAs are shallow marshes constructed and operated to reduce phosphorus levels in
surface water entering the EPA. The Consent Decree also included interim and long-term
phosphorus concentration limits for inflows to the Everglades National Park (ENP), and ambient
phosphorus levels for the Refuge marsh.

Purpose and Need

In 1994, expanding upon the 1992 Consent Decree, the Florida Legislature enacted the
Everglades Forever Act (EFA), which, following the approach identified in the 1992 Consent
Decree, envisioned a two pronged approach to achieving water quality standards in the EPA.
First, the EFA directed the SFWMD to implement a regulatory source control program requiring
landowners in the EAA and adjacent C-139 Basin to reduce phosphorus in their runoff prior to
discharge. Second, the EFA required the SFWMD to acquire land, then design, permit, and
construct an expanded series of STAs to further reduce phosphorus levels in stormwater runoff
and other sources before it enters the EPA. In 1995, the settling parties (ENP, the Refuge, FDEP,
and SFWMD) jointly moved to modify the Consent Decree, including the size of and the
deadline for completion of STAs, to reflect changed circumstances and the enactment of the
EFA by the Florida legislature in 1994. The motion to approve those modifications was granted
in 2001. In the 1994 EFA, the STAs, also known as the Everglades Construction Project (ECP),
originally consisted of six large constructed wetlands totaling about 40,450 acres. The STAs
were expanded by approximately 5,000 acres in FY2007 while in FY2012, completion of
construction of Compartments B and C resulted in an additional 12,000 acres of treatment area.
As discussed below, the latest proposed expansion embodied in the 2012 NPDES permit for the
STAs will bring the STAs to a total of approximately 57,000 acres. (SFWMD 2013)
The EFA also required the development of a numeric total phosphorus water quality standard
for the EPA by December 31, 2003, or a default standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb) would
take effect. Although the default criterion did become effective, it was replaced with the
current 10 ppb criterion which includes a four part methodology to measure achievement of
the criterion. If the STAs and source controls contemplated by the EFA would not achieve
water quality standards including the applicable numeric criterion for total phosphorus in the
EPA by December 31, 2006, the EFA required the SFWMD to submit a new proposal to the FDEP
by December 31, 2003, that would achieve compliance by 2006. In March 2003, the SFWMD
developed and submitted the Everglades Protection Area Tributary Basins Conceptual Plan for
Achieving Long-Term Water Quality Goals (Long-Term Plan) to FDEP, which was incorporated
into the EFA by reference. The Long Term Plan was revised in October 2003. Also in 2003, the
Florida legislature amended the EFA twice requiring the SFWMD to implement the Long-Term
Plan in two phases. The initial phase included STA expansions, physical and vegetative
enhancements to existing STAs, expanded source control programs, or BMPs, and integration
with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) projects. The second phase was to
be developed if the elements of the initial phase were unsuccessful in achieving water quality
standards in the EPA by 2016.
The STA expansions and enhancements described in the initial phase of the Long-Term Plan
have been completed and reductions in phosphorus concentrations have been achieved, but

Purpose and Need

concentrations are still higher than the water quality standard. Despite the success of these
measures state and federal agencies recognize the need to further improve the quality of water
entering the Everglades in order to achieve the standards.
In 2004, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida (Miccosukee Tribe) and the Friends of the
Everglades (FOE) brought suit against the USEPA alleging that the 2003 EFA amendments were
new or revised state water quality standards that USEPA should have reviewed and
disapproved. The complaint also alleged that USEPA should have reviewed and disapproved
parts of the State’s phosphorus rule. USEPA already reviewed and approved the numeric
criterion and implementing methodology for total phosphorus. After several remands and
actions, in July 2008, Judge Alan Gold agreed with the Miccosukee Tribe and FOE and issued an
order enjoining FDEP from issuing new NPDES permits for the STAs that authorize discharges
above the 10 ppb phosphorus standard. The Judge also ordered USEPA to review and
disapprove the amendments to the EFA and to review the remainder of the State’s phosphorus
rule to determine if it is in compliance with CWA. In December 2009 USEPA issued a new
determination disapproving the EFA Amendments as new or revised water quality standards as
well as disapproving portions of the phosphorus rule. In response to motions filed by the
Miccosukee Tribe and FOE, on April 14, 2010, Judge Gold further ordered USEPA to issue an
Amended Determination identifying the remedies and strategies that the SFWMD would need
to implement to achieve the 10 ppb phosphorus standard in the EPA. The Court also ordered
the State to submit NPDES permits within 60 days of the Amended Determination that
conformed to the ourt’s orders, and the !mended Determination.

1.3.1.1

Restoration Strategy

In response to Judge Gold’s April 14, 2010, order, the USEPA began a technical review of the
current phosphorus control technologies in order to develop a suite of remedies and strategies
to achieve water quality standards in the EPA. USEPA consulted with the SFWMD, FDEP, and
others during the development of these remedies and strategies. USEPA first identified a
WQBEL for discharges into the EPA that USEPA determined would achieve compliance with the
State of Florida’s numeric phosphorus criterion in the EPA. USEPA, after months of modeling of
various options and discussion, subsequently identified a suite of additional water quality
projects based on the modeling that would work in conjunction with the existing Everglades
STAs to meet the WQBEL for discharges from those STAs. USEP!’s Evaluation of !lternatives to
Achieve Phosphorus WQBELs in Discharges to the Everglades Area dated September 2, 2012 is
included in Appendix G.

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

On September 3, 2010, USEPA issued an Amended Determination (2010 AD) identifying a
recommended WQBEL, and a suite of remedies and strategies designed to achieve the WQBEL.
The 2010 AD is included in Appendix G.
In particular, the 2010 AD proposed that the A-1 site would be designated as an STA to
maximize phosphorus uptake. The size of the STA that the USEPA predicted would be needed to
meet the WQBEL was based on many factors and assumptions including the volume of flow to
be treated and the concentration of TP in these flows. Based on these assumptions, the
modeling predicted a 15,600 acre STA would be needed in the Central Flowpath to meet the
WQBEL at the discharge points of STA 2 and STA 3/4. The USEPA noted in the 2010 AD that
there may be other project designs that could meet the WQBEL and invited the SFWMD to
submit an alternative plan. Since the USEPA issued the 2010 AD, additional permitting
developments occurred.
On November 2, 2010, consistent with the ourt’s !pril 14, 2010 Order, FDEP submitted
example NPDES permits to the Court and indicated that FDEP lacked State law authority to
conform to the 2010 AD without compliance schedules. After hearings, the Court issued a
subsequent order that deemed these permits as submitted to USEPA as draft permits for
review under the CWA. USEPA objected to these permits finding certain provisions, including
the use of the compliance schedules, inconsistent with the requirements of the CWA.
In addressing USEP!’s objections, the SFWMD began a new analysis of potential remedies,
starting with the work done for the Amended Determination. The SFWMD updated and
revised some of the flow data and hydrologic modeling upon which the USEPA had relied in
developing the projects for the 2010 AD. For example, the SFWMD plan assumed a slightly
lower volume of water to be treated, and relied upon different assumptions regarding TP
concentrations in the water to be treated. Both the 2010 AD and the SFWMD plan relied on the
use of the 15,000 acre A-1 site to store or treat water. However, the revised SFWMD plan
would utilize the A-1 site as a 54,000 acre-foot FEB to manage and meter water flow and
phosphorus load discharged into STA 2 and STA 3/4. Even though the FEB was not designed to
treat phosphorus, water depth in the Shallow FEB is projected by the State to support
vegetation that is likely to aid in the removal of additional phosphorus.
The new modeling relied on new data and information and options that were not available to
the USEPA at the time of the 2010 AD. After extensive technical discussions with the SFWMD
and the FDEP and thorough evaluation, the USEPA concluded that the State plan is based on an
appropriate set of assumptions given the information available at the time the plan was

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

developed. The USEPA determined that the State plan can reasonably be expected to achieve
the WQBEL.
The USEPA worked closely with other federal agencies, the SFWMD, and the FDEP to identify a
modified suite of remedies that was based on many months of additional modeling by the
SFWMD, ENP and the Refuge. Ultimately, these new remedies were incorporated into a draft
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and consent order, along with
an EFA permit and consent order, issued by FDEP on June 6, 2012. Historically, each STA had an
individual permit. It was decided to issue one watershed NPDES permit for all the STAs. The
2012 revised NPDES watershed permit, associate documents and draft enforcement consent
order between the FDEP and the SFWMD include corrective actions and deadlines to achieve
the WQBEL. These documents are in Appendix G and can be found online at the website:
http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wqssp/everglades/ecp-sta.htm.
USEPA found the permit addressed its objections, which led to final NPDES permit being issued
on September 10, 2012. The permit established a WQBEL and identified a suite of additional
water quality improvement projects developed by the State in lieu of those in the Amended
Determination to be constructed identified as the Regional Water Quality Plan (RWQP).
This EIS, although independent from the evaluation performed by the USEPA in the Amended
Determination and subsequent evaluation associated with the 2012 NPDES permit recognizes
the prior discussions between the USEPA, SFWMD and FDEP. This is also reflected in USEP!’s
memorandum reviewing the State’s proposal, entitled, “!ssessment of the State of Florida’s
Everglades Water Quality Plan,” dated June 13, 2012.

1.3.1.2

Water Quality Based Effluent Limit

The WQBEL is a numeric discharge limit that will be applied to all NPDES permitted discharges
from Everglades STAs to the EPA to assure that such discharges do not cause or contribute to
exceedances of the 10 ppb total phosphorus (TP) criterion [expressed as a long-term geometric
mean (LTGM)] established under 62-302.540, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) (SFWMD –
Final Technical Support Document for the WQBEL 2012). TP is measured at a network of
stations across the EPA marsh and prevents imbalances of aquatic flora and fauna. The WQBEL
is measured at the discharge points from each STA and requires that total phosphorus
concentration in STA discharges shall not exceed: 1) 13 ppb as an annual flow-weighted mean
in more than three out of five water years on a rolling basis; and 2) 19 ppb as an annual flowweighted mean in any water year.

Purpose and Need

Regional Water Quality Plan

The RWQP was the result of many months of discussions and modeling by both the State of
Florida and ENP and the Refuge, and is composed of projects divided into the three EAA flow
paths (Eastern, Central and Western) (Figure 1-2). Under the RWQP, the proposed Shallow FEB
project, a component of the Central Flowpath, is an incremental step towards achieving the
overall goal of meeting water quality standards in the EPA. The Shallow FEB is the subject of this
EIS. Other projects identified in the RWQP will be evaluated as appropriate for those projects
requiring DA authorization under the CWA.

1.3.2 PRIOR DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY PERMITS
On October 14, 2004, (after passage of the EF! and before Judge Gold’s decision) a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) regarding acceleration of several CERP and other water
quality improvement projects was signed by the Governor’s Executive Office and the SFWMD.
Collectively the group of projects was named Acceler8. Acceler8, consisting of eight projects
with multiple components (Figure 1-4), was designed to expedite attainment of water quality,
quantity, timing and delivery goals of Everglades restoration efforts ahead of the federal
implementation schedule for CERP. The eight Acceler8 projects include:
• C-44 (St. Lucie Canal) Reservoir / Stormwater Treatment Area
• -43 (Caloosahatchee River) West Reservoir
• Everglades !gricultural !rea ST! Expansion
• Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoir- Phase 1 (later phase to include Bolles and
Cross Canals Improvements)
• Water Preserve Areas Includes Site 1, C-9, C-11, Acme Basin B, Water Conservation Area3A/3B Seepage Management Area
• Picayune Strand (Southern Golden Gate Estates) Restoration
• iscayne ay oastal Wetlands - Phase 1
• -111 Spreader Canal
As part of the Acceler8 program, the SFWMD pursued construction of a 12.5-foot deep
reservoir on the A-1 project site for water storage ahead of the federal schedule for
implementation of a CERP reservoir project at that site. The 12.5-foot deep reservoir was to be
the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir – Phase 1 (fourth bullet above) project, also referred
to as the A-1 Reservoir. As described in the 2006 Final EIS for the EAA A-1 Reservoir, the overall
project purpose of the reservoir was to provide water storage in order to improve timing of
water deliveries from the EAA to the WCAs, reduce Lake Okeechobee regulatory releases to the
estuaries (i.e. route additional water from the lake south thereby reducing discharges to the

estuaries), meet supplemental agricultural irrigation demands, and increase flood protection
within the EAA. A DA permit was issued to the SFWMD for the discharge of dredged or fill
material into waters of the US associated with the construction of the 190,000 acre-foot A-1
Reservoir in July 2006. The SFWMD began construction on the EAA A-1 Reservoir in 2006, but
terminated the construction contract in late 2008. Subsequently, in 2008 the State of Florida
announced the River of Grass proposal to purchase additional lands in the EAA and C-139
Annex from the U.S. Sugar Corporation. The SFWMD recognized that the acquisition of
additional lands could lead to modifications of the plan for the A-1 Reservoir beyond what was
contemplated by the expedited project. The DA permit for the A-1 Reservoir has since expired.
The SFWMD having terminated the plans for the reservoir, is now proposing to construct a
Shallow FEB (up to 4 feet of surface water) on the A-1 project site (Figure 1-5). The purpose of
this project is not to be confused with purpose of the A-1 Reservoir as the project purposes are
quite different. The main difference is that the A-1 Reservoir project purpose was to reduce
Lake Okeechobee regulatory releases to the estuaries (i.e. to route additional water from the
lake south thereby reducing discharges to the estuaries) and provide water storage for other
uses, while this project would only attenuate the flow of existing water into the STAs to
maximize water quality treatment for existing water, that is water currently sent south from
Lake Okeechobee (does not accept water releases that would have otherwise been sent to the
estuaries). To construct the Shallow FEB, a new DA permit will be required to fill waters of the
US, including wetlands.

Purpose and Need

1.3.3 TALISMAN LAND ACQUISITION
The need to obtain an interim land use change approval from the DOI/USFWS for construction
of the Shallow FEB on the A-1 project site is a requirement of the funding agreement entitled
Cooperative Agreement Among the United States Department of the Interior and the Nature
Conservancy and the South Florida Water Management District (Cooperative Agreement).
Congress enacted the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (Farm Bill) and
provided funds on April 4, 1996 (Public Law 104-127, 110 Statute 1022). Under Section 390 of
the Farm Bill, the Secretary of Interior was authorized to use funds made available to conduct
restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem in South Florida, including, but not limited to
the acquisition of real property and interests in real property located within the Everglades
ecosystem. The Farm Bill provided that the Secretary of the Interior could transfer funds to the
USACE, the State of Florida, or the SFWMD to conduct the aforementioned restoration
activities.
A Framework Agreement was entered between the DOI, the Department of the Army, the State
of Florida, FDEP and the SFWMD, on October 3, 1996, which provides a framework for the
Secretary of Interior to provide funds under Section 390 to the other parties for Everglades
ecosystem restoration. The parties agreed to use Section 390 funds, in part, to acquire real
property for conservation purposes and to construct features that are intended to become part
of existing or future USACE projects authorized by Congress. The parties agreed that any real
property acquired or features constructed with these funds will be used to conduct restoration
activities in the Everglades ecosystem. The Framework Agreement provides that the terms and
conditions relevant to the provision of Section 390 funds shall be set forth in individual funding
agreements. It also provides that funding agreements between DOI, FDEP, and the SFWMD
generally will use the standard forms and follow the standard procedures of the USFWS
pertaining to the provision of funds including grants or cooperative agreements, whichever the
case may be.
The Framework Agreement specifically provides that real property acquired may be managed
for purposes that are not inconsistent with the purpose of restoring the Everglades ecosystem
until the land is intended to be incorporated into a DA project. In addition, the Framework
Agreement provides a dispute resolution mechanism.
In 1999, the Nature Conservancy under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement closed on the
acquisition of approximately 50,000 acres of land located within the southern portion of the
EAA in Palm Beach and Hendry Counties. This acquisition, which included the Compartment A-1
lands, was the culmination of many years of negotiations.
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

The DOI transferred funds to the Nature Conservancy pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement,
and the SFWMD received the title to the properties acquired. The Cooperative Agreement
states that lands acquired for public ownership under this Agreement will be used and
managed for purposes of Everglades ecosystem restoration and will be subject to the provisions
of the Framework Agreement, including but not limited to, those provisions applicable to uses
of property prior to the commencement of the USACE project. Any proposed change in land use
of Compartment A-1 may not be implemented until the DOI/USFWS: 1) reviews the proposal; 2)
determines that it meets the requirements of the NEPA, Section 7 of the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and any other applicable
statutes; and 3) approves the proposal. The Cooperative Agreement also includes a procedure
for dispute resolution.
It is essential to Everglades restoration that water entering the WCAs achieves the WQBEL and
flows entering ENP meet the limits set in the phosphorus rule which are also the limits
identified in the 1992 Consent Decree, Appendix A for ENP. During the evaluation and
optimization for the A-1 project site the SFWMD determined a Shallow FEB would optimize the
treatment performance of the existing ST!’s and be more cost effective than a deep FEB, or
reservoir. Thus, concurrent with the analysis conducted in this EIS, in order to approve the land
use change for construction of the Shallow FEB, the DOI/USFWS must determine that the
Proposed Action furthers restoration of the Everglades.

1.4

DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTION

The proposed Shallow FEB is a shallow above-ground impoundment for the temporary storage
of stormwater runoff, with a capacity of approximately 60,000 acre-feet at an approximate
maximum operating depth of 4 feet (Figure 1-5). As a result of the project, approximately 536.8
acres of waters of the US, including wetlands, would be impacted as a result of placement of fill
and approximately 10,500 acres of waters of the US would be inundated (up to four feet of
water depth).
The key features of the Shallow FEB project include the following:


Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

The proposed Shallow FEB is intended to attenuate peak water flows and temporarily store
excess water from within the central EAA, collected by the North New River and Miami Canals
and to subsequently improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA
3/4. By managing basin runoff in the Central Flowpath in a more advantageous manner, the
impacts of storm driven events would be reduced for STA 2 and STA 3/4. The proposed Shallow
FEB will also improve operations of the STAs in the dry season by providing water during the
periods of drought and low water conditions. Attenuating and managing excess water flows in
the Central Flowpath will enhance operations and improve phosphorus treatment performance
in STA 2 and STA 3/4 so that these STA discharges meet the WQBEL. Discharges from these
STAs flow into WCA 2A and WCA 3A, part of the EPA marsh where the 10 ppb phosphorus
criterion is applied.
The goals and objectives for the Shallow FEB are to assist STA 2 and 3/4 in achieving the WQBEL
at the STA discharge. The FEB will facilitate this in concert with the STAs in three ways:
1. Attenuate peak water flows and temporarily store runoff from the central EAA,
thereby minimizing the discharge of untreated water into the EPA
2. Improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4, thereby providing enhanced
operation and phosphorus treatment performance
3. Assist in maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout
conditions within STA 2 and STA 3/4, which will sustain phosphorus treatment
performance
Although the 2012 Consent Order requires that construction commence by June 2014 and be
completed by July 2016, the SFWMD is proposing to move forward on an accelerated basis.
The SFWMD anticipates that construction would begin in October 2013 and be completed by
December 2014. The Consent Order requires that 54,000 acre-feet of storage capacity be
constructed. Since the A-1 project site could support 60,000 acre-feet of storage, the SFWMD
has chosen to utilize the maximum storage on the site.

Purpose and Need

PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED

In accordance with the NEPA, an EIS “shall briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to
which the agency is responding” (40 CFR §1502;13); When considered together, the “purpose”
and the “need” for the project establish the basic parameters for identifying the range of
alternatives to be considered in an EIS. Under NEPA (33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B) and under
Section 404 of the CWA pursuant to the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230), there
are three ways that the USACE is to examine the underlying goals, or purpose, of a project: 1)
the Applicant’s stated purpose and need (i;e; SFWMD’s stated purpose and need), 2) a “basic”
project purpose defined by the USACE specifically for addressing a project’s water dependency,
and 3) an “overall” project purpose, which is defined by the USACE and is used for the
alternatives analysis. Pursuant to 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B, when defining the purpose and
need for a project, “while generally focusing on the applicant's statement, the USACE will in all
cases, exercise independent judgment in defining the purpose and need for the project from
both from the applicant’s and the public’s perspective;”
Interpreting the !pplicant’s Stated Purpose and Need. The !pplicant’s stated purpose and
need is an expression, typically in the !pplicant’s own words, of the underlying goals for a
proposed project; The US!E takes an applicant’s purpose and need into account when
determining the overall purpose and the project purpose and need; The !pplicant’s purpose
and need is described in Section 1.5.1 below.
Defining the US!CE’s Basic Project Purpose. The USACE uses the basic project purpose to
determine water dependency [40 CFR §230.10(a)(3)]. If a project is not water dependent, other
alternatives that would not result in impacts to special aquatic sites are presumed to be
available. The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines state that practicable alternatives to nonwaterdependent activities are presumed to be available and to result in less environmental loss
unless clearly demonstrated otherwise by the applicant [40 CFR §230.10 (a)(3)]. Section 1.5.2.1
below defines the US!E’s basic project purpose as applied to the !pplicant’s proposed project;
The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines are one of the substantive criteria that the USACE uses to
evaluate a permit. The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines establish two rebuttable presumptions:
first, for a non-water-dependant project, the Guidelines presume that practicable alternatives
are available that do not involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into a special aquatic
site, such as wetlands. Second, the Guidelines presume that such alternatives result in less
adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem than wetland alternatives. These presumptions apply
unless the applicant clearly demonstrates otherwise. Application of these rebuttable

A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

1-18

February 2013

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

presumptions results in the identification of the least environmentally damaging practicable
alternative (LEDPA).
Defining the US!CE’s Overall Project Purpose. The USACE will use the overall project purpose
to identify alternatives for evaluation in this EIS and to determine if the !pplicant’s proposed
project is the LEDPA under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. According to USACE guidance in its
2009 Standard Operating Procedures, “The overall project purpose should be specific enough to
define the applicant’s needs, but not so restrictive as to constrain the range of alternatives that
must be considered under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Defining the overall project
purpose is the US!E’s responsibility; However, the applicant’s needs and the type of project
being proposed should be considered;” The US!E’s overall project purpose more specifically
addresses the Applicant’s purpose and need than does the USACE basic project purpose. The
US!E’s overall project purpose, as applied to the !pplicant’s proposed project, is defined in
Section 1.5.2.2 below.
Defining the DOI/USFWS’ Project Purpose and Need. The project purpose as defined by
DOI/USFWS is to conduct restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem. Because the
Compartment A lands were acquired for public ownership under the Cooperative Agreement
and are intended to be used and managed for purposes of Everglades Ecosystem Restoration
subject to the provisions of the Cooperative Agreement, any proposed change in land use of
Compartment A-1 may not be implemented until the DOI/USFWS approves the proposal.
Therefore, for purposes of this EIS, the DOI/USFWS must determine that the Proposed Action
results in restoration of the Everglades in order to approve the interim land use change for
construction of the Shallow FEB. Consistent with the Cooperative Agreement, this must include
an analysis of the actual contribution of these proposed actions to restoring the Everglades as
well as their contribution to improving the performance and operational flexibility of other
restoration features.

1.5.1 THE !PPLIC!NT’S PURPOSE !ND NEED ST!TEMENT
The !pplicant’s stated purpose and need is a statement that defines the intent and underlying
goals for a proposed project. The !pplicant’s stated purpose and need are as follows:
The SFWMD’s purpose of the project is to improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4 by
attenuating peak water flows and temporarily storing water runoff primarily from the central
EAA, and to assist in maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout
conditions within STA 2 and STA 3/4, which would increase the phosphorus treatment
performance of these STAs in order to achieve the WQBEL.
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

1-19

February 2013

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

The RWQP identified that an FEB was needed to improve management of flows in the Central
Flow Path. The Central Flow Path is primarily comprised of flows from the S-2/S-6/S-7 and S3/S-8 drainage basins, South Florida Conservancy District, and South Shore Drainage District
with a small amount of water coming from the C-139 Basin and Lake Okeechobee regulatory
releases under limited conditions. An FEB in this location within the EAA can manage basin
runoff in the Central Flowpath in a more advantageous manner than the no action alternative,
thereby reducing the impacts of storm driven events and dry-outs on STA 2 and STA 3/4
phosphorus reduction performance in order to assist these STAs in meeting the WQBEL.

1.5.2 USACE PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED STATEMENT
As stated above, the USACE defines the basic project purpose to determine water dependency
while the overall project purpose is used to identify and evaluate alternatives, including the
LEDPA.

1.5.2.1

USACE Basic Project Purpose and Water Dependency

The basic project purpose is to improve water quality of flows from the STAs 2 and 3/4. In
general, improvement of water quality or water treatment does not require access or proximity
to a special aquatic site. Therefore, the USACE finds that the basic project purpose is not water
dependent.
The A-1 project site is located in an area which consists of agricultural areas as well as wetlands
and ditches (or other Waters of the US). The need to attenuate water and then deliver it to the
STAs located at the south of the central flow path will ultimately limit the location of any
alternative sites of comparable size that could be utilized to satisfy the project purpose.
Additionally, other project sites within the Central Flowpath would have similar site
characteristics as the entire EAA has similar characteristics. Therefore, limited practicable
alternatives exist that would not have a similar impact on special aquatic sites and none of
these would be able to deliver water to the STA 3/4 and STA 2 as needed to improve
performance. The USACE may authorize the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of
the US for a proposed project that is not water dependent if the USACE determines that the
proposed project: (1) is the LEDPA and complies with other Section 404(b)(1) Guideline
requirements, (2) is not contrary to the public interest, and (3) complies with all other
applicable regulatory requirements.
The USACE determined that the DA permit application for the proposed Shallow FEB is a single
and complete project as defined in 33 CFR §330.2(i). While the Regional Water Quality Plan

February 2013

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

envisions multiple projects in three separate flow paths from the EAA into the Everglades, the
A-1 FEB project is the component of the Central Flowpath and has independent utility.

1.5.2.2

USACE Overall Project Purpose

The overall project purpose, as defined by the USACE, is to achieve the WQBEL at the STA 2 and
STA 3/4 discharge points in the Central Flowpath of the Everglades Protection Area.

1.5.3 DOI PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED STATEMENT
The purpose and need statement for the required DOI/USFWS interim land use change is to
conduct restoration activities within the Everglades ecosystem. Concurrent with the analysis
conducted by the USACE in this EIS, in order for approval of the land use change for
construction of the Shallow FEB, DOI/USFWS also must determine that the proposed action
furthers restoration of the Everglades.

1.6

DECISIONS TO BE MADE

The Proposed Action would result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the
US, including wetlands, through filling, excavation, land clearing, and other activities. Under
Section 404 of the CWA (33 USC §1344), the USACE is responsible for regulating the placement
of fill and discharge of dredged material into the waters of the US, including wetlands.
Therefore, because the SFWMD is seeking approval of a permit from the USACE, a federal
agency, the project involves a federal action. Because any environmental consequences of
SFWMD’s proposed project are essentially products of the USACE permit action, the scope of
the federal permitting action includes all of construction activities associated with this action on
the project site. Based on review of this EIS, the USACE will make a decision to either issue,
issue with conditions, or deny a permit for the Proposed Action.
The Proposed Action, through the USACE permit review requires consultation under Section 7
of the ESA and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, the Proposed
Action would involve evaluation for compliance with the Section 404 (b)(1) Guidelines of the
CWA; Section 401 of the CWA, the Clean Air Act, and federal requirements under the 1996
Farm Bill Act. A draft of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines evaluation is included in Appendix A,
the final evaluation will be provided in a Record of Decision that documents the DA permit
decision after completion of the Final EIS. Other authorizations required may include: a Water
Quality Certification issued pursuant to Section 401 of the CWA through the FDEP; a Coastal
Zone Management Act consistency determination under Section 307 issued by FDEP; an
Everglades Forever Act (EFA) from FDEP; a Conceptual Reclamation Plan issued by the FDEP;
and a Zoning and Land Use Permit issued by the appropriate county. If the STA is selected as

Purpose and Need

the preferred alternative, a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit for
construction and operation of an STA may also be required. Consultation and coordination,
including public involvement, are included in Chapter 7 of this EIS while a description of the
required permits, licenses and environmental laws are described in Chapter 8.

1.7

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

One of the basic tenets of NEPA is that comprehensive information is made available to the
public and agency officials before decisions are made and before actions are taken. In addition,
NEPA gives all persons, organizations, and government agencies the right to comment on
proposed federal actions that are evaluated by an EIS. To provide the public with the
comprehensive information they need to comment, the early identification of issues and
potential impacts is critical to efficient, effective EIS preparation. To obtain public input for this
draft EIS and to ensure that the information provided in the draft EIS was comprehensive, the
USACE sought input both early in the process, as required by NEPA, and throughout the
development of this document. The opportunities for public input available during the EIS
development are summarized in the following paragraphs.

1.7.1 SCOPING SUMMARY
The scoping process helps to establish the framework for the environmental study and
facilitates the development of the reasonable range of feasible alternatives to be evaluated in
the EIS. The goal of scoping is to provide opportunities for the public and agencies to provide
input on the proposed project. The lead federal agency uses scoping comments to identify the
nature and extent of potential issues and impacts.
To solicit public comments and develop a range of alternatives, the USACE held a public scoping
meeting, published the intent to complete an EIS in the Federal Register, distributed a public
notice, conducted a press release to media outlets, and consulted with agencies and federally
recognized Native American Tribes letters by mail. The USACE generated a mailing list of
interested parties which includes parties that had previously been involved with the A-1
Reservoir mailing list, a list of parties generated by the FDEP for the watershed NPDES permit
for the STAs parties on the distribution list for the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP)
and the River of Grass project, and parties interested in the EAA, as well as adjacent
landowners, State, Federal, and local governments. Approximately eighteen (18) people
attended the Scoping meeting which was held on September 6, 2012, at the SFWMD
Auditorium, 3300 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

During the formal scoping period from August 28, 2012, to September 27, 2012, fourteen (14)
issue-specific comments were identified in the communication received from the public and
agencies. In general, comments received were related to one or more of the following nine (9)
major categories:

general support for the project,
potential for improved habitat,
water quality,
fish and wildlife resources,
the interrelationship with the federal Central Everglades project,
wetland mitigation and a contingency plan,
effects of operation,
alternative analysis, and
downstream water quantity.

Scoping comments were used in conjunction with the USACE defined overall project purpose to
develop the full range of alternatives presented in Chapter 2. Specific public and agency input
received during scoping was used to inform the scope and range of issues addressed. This input
included:



geographic extent of the affected environment,
evaluation of the deep FEB, or reservoir, as an alternative.

1.7.2 ISSUES ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED ANALYSIS
The following issues were eliminated from detailed analysis based on public and internal
scoping:




Essential Fish Habitat – Since the proposed project would not change the amount of
freshwater that currently is released from Lake Okeechobee to tide, the project would
not affect essential fish habitat in the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries.
Air Quality – Although a new pump station would be required for the deep FEB and the
STA alternatives, no measurable changes in air quality are expected to occur as a result
of any of the alternatives. There may be a negligible impact on carbon monoxide
emissions within the project area as the pumps are expected to be standard flood
control diesel pump stations similar to those at G-370 and G-372. Short term increases
would be associated with earth-moving equipment and activities required to accomplish
the proposed construction activities, but those short-term impacts will be intermittent

in nature and likely offset by the cessation in use of agricultural equipment. Alternatives
2, 3, and 4 require exotic plant removal, which is anticipated to occur by burning. The
increase in air quality pollution associated with the vegetation burning is short term.
Long-term effects are associated with the operation of the existing pumps. However, it
is anticipated that there would be slight long-term improvements in air quality due to
the changes in land use from agricultural to uses such as water storage and native
wetland habitats.
Noise Pollution - No measurable changes in noise are expected to occur as a result of
any of the alternatives. Noise impacts are expected during construction activities;
however, this would be temporary in nature and limited to the immediate area of
construction. The long-term noise impacts are associated with the operation of the
existing pumps, which is not expected to cause concerns for humans or fish and wildlife
species.
Transportation – Any effect on highways from construction traffic would be short term
and would not cause extended delays on adjacent highways. These impacts could be
considered negligible considering the scope of construction work. Railways that exist in
the EAA to transport sugar cane and the mainline railroad, South Central Florida
Express, are not anticipated to be affected by Action Alternatives based on their
distance from project site.
Water Supply and Drinking Water - The project purpose does not involve increasing or
decreasing system performance for water supply or drinking water.

RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS

A number of previously published environmental documents contain information relevant to
this EIS. Brief summaries of some of the most relevant environmental documents are provided
in the following paragraphs. The reports and documents listed below were utilized to varying
degrees as sources of information to evaluate the proposed project and have helped to inform
the USACE as it developed this EIS on construction and operation of the Shallow FEB.

1.8.1 FINAL EIS – EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA RESERVOIR A-1
This EIS, which was completed in 2006, is the US!E’s NEPA document for the decision to
construct a reservoir on the project site. Even though the purpose of the previously permitted
reservoir is different from the purpose of the proposed Shallow FEB, much of the information
to develop the alternative to construct a deep FEB, or reservoir on the project site was based
on the 2006 EIS. In addition, background information and descriptions of the affected
environment were derived from the 2006 EIS.

Purpose and Need

1.8.2 FINAL EIS TO CONSTRUCT STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS ON
COMPARTMENT B AND C OF THE EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA,
FLORIDA
The USACE completed an EIS in January 2009 for the construction of three additional STAs in
the EAA. Two of the three additional STAs include the Compartment B North Build-out and
Compartment B South Build-out, which expanded STA 2. The third additional STA is
Compartment C, which is located west of the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area in Hendry
County and is part of the STA 5/6 complex. Because the proposed Shallow FEB is intended to
assist STA 2, the Compartment B and C EIS was used as a source of reference material since
Compartment B expanded the treatment capacity of STA 2. Information in the Compartment B
and C EIS was used to help develop background information, to update information needed to
describe the affected environment, and to support the technical information used to evaluate
the environmental effects.

1.8.3 SOUTH FLORIDA ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT
The South Florida Environmental Report (SFER) is an annual document that consolidates the
scientific and engineering efforts made by various agencies throughout south Florida related to
Everglades Restoration. As a requirement of the 1994 EFA, the SFWMD, in cooperation with
the FDEP, compiles various agencies’ reports into a single document to summarize and update
the accomplishments on South Florida’s environmental restoration and other key activities.
The final SFER of 2012 and draft report of 2013 were used to provide information in the EIS on
the existing STAs and water quality data.

1.8.4 FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL EIS FOR THE LAKE OKEECHOBEE REGULATION
SCHEDULE 2008
The Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule (LORS) 2008 is included in the modeling
assumptions for the proposed project. LORS 2008 is an operating schedule for Lake
Okeechobee that balances competing water use objectives including flood control, water
supply, navigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources. LORS lessened some of the
impacts to the environment from the previous regulation schedule (referred to as Water Supply
and Environment) by operating the lake at a lower level, and accommodated for the Herbert
Hoover Dike structural limitations. A final Supplemental EIS was completed in November 2007
and a ROD was signed in April 2008.

ecosystem in WCA 3A and 3B, which supported the existing site conditions for fish and wildlife
habitats, wildlife usage, water flows, water quality, water management, and hydrology.

1.8.8 USEPA AMENDED DETERMINATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF
FLORIDA'S EVERGLADES WATER QUALITY PLAN
On September 3, 2010, the USEPA issued its Amended Determination in order to ensure that
the water entering the EPA from the EAA and C-139 Basin meets the pertinent water quality
standards in the shortest time possible. On June 13, 2012 USEPA issued a memorandum
entitled, “!ssessment of the State of Florida’s Everglades Water Quality Plan;” This
memorandum documents the history and evolution of the efforts by USEPA, FDEP, and SFWMD
since the issuance of the Amended Determination to define the pertinent water quality
standards and the means for achieving them. These documents are discussed in further detail
in section 1.3.1.1.

2.0 ALTERNATIVES
This chapter outlines the process used to determine the range of reasonable alternatives to the
proposed action and presents each alternative to be considered. Several alternatives to the
!pplicant’s proposal were evaluated for their ability to meet the overall project purpose as
presented in Chapter 1, including the feasibility, timeliness, and responsiveness to the issues
and concerns identified during public scoping. This evaluation process concluded with a range
of reasonable project alternatives, including:
• !lternative 1: No Action
• !lternative 2: Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (!pplicant’s Proposed !ction)
• !lternative 3: Deep Flow Equalization Basin
• !lternative 4: Stormwater Treatment Area

2.1

REGULATORY SETTING FOR ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

oth the ouncil of Environmental Quality’s (EQ) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
Implementation Procedures [40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §1502.14] and the United
States !rmy orps of Engineers’ (USACE) NEPA Implementation Procedures (33 CFR Part 325,
Appendix B) require consideration of a range of reasonable alternatives for a proposed action.
Defining a range of reasonable alternatives is a key element for subsequent analyses in an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The CEQ (1981) describes the alternatives as being the
“heart of the environmental impact statement,” and alternatives that are considered
reasonable under NEP! include those alternatives “that are practical or feasible from a
technical and economic standpoint and using common sense.” The US!E’s NEP!
Implementation Procedures define reasonable alternatives as “those that are feasible, and such
feasibility must focus on the accomplishment of the underlying purpose and need (of the
applicant or the public) that would be satisfied by the proposed Federal action (permit
issuance).” The US!E‘s regulations further provide that only reasonable alternatives need to
be considered in detail and that the reason for eliminating alternatives from detailed study
should briefly be discussed in the EIS [33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B, sec. 9.a. (5) (a)]. NEPA
regulations require that agencies consider a range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed
action, including consideration of a “No !ction” alternative- the regulations do not, however,
require consideration of every conceivable variation of an alternative (40 CFR §1502.14). In
addition, these regulations provide that, while the USACE shall not prepare a cost benefit
analysis of the alternatives, the EIS should indicate any cost considerations that are likely to be
relevant to a decision [33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B, sec. 9.a.(5)(d)].

Chapter 2

Alternatives

The substantive criteria used by the USACE to evaluate a permit are the Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230) promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA). The guidelines require the evaluation of “practicable alternatives,” and are
used to identify the Least Environmentally Practicable !lternative (LEDP!) to ensure that “no
discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the
proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as
the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.” The
guidelines define an alternative as practicable “if it is available and capable of being done after
taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project
purposes” (40 FR §230.10 [a][2]). The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines indicate that the analysis
of alternatives for NEPA environmental documents will in most cases provide the information
required to evaluate the alternatives under the guidelines (40 CFR §230.10 [a][4]).
The USACE and cooperating agencies evaluated and screened the alternatives mindful of both
the NEPA requirements and the 404(b)(1) Guideline requirements. As a result, the alternatives
analysis in this EIS also satisfies the requirement under both NEPA and the Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines. Additional analysis required to comply with the Guidelines is included in Appendix
A. As described below, the USACE and cooperating agencies examined the full scope of possible
alternatives and components and systematically arrived at the range of reasonable and
practicable alternatives. Through this process, the USACE believes that it has captured all of the
alternatives and components necessary to determine whether the !pplicant’s proposed project
is the LEDPA.

2.2

PRELIMINARY SCREENING OF ALTERNATIVES

The USACE implemented a structured process to develop and screen alternatives for the A-1
Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB) project, with a goal to consider the broadest range of
possible alternatives and identify the range of reasonable and practicable alternatives that
would advance for comparative analysis. The intent of an iterative process is to eliminate
impracticable and unreasonable alternatives as early in the process as practical to allow the
USACE and the cooperating agencies to focus detailed evaluation on practicable and reasonable
alternatives. For some proposals there may exist a very large or even an infinite number of
reasonable alternatives if the proposed alternatives could vary from one another due to an
infinite number of incremental changes (e.g., various water depths). Nevertheless, only a range
of reasonable and practicable alternatives need be considered. The USACE and cooperating
agencies worked together to consider the development and screening process. Although the
USACE sought the consensus of the cooperating agencies in determining reasonable and
practicable alternatives that would meet the water quality goals of the project, this analysis is
independent of USEP!’s prior analysis in the 2010 !D, and therefore, a ST! alternative was not

initially identified as an alternative.
The initial step in the process was identification of possible alternative concepts for achieving
the purpose and need of the project (see Chapter 1). Two alternatives that are always
examined in an EIS are the No !ction !lternative and the !pplicant’s Preferred Alternative.
Because the USACE had originally evaluated a range of alternatives and issued a permit for the
A-1 Reservoir on the project site, the USACE determined that the A-1 Reservoir was an
alternative to the proposed project. The A-1 Reservoir was included in the Notice of Intent to
draft an EIS published in the Federal Register prior to the Scoping meeting.
Alternative 1: No Action. As required by the CEQ, the EIS must consider as an
alternative the possibility of not permitting the project. For this alternative, the activities
that are considered would only be those that would not require a Department of the
Army (DA) permit to discharge fill into waters of the United States (US) [33 CFR Part
325, Appendix B, Paragraph 9.b.5(b)].
Alternative 2: Shallow FEB (!pplicant’s Proposed !ction). The Applicant is proposing to
construct a shallow (approximate depth of four feet) FEB on the A-1 Project Site. The
Shallow FEB is proposed to improve delivery rates to Stormwater Treatment Area (STA)
2 and STA 3/4 by attenuating and temporarily storing peak stormwater flows to assist in
maintaining optimal water levels and minimizing the frequency of dryouts within STA 2
and STA 3/4. This alternative is described in greater detail in Section 2.4.2 below.
Alternative 3: Deep FEB. A deep reservoir, known as the A-1 Reservoir, was previously
the subject of NEPA and Section 404 permit review for this site; therefore, the USACE
determined that the construction of a deep FEB similar to the previously authorized A-1
Reservoir is a reasonable alternative to the construction of a shallow FEB for
consideration. A deep reservoir was also was the subject of a detailed review by the
USEP! as referenced in USEP!’s 2010 Amended Determination (AD). The construction
of the deep reservoir, or deep FEB, may also provide for flow attenuation, and the flow
attenuation could provide water quality benefits to the STAs. Therefore, a Reservoir
was considered as a reasonable alternative to the applicant’s proposed project. This
alternative is described in greater detail in Section 2.4.3 below.
During public scoping meeting, it was suggested that a deep Reservoir and the restoration of a
pond apple slough south of Lake Okeechobee (offsite of the A-1 project site) should be
considered as alternatives. During the public scoping comment period, the USEPA commented
that a STA alternative was also included in the 2010 AD and should be incorporated into the

US!E’s alternatives analysis. The scoping comments are documented in Chapter 7. At the
conclusion of the scoping period, the USACE and the cooperating agencies considered the goals
of the project to generate other potential project alternatives that were not previously
considered to be evaluated along with the alternatives listed above. Additional alternatives
evaluated at this point included:


A Deep Reservoir - This alternative had already been identified and carried
forward as Alternative 3, which was initially identified as the A-1 Reservoir. A
reservoir has similar characteristics of a Deep FEB. However, as previously
described, the previously permitted A-1 Reservoir has a different project
purpose than would be served by the proposed project. To avoid confusion with
the name and purpose of the previous A-1 Reservoir project, this alternative,
which will be carried forward for further evaluatation, has been renamed as a
Deep FEB (approximate depth of 12.5 feet).



Utilizing other treatment technologies to treat and remove phosphorus from the
Central Flowpath



Utilizing other lands not currently owned by the Applicant as possible off-site
Alternatives



The restoration of a pond apple slough south of Lake Okeechobee



Construction of a Stormwater Treatment Area on the Project Site. The
construction of a STA also was the subject of a detailed review by the USEPA in
the 2010 AD.

These alternatives were then assessed based on their practicability, which is assessed based on
their ability to meet the USACE overall project purpose. The USACE coordinated with the
cooperating agencies and the applicant to obtain additional details about the !pplicant’s
proposed project as well as the other alternatives. Based on the review, the following
alternatives were not considered practicable alternatives and were, therefore, eliminated from
further analysis:


Utilizing other treatment technologies to treat and remove phosphorus from the
Central Flowpath. Various alternative treatment technologies, such as the
Hybrid Wetland Treatment Technology pilot project and the Northern Everglades
Chemical Treatment pilot project, are currently being conducted in the Northern
Everglades watershed. The pilot projects are in various stages of testing.
Similarly, other treatment technologies are unavailable to practicably meet the
overall project purpose.



Utilizing other lands not currently owned by the Applicant as possible offsite

Chapter 2

Alternatives

Alternatives. The USACE evaluated the practicability of utilizing properties not
currently owned by the Applicant for offsite alternatives to be carried forward
for further analysis. Given the project purpose, an alternative project site would
need to work in association with and be in close proximity to STA 2 and 3/4 to
meet the WQBEL at the STA discharge points. The A-1 project site is ideally
located adjacent to both STA 3/4 and STA 2, allowing it to provide benefits to
both STAs. Noting that the A1 project site was contiguous to STA 2 and STA 3/4,
USEPA stated in the 2010 AD that the A1 site was “strategically located for an
expansion of the current STAs” and did not provide the SFWMD any scheduled
time to aquire additional lands within the Central Flowpath.
Any project developed on another site must be acquired by the State, which
requires time for land acquisition. In USEP!’s 2010 AD, USEPA found acquisition
times “were highly variable and has ranged from two to eight years.” The US!E
conducted a survey of eleven of the !pplicant’s restoration land acquisition
experiences spanning between 1991 to 2009 and found that land acquisition has
taken as little as three years and as long as 17 years to complete, with an
average of 6-7 years. Acquisition time depends upon the number of willing
sellers and increases due to the number of involved landowners. Other lands
adjacent to STA 2 and STA 3/4 not owned by the Applicant are agricultural lands
located north of STA 2, which are privately owned and utilized by three entities:
Okeelanta Corporation, New Hope Sugar, and King Realty Company. None of
these companies are known willing sellers. Due to the land acquisition time
frames (up to 17 years) and the subsequent time for site development and
construction, the USACE determined that utilizing lands not currently owned by
the applicant would be an alternative that is not available to the applicant and is
impracticable.


The restoration of a pond apple slough south of Lake Okeechobee (offsite
alternative). Although a pond apple slough restoration project could provide
environmental benefits, there is no evidence that it would ensure achievement
of the Water Quality Based Effluent Limits (WQBEL) at the STA discharge points.
Therefore, this alternative does not satisfy the project purpose. Additionally, this
alternative would be contingent upon the purchase of land currently unavailable
to the applicant, which the USACE has determined is impracticable.

The alternative that was not eliminated during the practicability analysis (the construction of an
STA on the project site) was advanced to the next step of the alternatives development process.

Alternatives

The US!E’s independent alternatives development and USEP!’s alternatives analysis results in
the same suite of alternatives: a shallow FEB, a deep FEB, and a STA.
Alternative 4: A Stormwater Treatment Area. The construction of a STA may also
ensure that the WQBEL is met at the discharge points of STA 2 and STA 3/4, and
therefore an STA on the A1 project site is considered a practicable alternative to the
applicant’s proposed project. The USEPA had fully evaluated the STA alternative, found
that it would attain the WQBEL at the discharge points for STA 2 and STA 3/4, and
recommended this option during the development of the 2010 AD.

2.3

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA AND A FLOW
EQUALIZATION BASIN

2.3.1 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA
STAs are large-scale freshwater wetlands constructed to remove phosphorus from urban and
agricultural runoff prior to discharge to the Everglades. Phosphorus is removed from the water
column through physical, chemical, and biological processes such as sedimentation,
precipitation, plant growth, microbial activity and the accumulation of dead plant material that
is converted to a layer of soil. A typical STA has multiple cells that are divided into several
parallel treatment paths or flow ways. Water flows through these systems via water control
structures, such as pump stations, gates, or culverts. The plant communities in STAs are broadly
classified as emergent aquatic vegetation (EAV) or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV).
Interspersed among this vegetation, where conditions are favorable, are floating aquatic
vegetation and periphyton communities. In contrast to conventional chemical treatment
technologies which are designed to allow real time active control of treatment processes to
provide technically reliable performance, STAs are, biological systems which are more complex
and reliant on multiple factors that are less controllable and subject to natural perturbations.
STAs are highly managed and maintained wetlands and typically require intensive monitoring
networks to enable continuous evaluation of vegetation conditions and treatment
performance. Proactive management of both desirable and undesirable vegetation within STAs
is critical to achieving and sustaining treatment performance. In addition, STA dryout is a major
concern due to potential spikes in phosphorus concentrations that can occur upon rehydration.
Therefore, strategies to manage STAs during dry conditions include proactive measures to
maintain minimum water levels in an effort to reduce vegetation stress and maintain treatment
performance. Additional STA acreage increases the risk of STA dryout (and potential
performance reduction) and requires additional water to maintain minimum STA water levels,
often at times when regional water supplies are limited and demands are high.

Alternatives

2.3.2 FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
FEBs are impoundments constructed to temporarily detain excess surface water flows prior to
release into STAs. The FEBs are not intended to treat the water, but to store it during high
water events until the optimal time when STA needs additional water. The FEBs would then
pump water into the STAs at an ideal rate once the peak runoff flows have subsided in the
canals. The FEB would achieve normal full stage level only during peak runoff conditions and is
not intended to store water for any extended length of time after pumping operations cease.
However, during the rainy season and extreme wet years, the FEB site could experience staged
water levels for significant durations. The vegetation within the FEB is expected to be
herbaceous wetland plants that are likely to aid in the removal of additional phosphorus.

2.4

DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVES

As well as providing the full range of reasonable alternatives for NEPA, the four alternatives also
establish the range of practicable alternatives that will be evaluated to determine the LEDPA
per USACE guidance related to Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act (40 CFR Part 230). The
following sections provide detailed information on the four reasonable alternatives.

2.4.1 ALTERNATIVE 1: NO ACTION
NEPA regulations require consideration of the No Action Alternative, which can be used as a
benchmark for comparison of the environmental effects of the various alternatives. The No
Action Alternative would result from the USACE not issuing a DA permit for fill in waters of the
US regulated by the USACE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Without a DA permit, no
additional fill could be discharged into waters of the US.

2.4.2 ALTERNATIVE 2: SHALLOW FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN (SOUTH FLORIDA
WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT’S PREFERRED !LTERN!TIVE)
Alternative 2 is a 15,000-acre shallow FEB with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4
feet, and is South Florida Water Management District’s (SFWMD) Preferred Alternative. In the
2010 AD, the USEPA proposed that a the A-1 project site be utilized as an STA to maximize
phosphorus uptake. After issuance of the 2010 AD, the SFWMD updated and revised some of
the hydrologic modeling upon which the USEPA had relied in developing the projects for the
2010 AD utilizing new data, information, and options that were unavailable at the time of the
2010 AD. In 2012, the SFWMD proposed that a Shallow FEB in place of the STA design would
better manage and meter water flow and phosphorus load discharged into STA 2 and STA 3/4.
After extensive technical discussions with the SFWMD and FDEP and thorough evaluation, the
USEPA concluded that the modified plan was based on an appropriate set of assumptions and
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

Alternatives

could reasonably be expected to achieve the WQBEL (USEPA 2012). Both alternatives (a Shallow
FEB and an STA) are being evaluated for this EIS. Construction of the Shallow FEB would result
in impacts to 537 acres of waters of the US to include 296.5 acres of fill to construct the levee
and 164.5 acres of fill to raise the elevation of canals and ditches, as well as the discharge of fill
material associated with canal excavation into 75.8 acres of waters fo the US. Over 10,500
acres of waters of the US would be inundated.
Alternative 2 would include the following components:









Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee heights for 4 feet
maximum operating depth)
Interior levees to convey inflows to the north end of the FEB (8.7+/- miles)
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA 3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

The site contains 1,200 foot wide areas that have been scraped down to the cap rock along the
perimeter of the site that would be incorporated as a flow path into the interior footprint of the
Shallow FEB. By utilizing the available scraped down area as a flow path, it has been
determined by the SFWMD, based on preliminary hydraulic analyses, that the existing pump
stations G-370 and G-372 currently have the capability to deliver flows to the north end of the
FEB.
Inflows will be conveyed to the Shallow FEB via two proposed operable water control structures
by the existing STA 3/4 inflow pump stations G-370 and G-372. The Shallow FEB will receive
runoff from the Miami Canal via existing pump station G-372, and from the North New River
Canal via existing pump station G-370. After inflows are conveyed to the north end of the
Shallow FEB, the water will be spread utilizing the northern scraped area to enable sheet flow
from north to south. An internal collection canal will be constructed to assist in conveying
water out of the Shallow FEB. Outflows will be conveyed by operable water control structures
to the North New River Canal. Operable water control structures may also be constructed to
allow discharges to be conveyed via gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. The perimeter
seepage canals constructed during the EAA A-1 Reservoir project will likely be improved to
protect adjacent properties, including US Highway 27. The majority of the Shallow FEB outflows
(approximately 80%) will be will be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining flows

(approximately 20%) will be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B) via the G-434 and G435 pump stations.

2.4.3 ALTERNATIVE 3: DEEP FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
Alternative 3 is a 15,000-acre deep Flow Equalization Basin, with a maximum operating depth
of approximately 12.5 feet. A deep FEB can attenuate flows to the STAs to improve STA
performance. This differs from typical storage reservoirs, including the earlier design that was
the subject of the 2006 EIS that often have multiple objectives such as water supply for the
environment, urban, or agricultural uses. Similar to the Shallow FEB, construction of the Deep
FEB would result in impacts to 626 acres of waters of the US to include 550 acres of fill to
construct the levee and the discharge of fill material associated with canal excavation into 75.8
acres of waters fo the US. Over 10,500 acres of waters of the US would be inundated.
Alternative 3 was assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:










Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 20-30 feet levee heights for a maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet)
Inflow Pump Station to direct North New River Canal flows into the FEB to the maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
A cutoff wall to minimize or eliminate seepage impacts to adjacent areas
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA 3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

Based on hydraulic analyses, the existing pump stations G-370 and G-372 currently do not have
the capability to deliver flows to the Deep FEB up to the maximum operating depth of 12.5 feet.
Therefore, a new inflow pump station located at the northeast corner of the Deep FEB would
be required to deliver flows to the Deep FEB up to the maximum operating depth of 12.5 feet.
Inflows will be conveyed to the Deep FEB via two proposed operable water control structures
by the existing STA 3/4 inflow pump stations G-370 and G-372 and a new inflow pump station.
The Deep FEB will receive stormwater runoff from the Miami Canal via existing pump station G372, and from the North New River Canal via existing pump station G-370 and the new inflow
pump station.
An internal collection canal may be constructed to assist in conveying water out of the Deep
FEB. Outflows will be conveyed by operable water control structures to the North New River

Canal. Operable water control structures may also be constructed to allow FEB discharges to be
conveyed via gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. A new cutoff wall and the perimeter
seepage canals constructed during the EAA A-1 Reservoir project will likely be improved to
protect adjacent properties, including US Highway 27. The majority of the Deep FEB outflows
(approximately 60%) will be will be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining flows
(approximately 40%) will be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B) via the G-434 and G435 pump stations.

2.4.4 ALTERNATIVE 4: STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA
Alternative 4 is a 15,000-acre STA, with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4 feet. As
previously mentioned, the USEP!’s !D proposed that a the !1 Site be utilized as an ST! to
maximize phosphorus uptake in association with STA 2 and STA3/4. After issuance of the 2010
AD, the SFWMD updated and revised some of the hydrologic modeling and proposed the
Shallow FEB in place of the STA design. After extensive technical discussions with the SFWMD
and FDEP and thorough evaluation, the USEPA concluded that the plan was based on an
appropriate set of assumptions and could be reasonably be expected to achieve the WQBEL.
Both alternatives are being evaluated for this EIS. The proposed STA would have a normal
operating depth of approximately 1.25 – 1.5 feet and a maximum operating depth of
approximately 4 feet. The proposed A-1 STA would operate in parallel with STA 2 and STA 3/4.
Construction of the A-1 STA would result in impacts to 1,055 acres of waters of the US to
include 370 acres of fill to construct the levee, 164.5 acres of fill to raise the elevation of canals
and ditches, 270 acres of canal excavation, and 250 acres of excavation and fill within Holey
Land Wildlife Management Area (Holey Land). Wetland impacts within the Holey Land are
required to construct a new discharge canal to allow treated discharges from the A-1 STA to be
conveyed to the L-5 Canal. The new discharge canal would be proposed west of STA 3/4 Cells
3A and 3B while the existing STA 3/4 discharge canal south of STA 3/4 Cell 3B would be
expanded. Within the proposed A-1 STA, over 10,500 acres of waters of the US would be
inundated.
Alternative 4 was assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:








Perimeter Levees around the STA (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee height for 4 feet maximum
operating depth)
Interior levees dividing the STA into cells
Inflow canals to direct inflows from the North New River and Miami Canals to the STA
Discharge canal to direct outflows from the STA to the L-5 Canal
Internal distribution canals to facilitate sheetflow through the cells
Internal collection canals to assist in conveying water out of the cells

Alternatives

Operable water control structures to control water levels and flows into and out of all
STA cells

For this EIS, the A-1 STA represented in Alternative 4 was assumed to utilize the existing STA
3/4 inflow pump stations (G-370 and G-372) to convey stormwater runoff to the proposed A-1
STA. Inflows are then assumed to be conveyed via inflow canals to the north end of the project
site. Flows would then be distributed to the A-1 STA cells via water control structures and
conveyed north-to-south and collected in internal collection canals. In order to operate the A-1
STA, construction of conveyance features in addition to construction of the A-1 STA itself will be
required. Specifically, a discharge canal would need to be constructed within the Holey Land to
connect the A-1 STA discharge canal to the L-5 Canal. This would enable the delivery of
discharges from the proposed A-1 STA to Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A and/or WCA 3A
via existing infrastructure, without interfering with the existing operations of STA 2, STA 3/4
and the North New River and Miami Canals.

2.5

COMPONENTS COMMON TO ALL ACTION ALTERNATIVES

The following components of the Central Flowpath, including STA 2 (including Compartment B)
and STA 3/4, WCA 2A and WCA 3A are common to all of the alternatives although the timing
and volumes of inflow and outflow to the components would vary by alternative.

2.5.1 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA 2
STA 2 is a 16,000-acre constructed wetland marsh system which was designed to reduce
phosphorus concentrations in surface water. The facility is located within southern Palm Beach
County and is immediately adjacent to the western boundary of WCA 2A. STA 2 consists of
Flow-way 1 (Cell 1), Flow-way 2 (Cell 2), Flow-way 3 (Cell 3), Flow-way 4 (Cells 4, 5 and 6), and
Flow-way 5 (Cells 7 and 8) (Figure 2-1). STA 2 currently receives runoff from the S-2, S-5A, S-6
and S-7 Basins, East Shore Water Control District and 715 Farms (also known as Closter Farms).
Runoff collected by the North New River Canal is pumped into STA 2 via the G-434 and G-435
pump stations. Runoff collected via the Hillsboro Canal is pumped into STA 2 via the S-6 pump
station. In addition, stormwater runoff from agricultural lands adjacent to STA 2 is pumped into
STA 2 via the G-328 pump station. Treated discharges from STA 2 are pumped into the L-6
Canal, and then conveyed to either northern WCA 2A through a set of box culverts or to
western WCA 2A through a section of degraded L-6 Canal levee.

2.5.2 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA 3/4
STA 3/4 is a 16,000-acre constructed wetland marsh system which was designed to reduce
phosphorus concentrations in surface water. The facility is located in southern Palm Beach
County between STA 2 and the Holey Land. STA 3/4 consists of the Eastern Flow-way (Cells 1A
and 1B), the Central Flow-way (Cells 2A and 2B), the Western Flow-way (Cells 3A and 3B), and
the Periphyton-based STA Implementation Project. STA 3/4 currently receives agricultural
and/or urban runoff from the S-2, S-3, S-7, S-8, and C-139 Basins, the South Shore Drainage
District and the South Florida Conservancy District. Runoff collected by the North New River
Canal is pumped into STA 3/4 via the G-370 pump station. Water collected via the Miami Canal
is pumped into STA 3/4 via the G-372 pump station. Treated discharges from STA 3/4 are
conveyed to the STA 3/4 Discharge Canal and L-5 Canal, and then conveyed to either western
WCA 2A via the S-7 pump station, to eastern WCA 3A via S-150, or western WCA 3A via the S-8

2.5.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS 2A AND 3A
WCA 2A operates under the current Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project regulation
schedule. Operations of WCA 2A also include regulatory releases to the Atlantic Ocean through
the Lower East Coast canals, as documented in the C&SF Project Water Control Plan for Lake
Okeechobee and Everglades Agricultural Area (Water Control Plan), (USACE, June 2008). In
addition, no net outflows from WCA 2A to maintain minimum stages in the Lower East Coast
Service Area canals (salinity control) are assumed, if water levels in WCA 2A are less than the
minimum operating criteria of 10.5 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29).
Any water supply releases below the minimum operating criteria are matched by an equivalent
volume of inflow, typically from Lake Okeechobee.
WCA 3A operates under the current Everglades Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP) regulation
schedule. As discussed in Chapter 1, ERTP is the water management operating criteria for
Central and Southern Florida Project features and the constructed features of the Modified
Water Deliveries and Canal-111, which was recently adopted. Since this new operating regime

went into effect in October 2012, the ERTP regulation schedule for WCA 3A, as per South
Florida Water Management Model alternative 9E1, was assumed for this EIS. Operations of
WCA 3A also include regulatory releases to the Atlantic Ocean through the Lower East Coast
Canals, as documented in the Water Control Plan (USACE, June 2008). In addition, no net
outflows from WCA 3A to maintain minimum stages in the Lower East Coast Service Area canals
(salinity control) are assumed, if water levels in WCA 3A are less than the minimum operating
criteria of 7.5 feet NGVD29. Any water supply releases below the minimum operating criteria
are matched by an equivalent volume of inflow, typically from Lake Okeechobee.

3.0 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
This chapter provides a description of the physical, biological, chemical, and human
environments that could be affected by alternatives evaluated. The existing conditions are
presented in either a regional- or area-specific context depending on the nature of the resource
or the anticipated effect to that resource.

3.1

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Lake Okeechobee, located north of the project area, is an approximately 730-square-mile
freshwater lake located north of the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) with an average depth
of roughly 9 feet (USACE 2007a). The depressional area, now occupied by Lake Okeechobee,
was formed approximately 6,000 years ago when the Okeechobean Sea receded (Lodge 2004).
The depressional area then filled with water during the following period of wetter conditions.
Historically, water flowed south from the lake to the Everglades through a series of small
tributaries at the southern portion of the lake. Once the headwaters of the Everglades, the
waters are now contained by the Herbert Hoover Dike and by an earthen levee around the
southern perimeter of the lake. Discharges, water levels, and flows are highly managed through
a series of water control structures and canals including the structures that discharge water to
the EAA.
The EAA is located south of Lake Okeechobee primarily in western Palm Beach County (Figure
3-1), extending south to Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3A. It is bounded on the east by the
Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, which is WCA-1 (herein referred to as
the Refuge), WCA 2A, the Western C-51 Basin, the L-8 Basin, and on the west by the C-139
Basin. Historically, the EAA was pond apple swamp forest on the southern shore of Lake
Okeechobee and an extensive sawgrass wetland, which have been drained and put into
agriculture production. The former wetlands produced the rich organic peat and muck soils that
today make it a highly productive agricultural area. As of September 30, 2011, there were
474,622 acres of land under active agricultural production in thirty-two (32) South Florida
Water Management District (SFWMD) permits in the EAA (Office of Agricultural Water Policy
2011). The agricultural area designation was formally established in the 1950s and associated
water management infrastructure was substantially completed in 1962 (USACE and SFWMD
2004). As of 2004, sugar cane was reported to be the area’s dominant crop with approximately
898 square miles (575,000 acres) of active sugar cane fields; this harvest provides 50 percent of
the sugar produced nationally (USACE and SFWMD 2004).

Affected Environment

Runoff from the EAA, which contains relatively high levels of nutrients (mainly phosphorus and
nitrogen from particulate matter and fertilizers), drains from the agricultural canals to the
secondary canals, then into the six main primary canals, and are eventually discharged into the
Everglades Protection Area (EPA) or to tide. In addition to flood protection, the canals and
water control structures convey regulatory and/or water supply releases from Lake
Okeechobee to the EAA, the WCAs, and the Everglades National Park (ENP). The canals also
provide for municipal water supply to eastern Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties
(Cooper 1989).

Affected Environment

The physical, biological, chemical, and human environments of those areas that may be
affected include land use; geology, topography, and soils; hydrology to include surface water
and ground water hydrology; water quality; climate; vegetation and cover types; threatened
and endangered species; fish and wildlife species; aesthetics; cultural, historic and
archaeological resources; socioeconomics; environmental justice; recreation; hazardous and
toxic wastes; and flood protection. The spatial extent of the effect for each components
described in this chapter varies based on the geographic extent of effects on the environment
being described and will be addressed by topic.
Areas not considered as part of the affected environment include Lake Okeechobee, C-139
Basin, and the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area since the No Action Alternatives and the
Action Alternatives would have no effect on these areas.

3.3

LAND USE

The general pattern of land use within the region of South Florida consists of an expanding zone
of urban development within the coastal strip adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean; a large area
dominated by intensive agricultural use east, south, and west of Lake Okeechobee; and a band
of largely undeveloped land within the EPA. The following discussion addresses existing land
use patterns within the project site, the STAs and other areas including the WCAs and the Holey
Land.

3.3.1 PROJECT SITE
SFWMD acquired title to approximately 50,000 acres of land in March 1999 pursuant to Grant
Agreement FB-4 with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)/Department of the
Interior (DOI). The approximately 50,000 acres of land acquisition included the 16,000-acre A-1
project site. The SFWMD has managed the A-1 property under agricultural leases prior to the
land being utilized for a restoration project. A project to construct a reservoir on the A-1
project site was included in the Comprehensive Environmental Restoration Plan (CERP) as it was
designed to improve the quantity, quality, timing and delivery of water in the Everglades. The
reservoir would have provided water storage in order to improve timing of water deliveries
from the EAA to the WCAs, reduce Lake Okeechobee regulatory releases to the estuaries, meet
supplemental agricultural irrigation demands, and increase flood protection within the EAA. In
2006, SFWMD was given Department of the Army (DA) authorization to construct the reservoir
on the A-1 project site. USFWS/DOI provided approval for the interim land use change for
construction of the reservoir.

3.3.2 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS
STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4 were constructed and are being operated to
provide water quality improvement in discharges to the EPA. Physical features within the
existing STAs include the constructed wetlands and the associated water management
infrastructure (such as levees, canals, and water control structures). Land cover within the STAs
is primarily a mixture of open water, emergent, and submergent marshes. Land use for these
areas can be classified as public/institutional or conservation. To varying degrees, the STAs also
support ancillary recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing.

3.3.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS AND HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE
MANAGEMENT AREA
Within the Central Flowpath, WCAs 2 and 3 abut the southern boundaries of the EAA (Figure 32). WCAs 2A and 3A were designated primarily to receive flood waters from adjacent areas and
store the waters for beneficial municipal, urban, and agricultural uses; however, they are
currently managed for multiple uses including flood protection, water supply storage, and
environmental resource protection. The Holey Land is another parcel of land that was also
managed for flood protection, water supply storage, and environmental resource protection.
However, since 2008, no inflow or outflows have occurred in the Holey Land and the area is
currently managed for environmental resource purposes. The Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FWCC) currently manages the fish and wildlife in the WCAs and the
Holey Land.

3.4

GEOLOGY, TOPOGRAPHY, AND SOILS

3.4.1 GEOLOGY
At the project site, the upper carbonate sand and limestone constitutes the Fort Thompson
Formation. Below this, shelly sand and sparse limestone constitutes the Caloosahatchee
Formation and possibly part of the Tamiami Formation. The top of the Fort Thompson
Formation consists of a hard limestone layer about four and a half to five feet thick, which is
locally called caprock. The caprock is generally white, light gray, tan or yellowish brown. The
caprock is underlain by silty carbonate sand extending to about 23.5 to 24.5 feet deep, where
another hard limestone layer one and a half feet to three feet thick is encountered. A thinner,
hard limestone layer about one half foot to one foot thick is often encountered at around 16 to
17 feet deep. The sand and lower limestone layers are generally white to very pale brown.
Laboratory testing of the sand sampled in the borings averaged 84.2 percent calcium carbonate
content with an average of 22 percent passing the #200 sieve in gradation tests. Visual

inspection of the sand samples from the borings revealed that they include shell fragments, and
tend to be angular and platy (USACE 2006).
All the Fort Thompson Formation limestone layers exposed in core or in excavations at the
project site are very fossiliferous. The sand exposed in the seepage collection canals and
dewatering sumps was abundantly fossiliferous with gastropods, pelecypods, corals, and
echinoderms.
Portions of the project site and surrounding areas also contain the Caloosahatchee Formation.
The top of the Caloosahatchee Formation is composed of fine grained, subrounded, shelly
quartz sand that is mixed with shelly carbonate sand similar to that in the Fort Thompson
Formation. The Caloosahatchee Formation at the site is 30 to 60 feet thick; however, the
interface between this formation and the underlying Tamiami Formation is difficult to define.
The proportions of carbonate to quartz sand vary. Laboratory testing on the sampled sand
indicated an average calcium carbonate content of 40.1 percent and an average of 12.1 percent
of material passing through the #200 sieve. The primary color of the geologic material in the
Caloosahatchee Formation is light greenish gray (USACE 2006).
Other geologic information may indicate that the Caloosahatchee Formation is not present at
the project site. For instance, geological work (Reese and Cunningham, 2000) has redefined the
stratigraphy of the area. Presently, the Tamiami Formation has several recognized named and
unnamed geologic members including the Ochopee Limestone Member and the Pinecrest Sand
Member. Both Tamiami Formation members contain sandy strata, but the Pinecrest Sand
Member is principally shelly, fine grained, quartz sand. Therefore, interpretation of the contact
between the Caloosahatchee Formation and Tamiami Formation at the project site is not
possible (USACE 2006).

3.4.2 TOPOGRAPHY
The Central Flowpath consists of agricultural lands in the EAA, the project site, STAs 2 and 3/4,
and the Holey Land, while WCA 2A and WCA 3A are located south of the Central Flowpath. The
topography within the Central Flowpath and the WCAs 2A and 3A is relatively flat. The EAA
contains elevations generally less than 18.6 feet North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988,
and the ground surface generally slopes from north to south with an average gradient of 0.15
foot per mile.
With the exception of work performed at the site under the permit for the previous A-1
Reservoir Project, the majority of elevations of the unfilled and unexcavated areas at the site
range from 7 to 9 feet NAVD 1988 (SFWMD recordings, 2012). A seepage canal was constructed

just within the east and west borders of the project site, with elevated areas inside the canal
where the associated fill was placed. In addition, a remnant mining area in the northeast
portion of the project site has elevations less than 5 feet NAVD 1988, and an adjacent stockpile
area with elevations up to 15 feet NAVD 1988. The elevations of areas surrounding the project
site generally range from 6 to 11 feet NAVD 1988 (SFWMD recordings, 2012). See Figure 3-3
for site elevations.
Figure 3.3 A-1 Project Site Existing Topography

3.4.3 SOILS
According to the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Survey of 1988, 96 percent of the
EAA is composed of the following series of soils: Torry muck (7%), Terra Ceia muck (9%),
Pahokee muck (27%), Lauderhill muck (40%), Dania muck (10%), and Okeechobee muck (3%).
The remaining 4 percent of the EAA is composed of sands (Okeelanta muck) (Bottcher and
Izuno. Historically, the EAA was part of the largest region of organic soils, commonly 14 feet
thick or more. Through the years of draining and agricultural production, these soils have been
significantly reduced or in some areas even lost completely (Lodge 2004). Recent studies have

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

been conducted on the subsidence of soils in the EAA, and it is projected that by 2050 nearly
half of the EAA will have less than 8 inches of soil, which means the soil elevation on average is
decreasing 0.6 inches a year (Snyder 2004).
The A-1 project site contains Pahokee muck (primarily in the southern portion of the site) and
Lauderhill muck (primarily in the northern portion of the site). Numerous soil borings, taken
from 50 to 100 feet below ground surface, were completed within the project site in December
2004 and January 2005. The borings generally penetrated through approximately one half to
two feet of surficial peat/muck and marl, then through 22 to 26 feet of primarily carbonate
sand and limestone, and then into primarily shelly quartz sand with sparse limestone to their
completed depths. The marl beneath the peat and muck is known by some authors as the Lake
Flirt Marl (Reese and Cunningham, 2000; Harvey et. al., 2002), but is undifferentiated from the
peat and muck layer for this EIS.
South of the EAA, the WCAs and Holey Land primarily consists of muck and peat type soils, with
the underlying substrate classified as marl and/or limestone. Other soils in these areas that
have poor natural drainage (predominantly alfisols and entisols with histosols) include fine sand
and loamy material.

and Kalla, 2007)

HYDROLOGY

Water in the EAA is managed to provide flood protection, irrigation, and fresh water for the
EAA and surrounding environmentally sensitive areas through a series of canals, levees,
culverts, gates, and pumps (USACE and SFWMD 2004). Within the Central Flowpath, three
major canals pass through the EAA and receive flows from Lake Okeechobee and runoff from

the EAA: Hillsboro Canal, North New River Canal, and Miami Canal. Discharge from Lake
Okeechobee and runoff from the EAA, which contain relatively high levels of nutrients (mainly
phosphorus and nitrogen from particulate matter and fertilizers), drain from the agricultural
canals, to the secondary canals, into the primary canals. These three canals discharge to the
STAs through pump structures as detailed below.
STAs outflow into WCAs, which serve as surface water impoundments developed to provide
water supply, water storage, flood control, and wildlife conservation (SFWMD 2007a) and are
subjects of Everglades restoration activities. At times, when conditions do not allow for the
STAs to treat all runoff water prior to discharge, diversion to the WCAs may occur without
treatment. WCAs are Everglades wetlands surrounded by levees and typically include a rim
canal located on the inside of the levees next to the largely undisturbed peat soils and wetland
plant communities. The marsh vegetation, along with the east coast protection levee, prevents
floodwaters that historically flowed eastward from the Everglades from flowing into the
developed areas along the southeast coast of Florida (USACE 2011).

3.5.1 OVERALL WATER MANAGEMENT
Currently, water levels in Lake Okeechobee are managed by a regulation schedule by
transferring water through a complex system of pumps and locks. The Lake Okeechobee
regulation schedule attempts to achieve the multiple-use purposes as well as provide seasonal
lake level fluctuations. Flood control improvements around Lake Okeechobee consist of a
system of approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of encircling levees, designed to withstand a
severe combination of flood stage and hurricane occurrence.
The management of water from Lake Okeechobee to the EPA is through the network of canals
constructed as a result of the Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project; The &SF Project’s
intention was to provide water storage in the WCAs and to better control water levels in the
Everglades for multiple purposes. The construction of canals, levees, and roads has eliminated
the historical freshwater sheet flow and resulted in changes in the timing and quantity of flow
within the system that have influenced water quality conditions and impacted the downstream
EPA. On average, about 900,000 ac-ft of water is discharged from and through the EAA to the
south and southeast, historically mostly discharging into the EPA (Abtew and Khanal, 1994;
Abtew and Obeysekera, 1996). Four primary canals (Hillsboro Canal, North New River Canal,
Miami Canal, and West Palm Beach Canal) and three connecting canals (Bolles Canal, Cross
Canal, and Ocean Canal) facilitate runoff removal and irrigation water supply. Currently
runoff/drainage from the EAA is discharged to the STAs for treatment and released to the
WCAs.

Affected Environment

The WCAs are regulated for the Congressionally-authorized C&SF project purposes to provide
flood control; water supply for agricultural irrigation, municipalities and industry, and ENP;
regional groundwater control and prevention of saltwater intrusion; enhancement of fish and
wildlife; and recreation (USACE 2011). The WCAs are managed using the Everglades
Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP). ERTP superseded the 2006 Interim Operational Plan (IOP)
because the IOP was no longer a viable option for water management within WCA 3A based on
the status of endangered species within WCA 3A. The ERTP maximizes operational flexibilities
to provide further hydrological improvements consistent with protection of multiple listed
animal species, including the Everglades snail kite, wood stork and other wading birds and their
habitats in south Florida, while maintaining nesting season requirements for the Cape Sable
Seaside Sparrow, along with C&SF Project purposes. Water management operating criteria
outlined within ERTP is to be superseded once the features of the Modified Water Deliveries
(MWD) to the Everglades National Park project and the C-111 Project are available for water
management operations. Therefore, the ERTP serves as a transition plan between the previous
2006 IOP for Protection of the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow and a future operational plan.
Currently, the MWD Project elements are scheduled to be constructed by the end of 2013.
(USACE March 2011).

3.5.2 SURFACE WATER
3.5.2.1

Project Site

The surface water hydrology at the A-1 project site is currently rainfall driven. The site was
previously farmed as agricultural lands, but the agricultural activities have ceased. As a result
of the prior construction activities for the A-1 Reservoir, a seepage canal was constructed
within the north, east and west border of the project site. The canal was not completed. To
maintain flow, the levee at the south end of the A-1 project site was degraded to allow surface
runoff to enter the STA 3/4 seepage canal. Therefore, the surface waters currently flow from
the existing agricultural ditches to the STA 3/4 seepage canal.

3.5.2.2

Stormwater Treatment Area 2

The general management goal for STAs is to maintain shallow inundation in emergent aquatic
vegetation cells (EAV) for most of the year and to maintain shallow inundation of submerged
aquatic vegetation (SAV) cells throughout the year. Dry out and desiccation of submerged
aquatic vegetation and associated periphyton communities causes mortality and a significant
reduction in phosphorus removal performance.

Inflows. STA 2 currently receives water from the North New River Canal, which is pumped into
the STA via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations. Runoff collected via the Hillsboro Canal is

to STA 2 is pumped into STA 2 via the G-328 pump station.
Outflows. Treated discharges from STA 2 are pumped into the L-6 Canal via the G-335 and G­

WCA 3A via S-150, or western WCA 3A via the S-8 pump station. Pump station G-404 can also
be operated to convey treated STA 3/4 discharges to the northwest corner of WCA 3A and to
provide supplemental irrigation water supply to the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation (in
conjunction with pump station G-409). See Figure 3-7 for a simple schematic of STA 3/4.

3.5.2.4

Water Conservation Area 2A

Water within either the Hillsboro Canal or the North New River Canal enters into WCA 2A from
STA 2 and STA 3/4 primarily through pump stations S-7 (STA 3/4), G-335 (STA 2), and G-436
(STA 2). Pump stations deliver water from the canals to the WCAs. The S-7 pump station has an
adjacent gated spillway that can be opened to allow water supply deliveries from WCA 2A to
the EAA. Surface water inflows to WCA 2A also enter from the Refuge through the S-10A, S-10C,

and S-10D spillways located along the L-39 Levee. An interior levee across the southern portion
of WCA 2 subdivides WCA 2A from WCA 2B. The majority of the surface water flows from WCA
2A into WCA 3A primarily through the S-11 spillways; however, a portion is released via the S­
144, S-145 and S-146 structures to WCA-2B. When pool elevations in WCA 2B exceeds 11.0 feet
NGVD, water is discharged from WCA 2B to the North New River Canal via spillway structure S­
141.

3.5.2.5

Water Conservation Area 3A

WCA 3A receives water from Lake Okeechobee, WCA-2 and the EAA via the North New River
and Miami Canals with the majority of the inflows delivered from WCA 2A through the S-11
spillways. Another large source of water entering into WCA 3A is from STA 3/4 and STA-5, which
enter through the S-8 and G-404 pump stations, and the S-150 and G-357 culverts, all of which
are located at the northern boundary of WCA 3A. Under high water conditions, water flows
across the open portion of the western boundary of WCA 3A and into Big Cypress National
Preserve. However, surface outflows are primarily made to the ENP through the S-12 spillways
and the S-333 structure.
The S-140 pump station discharges runoff from the C-139 Annex, as well as the Seminole Tribe
of Florida Big Cypress Reservation and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida Reservation
located along the northwestern boundary of WCA 3A. Water supply deliveries to the Seminole
Tribe of Florida Big Cypress Reservation are made via the G-409 pump station located just west
of the northwest corner of WCA 3A. Sources of water for this pump station include Lake
Okeechobee (delivered via the G-404 pump station), STA 3/4, STA-5, STA-6, Rotenberger and
Holey Land WMAs, EAA runoff, and WCA 3A.
Interior levees running across the southeast portion of WCA 3 subdivide WCA 3A from WCA-3B.
WCA-3B receives most of its water from rainfall, but occasionally receives water supply releases
from WCA 3A via the Miami and L-67 Canals (through S-151). Water is discharged from WCA-3B
to the adjacent basins through the S-31 and S-337 structures via the Miami Canal, although
plans are underway to enable discharges to the Northeast Shark River Slough along the
northeast boundary of ENP from WCA-3B via the S-355 structures (Cooper, 1991; Grein et al.,
2003; Hwa, 2003; SFWMD, 2000; SFWMD Operations, 2003; Smelt, 2003; STRIVE, 1999; and
USACOE, 1999).

3.5.2.6

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Historically, inflows to Holey Land occurred via inflow pump station G-200A. The source of
inflows was the portion of the Miami Canal (L-23, L-24 and L-25) south of STA 3/4 diversion

structure G-373, which typically contains stormwater runoff that has been treated by either STA
3/4 or STA-5/6. However, in October 2005, Hurricane Wilma severely damaged G-200A,
rendering it inoperable. To date, this pump station has not been replaced. As a result, limited
surface water inflow capacity existed through the G-372HL box culvert located near STA 3/4
inflow pump station G-372. Outflows from Holey Land to the L-5 Canal could occur via culverts
with flashboard risers (G-204, G205 and G-206) (SFWMD, 2013). However, since April 2008,
there has been no surface water inflow to the Holey Land, and no outflows have occurred since
January 2006. Essentially, Holey Land has become a rainfall-driven system and no longer
functions as a flow-through system (Figure 3-8). The area dries out routinely, and re-wets
depending on rainfall amounts (SFWMD, 2013).
Figure 3.8. Location of Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

3.5.3 GROUNDWATER
The Lake Okeechobee area contains a surficial aquifer system consisting of all the rocks and
sediments from land surface to the top of the limestone. In the Central Flow Path, the high
organic content of the soil makes the surficial groundwater generally undesirable for domestic
use except close to Lake Okeechobee. This aquifer is recharged directly by two sources: Lake
Okeechobee and rainfall. Lake Okeechobee provides water for a variety of consumptive

A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

demands, including urban drinking water, irrigation for agricultural lands, and recharge for
wellfields.
Beneath the surficial aquifer is the Floridian aquifer system. It is the largest aquifer in Florida
and the most productive in the world. This system underlies an area of approximately 100,000
square miles (258,999 km2) in Florida, southeastern Alabama, southern Georgia, and southern
South Carolina. This aquifer is composed of a thick sequence of limestone layers and is divided
into Upper Floridian and Lower Floridan, by a less permeable middle confining unit of
carbonates. In the EAA, the water of the Floridan aquifer is rather salty, particularly in the
Lower Floridan (Sprinkle, 1989).
The intermediate confining unit is located approximately 200 to 250 feet below ground surface
(bgs) and will restrict any seepage from the project site that might reach this depth. There is a
high degree of communication between groundwater and surface water in the area, the
groundwater gradient in the surficial aquifer system is controlled, to a large extent, by the
operation of the hundreds of canals throughout the region. Therefore, even though the
general regional gradient in the surficial aquifer system is believed to be southward, localized
gradients may actually be in other directions in portions of the area surrounding the project site
due to the operation of canals and wells in the region.

3.5.4 STA PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL
Native soils within STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4 are primarily organic muck. As
dead plant material is accumulated in the STA, the material slowly is converted to a layer of
peat soil. The accretion of new soil primarily from vegetation and detritus material in the STA
occurs at a rate of approximately 1.2 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.8 cm/yr, respectively (Bhomia, Rupesh
2012).
STAs remove phosphorus from water by channeling the water through shallow marshes with
either emergent wetland vegetation or submerged wetland vegetation, both of which remove
phosphorus in different ways (Figure 3-9). For SAV-based treatment, the dominant phosphorus
removal pathway bounds inorganic phosphorus while EAV treatment enhances phosphorus
storage by plant uptake and peat burial (Bhomia and Reddy 2012). Water containing inorganic
phosphorus enters the wetland system. In the EAV treatment system, the wetland plants take
up or absorb phosphorus from the water. As the plant material decomposes, the detritus
material containing the phosphorus become sediments and provides substrata for microbial
growth where phosphorus is converted to a bioavailable form. In the SAV treatment system,
the limestone layer beneath the sediment absorbs or co-precipitates the phosphorus and

Affected Environment

makes it unavailable. As a whole system, phosphorus reduction in the STAs is carried out by the
various physical, chemical, and biological processes, but it primarily takes place at the soilwater-plant roots interface, assisted by microbes in the water column and within the soil layer.
Ultimately, the removal of phosphorus occurs as it is sequestered in the accreted soils.
STAs periodically experience dryout events as a result of drought conditions or management
related activities (Figure 3-10). Upon re-flooding, phosphorus stored in the soils can be re­
mobilized into the water column and released into downstream canals and/or wetlands (Figure
3-11). Several factors can potentially affect phosphorus release from STA soils. These include,
but are not limited to, the degree of prior sediment enrichment, hydrologic pattern (i.e.
continuously flooded versus periodic dryout), forms and concentrations of phosphorus in soil,
minerals, inflow water chemistry, oxidation-reduction potential, vegetation conditions, and
management activities (DeBusk and Kharbanda 2013).
Between Water Years 2002 and 2012, STA 2 experienced dryout conditions in at least five (5)
water years, with approximate durations ranging from 1 to 5 months. STA 3/4 experienced
dryout conditions one time since Water Year 2005, with a duration of less than one month.
Below are detailed descriptions of dryout conditions for STA 2 and STA 3/4.
STA 2
Cell 1 experienced dryout conditions for approximately 3 months from mid-April 2001 through
July 2001. Cell 1 experienced dryout conditions for approximately 5 months from early
December 2001 through April 2002. Cell 1 experienced dryout conditions for approximately 3
months from March through May 2009. Cell 2 experienced dryout conditions for approximately
3 months from March through May 2009. Cell 1 and parts of Cell 2 experienced dryout
conditions for approximately 1 month during Water Year 2011. Cell 4 experienced dryout
conditions for several months in Water Year 2011, but this was related mainly to Compartment
B construction activities. Cell 1 experienced dryout conditions for a brief period in June 2011.
Cell 4 experienced dryout conditions for several months in Water Year 2012 related mainly to
Compartment B construction activities.
STA 3/4
The Water Year 2011 dry season resulted in dryout conditions in all cells of STA 3/4 for
approximately 1 month (June 2011).

WATER QUALITY

Historically, the Everglades was an oligotrophic (or low nutrient) system. Therefore, the
increased levels of nutrients present in portions of the system today have resulted in an
imbalance in the native flora and fauna, for example, cattails and other invasive species
displacing native sawgrass. Currently, nutrient inputs into the Everglades come primarily from
agricultural fertilizers and decomposition of the peat soils, which is accelerated by continued
agricultural use. While the increased concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other
nutrients are a concern in the EPA, historically vegetation growth in the Everglades was limited
by the comparative lack of bioavailable phosphorus. Thus, phosphorus is a parameter of
particular concern in the water of Lake Okeechobee, the EAA, and the EPA.
Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) were implemented in the EAA in the 1990s,
with the result of improving water quality. However, this area remains a primary source of
pollutants for the WCAs. The WCAs form the remnant wetland communities for the northern
section of the Everglades system. Water moving south from Lake Okeechobee and EAA is
pumped through the STAs into WCAs, which are isolated by a series of levees and pump
stations. Construction of STAs upstream of the WCAs serves to improve water quality
conditions through time.

The focus of the water quality improvements in the Everglades is to reduce the total
phosphorus concentrations in the water entering into the EPA marsh. Water quality standards
are established to protect the designated use of a waterbody. The EPA waters have been
designated as lass III which has the designated use of “recreation, propagation, and
maintenance of healthy, well-balanced population of fish and wildlife” (62;302;540 F!); The
numeric total phosphorus criterion for Class III waters in the EPA as established in 62- 302.540
FAC is 10 parts per billion (ppb) measured as a long-term geometric mean. Achievement of the
10 ppb criterion in the Refuge and WCAs 2 and 3 is dependent on the total phosphorus (TP)
concentrations in the water leaving the EAA. The 10 ppb criterion is applied using an
achievement methodology that takes into account spatial and temporal variability, which is
described below.
Achievement of the criterion in impacted and unimpacted areas of the Refuge, WCA 2 and WCA
3 is determined based upon data from stations that are evenly distributed and located in
freshwater open water sloughs similar to the areas from which data were obtained to derive
the phosphorus criterion. Determining achievement of the criterion is based on data collected
monthly from the network of monitoring stations in both the impacted and unimpacted areas.
The waterbody is assessed for attainment of the criterion as determined by a four-part test. In
order to provide protection against imbalances of aquatic flora or fauna, the following
provisions must all be met:
a. The 5-year geometric mean averaged across all stations is less than or equal to 10 ppb;
b. The annual geometric mean averaged across all stations is less than or equal to 10 ppb
for 3 of 5 years;
c. The annual geometric mean averaged across all stations is less than or equal to 11 ppb;
and
d. The annual geometric mean at all individual stations is less than or equal to 15 ppb.
Assessment of the phosphorus criterion within the Everglades indicates that the 4-part test is
typically met in the unimpacted portions of each WCA, while the impacted portions of each
WCA fail one or more parts of the test and therefore exceed the criterion. (SFWMD 2012).

3.6.1 PROJECT SITE
Water quality data at the project site are not available, but is anticipated to be similar to that of
other fallow cropland in the EAA. It is reasonable to assume that phosphorus levels in the soil
and in runoff would be lower than active agricultural activities, but higher than sites not
previously farmed.

3.6.2 STA 2 AND STA 3/4
The original STA 2 consisted of three treatment cells (1, 2, & 3) with approximately 6,400 acres
of effective treatment area and began operation in 2000. The treatment area was expanded by
approximately 1,900 acres with the construction of Cell 4, which was flow capable by December
2006. However, this cell went off-line in Water Year (WY) 2010 (water budget standard
duration measured between May 1, 2009 and April 30, 2010) for Compartment B construction.
Compartment B construction was completed in December 2011 and was flow capable in April
2012, adding approximately 7,000 acres of treatment area. The STA 2/Compartment B complex
has a total of eight treatment cells, five flow-ways, and a total effective treatment area of
approximately 15,000 acres. (Figure 3-6).
STA 3/4 consists of six treatment cells (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B) and the Periphyton-based STA
(PSTA) Implementation Project cells (Upper SAV, Lower SAV and PSTA). STA 3/4 has 16,300
acres of effective treatment area and began operation in 2003 (Figure 3-7).
Average annual TP concentrations of inflows to and outflows from STA 3/4 and STA 2 are shown
in Table 3-1. Since STA 3/4 began operation in October 2003, it has treated approximately 3.7
million acre-feet (ac-ft) of runoff, retaining over 440 metric tons (mt) of TP, and reducing TP
concentration from 114 parts per billion (ppb) to 18 ppb. Since STA 2 began operation in
October 2003, it has treated approximately 2.7 million acre-feet of runoff, retaining over 268
metric tons of TP, and reducing TP concentration from 102 ppb to 22 ppb flow weighted mean
concentration (FWMC). While improvements have been observed, these STA outflow
concentrations still exceed 13 ppb, the concentration required at the STA discharge in order to
prevent further phosphorus enrichment in the EPA.

to conduct scientific investigations and research with the goals of enhancing knowledge of the
complex treatment systems, the factors affecting performance, and the various TP removal
mechanisms in the STAs. The research projects and results are presented annually in the South
Florida Environmental Reports (SFERs) (available at www.sfwmd.gov/sfer). It is evident,
however, that maintaining minimum stages to keep the STAs hydrated and to ensure the
viability of EAV and SAV, and regulating inflows to minimize high hydraulic loading rates
improves their performance.

3.6.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS
The geometric mean of measured TP concentrations (in ppb) in the WCAs over the 2005 to
2011 period of record is summarized in Table 3-2. The inflow and outflow concentrations are
based on total inflows and total outflows to the WCA. As the outflow from the STA is discharged
in the canal, the treated water mixes with the untreated water in the canal, and can enter into
the WCA. As not all of the canal water is treated by the STA and not all of the treated water
enters the WCAs, the TP concentrations in the outflow from the STA are different from the
concentrations in the inflow in the WCAs. Figure 3-12 and Figure 3-13 show the location of the
water quality monitoring stations in WCA 2A and WCA 3A, respectively.

Decreases in interior marsh TP concentrations in recent years have been observed for WCA 2A
and WCA 3A (Table 3-3). The continued decreases in TP concentration observed in WCA 2 and
WCA 3 likely reflect recovery from the recent climatic extremes, improved treatment of the
inflows to these areas (which is supported by similar decreases in inflow concentrations), and
improved conditions in the impacted portions of the marsh (SFWMD 2012). This includes the
area downstream of the S-10 structures located along the L-39 levee between WCA 2A and
WCA 2B, which is one of the area’s most highly impacted by historical phosphorus enrichment
(Figure 3-14). This area is also where the quantity of discharge has been significantly reduced
and the quality of the discharge has improved since STA 2 began operation.

3.6.4 HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA
Since 2008, there have been no surface water inflows to or outflows from Holey Land. Due to
the lack of surface water flows, SFWMD has collected limited water quality samples from
ponded water at the G-204, G-205, and G-206. The results (January 2008 through August 2012)
show total phosphorus concentrations ranging from 0.009 mg/l to 0.949 mg/l with an average
concentration of 0.081 mg/l. These values are indicative of water column concentrations within
these pools and may not be representative of the marsh water quality.

VEGETATION

3.7.1 PROJECT SITE
The project site is contains 16,152 acres of land, of which 14,705 acres are waters of the US and
1,447 acres are uplands. The waters of the US consists of 10,158 acres of mixed scrub shrub
wetlands, 234 acres of exotic scrub shrub wetlands, 3,877 acres of herbaceous freshwater
marsh wetlands, 109 acres of lateral farm ditches, and 327 acres of channelized waterway. The
uplands consist of existing levees and areas that have been previously filled to store rock
material and muck soils.
The mixed scrub shrub wetlands (10,158 acres) are areas that previously contained sugar cane
vegetation. Since active sugarcane cultivation has ceased in 2009, these wetland areas have
gone fallow. Sugar cane vegetation is no longer present and wetland vegetation has recruited
back into the area. These areas, which are in an altered condition, contain plant species such as
Carolina willow or often just referred to as willow (Salix caroliniana), wand goldenrod (Solidago
stricta), bushy broomsedge (Andropogon glomeratus), salt bush (Baccharis glomerulifolia),
elephant grass, primrose willow (Ludwigia peruviana) and cattail (Typha spp.).Standing water
was not observed in these areas during a site visit in October 2012.
The 233 acres of wetland that were high quality depressional wetlands in 2005 are now in a
degraded condition with 90% nuisance and exotic species such as Elephant grass (Pennisetum
purpureum) and castor bean (Ricinus communis). These areas did not contain standing water
during a site visit in October 2012. (See FDEP field trip report in Appendix C for details.)
The 3,877 acres of freshwater marsh wetlands were previously scraped down during
construction activities for the A-1 Reservoir. These areas are considered higher quality
wetlands as compared to the exotic wetland areas and scrub shrub wetlands because they
contain a dominance of native plant species including water-primrose (Ludwigia peruviana),
bushy aster (Aster dumosus), marsh fleabane (Pluchea rosea), flat-sedge (Cyperus spp.), jointed
spikerush (Eleocharis interstincta), and water-hyssops (Bacopa caroliniana). Also these areas
contained standing water during the site visit in October 2012.
The waters of the US include 109 acres of lateral farm ditches and 327 acres of channelized
waterway. Spatter-dock (Nuphar spp.) and water lettuce (Pistia Stratiotes) were found floating
on the surface of the canals and ditches. Refer to hapter 5 to review the SFWMD’s Unified
Mitigation Assessment Methodology (UMAM)wetland function and value scores for existing
site conditions.

3.7.2 STA 2 AND STA 3/4
Cells within the STA's are designed for either EAV or SAV and open water areas. The dominant
submerged aquatic vegetation species include Najas sp. (water-nymph) and Chara (muskgrass),
a gray-green branched multicellular algae, while the dominant emergent aquatic vegetation is
cattail (Typha domingensis).
Maintaining water depths at levels optimal to cattail growth and survival is an important
management strategy in the STAs. Changes in hydrologic regimes in a marsh can have subtle to
drastic effects on cattail (Chen et al., 2010). Cattail species can be eliminated under extended
periods of deeper water level conditions (Appelbaum, 1985 as cited in Chen 2013; Sojda and
Solberg, 1993 as cited in Chen 2013). Extended deepwater conditions can cause the formation
of cattail floating mats in the STAs (Chen et al., 2010). Heavy hydraulic loading, particularly
during storm events, has impacted cattail coverage and density in EAV cells.
Dry-outs have less effect on cattails than SAV as cattails can survive short periods of dry-out.
Lowering water levels to near ground level for a moderate time improves cattail recruitment
and establishment (Chen 2013); however long periods of complete dry-out can also result in
cattail mortality. In SAV cells, dryout events typically have adverse effects on the vegetation
and potentially alter the community characteristics following rehydration. Dry-out of SAV cells
leads to die off of the SAV and the associated periphyton communities essential to phosphorus
sequestration. For example, a STA 3/4 central flow-way dryout/re-flood event in 2011 resulted
in a dramatic change in the SAV community from a water-nymph and muskgrass co-dominated
to a muskgrass dominated system. (DeBusk and Kharbanda 2013)

3.7.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS 2A AND 3A
Almost all of the WCAs are grass-dominated wetlands interspersed with tree islands
(hammocks) and Carolina willow strands. Tree islands are a unique feature of the Everglades
ecosystem. In general, there are two recognizable types of basin wetland communities present
in the WCAs:
1. Sawgrass marsh composed of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) with cattail (Typha spp.),
maidencane (Panicum hemitomon), arrowhead (Sagittaria sp.), pickerelweed
(Pontederia cordata), Carolina willow, buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), wax
myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and saltbush.
2. Wet prairie, composed of beakrush (Rhynchospora spp.), spikerush (Eleocharis spp.),
maidencane, string lily (Crinum americanum) and white water lily (Nymphaea odorata).

A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

3-27

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

There are also forested wetlands within the WCAs, which include both wetland strands and
hydric hammocks. Forested wetland strands are dominated by cypress and Carolina willow
trees. Other species found within this community include pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens),
bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), Carolina willow, buttonbush, wax myrtle, sawgrass (Cladium
jamaicense), and royal fern (Osmunda regalis). Vegetative species associated with the hydric
hammocks include sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana), red bay (Persea borbonia), cocoplum
(Chrysobalanus icaco), strangler fig (Ficus aurea), wax myrtle, Carolina willow, elderberry
(Sambucus nigra), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), red maple (Acer
rubrum), false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), and water oak (Quercus nigra) (USACE and
SFWMD 2006).
High nutrient concentrations have resulted in widespread changes to the ecology of the
Everglades, including invasion of cattail. The proliferation of cattail in the Everglades is
attributed to increased phosphorus levels in the soil and increased water depth and duration of
flooding (Newman et. al. 1998). Monospecific stands of cattail have replaced the historic
sawgrass marsh ridge and slough landscape over nearly 12,500 hectares (30,888 acres) in the
Everglades (SFWMD 2012).
Vegetation maps provided in the following sections were produced by the SFWMD utilizing
color infrared aerial photography. Data sets were ground-truthed and vegetation types
delineated and classified using the Vegetation Classification for South Florida Natural Areas
(Rutchey et al. 2006).
Major plant communities in WCA 2A now consist of remnant tree islands, open water sloughs,
large expanses of sawgrass, and sawgrass intermixed with dense cattail stands. Remaining tree
islands are found primarily at higher ground level elevations, located in the northwest corner of
WCA 2A. Remnant tree islands, dominated primarily by Carolina willow, are found scattered
throughout the central and southern sections of WCA 2A. Cattail distribution in WCA 2 reflects
4,400 acres in which cattails represent more than 50% of the vegetation coverage and 24,000
acres of mixed or scattered cattail (<50% coverage) present in the northeast portion of WCA 2A
(USACE 2009).
Several studies conducted within WCA 2A show that cattail out-compete sawgrass in their
ability to absorb excess nutrients with increased cattail production during years of high nutrient
inflows (Toth, 1988; Davis, 1991). Cattail is considered a high nutrient status species that is
opportunistic and highly competitive, relative to sawgrass, in nutrient-enriched situations (Toth,
1988; Davis, 1991). Davis (1991) concluded that both sawgrass and cattail increased annual

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

production in response to elevated nutrient concentrations, but that cattail differed in its ability
to increase plant production during years of high nutrient supply.
The community structure and species diversity of Everglades vegetation located north of I-75
(WCA 3A North) is very different from the wetland plant communities found south of I-75 (WCA
3A South). Improvements made to the Miami Canal and the impoundment of WCA 3A by
levees have over-drained the north end of WCA 3A and shortened its natural hydroperiod.
These hydrological changes have increased the frequency of severe peat fires that have
resulted in loss of tree islands, aquatic slough, and wet prairie habitat that were once
characteristic of the area. Today, northern WCA 3A is largely dominated by sawgrass and lacks
the natural structural diversity of plant communities seen in southern WCA 3A.
Over-drainage of the northwestern portion of WCA 3A has allowed the invasion of a number of
terrestrial species such as saltbush, dog fennel (Eupatorium sp.), and broomsedge (Andropogon
glomeratus). Melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia) has become well-established in the
southeastern corner of WCA 3A, and is spreading to the north and west.
Vegetation located in the central and southern portion of WCA 3A represents some of the best
examples of original Everglades habitat left in South Florida. This region of the Everglades
appears to have changed the least since the 1950s, and contains a mosaic of tree islands, wet
prairies, sawgrass stands, and aquatic sloughs.
A comparison of vegetation in WCA 3 vegetation maps from 1995 to 2004 (SFWMD 2011)
indicate an increase in sawgrass/shrub by 48 percent (9,566 acres to 14,179 acres, 30 percent
increase in broadleaf marsh (2,775 acres to 3,593 acres), while floating marsh decreased by 37
percent (8,948 acres to 5,632 acres) (See Figure 3-15). Most significant may be the trend in
cattail coverage which increased 38% within WCA 3, representing a state change from historic
ridge and slough patterns (SFWMD 2011 and 2013)(Figure 3-16).

3.7.4 HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA
The vegetation community structure was historically dense sawgrass with scattered wetland
tolerant shrubs and sloughs (Davis, 1943); however, anthropogenic alterations of the
hydropattern have caused significant shifts in the plant community structure (Cornwell and
Hutchinson, 1974). Wet prairie and slough vegetative habitats are present in the northeast and
southwest reaches. Carolina willow is encroaching into the marsh along the Holey Land’s
western and southern boundaries.
Cattails are also prevalent throughout the Holey Land. The ground elevation within Holey Land
varies as much as four feet. This elevation range is primarily the result of muck fires burning
away organic soil during extreme dry periods. Extended high water levels in Holey Land can
drown out typical marsh species in these deep pockets, creating an opening in the landscape
susceptible to invasion by cattail (Newman et al. 1998). The FWCC performs cattail monitoring

in Holey Land (SFWMD, 2011). The results of the 2011 survey estimate that 18% (6,300 acres)
of the area is covered by cattail. This indicates an increase in estimated cattail coverage from
2010 (which was 10% of the area); however, it is still significantly less than what was estimated
in 2004 at 27% coverage of the area.

FISH AND WILDLIFE

3.8.1 GENERAL FISH AND WILDLIFE SPECIES
3.8.1.1

Overall area

Aquatic macroinvertebrates form a vital link between the algal and detrital food web base of
freshwater wetlands and the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and wading birds that feed upon
them. Important macroinvertebrates of the freshwater aquatic community include crayfish
(Procambarus alleni), riverine grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus), amphipods (Hyallela
aztecus), Florida apple snail (Pomacea paludosa), Seminole ramshorn (Planorbella duryi), and
numerous species of aquatic insects (USACE 1999a).
Small freshwater marsh fishes are also important processors of algae, plankton, macrophytes,
and macroinvertebrates. Marsh fishes provide an important food source for wading birds,
amphibians, and reptiles. Common small freshwater marsh species include the golden
topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), Florida flagfish
(Jordenella floridae), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna),
bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), oscar (Astronotus ocellatus), eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia
holbrookii), and small sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) (USACE 1999a). The density and distribution of
marsh fish populations fluctuates with seasonal changes in water levels. Populations of marsh
fishes increase during extended periods of continuous flooding during the wet season. As marsh
surface waters recede during the dry season, marsh fishes become concentrated in areas that
hold water through the dry season, such as alligator holes, limestone solution holes, and
longer-hydroperiod marshes and sloughs. Concentrated dry season assemblages of marsh
fishes are more susceptible to predation and provide an important food source for wading birds
(USACE 1999a).
Numerous sport and larger predatory fishes occur in deeper canals and sloughs. Common
species include largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus),

calva), and tilapia (Tilapia spp.) (USACE 1999a). Larger fish are an important food source for
raptors and other birds of prey, wading birds, alligators, otters, raccoons, and mink.
The freshwater wetland complex supports a diverse assemblage of reptiles and amphibians.
Common amphibians include the greater siren (Siren lacertina), Everglades dwarf siren
(Pseudobranchus striatus), two-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma means), pig frog (Rana grylio),
southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), Florida cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), squirrel tree frog (Hyla squirela), and green tree frog (Hyla
cinerea) (USACE 1999). Amphibians represent an important forage base for wading birds,
alligators, and larger predatory fishes (USACE 1999a).
Common reptiles of freshwater wetlands include the American alligator (Alligator
mississippiensis), snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), striped mud turtle (Kinosternon bauri),
mud turtle (Kinosternon subrubrum), cooter (Chrysemys floridana), Florida chicken turtle
(Deirochelys reticularia), Florida softshell turtle (Trionys ferox), water snake (Natrix sipidon),
green water snake (Natrix cyclopion), mud snake (Francia abacura), and Florida cottonmouth
(Agkistrodon piscivorus) (USACE 1999a). The alligator was historically most abundant in the
peripheral Everglades marshes and freshwater mangrove habitats, but is now most abundant in
canals and the deeper slough habitats of the central Everglades, the STAs, WCAs and the Holey
Lands. Drainage of peripheral wetlands and increasing salinity in mangrove wetlands as a result
of decreased freshwater flows has limited the occurrence of alligators in these habitats
(Mazzotti and Brandt 1994).
The freshwater wetlands of the STAs, WCAs and the Holey Land are noted for their abundance
and diversity of colonial wading birds. Common wading birds include the white ibis (Eudocimus
albus), glossy ibis (Plegadus falcenellus), great egret (Casmerodius albus), great blue heron
(Ardea herodius), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), snowy
egret (Egretta thula), green-backed heron (Butorides striatus), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis),
black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), yellow-crowned night heron (Nycticorax
violacea), roseate spoonbill (Ajaia ajaja), and wood stork (Mycteria americana) (USACE 1999a).
The Everglades National Park historically supported the largest number of nests in the Greater
Everglades, but in recent decades the majority of nesting has occurred further inland in the
WCAs. In 2012 an estimated 24,191 nests (92% of all south Florida nests) were initiated either
in the WCAs or Everglades National Park (ENP). This estimate is 40% lower than the decadal
average and 66% lower than in 2009 when a record high of 73,096 nests was recorded. Most
other regions of south Florida experienced similar declines in nest numbers during 2012. (Cook
and Kobza 2012). Wading bird populations in the Everglades are dynamic, changing constantly

and are influenced by many other aspects (Russell et al. 2002). However, the most influential
aspect is perhaps human habitat alteration; particularly those that change the natural
hydrological conditions. Food availability is consider the most important factor limiting
populations of wading birds in the Everglades (Frederick & Spalding 1994); however hydrology
is the factor that ultimately determines the availability of food. Data obtained during each SRF
over the years, support the important role that hydrological conditions plays on the abundance
and distributions of wading bird populations in the lower Everglades. The concept of too
much/too little or just the right amount of water and the too late/too early or just at the right
time seem to be of particular importance for wading birds. (Cook and Kobza 2012).
Mammals that are well-adapted to the aquatic and wetland conditions of the freshwater marsh
complex include the rice rat (Oryzomys palustris natator), round-tailed muskrat, and river otter
(Lutra canadensis). Additional mammals that may utilize freshwater wetlands on a temporary
basis include the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Florida panther (Puma concolor
coryi), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and racoon (Procyon lotor). Additional information on Greater
Everglades fauna is also contained within the South Florida Environmental Reports which are
published annually by the SFWMD:

Project site

The A-1 project site contains habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species. The previous
farming activities on the site may have deterred some species from utilizing the site; however,
since the site has been undisturbed for several years, the amount of wildlife utilization has
since increased. A list of fish and wildlife species observed on the project site is shown in Table

Stormwater Treatment Areas

The STAs are becoming known as havens for birds and wildlife. During the 109th National
Christmas Bird Count conducted in January 2009, a multi-agency team documented 92,600
birds; a total of 112 species at STA 5. These species includes limpkin, roseate spoonbill, wood
stork, bald eagle, Everglades snail kite, purple gallinule, black-necked stilts, sandhill crane, and
some rare birds such as short-tailed hawk and assin’s kingbird; Thus, the constructed wetland
systems provide abundant breeding and foraging habitats to birds and other wildlife.

3.8.1.4

Water Conservation Areas 2A and 3A and Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area

The WCAs and Holey Land as a whole contain a number of important species whose existence,
population numbers, and sustainability are markedly influenced by water levels. The American
alligator, a keystone Everglades species, has rebounded in terms of population numbers since
the 1960s when the reptile was placed on the endangered species list by the USFWS. Alligators,
it is believed, play an important ecological function by maintaining "gator holes", or
depressions, in the muck which are thought to provide refuge for aquatic organisms during
times of drought and concentrates food sources for wading birds. High water during periods of
nest construction, which occurs from June to early July (Woodward, et al., 1989), decreases the
availability of nesting sites. If conditions become too dry, either naturally or through water

management practices, water levels may fall too low to maintain gator holes, forcing the animal
to seek other areas to survive.
Other important reptile species commonly encountered within the WCAs and Holey Land
include a number of species of turtles, lizards, and snakes. Turtle species include the snapping
turtle, striped mud turtle, mud turtle, cooter, Florida chicken turtle, and Florida soft-shell turtle.
Lizards such as the green anole are found in the central Everglades, and several species of
skinks occur more commonly in terrestrial habitats. Numerous snakes inhabit the wetland and
terrestrial environments. Drier habitats support such species as the Florida brown snake,
southern ringneck snake, southern black racer, scarlet snake, and two rattlesnake species. The
eastern indigo snake, a federally-listed threatened species, and the Florida pine snake, a state
species of special concern, may also exist in drier areas. Wetter habitats support more aquatic
species such as the water snake, the green water snake, mud snake, eastern garter snake,
ribbon snake, rat snake, and the Florida cottonmouth (McDiarmid and Pritchard, 1978).
Important amphibians known to occur in South Florida include the Everglades bullfrog, Florida
cricket frog, southern leopard frog, southern chorus frog, and various tree frogs common to
tree islands and cypress forests. Salamanders inhabit the densely vegetated, still or slowmoving waters of the sawgrass marshes and wet prairies. They include the greater siren and
the Everglades dwarf siren. Toads such as the eastern narrow-mouth toad also occur within the
WCAs.
Colonial wading birds utilize the WCAs and Holey Land as both feeding and breeding habitat.
The most common species utilizing the WCAs include the white ibis, great egrets, snowy egrets,
cattle egrets, great blue herons, tricolored herons, little blue herons, green herons, blackcrowned night herons, yellow-crowned night herons, wood storks, and glossy ibis, with
populations varying widely in relationship to seasonal water level fluctuations. Historically,
white ibis has been the most abundant colonial wading bird species within the WCAs with the
great egret as the second (Frederick and Collopy, 1988). The WCAs and Holey Land support
additional aquatic avifauna, such as the limpkin, two species of bitterns, the anhinga, as well as
a number of resident and migratory waterfowl.
The Everglades fish community is composed of a variety of forage fish important in the diet of
many wading birds, sport fish, native species, and exotics introduced partly through
aquaculture practices and the aquarium trade. Forage species include the Florida flagfish,
bluefin killifish, least killifish, shiners, mosquito fish, and sailfin molly.

Affected Environment

The WCAs provide a valuable sport fishery for South Florida. Many of the canals, notably along
US 41, I-75, and in the L-35B and L-67A, provide valuable recreational fishing for largemouth
bass, sunfish, oscar, gar, bowfin, catfish and other species. Generally, Everglades sportfish are
harvested from the borrow canals that surround the marsh. As water levels in the canal and
marsh rise, fish populations disperse into the interior marsh and reproduce with minimum
competition and predation. As water levels recede, fish concentrate into the deeper waters of
the surrounding canals, where they become available as prey for wildlife and fishermen.
Several game and non-game wildlife species occur within the wetland systems in the WCAs and
Holey Land including: white-tailed deer, common snipe, and marsh rabbit. Blue-winged teal,
mottled ducks, and other game waterfowl are found in the sloughs. Feral hogs may also be
present in drier areas or on tree islands.

Project site

The project site currently supports habitat utilized by threatened or endangered species, in
particular the eastern indigo snake, the !udubon’s crested caracara, the wood stork, and the
Florida panther.
Eastern indigo snakes were reported in the project area from 2006 – 2011. Figure 3-17 is based
on the FWS’s GIS database and shows the locations of eastern indigo snake reported from
within the A-1 project site and the surrounding EAA. Currently, the former agricultural lands
have converted back to wetland vegetation. Since the eastern indigo snake is typically found in
upland areas, it is anticipated that eastern indigo snakes may be found in and around the levees
and berms. In the sugar cane fields of the former A-I Reservoir project site, eastern indigo
snakes have been observed (including one mortality) during earthmoving and other
construction-related activities.
The project site is located within a USFWS Audubon crested caracara consultation area. The
USFWS SLOPES defines the primary protection zone for the species as 985 feet outward from a
nesting tree with a secondary zone 6,600 feet from an active nesting tree. There are no known
nest sites located within 6,600 feet of the project site, as the nearest nest, documented in
2007, is over 20 miles northwest. The nearest documented occurrence was 12.6 miles
southwest of the project area. (Figure 3-18).

Affected Environment

The freshwater wetlands serve as foraging habitat for the wood stork. Although the nearest
active wood stork colony is located over 25 miles away, wood stork are observed on the site
(Figure 3-20).
Within the project area, there has been no panther focus area (based on telemetry point
density) designated. However, within a 10 mile buffer area, 19,688 acres have been identified
as a primary panther zone and 101,350 acres have been identified as secondary panther zone
(USFWS GIS database, 2012). Therefore, it is anticipated that panthers may hunt on the project
site, but it is unlikely that they would use these areas for any extended length of time because
of the lack of suitable long-term panther habitat (URS 2007). In addition, the site borders the
eastern extent of the panther’s secondary zone (Figure 3-21). No Florida panthers have been
sighted on the property; however, they have been documented in the area (Figure 3-22).

3.8.2.3

Stormwater Treatment Areas 2 and 3/4

The eastern extent of STA 2 is within the core foraging area of four wood stork colonies, and
the wood storks have been documented to utilize the wetlands within the both STAs. The
southeast corner of STA 3/4 also falls within the 18.6 mile buffer area of a wood stork colony.
The levees and berms may provide habitat for the eastern indigo snake. Alligators are present
within both STAs. Although it was originally anticipated that the Everglades snail kites would
only forage in the STAs, there have been documented reports that the snail kites nested within
STA 3/4 in 2011 and have begun nesting in STA 1E (USFWS GIS database, 2012).

3.8.2.4

Water Conservation Areas and Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Federally protected species occurring in the WCAs include many of the protected species in the
South Florida region including the !merican alligator, wood stork, !udubon’s crested caracara,
Everglades snail kite, Florida panther, and possibly the Eastern indigo snake. The WCAs also
have designated critical habitat for the Everglades snail kite in WCA 2 and WCA 3, and support
several successful nests.

American Alligator

The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a large, carnivorous reptile related to
crocodiles that inhabits freshwater lakes, ponds, marshes, sloughs, swamps, canals and,
occasionally, brackish waters throughout the southeastern United States. It is commonly seen
on canal banks throughout the EAA and in the WCAs.

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

In 1985, alligators were down-listed in Florida from “threatened” to status of “threatened due
to similarity of appearance” because of its similarity to the endangered !merican crocodile
(Crocodylus acutus). A distinguishing characteristic from the American crocodile, a close
relative, is that only the upper teeth are visible with the alligator’s mouth closed, while both the
upper and lower teeth are visible on the !merican crocodile; The listing “threatened due to
similarity of appearance” is defined for species that are not currently biologically threatened
but that are believed likely to become endangered in the future (50 CFR Part 17). Therefore,
no coordination is needed for this species.

3.8.2.5.2

Eastern Indigo Snake

The eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon corais couperi) is federally listed as threatened. It is a
large, black, non-venomous snake that reaches lengths up to of 265 cm (Ashton and Ashton
1981). Its historical range extended throughout Florida and the coastal plains of Mississippi,
Alabama, and Georgia (USFWS 1999).
The eastern indigo snakes preferred habitats are uplands (flatwoods, dry prairies, tropical
hardwood hammocks, and coastal dunes). They are not usually found in Everglades wetlands
(Steiner and others 1983), but can be found on the edges of freshwater marshes and in
agricultural fields (USFWS 1999). They are extremely susceptible to desiccation and cold. In
dry, cold habitats (Georgia, Alabama, and the Florida panhandle), eastern indigo snakes depend
on the holes of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), which provide protection from cold
and dry conditions (Layne and Steiner 1996). Throughout the warmer environment of
peninsular Florida, eastern indigo snakes may exist in any terrestrial habitats with low urban
development (USFWS 1999). They frequently use natural holes, gopher tortoise burrows, trash
piles and the like even in warmer south Florida. They use a variety of food sources including
fish, frogs, toads, lizards, turtles and their eggs, small alligators, birds and small mammals
(USFWS, 1999).
Initially, the population decline of eastern indigo snakes was from over-collecting for the pet
trade (43 FR 4028), but current major threats to the eastern indigo snake include loss and
fragmentation of habitat from increased development (USFWS 1999). Other threats to the
eastern indigo snake associated with development include increased mortality from vehicular
collisions, domestic pets, and people, and pesticides (USFWS 1999).
Eastern indigo snakes range over large areas and use various habitats throughout the year, with
most activity occurring in the summer and fall (Smith 1987; Moler 1985a). Adult males have
larger home ranges than adult females and juveniles; their ranges average 554 acres (Moler

1985b). In contrast, a gravid female may use from 3.5 to 106 acres (Smith 1987). In Florida,
home ranges for females and males range from 5 to 371 acres and 4 to 805 acres, respectively
(Smith 2003). At the Archbold Biological Station (ABS), average home range size for females was
determined to be 47 acre and overlapping male home ranges to be 185 acre (Layne and Steiner
1996).

!udubon’s Crested Caracara

The !udubon’s crested caracara (Polyborus plancus audubonii) is federally listed as threatened.
It is a large non-migratory raptor with its overall distribution including the southern United
States, Mexico, and Central America to Panama. In Florida, the most abundant populations of
crested caracara are in Glades, Desoto, Highlands, Okeechobee, and Osceola counties, all of
which are located north and west of Lake Okeechobee (USFWS 1999). Caracaras are most
commonly found in dry or wet prairies with occasional cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto) or
scattered wooded vegetation. Prey include insects and other small invertebrates, small
mammals, reptiles, and fish. Because of changes in land use, the crested caracara also now
uses improved or semi-improved pastures (USFWS 1999). The primary threat to the crested
caracara is in the conversion from dried prairies to agriculture and development. The project
site is located within a USFWS crested caracara consultation area. See Figure 3-18 for the
nearest documented occurrence of the !udubon’s crested caracara in relation to the project
site.

Everglade Snail Kite

The endangered Everglade snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) is a medium sized raptor
that feeds almost entirely on apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) which are found in palustrine
emergent, long hydroperiod wetlands (USFWS, 1999); The snail kite’s foraging habitat is
restricted to clear, calm waters of freshwater marshes and shallow vegetated littoral zones of
lakes in South and Central Florida including Palm Beach and Hendry Counties. Snail kites
require small trees or shrubs near foraging areas as nest sites and shallow inundated areas to
sustain their food source, apple snail.
Apple snails inhabit a wide range of ecosystems from swamps, ditches and ponds to lakes and
rivers. Apple snails eat, feed, breed, and lay eggs on emergent vegetation in waterbodies that
are flooded continuously for longer than 1 year (USFWS 1999). Changes in water regimes and
depth and duration of inundation are important characteristics for wetland vegetation that
supports snail kite nesting and foraging habitat, Florida apple snails, and all aspects of snail kite
and apple snail life history. Rapid and/or large increases in water depth may detrimentally
affect desirable vegetation, and can flood out Florida apple snail eggs, leading to reductions in
apple snail populations and reduced snail kite foraging (USFWS 2006).
Designated critical habitat for the snail kite exists on the western side of Lake Okeechobee and
portions of the EPA, including WCA 1, WCA 2 and WCA 3A. Snail kites are also found in Holey
Land. Wood storks and snail kites have overlapping ranges, but different feeding mechanisms
and require different hydrologic conditions for optimum feeding. Historically, both have
survived with the hydrologic variability characteristic of the natural system. The reduced
heterogeneity and extent of natural area of the present system make the snail kites more
vulnerable to natural and human-caused threats (USFWS, 1999).
Loss and degradation of habitat are the primary threat to snail kites. Water levels, duration,
and quality are primary concerns in Everglade snail kite conservation. Water levels must allow
for appropriate nesting sites, durations of water levels must be sufficient to support apple snail
populations, and water quality must be such that invasive species do not take over Everglade
snail kite foraging habitat (USFWS 1999). The project site, the STAs and WCAs are all within
Everglade snail kite USFWS consultation area. The nearest nest to the project area, recorded in
2011, was located approximately 3 miles from the A-1 project site (Figure 3-19). The most
recent nests, recorded in 2012, were located 14.1 miles to the west and 22.3 miles to the east
(WCA 1).

Wood Stork

The endangered wood storks (Mycteria Americana) are tall, long-legged wading birds that
utilize a variety of freshwater and estuarine wetlands (USFWS 1999) including shallow
freshwater wetlands, canals, and ditches to catch prey. Historically, breeding colonies existed
in coastal states from Texas to South Carolina, but today breeding colonies are limited to
Georgia, Florida, and coastal South Carolina (USFWS 1999). Their non-breeding season range
extends throughout the continental United States.
The timing, duration, and quantity of water affect wood stork distribution for two reasons:
shallow waters with high prey densities are needed for feeding; and they prefer nesting sites
surrounded by deep water. The primary prey of wood storks is small fish. During feeding,
wood storks immerse their bill, partly open, in water and snap it shut when it contacts a prey
item (Kahl 1964, as cited in USFWS 1999). This feeding behavior, known as tactolocation or
grope feeding, requires high prey concentrations found after drying events that concentrate
fish to smaller areas. Nesting colonies of wood storks are usually established in stands of
medium to tall trees, such as cypress stands or mangrove forests, surrounded by deeper water
marshes (Palmer 1962; Rogers and others 1996; and Ogden 1991, as cited in USFWS 1999).
These areas provide protection from terrestrial predators. Core foraging areas include an 18.6­
mile radius around breeding colonies (USFWS SLOPES). The nearest active colony reported in
2009 is located 21.2 miles from the A-1 project site (Figure 3-20). Documented in 2011, the
most recent active colony is 25.0 miles south of A-1 project site (USFWS GIS database, 2012).

Affected Environment

Florida Panther

The Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), a medium-sized tawny-colored long-tailed puma, is
one of the most federally listed endangered land mammal; !t one time, the panther’s range
extended through Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Southern Tennessee,
South Carolina, and Florida. Today, the only existing population is found in a two million acre
area in central and South Florida with population estimates of only 80 total individuals, 30 to 50
adults and approximately 30 subadults (USFWS 1999). The Big Cypress Swamps/Everglades has
the only known breeding panther population (USFWS 1999).
The Florida panther, a subspecies of the mountain lion, is Florida’s designated state mammal;
Male panthers weigh 102 to 154 pounds and reach 7 feet in length, while the smaller females
weigh 50 to 108 pounds and reach 6 feet in length (Roelke 1990); Panther’s preferred habitats
are hardwood hammocks and pine flatwoods, but they can also be found in wetlands and
disturbed habitat (USFWS 1999). The panther diet includes feral hogs (Sus scrofa), white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus)
(Maehr et. al. 1990).
Habitat loss and fragmentation from development are the largest threat to panthers and have
lead to inbreeding, reduced prey availability, and mortality from vehicle strikes. An individual
panther range may extend on average 200 square miles for males and 74 square miles for
females (Land 1994); The panther’s wide-range recovery plan cites three conditions necessary
for the survival and recovery of the species: (1) protection and enhancement of existing
populations, habitats, and prey resources; (2) improving genetic health and population viability;
and (3) re-establishing a minimum of two more reproducing populations within the historical
range.
Panther telemetry data from 1981 to 2005 show panthers in the EAA, including areas directly
adjacent to the project site and in W! 3! (USFWS 2006); ased on the USFWS’ GIS Database,

STATE LISTED SPECIES

3.8.3.1

Overall Area

The project site and the affected areas contain habitat for several state listed species. State
listed endangered animal species include the whooping crane (Grus Americana) while the listed
threatened animal species include the Florida sandhill crane (Grus Canadensis pratensis). The
species of special concern include the Florida mouse (Podomys floridanus), black skimmer
(Rynchopsniger), limpkin (Aramus guarauna), reddish egret (Egretta rufescens), snowy egret
(Egretta thula), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), white ibis
(Eudocimus albus), roseate spoonbill (Ajaia ajaia), the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia),
gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), and the gopher frog (Rana capito). Information for
each species was obtained directly from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
ommission’s website at:

3.8.3.2
3.8.3.2.1

Endangered Species
Whooping Crane

The whooping crane is the tallest bird in North America, standing nearly five feet tall with a
wing span of seven to eight feet. Adult whooping cranes are solid white with a red crown on
their head, long black legs, and a long “S” shaped neck; Whooping crane chicks have a
cinnamon brown body color; however, by the age of four months they will begin to gain adultlike white feathers. The diet of whooping cranes primarily consists of aquatic invertebrates
(insects, crustaceans, and mollusks), small vertebrates (fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and
mammals), roots, acorns, and berries.
While courting, males will perform a dancing ritual that includes them jumping, flapping their
wings, and tossing objects into the air (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011). The nesting
season in Wood Buffalo National Park (located in Alberta and the Northwest Territories of
Canada) occurs between the months of April and May, while cranes in Florida breed between
the months of January and May. The clutch size for the whooping crane ranges from one to
three eggs (M. Folk pers comm. 2011). Eggs are incubated for 29-31 days with both parents
sharing the incubating duties. Breeding pairs will re-nest if the first clutch of eggs is destroyed
before mid-incubation. It is rare for more than one of the chicks from a single nest to survive.
Whooping crane chicks are able to fly (fledge) at 80 to 90 days old. Juvenile migratory cranes

Affected Environment

become independent from their parents on their first migration north, while non-migratory
whooping cranes become independent before their parents’ next breeding season; Whooping
cranes mate for life, but will pick new partners if the previous partner is lost. Females produce
their first fertile eggs at four to seven years of age.

Habitat and Distribution
Whooping cranes have a very limited range and only inhabit shallow marshes and open
grasslands. The only natural whooping crane nesting population is located in Wood Buffalo
National Park. This population winters in and around Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which is
located on the Texas Gulf Coast. There is a non-migratory population in Central Florida that the
FWC introduced in 1993. The introduction was stopped in 2008 due to survival and
reproduction problems. During the winter, migratory whooping cranes are led by an ultra-light
aircraft from Wisconsin to Florida. A new project to reintroduce non-migratory whooping
cranes to Louisiana was begun in early 2011 (Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries
2011).

Threats
The main threat to the whooping crane is the alteration and degradation of their habitat in the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Pollution is also a threat to the whooping crane in Aransas, as
the boats and barges in the Intracoastal Waterway carry toxic chemicals that could cause
devastating effects to the species if spilled. Their extremely small range also puts them at risk
to suffer a population decline during natural disaster events. Other threats include illegal

hunting, collisions with cars, and increased predation by other species such as the black bear,
wolverine, gray wolf, red fox, lynx, and bald eagle (Lewis 1995). Also, in recent times, wind
farms and their associated power lines in the migratory corridor have become a major concern
(Canadian Wildlife Service and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2007).

3.8.3.3

Threatened Species

3.8.3.3.1

Florida Sandhill Crane

The Florida sandhill crane can reach a height of 47.2 inches (120 centimeters) with a wingspan
around 78.7 inches (200 centimeters) (Nesbitt 1996). This species is gray with a long neck and
legs, and a bald spot of red skin on the top of its head. The sandhill crane is unique in flight as it
can be seen flying with its neck stretched out completely.

Life History
The diet of the Florida sandhill crane primarily consists of grain, berries, seeds, insects, worms,
mice, small birds, snakes, lizards, and frogs. Florida sandhill cranes are a non-migratory species
that nests in freshwater ponds and marshes. This species is monogamous (breeds with one
mate). Courtship consists of dancing, which features jumping, running, and wing flapping
(International Crane Foundation, n.d.). Sandhill crane nests are built by both mates with grass,
moss, and sticks. Females lay two eggs that incubate for 32 days. Both male and female
participate in incubating the eggs (Nesbitt 1996). The offspring will begin traveling from the
nest with their parents just 24-hours after hatching. At ten months old, juveniles are able to
leave their parents (Nesbitt 1996). Bonding between pairs begins at two years old.

Habitat and Distribution
Florida sandhill cranes inhabit freshwater marshes, prairies, and pastures (Florida Natural Areas
Inventory 2001). They occur throughout peninsular Florida north to the Okefenokee Swamp in
southern Georgia; however, they are less common at the northernmost and southernmost
portions of this range. Florida’s Kissimmee and Desoto prairie regions are home to the state’s
most abundant populations (Meine and Archibald 1996).

Affected Environment

Threats
Degradation or direct loss of habitat due to wetland drainage or conversion of prairie for
development or agricultural use are the primary threats facing Florida sandhill cranes. The
range of the Florida sandhill crane diminished in the southeastern United States during the 20th
century, with breeding populations disappearing from coastal Texas, Alabama, and southern
Louisiana due to degradation, habitat loss, and overhunting. (Meine and Archibald 1996).

3.8.3.4

Species of Special Concern

3.8.3.4.1

Florida mouse

The Florida mouse is a large member of the genus Podomys that can reach a length of eight
inches (20.3 centimeters) and a weight of 0.7 to 1.7 ounces (36.9-49 grams). This species has a
yellowish-brown upper body with orange colored sides and a white belly. It also has five
plantar tubercles (foot pads) on each foot, which is distinct to the species (Florida Natural Areas
Inventory 2001, Layne 1990, Layne 1992, Jones and Layne 1993).

Life History
The diet of the Florida mouse primarily consists of seeds, plants, fungi, and insects (Smithsonian
National Museum of Natural History, n.d.).The Florida mouse digs small burrows inside the
burrows of other species, primarily the gopher tortoise, where they will prepare a nest
(Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, n.d.). Reproduction occurs throughout the

year, but peaks in the fall and winter. The number of young per litter is typically between two
and four. Offspring are weaned at three to four weeks of age (Jones 1990, Layne 1990, Jones
and Lane 1993).

Habitat and Distribution
The Florida mouse inhabits xeric uplands (ecological communities with well drained soils) such
as sandhill and scrub (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001). Peripheral peninsular counties are
St. Johns, Clay, Putnam, Alachua, Suwannee, and Taylor counties in the north, south to Sarasota
County on the west coast (although not documented in Sarasota County in recent years), south
to Highlands County in central Florida, and, at least formerly, south to Dade County on the east
coast (now south to near Boynton Beach (Layne 1992; Jones and Layne 1993; Pergams et al.
2008).

Threats
The Florida mouse exhibits narrow preferences for fire-maintained, xeric upland habitats
occurring on deep, well-drained soils, especially scrub and sandhill habitats (Jones and Layne
1993). Because of this narrow habitat specificity, the major threat to the Florida mouse is loss
and degradation of habitat caused by conversion to other uses (e.g. development and
agricultural use) and insufficient management (e.g., fire suppression) (Layne 1990, 1992). In

Highlands ounty, 64% of the species’ habitat was destroyed between 1940 and 1980, with an
additional 10% considered disturbed or degraded (Layne 1992).

3.8.3.4.2

Black skimmer

The black skimmer is a seabird with defining physical characteristics that make it easily
distinguishable from others. The key physical feature of the skimmer is its large red and black
bill. The bill begins to widen at the top and gradually becomes smaller as it forms a sharp tip at
the end of the bill. The lower part of the bill is longer than the top, which is important because
they use their bill to skim along the top of the water to catch fish, for which they are aptly
named. Skimmers can reach a height of 19.7 inches (50 centimeters) with a wingspan of 3 to
3.5 feet (.9-1.1 meters) (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011, E. Sachs pers. comm. 2011).
Skimmers have a black back, black wings with white edging, and a white belly and head.

Life History
The diet of the black skimmer primarily consists of fish. The skimmer has a unique style of
feeding that involves literally “skimming” the surface of the water with their lower bill; When
they contact a prey item, they quickly bend their head forward and snap the upper bill closed,
seizing their prey. Breeding occurs during the summer, generally between May and early
September (Katja Schulz, n.d.). Skimmers nest on the sand along beaches, sandbars, and
islands developed by dredged-up material. Nesting occurs in colonies consisting of one to
several hundred pairs of skimmers. Skimmers are protective of their nests and offspring and
will utilize group mobbing to protect the nests. Skimmers usually lay three to five eggs per nest
and eggs are incubated by both parents for approximately 23-25 days (The Cornell Lab of
Ornithology 2011). Each parent incubates the eggs for up to four hours at a time (Gochfield
and Burger, 1994). Once hatched, parents guard the offspring until they are able to fly at about
28-30 days old (Katja Schulz, n.d.).

Habitat and Distribution
The black skimmer inhabits coastal areas in Florida such as estuaries, beaches, and sandbars.
Skimmers can be found from the coasts of the northeastern U.S., down to Mexico, and over to
the Gulf Coast of Florida. Breeding range is from Southern California, down to Ecuador.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

3-57

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

Threats:
The black skimmer faces many threats as the human population increases and spreads to
previously undeveloped coasts. Habitat loss due to coastal development is the main threat to
the species. People are relocating to the coasts at unprecedented levels causing increased
development and traffic on the beaches, as well as increased predators; all of which are
detrimental to skimmer habitat. Predators will feed on skimmer eggs and chicks and include
species such as raccoons, crows, opossums, feral hogs, and coyotes. Because skimmers nest on
the beach and are colonial they are extremely vulnerable to disturbance by people, pets, and
predators. Other threats include recreational activity, beach driving, shoreline hardening,
mechanical raking, oil spills, and increased presence of domestic animals, all of which may
prevent or disrupt nesting or result in the death or abandonment of eggs and young. Global
climate change is an impending threat to the black skimmer. Sea level rise may cause
destruction to primary nesting areas, resulting in a decreased population size.

3.8.3.4.3

Limpkin

Limpkins are large (approximately 66 centimeters) brown to olive colored birds with a long,
heavy down-curved yellow bill with a dark tip. Occurring from peninsular Florida and southern
Mexico through the Caribbean and Central America to Northern Argentina, limpkins are listed
as species of special concern in Florida. Limpkins inhabit freshwater marshes and swamps with

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

tall reeds, as well as mangroves. They are largely nocturnal, but daytime activities have also
been observed (Holyoak and Colston 2003).Limpkins forage primarily in shallow water and on
floating vegetation, such as water hyacinth and water lettuce. Similar to snail kite, this wading
bird species feeds primarily on apple snails of the genus Pomacea. The availability of apple
snails has a significant effect on the local distribution of the limpkin (Cottam 1936). Freshwater
mussels and other species of snail are secondary food resources. Less important prey items
include insects, frogs, lizards, crustaceans and worms, which may be important dietary
components during periods of drought or flooding when birds may be forced to forage in
suboptimal areas.

3.8.3.4.4

White Ibis

The white ibis is easily identified by its long red legs, all white plumage, red face, long decurved
red bill and black tipped wings. White ibises are medium-sized wading birds, weighing about
two pounds, with a 36-inch wingspan, and a length of 24 inches. White ibises inhabit shallow
coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps and feed on crayfish, crabs, insects, snakes,
frogs and fish (Kushlan and Bildstein 1992). Nesting occurs in trees, shrubs, and grass clumps
from ground level to a height of 50 feet. Nests are constructed of vegetation sticks, leaves
and/or roots. Females typically lay two to three eggs; eggs are incubated for 21 to 22 days. The
young are able to leave the nest at 9 to 16 days of age. Nestlings are independent at 40 to 50
days of age. Breeding season extends from March to August (FWC 2003c). Ibises are known for
frequent shifts in roost and colony sites.
The white ibis has been recorded breeding throughout the state of Florida; the center of
breeding abundance occurs in the Everglades, with breeding populations extending into Florida
Bay and the Keys (FWC 2003c). Aerial surveys have revealed 90 percent declines in south
Florida breeding pairs since the 1940s and 20 to 50 percent declines statewide during the past
decade. Because of this, the FWC listed the white ibis as a state listed species of special
concern (FWC 2003c). Population declines of the species are attributed to loss and degradation
of suitable habitat; however, large populations of white ibises remain.
The white ibis is a midsized member of the Family Threskiornithidae. This species is
approximately 22 inches (56 centimeters) long with a wingspan of approximately 37 inches (96
centimeters) (Frederick 1996). Adults are mostly white with black tipped wings, a red face, red
legs, and a very distinct downcurved, pink bill which is used to probe the ground for food while
foraging.

February 2013

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

Life History
The diet of the white ibis primarily consists of crabs, crayfish, fish, snakes, frogs, and insects.
Ibis breed in large colonial groups along the coast and inland between February and October,
with the peak in the spring and summer. Nests are made of sticks, leaves, and roots, and can
be found both on the ground and as high as 50 feet (15.2 meters) up in trees. Females lay
between two and four eggs in one nesting and incubation can last up to 22 days with both
parents sharing incubation responsibility. Between the ages of 9 and 16 days, the young
become more mobile; however, the young generally remain in the nest until they are 28 to 35
days old.

Habitat and Distribution
White ibis prefer coastal marshes and wetlands, feeding in fresh, brackish, and saltwater
environments. They range from Baja California and Sinaloa, Mexico, east through south Texas,
Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, coastal North Carolina, south throughout the Greater Antilles, and
South America to Peru, and French Guiana. This species is found throughout most of Florida.

February 2013

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

Threats:
The main threat to the white ibis is the loss of wetland habitat due to the human development
of coastal areas and their freshwater feeding areas. The alteration of wetlands, pollution, and
saltwater influxes are other habitat threats as these practices degrade the quality of wetlands
and decrease the availability of prey (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001, Bildstein et al. 1990,
Frederick 1987, Adams and Frederick 2009, Herring et al. 2010).

3.8.3.4.5

Snowy Egret, Reddish Egret, Little Blue Heron and Tricolored Heron

The snowy egret, reddish egret, little blue heron and tricolored heron are listed by the FWC as a
species of special concern. Snowy egrets are medium sized herons, with entirely white
plumage, long slender black bills, long black legs and bright yellow feet (Parsons and Masters
2000). The snowy egret breeds in Florida from January through August, breeding mostly in
central and southern Florida in freshwater and saltwater marshes (FWC 2003c). The tricolored
heron occupies similar habitats; breeding occurs in February through August (FWC 2003c). The
tricolored heron is ornately colored; it is slate-blue on its head and upper body and has a
purplish chest with white under parts and fore-neck (Frederick 1997). The little blue heron is a
smaller-sized heron, dark overall with yellow-green legs, and a blue bill with a black tip (Rodgers
and Smith 1995). The little blue heron shows a preference for freshwater habitat; however, it
also inhabits saltwater marshes. Little blue herons breed later than tricolored herons or snowy
egrets; breeding occurs in April through September in Florida. The little blue heron is more
widely distributed throughout the state in comparison to the tricolored herons or snowy egrets.
Like the snowy egret, breeding populations are concentrated in central and southern Florida
(FWC 2003c).
Reddish egrets have two color morphs; white and dark. Dark morphs have gray bodies with
chestnut heads, blue legs and pink bills with black tips (Lowther and Paul 2002). The reddish
egret is the rarest heron in Florida and is entirely restricted to the Florida coast with
concentrations in Florida Bay and the Keys; two-thirds of the state’s breeding population. The
heron forages on shallow flats and sandbars for fish species, including killifish. In Florida Bay,
reddish egrets nest from November through May (FWC 2003c). Population declines of the
species are attributed to loss and degradation of suitable habitat. Target nest numbers for
snowy egrets and tricolored herons combined are 10,000 to 20,000 pairs. Nesting targets for
the snowy egret and tricolored heron have not been met in the WCAs and ENP since the
implementation of IOP in 2002. Nesting effort (number of nests) of these species from 2002 to
2008 is summarized as follows; 2000-2002: 8,614 pairs, 2001-2003: 8,088 pairs, 2002-2004:
8,079, 2003-2005: 4,085 pairs, 2004-2006: 6,410 pairs, 2005-2007: 4,400 pairs, 2006-2008

3,778 pairs(SFWMD 2009b). However, target numbers have not been met prior to the current
operating regime; 1998-2000: 2,788 pairs, 1999-2001 4,270 pairs. Little blue heron censuses
from aerial surveys are unreliable due to its dark plumage and tendency to nest in small,
isolated colonies (FWC 2003c).

3.8.3.4.6

Roseate Spoonbill

Roseate spoonbills have a pink body with a white neck and breast, pink wings with highlights of
red and long reddish legs. Spoonbills have an unfeathered head which can be yellow or green.
Roseate spoonbills are large wading birds, weighing about three pounds and have a 50-inch
wingspan. Characteristic to the species is a long, spatulate bill. The spoonbill feeds by wading
through shallow water, head down, probing the bottom by sweeping its long, spoon-shaped bill
back and forth in the water. When prey is detected by touch, the bill snaps shut; small fish,
crustaceans, and insects make up the bulk of the diet (Dumas 2000). Spoonbills typically
establish nests in Florida Bay between November 1 and December 15, with a mean nest
initiation date of November 18. Females typically lay three eggs; eggs are incubated for about
21 days. After the young spoonbills hatch, chicks require a continuous supply of food for 42
days. Spoonbills primarily feed on wetland fishes. Foraging adult spoonbills require water levels
at or below 13 centimeters within the coastal wetlands to forage efficiently and feed young
(Lorenz et al. 2010). Nestlings fledge in approximately four weeks (FWC 2003c).
Thirty-nine of Florida ay’s keys have been used by roseate spoonbills as nesting colonies.
These colonies have been divided into five distinct nesting regions based on the colonies
primary foraging locations: northeast region, northwest region, central region, south region,
and southwest region. The northeast and northwest colonies contain the largest nesting
colonies and these birds principally use wetlands on the mainland as their primary foraging
grounds (Lorenz et al. 2010). In addition to a large nesting population in Florida Bay, roseate
spoonbills historically nested along the southwest coast of the Everglades in the SRS and
Lostman’s Slough estuaries; !lthough there has been some documentation of spoonbill nesting
in this area, the numbers have been negligible (Lorenz et al. 2009).
The roseate spoonbill is state listed by the FWC as a species of special concern. In 1979, 1,258
roseate spoonbill nests were located in Florida Bay. More than half of these nests (688) were
located in the northeast region (Lorenz et al. 2008). Drops in nests coincide with the completion
of the SDCS in 1982, when water deliveries to Taylor Slough and northeastern Florida Bay
changed dramatically. Since completion of the SDCS, spoonbill nesting effort has shifted to the
northwest region of Florida Bay; nesting effort has been consistent since the early 1980s and
the population remains stable with an average of 1.24 chicks produced per nest, per year

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

(Lorenz et al. 2008). Prior to the construction of the SDCS, spoonbills in the northeast region of
Florida Bay produced an average of 1.38 chicks per nest, per year. Following completion of the
SDCS, spoonbill production dropped to 0.67 chicks per nest, per year (Lorenz et al. 2008).
Wading bird studies suggest that a population that does not produce at least one chick per
nest, on average, will decline.

3.8.3.4.7

Gopher tortoise

The gopher tortoise is a moderate-sized, terrestrial turtle that averages 9-11 inches (23-28
centimeters) long. This species of tortoise has a brown, gray, or tan upper shell (carapace), a
yellow lower shell (plastron), and brown to dark gray skin (Florida Natural Areas Inventory
2001). Gopher tortoises have stumpy, elephant-like hind feet and flattened, shovel-like
forelimbs that are used for digging burrows.

Life History
Gopher tortoises dig deep burrows that average 15 feet long (4.6 meters) and 6.5 feet (two
meters) deep. These burrows provide protection from extreme temperatures, moisture loss,
predators, and serve as refuges for 350-400 other species. Because so many other animals
depend on the burrows (commensals), gopher tortoises are referred to as a keystone species.
Gopher tortoises generally forage within 160 feet (48.8 meters) of their burrows but have been
known to travel greater distances to meet their nutritional needs. Gopher tortoises feed on a
wide variety of plants including broadleaf grasses, wiregrass, grass-like asters, legumes,
blackberries, and the prickly pear cactus.
Gopher tortoises are slow to reach sexual maturity, have low reproductive potential, but they
have a long life span – 60 years or longer. Females reach sexual maturity between 10-20 years
of age. The breeding season is generally between March and October. Females lay five to nine
eggs between May and June. Nests are excavated in areas of abundant sunlight, especially in
the sand mound that is located in front of a burrow. Egg incubation lasts 80 to 90 days in
Florida. Hatchlings are capable of digging their own burrow, but may use other tortoises’
burrows instead (Gopher Tortoise Council 2000).

Habitat and Distribution
Gopher tortoises are found in the southeastern Coastal Plain, from southern South Carolina,
southwest to extreme southeastern Louisiana (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001). In
Florida, tortoises occur in parts of all 67 counties, but prefer high, dry sandy habitats such as
longleaf pine-xeric oak sandhills. They also may be found in scrub, dry hammocks, pine

flatwoods, dry prairies, coastal grasslands and dunes, mixed hardwood-pine communities, and
a variety of disturbed habitats, such as pastures.

Threats:
The primary threat to the gopher tortoise is habitat loss. Habitat alteration, such as
urbanization, generally occurs in the same high, dry habitats that the tortoise prefers. Lack of
appropriate land management (especially controlled burning) has also contributed to
population declines in areas where natural habitat remains. Other threats include road
mortality from vehicles and illegal human predation.

Gopher frog

The gopher frog is a stout-bodied frog that reaches a length of two to four inches (5.1-10.2
centimeters). This species has a cream to brown-colored body with irregular dark spots on its
sides and back, a large head, warty skin, rounded snout, short legs, and a light brown ridge
found behind its eyes (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001).

Life History
The diet of the gopher frog primarily consists of invertebrates and anurans (frogs and toads)
(Godley 1992). The breeding season differs by geographical location, as the North Florida

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

population breeds from February to June and the Central and South Florida population during
the summer. Gopher frogs will travel long distances (up to a mile or more) to breed in
temporary breeding ponds. Females lay eggs in shallow water in a single mass that can contain
3,000 to 7,000 eggs, which attach to vegetation when released. Once hatched, the tadpoles
metamorphose in three to seven months. Gopher frogs usually reach sexual maturity at two
years of age (Godley 1992, Palis 1998).
The call of a gopher frog is a deep guttural snore (the sound is developed in the back of the
mouth) and heavy rains at any season may stimulate choruses, with many of them calling at
once. Sometimes they call from underwater, so as not to attract predators, creating a noise
that is detected only by a hydrophone.

Habitat and Distribution
The gopher frog inhabits longleaf pine, xeric oak, and sandhills mostly, but also occurs in upland
pine forest, scrub, xeric hammock, mesic and scrubby flatwoods, dry prairie, mixed hardwoodpine communities, and a variety of disturbed habitats (Enge 1997). This species inhabits gopher
tortoise burrows, which is how its name originated. Gopher frogs can be found throughout
Florida (Map Data from: FNAI, museums, and gopher frog literature).

Threats:
The main threat to the gopher frog is the destruction of its habitat, especially breeding ponds.
Exclusion and suppression of fire from wetlands often leads to degradation of breeding ponds
through shrub encroachment, peat buildup, and increased evapotranspiration (evaporation of

surface water and release of water vapor) from plants shortening the hydroperiods (LaClaire
2001). Coverage of grassy emergent vegetation decreases and peat buildup may acidify the
water past tolerance levels of the gopher frog (Smith and Braswell 1994). Another threat to
gopher frog populations is the introduction of game and predaceous fish into formerly fish-free
wetlands during natural flooding events. The introduction of these fish causes increased
predation of the gopher frog’s eggs and tadpoles; The gopher frog also faces threats of disease,
such as contraction of the Anuraperkinsus mesomycetozoan (yeast-like) pathogen - an
infectious parasite.

3.8.3.4.9

Burrowing owl

The diet of the burrowing owl primarily consists of insects; however, they will also feed on
snakes, frogs, small lizards, birds, and rodents. Nesting season occurs between October and
May, with March being the primary time for laying eggs. Nesting occurs in burrows in the
ground that they dig. These burrows will be maintained and used again the following year
(Haug et al. 1993). Females lay up to eight eggs within a one-week period, and they will
incubate the eggs for up to 28 days. Once the white-feathered juveniles are born, it takes two
weeks before they are ready and able to appear out of the burrow. Juveniles will begin learning
how to fly at four weeks, but will not be able to fly well until they are six weeks old. Juveniles
will stay with the parents until they are able to self-sustain at 12 weeks old. Burrowing owls are
different than other owls as they are active during the day time (diurnal) rather than at night
(nocturnal) during breeding season. During the non-breeding season, they become more
nocturnal.

Habitat and Distribution
Burrowing owls inhabit open prairies in Florida that have very little understory (floor)
vegetation. These areas include golf courses, airports, pastures, agriculture fields, and vacant
lots. The drainage of wetlands, although detrimental to many organisms, increases the areas of
habitat for the burrowing owl. The range of the burrowing owl is throughout the peninsular of
Florida in patches and localized areas. Burrowing owls can also be found in the Bahamas
(Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001).

Threats:
The burrowing owl faces many threats to its population. The main threat is the continued loss
of habitat. Threats to habitat include construction activities development and harassment by
humans and domesticated animals. Heavy floods can destroy burrows in the ground, which can
cause the destruction of eggs and young. Other threats include increased predation by ground
and aerial predators in the burrowing owl’s habitat, and vehicle strikes.

MIGRATORY BIRDS

The A-1 project site supports migratory birds. Migratory birds are of great ecological and
economic value to this country and to other countries. They contribute to biological diversity
and bring tremendous enjoyment to millions of Americans who study, watch, feed, or hunt
these birds throughout the United States and other countries. The United States has recognized
the critical importance of this shared resource by ratifying international, bilateral conventions
for the conservation of migratory birds. These migratory bird conventions impose substantive
obligations on the United States for the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats, and
through the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Act), the United States has implemented these
migratory bird conventions with respect to the United States. Executive Order 13186 of January
10, 2001 directs executive departments and agencies to take certain actions to further
implement the Act. As stated in Executive Order 13186, each agency shall, to the extent
permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations and within budgetary limits,
(1) support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions and avoid or minimize
impacts on migratory bird resources, (2) restore and enhance the habitat of migratory birds, as

practicable, (3) prevent or abate the pollution or detrimental alteration of the environment for
the benefit of migratory birds, as practicable, (4) design migratory bird habitat and population
conservation principles, measures, and practices into agency plans and planning processes as
practicable and coordinate with other agencies and nonfederal partners, (5) ensure that agency
plans and actions promote programs of comprehensive migratory bird planning efforts, (6)
ensure environmental analysis of Federal Actions required by NEPA evaluate the effects of
actions on migratory birds with emphasis on species of special concern, (7) provide notice to
the USFWS in advance of conducting an action that is intended to take migratory birds, (8)
minimize the intentional take of species of concern, and (9) identify where unintentional take
reasonable attributable to agency actions is having or is likely to have a measurable negative
effect on migratory bird populations. For a complete list of the requirements in the Executive
Order, please refer to the Presidentail Documents, Federal Register, Volume 66, Number 11
dated January 17, 2001 Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds.

3.9

CULTURAL, HISTORIC AND ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

The A-1 project site has been the subject of multiple cultural resource investigations to
determine the presence of cultural, historical and archeological resources. In 2006, the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) reaffirmed the findings from the December 2002
determination that no historic or cultural resource sites eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historical Places (NRHP) were encountered on the A-1 project site and due to the
site being heavily impacted by sugar cane and sod cultivation practices, no additional cultural
resource investigations are necessary.
Most recently, the State Bureau of Archaeological Research (BAR) on behalf of the SFWMD and
the USACE, conducted a Phase I archaeological survey of 16,593 acres of the EAA A-1 project
area in July 2012, as part of the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP). This survey was
intended to locate, identify, delineate, and evaluate cultural resources in advance of proposed
landscape modification. The survey recommended no further archaeological work at the A-1
property at this time. (A Cultural Resource Assessment Survey of the EAA A-1 Property, Palm
Beach County, Florida, Bureau of Archeological Research, Division of Historical Resources,
Department of State, State of Florida, September 2012).
The EAA A-1 survey was undertaken to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) and Section 267 of the Florida Statutes. Section 106 of NHPA of 1966
(PL89-665, as amended) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects upon historic
properties of projects involving federal funding, federal permitting, or occurring on federal
lands. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 36, Chapter VIII, Part 800 (36 CFR 800)
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

3-68

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

contains the guidelines for fulfilling the provisions of Section 106. The study evaluated all
potential cultural resources in the project area for eligibility for the NHRP. Cultural resources
include archaeological, architectural, and historical sites and objects. Similarly, Section 267 of
the Florida Statutes requires that “each state agency of the executive branch having direct or
indirect jurisdiction over a proposed state or state-assisted undertaking shall, in accordance
with state policy and prior to the approval of expenditure of any state funds on the
undertaking, consider the effect of the undertaking on any historic property that is included in,
or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places”;
The July 2012 BAR cultural resource assessment survey of the EAA A-1 project area found no
cultural resources that they believed to be eligible for listing in the NHRP. Investigations
included both archival research and fieldwork and were designed to determine the presence of
cultural resources. A search of archives in the Florida Master Site File (FMSF) revealed that
there were no known archaeological sites or historic resources within the project area.
Fieldwork consisted of pedestrian walk-over survey with concurrent ground inspection and
shovel testing to detect possible subsurface archaeological resources. The field methodology
was tailored to the area’s unique environmental conditions; !s with other survey
methodologies in the EAA (Carr 1974; Carr et al. 1996; Carr et al. 2000; Marks and Arbuthnot
2008; Smith 2007), investigations were focused on potential tree island locations (extinct or
extant) and other landscape anomalies identified in modern and historic aerial imagery. Field
crews found no cultural materials greater than 50 years old in any of the shovel test pits. The
remains of the Talisman Sugar Mill (8PB15974), an agricultural facility that was constructed in
1962 and demolished in the late 1990s, were recorded.
The BAR concluded and the USACE agrees that the lack of significant (i.e. NRHP eligible) cultural
resources in the EAA A-1 project area is likely because the inhospitable pre-drainage
environment limited opportunities for extensive human settlement. Before drainage, the A-1
project site was in the Sawgrass Plains, a sparsely inhabited landscape that was covered in
sawgrass and typically submerged under 1.5 ft of water (McVoy et al. 2011). Additionally, any
archaeological sites which may have been present, may have been destroyed through the
decades of drainage and agriculture work that resulted in severe demucking. Some areas also
likely lost soil due to oxidation and burning of dry muck due to over-drainage (FWCC 2002:10–
11).

3.10 TRIBAL RIGHTS
3.10.1

OVERVIEW OF SEMINOLE TRIBE WATER SUPPLY SOURCES

The Seminole Tribe of Florida (Seminole Tribe) has surface water entitlement rights pursuant to
the 1987 Water Rights Compact (Compact) between the Seminole Tribe, the State of Florida,
and the SFWMD (Pub. L. No. 100-228, 101 Stat. 1566 and Chapter 87-292 Laws of Florida as
codified in Section 285.165, F.S.) The Compact contains a series of provisions regarding
establishment of Tribal water rights. Specifically, several "entitlements" to surface water were
created. Additional documents addressing the Water Rights Compact entitlement provisions
have since been executed. These documents include Agreements between the Seminole Tribe
and the SFWMD and a SFWMD Final Order.
According to the Compact, the surface water entitlement for the Big Cypress Reservation is
based on the percentage of water available within the South Hendry County / L-28 Gap Water
Use Basin as the lands of the Big Cypress Reservation are proportional to the total land acreage
within the identified basin. The specific volume of water associated with this entitlement was
quantified in the 1996 Compact Agreement [1996 Agreement (Appendix O)] between the
SFWMD and Seminole Tribe. The 1996 Agreement was precipitated by SFWMD implementation
of the Everglades Construction Project (ECP), as required by Section 373.4592, Florida Statutes.
Implementation of the ECP diverted surface water from the C-139 Basin and C-139 Basin Annex
for treatment, thereby removing a portion of the Seminole Tribe's Big Cypress Reservation
surface water entitlement from direct availability for Tribal use. The SFWMD agreed in the 1996
Agreement to first quantify this entitlement volume and protect the Compact right by providing
replacement water supplies, as a secondary source, to offset the partial diversion of the
entitlement amount. A study was conducted and, with the Seminole Tribe’s concurrence,
quantified the Seminole Tribe's entitlement at 47,000 acre-feet per year to be distributed to the
Reservation in 12 equal monthly amounts of 3,917 acre-feet. The entitlement right is to be
perfected through the annual work plan process. Further, this entitlement volume is to be
delivered primarily from the original entitlement source, the North and West Feeder Canals.
Only when these volumes are insufficient, reliance on the secondary supply source, the G-409,
is appropriate. To accomplish this delivery hierarchy, as well as to appropriately deliver water
to the Big Cypress Reservation, an operational plan was developed and has been consistently
implemented since 2003.

EXISTING WATER FLOW

Water supply deliveries to the Big Cypress Reservation are made from the North and West
Feeder Canal systems via the G-409 pump station located just west of the northwest corner of
WCA 3A. Sources of water for this pump station include Lake Okeechobee (delivered via the G­
404 pump station), STA 3/4, STA-5, STA-6, Rotenberger and Holey Land WMAs, EAA Runoff, and
WCA 3A. Supplemental flows to the Big Cypress Reservation, when demand is not met by the
primary supply, are provided from the Miami Canal via G404 and G409. Existing conditions for
flows into STA Flow-ways 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 6-1, and 6-2 are provided from the C139 and C139
Annex Basins. The inflows are currently distributed into the STAs via the L-2/L-3 canal system by
impounding water at G-407 in the vicinity of confusion corner (Figure 3-23). Inflows into the
STAs are treated before discharge into the STA-5/6 discharge canals. The treated flows are
directed to the WCA 3A via the L- 4 and Miami Canals. Any flow that cannot be accommodated
in the STAs is diverted through G406/G407 into the L-4, similar to past operations.

3.10.3

WCA 3A TRIBAL RIGHTS

The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida (Miccosukee Tribe) holds a perpetual leasehold to an
189,000-acre tract of land within the northwest portion of WCA 3A (Figure 3-24). The purpose
of the lease is to (1) preserve the Leased Area in its natural state for the use and enjoyment of
the Miccosukee Tribe and the general public, (2) to preserve fresh water aquatic wildlife, their
habitat, and (3) to assure proper management of water resources. The Miccosukee Tribe is
allowed to use this land for the purposes of hunting, fishing, frogging, subsistence agriculture,
and other activities that are dependent on wet conditions.
The Seminole Tribe also has rights to lands within WCA 3A. In 1989, 14,720 acres in WCA 3A
were purchased from the Seminole Tribe with funds from the SFWMD and the Conservation
and Recreational Lands (CARL) Program. This tract was added as an amendment to the
Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area lease, which names the FWCC as a lead managing
agency. The compact recognized the special status of the Seminole Tribe by acknowledging
rights and obligations substantially different from those of other Floridian citizens. The
Seminole Tribe has retained non-exclusive rights to utilize the 14,720 acres of land in WCA 3A
to hunt, trap, fish and frog. The Seminole Tribe also has full rights of access to the lands in WCA
3A. This amendment has a perpetual flowage easement granted to the SFWMD for the flowage
and storage of water.
Public Law 93-440 provides that members of the Miccosukee Tribe and the Seminole Tribe shall
be permitted, subject to reasonable regulations established by the Secretary, to continue their

3.11 RECREATIONAL RESOURCES
Recreational opportunities are based on a variety of resources, including the waterbodies
within the area and several extensive tracts of publicly owned lands. The recreational lands are
primarily the existing STAs, which are managed by SFWMD for water quality purposes, or
Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), which are managed by FWCC for public use (primarily
hunting and fishing). FWCC also manages hunting within the STAs with a cooperative
agreement with SFWMD. The STAs are highly managed and as such public access is limited with
no motorized uses allowed within the STAs. Public access, including a variety of motorized uses
is permitted in the WMA areas. Due to consistent water levels and managed vegetation, the
STAs are abundant in wildlife and are highly desired hunting destinations. The many levees

Affected Environment

within the STAs allow hiking, biking and limited vehicle access whereas the WMAs are vast
without internal levees and are accessed with airboats and tracked vehicles. Overall the STAs
and WMAs offer the public a variety of recreational activities that can include hunting, fishing,
camping, wildlife observation, interpretation, hiking, bicycling, canoeing, and air boating. The
recreational areas within the study area are discussed below.

3.11.1

PROJECT SITE

Currently the project site does not offer any recreational use as it is not open to the public.

3.11.2

STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS 2 AND 3/4

Hunting is permitted in STA 2 and STA 3/4 and bird watching is allowed in STA 3/4. Recreational
plans developed for the STAs ensure that permitted recreational uses are consistent with the
primary STA goal of improving water quality.
The STA 3/4 recreational facility, known as the Harold A. Campbell Public Use Area, is located
within the footprint of STA 3/4, between the Griffin Rock Pits and Cell 2B. The location of the
public use area minimizes public access past the ST!’s water control structures and data
equipment. The Harold A. Campbell Public Use Area includes a vehicle barrier gate, road
improvements, a boat ramp, asphalt parking area, an information kiosk (sheltered),
landscaping, a multi-purpose bridge, and a composting toilet. The public has access to a 4-mile
loop trail during daylight hours on designated days. The boat ramp allows 7-day access during
daylight hours to the external canals of STA 3/4 and those canals along the south side of the L-5
levee for a total of 27 miles of fishable canals. FWCC manages waterfowl and alligator hunting
in STA 3/4 and STA 2. STA 2 provides access from US Highway 27 through to the WCA 2 and
allows fishing along this route. A boat ramp and parking area are located on the east at the
shared boundary of the WCA 2 for access into the L-6 Canal.

3.11.3

WATER CONSERVATION AREAS 2A AND 3A

The Everglades-Francis S. Taylor WMA includes WCAs 2A, 2B, and 3A and is located
immediately southeast and south of the EAA. The Everglades-Francis S. Taylor WMA is
separated from adjacent areas by water control levees and canals, and its hydrology is highly
managed. Its 671,831 acres of primarily Everglades marsh buffers ENP and Big Cypress National
Preserve from agriculture in the EAA. The main recreational activities within the WMA include
hunting, fishing, frogging and air-boating in the interior areas. The levees and canals also
provide opportunities for fishing, frogging, hiking, biking, and wildlife viewing. Common access
to the western area of WCA 2A and the L-6 Canal between the S6 and S7 pump stations is

rights to land within WCA 3A. The Tribes have rights to use this land for the purposes of
hunting, fishing, frogging, subsistence agriculture, and other activities.

3.11.4

HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA

Currently, state agencies (FWCC, SFWMD, and FDEP) are developing an updated management
plan to address goals and objectives for restoration of the Holey Land. Recreation includes
hunting, fishing, camping, frogging, hiking, and biking. The Holey Land Restoration project that
began in 1991 increased the hydroperiod in this WMA. In response, the primary recreational
use in the Holey Land changed from hunting deer and feral hog to fishing in perimeter canals
and hunting waterfowl (USACE and SFWMD 2006).

3.12 AESTHETICS
The A-1 project site is composed of lands that were historically used for sugar cane farming,
with the occasional rotational crop of rice or corn. The site is currently vacant and fallow; the
majority of the project lands were formerly part of the EAA A-1 Reservoir project, which was
partially constructed before construction was halted due to budgetary and other issues.
Construction was halted in 2006 and much of the land has reverted to natural wetland
characteristics since that time.
The visual landscape of the STAs and WCAs is overwhelmingly flat. Landscape features include
typical canals, levees and prairie wetland communities. The STAs and WCAs offer opportunities
for observation of migratory game birds during winter months. Although some of the
marshlands have been degraded in visual quality by over-flooding and loss of tree islands, other
areas, such as the south-central region of WCA 3A, still preserve good examples of original,
undisturbed Everglades’ communities, with a mosaic of tree islands, wet prairies, sawgrass
expanses, and deeper sloughs. From the elevated viewpoint of the Eastern Perimeter Levee
system, the view westward to the marshes is panoramic, though mostly homogenous.

3.13 FLOOD PROTECTION
Runoff from the EAA is collected and routed to the WCAs for flood control (SFWMD 2004). The
flood storage capacity of the WCAs is essential to flood control in the EAA.

3.14 HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE
Although the project site is no longer in active agriculture use, the past farming activities could
have resulted in contamination on the site. Phase I and Phase II environmental site
assessments (ESAs) provide a comprehensive overview of the properties and identify point
sources including chemical storage and mixing areas, agrochemical and petroleum storage
tanks, refueling and maintenance areas, and residual agrochemicals and soil addenda in
cultivated areas.
The Phase I and Phase II ESAs identified three tracts of land with potential to contain hazardous
and/or toxic waste (Figure 3-25). These tracts are:


Woerner Farm 3 – Tract No. 100-0039
Talisman South Ranch Eastern 1/3rd – Tract #100-104
Cabassa Farm – Tract #100-105

Woerner Farm 3- Tract # 100-0039
The Woerner Farm 3 property, which is located north of the A-1 project site consists of
approximately 1,000 acres of land, which was utilized as a sod farm from 1981 until 1996 when
sugarcane was added. The following assessments and investigations were conducted for the
Woerner Farm 3:




A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment - November 1994 and January 1998
Phase II ESA investigation - February 1999
Supplemental investigations – February 2000 and March 2001

Three areas of concern were identified which required additional assessments and/or
corrective actions (Figure 3-26). In 2005, over 1,880 tons of toxaphene impacted soils were
excavated from the cultivated area. A limited soil excavation of pesticide and petroleum
impacted soils was conducted at the former shed on the Woerner tract. In addition 130 tons of
petroleum impacted soils were excavated from the main pump station. An Environmental Risk
Assessment (ERA) was formulated and site specific cleanup target goal of 5.2 mg/kg was
proposed for toxaphene. The ERA was reviewed by the USFWS and recommendations were
made to the SFWMD to (1) scrape the entire Woerner property and dispose of soil, (2) move
the north border of the reservoir south, off of the Woerner property, and (3) conduct additional
sampling. Based on these options, the SFWMD has avoided the subject area of concern. The
Woerner Farm 3 site was resampled in 2012 to determine the levels of toxaphene. Four out of

the five samples exhibited an average of 60-70% degradation in toxaphene concentrations since

Talisman South Ranch 1/3rd –Tract #100-104
In March 1996, a Phase I and Phase II ESAs were conducted for the eastern one third portion of
the Talisman South Ranch (approximately 7,000 acres). The assessment focused on the
Talisman sugar mill and surrounding areas. In November 1998, a Phase II ESAs was conducted
to determine the status of potential constituents of concern (COC) at each of the areas of
concern identified in Phase I.

Affected Environment

Based on the Phase I and Phase II ESAs, 11 areas of COC were detected in soil, groundwater,
sediment, or surface water at concentrations exceeding regulatory cleanup target levels or
guidance concentrations. Transference of ownership of each of the Exclusion Areas was
deferred until a Site Rehabilitation Completion Order (SRCO) for each Exclusion Area was issued
by the Florida Departmetn of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The list of Exclusion Areas
included:







Five pump stations
Two pesticide mix load areas
A former labor camp and crop-duster landing strip
A former borrow pit/agricultural landfill
The former sugar processing mill
The surface water management areas adjacent to the sugar mill

These areas were primarily impacted with organochlorine pesticides (e.g.,
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), petroleum products, and arsenic). An assessment and
remediation on all of the Exclusion Areas on behalf of Talisman Sugar Corp. and the St. Joe
Company was performed. The cleanup objectives for each Exclusion Area within the proposed
project footprint were based on the proposed end land use for water storage areas. As such,
cleanup target levels were chosen to be protective of potential ecological receptors which are
likely to inhabit the area once a project is constructed. For protection of wildlife, the clean up
target levels for most of the chemicals found on the Talisman property are more stringent than
the cleanup standards for human health. Therefore, a cleanup to ecological standards is also
inherently protective of agricultural workers during the interim period prior to construction as
well as construction workers.
FDEP issued SRCOs for the majority of the Exclusion Areas. These parcels can be conveyed
immediately with no restrictions. On the remaining parcels, the remediation work has been
completed to the satisfaction of the FDEP; the FDEP has issued memoranda of technical
concurrence. However, a deed restriction was necessary in order to convey the property to
SFWMD.
The cleanup of the mill site involved assessment and remediation of a number of point source
discharge areas. Areas of concern at the mill site included numerous leaking petroleum storage
tanks, pesticide and/or arsenic impacted soils in the sediments of two drainage canals, an ash
pit, and a water storage retention area, and metals-impacted soils adjacent to several building
slabs.

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

In general, the petroleum impacted areas were handled through excavation and on-site
treatment of soils in ex-situ bioremediation piles. Once the treatment was verified by
confirmation sampling, the treated soils were returned to their respective excavations.
Approximately 16,000 cubic yards of petroleum impacted soil was excavated, treated and
backfilled.
The canals and surface depressions at the mill were covered with a two foot layer of clean soil.
The cover is intended to prevent exposure of potential receptor species to these sediments.
Pesticide and arsenic impacted soil was also excavated from other areas of concern at the mill
site and consolidated in the ash pit. The ash pit was a low lying excavated area that accepted
effluent from the boilers. The ash in the pit was lightly impacted with heavy metals and
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Additional soils from other areas of concern were
also filled into the pit and the ash pit was covered with two feet of clean soil to prevent future
exposure.
These three areas within the mill site where contaminated soils have been left and capped will
also require restrictions on excavation activities. These parcels are identified as the South Rock
Canal, the Ash Pit, and the Waste Lake Discharge Ditch. An additional area of capped, impacted
soil is present approximately three miles west of the mill at the former borrow pit/agricultural
landfill. These areas contain pesticide, PAH, and metal impacted soils which are buried beneath
a clean soil cover. The excavation restrictions are necessary to prevent disturbance of these
areas. These areas have been surveyed by a professional land surveyor and the coordinates
have been provided to SFWMD to ensure that no disturbance of these areas occurs.
In summary, all of the physical assessment and remediation intended by SFWMD has been
completed on all of the Exclusion Area parcels and all of the technical documents relating to the
cleanup have been reviewed and accepted by FDEP. A remaining outstanding activity is to
record the appropriate deed restrictions on a few of the parcels. Once this activity is
completed, it is expected that the FDEP will issue SRO’s on the remaining parcels and all of the
parcels can be conveyed to SFWMD. No additional assessment, corrective actions, or closures
are required on this property.
Cabassa Farm –tract #100-105
The Cabassa Farm property consists of approximately 9,700 acres. This property was
historically used for the cultivation of sugarcane while the far southeast portion used for rice
cultivation. A Phase I and Phase II ESAs were conducted in February and March 1999,
respectively. The Phase I and Phase II ESAs identified four areas of concern that required
additional assessment and/or corrective actions. A Contamination Ecological Risk Assessment

and Corrective Action Plan were prepared in January 2002 for this property. Four hundred and
fourteen tons of arsenic and copper impacted soil from the maintenance area and extensive
soil sampling were conducted in the cultivated crop area using USFWS and SFWMD sampling
protocol. Results of the updated ERA concluded that the residual concentrations of pesticides,
copper, and zinc were not a threat to representative fish and wildlife species. USFWS and FDEP
concurred with SFWMD’s recommendation for No further !ction (NF!) for the equipment
maintenance area, cane loading/equipment staging area and the cultivated crop area. In 2003,
assessments, corrective actions, and closure activities associated with the pump stations were
conducted and received NFAs from FDEP for each of the pump stations. No additional
assessment, corrective actions, or closures are required on this property.

3.15 CLIMATE
The subtropical climate of South Florida, with its distinct wet and dry seasons, high rate of
evapotranspiration, and climatic extremes of floods, droughts, and hurricanes, represents a
major physical driving force that sustains the Everglades while creating water supply and flood
control issues in the agricultural and urban segments.
Seasonal rainfall patterns in South Florida resemble the wet and dry season patterns of the
humid tropics more than the winter and summer patterns of temperate latitudes. Of the 53
inches of rain that South Florida receives on average annually, 75 percent falls during the wet
season months of May through October. During the wet season, thunderstorms that result
from easterly trade winds and land-sea convection patterns occur almost daily. Wet season
rainfall follows a bimodal pattern with peaks during May through June and September through
October. Tropical storms and hurricanes also provide major contributions to wet season rainfall
with a high level of interannual variability and low level of predictability. During the dry season
(November through April), rainfall is governed by large-scale winter weather fronts that pass
through the region approximately weekly. However, due to the variability of climate patterns
(La Nina and El Nino), dry periods may occur during the wet season and wet periods may occur
during the dry season. High evapotranspiration rates in South Florida roughly equal annual
precipitation. Recorded annual rainfall in South Florida has varied from 37 to 106 inches, and
interannual extremes in rainfall result in frequent years of flood and drought.
Greenhouse gasses produced on the project site as a result of past rock mining and agriculture
are primarily carbon dioxide, while other gasses include methane, nitorous oxide, and
chloroflourocarbons; !ccording to EP!’s 2009 Inventory of U;S; Greenhouse Gas Emissions and
Sinks: 1990-2007, “Executive Summary,” “the primary greenhouse gas emitted by human
activities in the United States was CO2 [carbon dioxide], representing approximately 85.4

percent of total greenhouse gas emissions” (EP! 2009); The carbon dioxide produced on the !­
1 project site is prodiced from onsite hauling, offsite hauling by truck and rail, and rock quarry
equipment.

3.16 COST
The SFWMD has incurred costs with the previous construction from the EAA A-1 Reservoir.
These are defined as sunk costs (costs already incurred) for the land and initial earthwork that
was conducted and is currently $180,000. The SFWMD also conducts routine vegetative
maintenance and maintains measures that prohibit public access on the site.

3.17 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Under Executive Order 12898, Federal agencies are responsible for identifying and addressing
potential disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on
minority and low-income populations. Minority persons are those who identify themselves as
Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or multiracial (with at least one race designated as a
minority race under Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidelines (CEQ 1997). Persons
whose income is below the Federal poverty threshold are designated as low income.
Disproportionately high and adverse human health effects occur when the risk or rate of
exposure to an environmental hazard for a minority or low-income population is significant (as
defined by the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA]) and appreciably exceeds the risk or
exposure rate for the general population or for another appropriate comparison group (CEQ
1997). A disproportionately high environmental impact that is significant (as defined by NEPA)
refers to an impact or risk of an impact on the natural or physical environment in a low-income
or minority community that appreciably exceeds the environmental impact on the larger
community. Such effects may include ecological, cultural, human health, economic, or social
impacts. An adverse environmental impact is an impact that is determined to be both harmful
and significant (as defined by NEPA).
For the environmental justice analysis for this EIS, the project area was examined. The project
area is composed of the EAA, which is composed mainly of agricultural lands.

3.18 NATURAL OR DEPLEATABLE RESOURCES
The A-1 project site has been previously utilized for sugar cane and sod farming, but currently

throughout the site including agricultural ditches and degraded roads. As a result of permitted
construction activities to construction the A-1 Reservoir, the SFWMD has excavated rock
material on the project site. Limestone, composed of the mineral calcite, is the primary rock
formation which is appropriate for use in building materials and as aggregate for road beds.

INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides a discussion of the potential environmental effects, which can be either
positive or negative, that could result from implementation of the Alternatives. A detailed
description of the alternatives is provided in Chapter 2. The evaluation of the effects was based
on results of modeling simulations (as described below), current information including scientific
literature, direct observation, project design reports, reasonable scientific judgment, the
scoping process, and other environmental impact statement (EIS) documents for similar
projects. The No Action Alternative considers the environmental conditions in the affected
regions without the Proposed Action. However, the modeling analysis does include other
planned restoration projects anticipated to be fully or partially in operation by 2015-2020 [C-43
West Reservoir, C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area (STA), Site 1 Impoundment,
Broward Water Preserve Area (C-11 and C-9 Impoundments), C-111 Spreader Canal project, and
the Loxahatchee River Watershed Restoration Plan].

MODELING EFFORTS

The objective of the modeling efforts was to evaluate the effects on hydrology, water quality,
and the downstream environment. The results of the modeling efforts that describe the overall
water management is described in Section 4.5.1, surface water ponding and hydroperiod in
Section 4.5.2, groundwater in Section 4.5.3, and water quality in Section 4.6.
Three modeling efforts were integrated into this EIS: 1) the South Florida Water Management
Model [SFWMM or 2x2 (SFWMD, 2005)]; 2) the Dynamic Model for Stormwater Treatment

Areas (DMSTA) Version 2 (Walker and Kadlec, 2005); and 3) the Regional Simulation Model
(RSM) (SFWMD, 2005). See Figure 4-1 for the approximate spatial extent of each of the three
models used in this EIS. The modeling reports for the SFWMM, DMSTA and RSM describe the
modeling methods in detail. Appendix E presents the results of model simulations, and
performance measure graphics for the alternatives. These three models represent the best
available tools for simulating hydrology and water quality. Each model has been developed
specifically for the Everglades region, and has been developed and refined over a period of
several years.
Figure 4-1 Approximate Model Domains

4.2.1 SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT MODEL
The SFWMM (or 2x2) is a regional, hydrologic computer model specifically developed and
applied to simulate the unique hydrology of the south Florida system and its regional
management. Use of the SFWMM in this EIS involved application of the model to estimate the
volume and timing of surface water flows discharged from source basins contributing inflows to
existing STAs and proposed project features associated with the alternatives described below,
with eventual discharge into the Everglades Protection Area (EPA).
The SFWMM is a coupled surface water-groundwater model which incorporates overland flow,
canal routing, unsaturated zone accounting and two-dimensional single layer aquifer flow. The

model simulates the major components of the hydrologic cycle in south Florida including
rainfall, evapotranspiration, infiltration, overland and groundwater flow, canal flow, canal
groundwater seepage, levee seepage and groundwater pumping. The model has been
exclusively developed for the south Florida region and has been calibrated and verified using
water level and discharge measurements at hundreds of locations distributed throughout the
region within the model boundaries. In addition to simulating the natural hydrology in south
Florida, the model also simulates the management processes that satisfy policy-based rules to
meet flood control, water supply and environmental needs. It can incorporate current or
proposed water management control structures and current or proposed operational rules. The
SFWMM simulates hydrology on a daily basis using climatic data for the 1965-2005 period of
record which includes many droughts and wet periods.
The SFWMM simulation RS_BASE2 used in this EIS provided the modeled hydrologic estimates
for inclusion in the DMSTA water quality modeling effort described below. The intent of the
SFWMM simulation RS_BASE2 is to represent a projection of the south Florida system
hydrology as it would be in the future condition (circa 2015-2020). This projection is dependent
on several assumptions, including anticipated completion of current and planned projects,
system operating protocols and projections of future consumptive use and environmental
demands. Although the entire south Florida regional system is modeled by the SFWMM, the
modeling results for this EIS focused on the basin hydrology in and in the vicinity of the
Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) specifically related to basins that contribute flow to
Everglades STAs that discharge into the EPA. The period of simulation (or period of record) of
RS_BASE2 is January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2005. For the purposes of this EIS, SFWMM
simulation RS_BASE2 provides hydrologic estimates of the areas identified in Figure 4-1. A
detailed description of the south Florida system-wide assumptions and projects that were
incorporated into the RS_BASE2 scenario is provided in the Model Documentation Report
provided in detail in Appendix D.
For each basin, daily flow time series were provided from the SFWMM output. These daily flow
time series provide the basis for the generation of inputs to the DMSTA model. The SFWMM
daily flows were post-processed using methods that are consistent with previous DMSTA
modeling efforts (Gary Goforth, Inc., 2009). Essentially, SFWMM post-processing requires the
merging of historical phosphorus concentration data from contributing source basins with the
SFWMM daily flows to generate inflow datasets for DMSTA. During this process, some aspects
of the SFWMM-estimated hydrology are recalculated or rescaled to more closely approximate
observed historical data. Specific post-processing details are provided in the Model
Documentation Report provided in Appendix D.

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

For this EIS, the inflow datasets for DMSTA that were prepared by post-processing SFWMM
daily flows were utilized for all EIS alternatives. Any changes as a result of alternative project
features and their operations were formulated and evaluated as part of the DMSTA water
quality modeling effort. To be clear, SFWMM was not utilized to formulate or evaluate
alternatives; this was accomplished by the DMSTA and RSM modeling efforts described below.
As a planning tool, the SFWMM was applied to estimate regional-scale hydrologic responses to
proposed modifications to the water management system in South Florida. Results from the
regional scale investigation was then used for more detailed modeling and investigation at a
sub-regional scale, which in turn provided the bases for detailed design of specific alternatives.
Therefore, SFWMM results are equivalent for all EIS alternatives.

4.2.2 DYNAMIC MODEL FOR STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS
The DMSTA was used to simulate EAA runoff surface water routing, and estimate the
phosphorus removal performance of the STAs and Flow Equalization Basins (FEBs) in the
alternatives. DMSTA was developed for the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (Walker and Kadlec, 2005;
http://wwwalker.net/dmsta/). DMSTA was developed and calibrated to information specific to
south Florida and to predict phosphorus removal performance of Everglades STAs and storage
reservoirs, and has been commonly used since 2001 by state and federal agencies for STA
design and evaluation. The 2005 version of DMSTA was calibrated to data from 35 fully
functional STA treatment cells with vegetation communities of various types. The model
provides detailed output on the water and phosphorus balances of individual treatment cells
and entire STAs, regional networks of STAs and storage reservoirs.
Model input requirements include daily values for flow, phosphorus concentration, rainfall,
evapotranspiration (ET), depth (optional input or simulated value) and releases (optional input
or simulated), treatment area configuration, cell size, flow path width, vegetation type,
estimates of hydraulic mixing, outflow hydraulics, and seepage estimates. Phosphorus removal
rates (settling rates) and other phosphorus cycling parameters can be either user-defined or
calculated within DMSTA based on calibration data sets. DMSTA assumes that specified
vegetation types (emergent, submerged, periphyton) will be maintained over the 40-year
hydrologic period used as a basis for design, with some allowance for down time required for
maintenance.
Some level of forecast error may result when applying any model, reflecting the limitations of
the calibration datasets (data range, measurement error, short duration, etc.). One limitation
of DMSTA is that the model may not reproduce phosphorus loading spikes observed in some
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

4-4

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

STA cells following periods of extended dry-out. Careful management of treatment cell water
measures and operating the STA in conjunction with an FEB may be two options to minimize
the frequency and duration of such conditions. DMSTA may forecast outflow concentrations
below values observed in the field following extreme drought conditions if management
measures are unsuccessful at maintaining sufficient water levels.
To account for this
uncertainty, annual values less than 12 parts per billion (ppb) simulated by DMSTA were
replaced with a value of 12 ppb in both this EIS and the Restoration Strategies Regional Water
Quality Plan.
DMSTA is the best available tool for simulating phosphorus removal performance of existing or
planned storage reservoirs and STAs. DMSTA is configured to allow integration with the

interface and relatively limited input data requirements allow the development and evaluation
of various alternatives (Walker and Kadlec, 2011). For this EIS, DMSTA results are summarized
for the water years (Water Years 1965 ̌ 2005 or May 1, 1965 ̌ April 30, 2005) that are
contained with the SFWMM period simulation (January 1, 1965 ̌ December 31, 2005).
DMSTA Results
The phosphorus removal performance of Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 was projected using
DMSTA. DMSTA provides simulated inflow and outflow volumes, and total phosphorus
concentrations and loads for the FEBs and STAs. DMSTA also provides water depths within the
project area and the FEBs and STAs. These results were used, in part, to determine effects on
water resources, vegetation, fish and wildlife, and threatened and endangered species in the
project site, and in STA 2, and STA 3/4. However, DMSTA results alone are not appropriate for
evaluating environmental effects within Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A, WCA 3A and Holey
Land Wildlife Management Area (Holey Land). Therefore, DMSTA-simulated daily flows were
provided as boundary flows to Glades and Lower East Coast Service Area (LECSA) RSM for
further analysis in order to understand effects of the alternatives on areas downstream of the
STAs. In some areas, DMSTA flows were combined with SFWMM flows (not simulated within
DMSTA) and provided as input to the Glades LECSA RSM. See the DMSTA modeling report
provided in Appendix E for more information.

4.2.3 REGIONAL SIMULATION MODEL
The Glades and LECSA RSM model (also referred to as the Glades-LECSA model) is an
application of the RSM developed by the SFWMD. RSM was used to project the hydrologic
conditions downstream of the STAs. The Glades-LECSA model represents the most recent

generation of integrated surface and groundwater flow models developed specifically to
Κββ̤ζ̨̨ ̲ϲζ Ψ̡̍̇̕ζ͞ϵ̲͟ ̕π ̨͍̲̕ϲ Ḟ̤̕ϵβΚϳ̨ hydrologic system. The model also has capabilities to
predict the outcomes of implementing structural and operational changes to the water
management system in south Florida. The Glades-LECSA model domain includes all WCAs,
Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve and the Lower East Coast Service Areas
south of the C-51 Canal in Palm Beach County. The Glades-LECSA model was used in this EIS to
evaluate the hydrologic impacts of the EIS alternatives within the affected environment.
The RSM is an implicit, finite volume, continuous, distributed and integrated surface-water and
ground-water model. It simulates the one-dimensional canal/stream flow and two-dimensional
overland and groundwater flow in arbitrarily shaped areas using a variable triangular mesh. The
overland and groundwater flow components are fully coupled for a more realistic
representation of the hydrology in south Florida. It has physically based formulations for the
hydrologic processes which include evapotranspiration, infiltration, levee seepage, and canal
and structure flows. The model uses the diffusive wave approximation of Saint-̋ζ̎Κ̲̎ϳ̨

overland flow. The Glades-LECSA model mesh consists of 5,794 triangular cells with an average
cell size of approximately one square mile. The domain takes into consideration the need for
having higher spatial resolution in areas where steep hydraulic gradients and prominent
physical features (e.g., levees) exist. The mesh resolution is the finest in the natural areas,
especially WCA 3B, which has the smallest average cell area (0.41 square miles) and finest
resolution. The mesh is designed to conform to all important flow controlling features, such as
roads and levees within the model domain. A one-day time step was used for the calibration
and validation of the model. The model has been stringently calibrated with goodness of fit (for
bias and root mean squared error) comparable to the SFWMM. The model results show that
the Glades-LECSA model is capable of simulating, with an acceptable error tolerance, the stage
and other stage dependent variables such as flow, flow vectors, ponding depth and
hydroperiods within the model domain.
The Glades-LECSA model used as a baseline in this EIS reflects the south Florida system
hydrology as it would be in the future condition without any of the EIS alternatives, or in the No
Action Alternative. It is comparable to the SFWMM model (described above) in that it includes
projects and operations circa 2015-2020. It also includes the recently implemented Everglades
Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP) schedule in WCA 3A. The period of simulation of the GladesLECSA model is January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2005. For simulation of the EIS alternatives,
the Glades-LECSA model boundary conditions at the northern model boundary are a
combination of output from the SFWMM and DMSTA for each of the four alternatives. In other

words, outflows from the EIS alternatives, as simulated by DMSTA, are combined with relevant
SFWMM boundary conditions (not simulated by DMSTA) and provided as input to the GladesLECSA model.
Glades LECSA RSM Results
Glades LECSA RSM simulates daily components of the hydrologic cycle (canal and structure
flows, infiltration, levee seepage, evapotranspiration, etc.) resulting from daily precipitation
and climate variables for the period of January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2005. Using Glades

be evaluated over a 41-year period of meteorological conditions (1965-2005). The Glades LECSA
RSM simulation used a baseline for this EIS represents the south Florida system hydrology as it
would be in the 2015-2025 condition without any of the EIS alternatives.
Performance measure graphics are outputs of Glades LECSA RSM and were utilized for this EIS
to assist in the evaluation of the effects of the EIS alternatives on WCA 2A and WCA 3A. These
graphics identify the potential downstream effects to surface water hydrology, which in turn
were considered in the evaluation of effects to soil; geology; water supply; surface water
management; water quality; vegetation; and threatened and endangered species; fish and
wildlife. See the RSM modeling results provided in Appendix E for more information.

LAND USE

Pursuant to grant agreement FB-4 entitled Cooperative Agreement Among the United States
Department of the Interior and the Nature Conservancy and The South Florida Water
Management District (Cooperative Agreement), lands acquired for public ownership under the
Cooperative Agreement, including the A-1 project site will be used and managed for purposes
of restoration in the Everglades ecosystem . Any proposed change in land use of Compartment
A-1 may not be implemented until the DOI/FWS: 1) reviews the proposal; 2) determines that it
meets the requirements of the NEPA, Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and any other applicable statutes; and 3)
approves the proposal. The Cooperative Agreement also includes a provision for dispute
resolution. The DOI/FWS approved an interim land use change for the A-1 project site on July
12, 2006, for utilization of the site as the A-1 Reservoir.

4.3.1 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE
If the site were to remain fallow or return to agricultural use, it would no longer be used for
restoration purposes pursuant to the Farm Bill and the Cooperative Agreement. Therefore, any
proposed land use of the site would need to be evaluated by the DOI/FWS pursuant to the
terms of the Cooperative Agreement. The land uses for STAs 2 and 3/4 would not change. The
STAs would continue to be utilized for water quality purposes, and they would continue to
support ancillary recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing. The land uses
in WCA 2A, WCA 3A, and the Holey Land also would not change. The areas would continue to

store flood waters for beneficial municipal, urban, and agricultural uses and would continue to
provide flood protection, water supply storage, and environmental resource protection.

4.3.2 ACTION ALTERNATIVES
4.3.2.1

Project site

Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would utilize the A1 site in combination with STA 2 and STA 3/4 to
ensure that water leaving the STA discharge points meets the WQBEL prior to discharge into
the EPA. Each of the Action Alternatives would only accept existing water from Lake
Okeechobee. Unlike the previous A-1 Reservoir project, the shallow FEB, deep FEB, and the STA
are designed to store water from Lake Okeechobee that is currently budgeted to be discharged
south. The change in the purpose of the projects would require the lands to be used for water
quality purposes rather than water storage purposes. Therefore, each of the Action
Alternatives would require approval for a land use change from the USFWS/DOI.

4.3.2.2

Stormwater Treatment Areas

Under the Action Alternatives, the land use for STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4
would not change. Operations of the STAs would continue in order to provide water quality
improvement in discharges to the EPA. Land use would continue to be classified as
public/institutional or conservation and would continue to support ancillary recreational uses
such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing.

WCAs and Holey Land

Under the Action Alternatives, there would be no changes in the land uses for WCA 2A, WCA
3A, and the Holey Land.

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, surficial geology of the project site, the STAs, the WCAs, or
Holey Land is not anticipated to change. The project area would likely remain undisturbed or be
converted back to active agriculture. Future soil conditions are expected to continue to subside
within the project area due to oxidation and lack of new sediment deposition within the project
area. As soil subsides, the topography is expected to lower slightly. No changes to topography

are expected for the STAs, the WCAs, or Holey Land under the No Action Alternative since the
land use and surface water operations within these areas are not expected to change.

4.4.1.2

Action Alternatives

With all the action alternatives, there would be minor geologic impacts within the project area
from the removal of surface cover (e.g. vegetation and soil), of the caprock from blasting, and
removal of limestone to obtain material for construction of levees, canals and roads. The depth
of the caprock varies from less than 1 to 4 feet; and averages a depth of approximately 2 feet
across the project site. Seepage and borrow canals would be constructed with all three of the
Action Alternatives and portions of existing canals and ditches would require fill to provide
elevations consistent with the adjacent wetlands.
Alternatives 2 and 4 would result in conversion of relatively flat, uniform agricultural lands to an
FEB or STA with shallow water (4 feet maximum operating depth) and exterior levees up to 10
feet above existing grade (generally 7 to 9 feet North Atlantic Vertical Datum 1988). Alternative
2 (shallow FEB) would require internal levees to be constructed to enable the conveyance of
flows to the north end of the project site. Alternative 4 (STA) would also require additional
internal levees to be constructed to delineate STA treatment cells and flow-paths.
Alternative 3 is an FEB with deep water (12.5 feet maximum operating depth) and exterior
levees up to 25 feet above existing grade. For Alternative 3 (deep FEB), additional blasting or
fracturing of the caprock would be required both to construct the higher levee walls and to
construct an associated pump station. The seepage buffer on the east, west, and north of the
project site would have a 150-foot wide strip at existing grade.
No changes to geology or topography are expected are expected within the STAs, the WCAs, or
Holey Land through implementation of any of the action alternatives as additional features,
land use, and operations are not expected to change.

4.4.2 SOILS
4.4.2.1

No Action

Under the No Action Alternative it is expected that the project site would remain fallow or
return to agriculture. Currently, direct rainfall is the dominant source of water for the project
site. Under the No Action Alternative, dryout conditions and the resultant loss of soil due to
oxidation would persist and possibly increase in frequency dependent upon future climatic
conditions. With re-wetting, the oxidized soil releases phosphorus and other nutrients into the
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

overlying water column thereby increasing the nutrient concentrations in runoff from the site.
In addition to impacts on nutrient concentrations, it is expected that the continued loss of soil
due to oxidation during dry conditions will result in a slightly lower topography in the project
site in the future.
Under the No Action Alternative, STAs 2 and 3/4 will continue to face substantial management
challenges caused by regional hydrologic conditions. As discussed in previous chapters,
insufficient rainfall during the dry season can cause extreme low water conditions that expose
wetland soils and result in the oxidation of organic material and the release nutrients. These
conditions hinder the treatment performance of the STAs and threaten to delay or prevent the
attainment of the Water Quality Based Effluent Limit (WQBEL).
If STA discharges exceed the WQBEL as projected under the No Action Alternative, the excess
phosphorus discharged downstream will increase soil phosphorus concentrations in the WCAs.
The current pattern of soil phosphorus enrichment near the major inflow points would remain
and the gradient of elevated nutrient levels would continue to expand over time into the
interior of the marsh. Soil characterization studies of the phosphorus gradient in WCA 2A have
shown a roughly proportional increase in concentration of phosphorus near the major surface
water inflow points concentrations at the major inflow points to the WCAs (DeBusk et al, 2001).
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no affect to soils in the Holey Land.

4.4.2.2

Action Alternatives

During construction of levees, the overlain muck soils would be removed and stockpiled on site
to access the limestone. Following construction, muck soils would be redistributed to the side
slopes of the levees. The remaining muck would be redistributed throughout the area.
Alternatives 2 and 4 are expected to encourage vegetation establishment and wetland
ecological function due to the shallow nature of the water levels. Muck soils would likely
increase as a layer of fine sediments containing a high level of organic debris and nutrients
would likely settle from the overlying water and cover the bottom. The soils within the project
site are anticipated to remain hydric and retain muck properties or revert to muck properties
post-construction. Alternative 3, the Deep FEB, is expected to contain less organic debris and
nutrients since rooted vegetation would not be present.
The FEBs proposed in Alternatives 2 and 3 have the potential to benefit soils within STA 2 and
STA 3/4 by maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout conditions.
Decreasing the frequency of dryout conditions will reduce the potential for soil oxidation and
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

4-11

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

the resulting release of phosphorus and other nutrients from the soil. The probability of
experiencing dryout conditions in STA 2 and STA 3/4 is greater under Alternative 4 (STA), as the
proposed STA would not operate to maintain the minimum water levels in the STAs.
Lower phosphorus concentrations coming from the STA2 and STA 3/4 would reduce the rate of
soil phosphorus accumulation in WCA soils. Over time, reductions in soil total phosphorus (TP)
will help facilitate the restoration of impacted areas near the inflow points to WCA 2A and WCA
3A creating conditions more conducive to historic Everglades vegetative communities. The
overall soil classification (histosol) and structure (muck) is not expected to change.
Alternatives 2 and 3 (FEBs) would have no effect on the soils in the Holey Land. Alternative 4
would require the construction of a discharge canal from the proposed STA to the L-5 Canal,
which would disturb soils on the eastern portion of Holey Land adjacent to Cells 3A and 3B
within STA 3/4. The remaining soils within Holey Land would remain undisturbed.

HYDROLOGY

No Action

If the A-1 project site were to resume agricultural activities, water would continue to enter the
site via the Miami Canal and the North New River Canal; however, drainage improvements
would be necessary to pump water off the property in the North New River Canal. If the site
were to remain undisturbed, there would be no change in the surface water management as
the water would continue to flow from the existing agricultural ditches to the STA 3/4 seepage
canal.
There should be no changes to the surface water management within the STAs, WCAs, or Holey
Land under the No Action Alternative.

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)

The Shallow FEB will be operated in series with (upstream of) STA 2 and STA 3/4. Inflows would
be conveyed to the Shallow FEB from the Miami Canal via the existing pump station G-372 and
from the North New River Canal via existing pump station G-370. After inflows are conveyed to
the north end of the shallow FEB, the water would sheet flow from north to south. An internal
collection canal would be constructed to assist in conveying water out of the shallow FEB back

Environmental Effects

to the North New River Canal when the water deliveries are needed. Two operable water
control structures will be constructed to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of the
FEB; one at the existing pump station G-370 at the North New River Canal and one at the
existing pump station G-372 to collect runoff from the Miami Canal. To send water to STA 3/4,
operable water control structures may also be constructed to allow discharges to be conveyed
via gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. To send water to STA 2, water would be
pumped into STA 2 into the Hillsboro Canal by the S-6 pump station and into the North New
River Canal by the G-434 and G-435 pump stations. The majority of the shallow FEB outflows
(approximately 80%) would be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining flows
(approximately 20%) would be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B). No changes to
the structural components of the water management systems would be required for water
inflows into STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A, or Holey Land.

4.5.1.2.2

Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)

The Deep FEB is operated in series with (upstream of) STA 2 and STA 3/4. The deep FEB would
receive water from the Miami Canal via existing pump station G-372, and from the North New
River Canal via existing pump station G-370 and the new inflow pump station. Outflows would
be conveyed back to the North New River Canal when water deliveries are needed. Operable
water control structures may also be constructed to allow FEB discharges to be conveyed via
gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. The majority of the deep FEB outflows
(approximately 60%) would be would be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining
flows (approximately 40%) would be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B). No changes
to the structural components of the water management systems would be required for water
inflows into STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A, or Holey Land.

4.5.1.2.3

Alternative 4 (STA)

The STA would operate in parallel with STA 2 and STA 3/4. The proposed STA would utilize the
existing STA 3/4 inflow pump stations (G-370 and G-372) to convey stormwater runoff to the
proposed STA. Flows would be distributed to the STA cells [33% emerged aquatic vegetation
(EAV) and 67% submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)] via water control structures and conveyed
north-to-south in internal collection canals. In order to operate the new STA, the STA discharge
canal would need to be connected to the L-5 Canal, which would require the proposed
discharge canal to be constructed within a small portion of the perimeter of the Holey Land.
This would enable the delivery of discharges from the proposed STA to WCA 2A and/or WCA 3A
via existing infrastructure, and would not alter the existing operations of STA 2, STA 3/4 and the
North New River and Miami Canals. No changes to the structural components of the water

management systems would be required for water inflows into STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, and
WCA 3A.

4.5.2 SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
As described in Section 4.2, data obtained from the modeling efforts were used to estimate the
volume and timing of surface water flows discharged from source basins contributing inflows to
existing STAs and proposed project features associated with the Alternatives, with eventual
discharge into the EPA. The source basins and their average annual flow volumes simulated by
the SFWMM are provided in Table 4-1.

No Action
Project Site

Under the No Action Alternative, the surface water hydrology at the project site would likely
remain rainfall driven if the area remains fallow. The wetlands would continue to experience
seasonal ponding and the water levels in the ditches and canals would fluctuate depending on
rainfall. Stormwater would continue to run off the lands into existing agricultural ditches and
to the STA 3/4 seepage canal. If the project site was converted back to active agriculture,

drainage improvements would likely be necessary to convey stormwater to the North New
River Canal.

4.5.2.1.2

STA 2 and STA 3/4

Under the No Action Alternative, the surface water hydrology of STA 2 and STA 3/4 would
continue to function as it does today and continue to operate under the existing operational
plans. Agricultural and/or urban stormwater runoff primarily from the S-2, S-5A, S-6 and S-7
basins collected by the Hillsboro and North New River Canals would continue to be pumped
directly into STA 2, while agricultural and/or urban stormwater runoff from the S-2, S-3, S-7, S-8
and C-139 basins collected by the North New River and Miami Canals would continue to be
pumped directly into STA 3/4 for treatment. STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to receive peak
stormwater flows and continue to experience dryout conditions that occur as a result of
extreme hydrologic conditions that exist in south Florida. These conditions adversely impact the
phosphorus removal performance of the STAs. Wet season conditions would likely continue to
result in longer than optimal durations of higher than optimal water depths.
STA 2 and STA 3/4 are currently operated to encourage the growth and establishment of
wetland plants within the STAs to optimize the uptake of phosphorus from stormwater passing
through the cells. Maintaining minimum water stages improves the ϶ϼ!ϳ̨ phosphorus
treatment performance by keeping the STAs hydrated and ensuring the viability of EAV and
SAV, and regulating inflows to minimize high hydraulic loading rates. As stated in the
Operations Plan dated December 2010 and August 2007 for STA 2 and STA 3/4, respectively,
the treatment cells within the STA are recommended to be operated at target depths under
normal operations:




Minimum Depth: To the maximum extent practicable, a minimum static water level
of 0.5 feet above the ground elevation should be maintained to avoid drying out the
treatment cell, subject to available water from the upstream watershed.
Maximum Depth: To the maximum extent practicable, a maximum static water level
of 4.0 feet above the ground elevation should not be exceeded to avoid damage to
the levees and marsh vegetation.

Table 4-2 provides the average annual inflow, diversion, and outflow volumes for STA 3/4 and
STA 2 for the No Action Alternative. Out of the approximately 834,000 acre-feet of water per
year that flows south to STA 2 and STA 3/4, 805,000 acre-feet of water per year enters STA 2
and STA 3/4 while 29,000 acre-feet per year from these basins and 27,000 acre-feet per year of
Urban Water Supply are diverted around or bypasses the STAs. Water diversions consist of the
delivery of water to the WCAs without treatment by the STAs, usually during extreme storm

events to maintain flood control. Conversely, urban water supplies are the deliveries of water
to the canals passing through the WCAs without treatment by the STAs during dry periods, but
delivered to the coast to maintain freshwater gradient in the coastal wells. Figures 4-2 and 4-3
are ponding depth hydrographs based on DMSTA modeling for STA 2 and STA 3/4, respectively,
for the No Action Alternative. Figure 4-4 shows ponding depth duration curves for STA 2 and

WCA 3A

Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 3A receives approximately
400,000 acre-feet per year via the S-150 structure and the S-8 pump station. These WCA 3A
inflows include treated flows from STA 3/4, STA 3/4 diversion flows and urban water supply
flows. Performance measure graphics were generated for several gauge locations within WCA
3A and for the entire area. A gauge location map is provided in Figure 4-5.
Five monitoring sites were chosen to depict the changes in ponding depths within WCA 3A (3ANW, 3A-NE, 3A-3, 3A-4, and 3A-28). Hydrographs of daily ponding depths (feet of surface
water) and duration curves of ponding depths (days of surface water inundation on average per
year) are provided for the WCA gauge locations. Changes in these hydrographs will be used to

In WCA 3A, the average annual ponding depths range from 0 feet to over 3 feet above the
surface (Figure 4-10). The northern portion of WCA 3A is dryer (depths range between 0 and
0.5 feet) while the water levels increase as it travels south, with depths ranging between 1-2
feet above the surface. Along the southeastern border of WCA 3A, water depths are the
deepest and range between 2-3 feet. Two cells in this area contain water depths above three
feet.
WCA 3A contains water between 60 and 365 days of the year (Figure 4-11). The hydroperiod is
dryer along the northern perimeter of the area and range between 120-240 days of the year,
with one cell between 60-120 days of hydroperiod per year. The hydroperiod increases in the
southern portion of WCA3A, with durations between 300-365 days of the year.

Action Alternatives
Project Site

Construction and operation of all three Action Alternatives (Shallow FEB, Deep FEB, and STA)
would affect surface water hydrology within the project site. Post construction, water from the
North New River Canal and the Miami Canal would be pumped into either the Shallow FEB,
Deep FEB or the A-1 STA and contained within levees and managed at various depths, unique to
each Alternative. When the water is released from the project site, it would enter either STA 2
or STA 3/4 before being released into the WCA 2A or 3A. A summary of DMSTA-simulated
inflow and outflow volumes on the A-1 project site for all Alternatives as compared to the No
Action Alternative is provided in Table 4-3.
The Deep FEB has the greatest Average Annual volume of inflows because it provides the
greatest storage capacity, so it has the ability to temporarily store and attenuate more runoff
per year on average than the Shallow FEB or the STA. This would be a benefit during storm
events if the additional capacity is needed. However, the Shallow FEB and the STA each use
approximately 2,000 acre-feet of water per year, while the Deep FEB uses 3,000 acre-feet of
water per year (as seen in the differences between the inflows and outflows/diversions for

evapotranspiration.

Figure 4-26 provides ponding depth hydrographs for the project site for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4.
Figure 4-27 provides ponding depth duration curves for the project site for Alternatives 2, 3,
and 4. Figures 4-28, 4-29, and 4-30 show the monthly depths for the project site from with 10%
to 90% probabilities for Alternative 2, Alternative 3, and Alternative 4, respectively.
Under Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) water inflows and outflows on the project site would
increase compared to the No Action Alternative, which has no water entering the site. An
average of 274,000 acre-feet per year of water would enter the site, while 272,000 acre-feet
per year would exit the site. The Shallow FEB would be operated at inflow water depths
ranging from 0 to 4 feet and would be inundated with water depths greater than 1.5 feet for 60
percent of the year (Figures 4-26, 4-27). For six months of the year, the site would average
around 1 foot, varying from 0.3 feet to over three feet, while water depths would average from
2 to 3.5 feet during the rainy season (Figure 4-28). As compared to the No Action Alternative,
Alternative 2 would increase the ponding stages on the site up to four feet under a managed
operation plan (Figure 4-26).
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) would result in the highest water inflows and outflows on the project
site. This alternative could retain more water than the other Alternatives during a storm event
due to the deeper capacity. Approximately 336,000 acre-feet per year of water would enter
the site, while 333,000 acre-feet per year would exit the site. The Deep FEB would be operated
at inflow water depths ranging from 0-12.5 feet and would be inundated with water depths
greater than 1.75 feet for 60 percent of the year, greater than 6 feet for 20 percent of the year,
and greater than 10 feet for 10 percent of the year (Figures 4-26, 4-27). For five months of the
year, the site would average around 2 feet, varying from 0.3 feet to almost six feet, while water
depths would average from 2 to 6 feet during the rainy season (Figure 4-29). Alternative 3

would increase the ponding stages on the site up to 12.5 feet under a managed operation plan
(Figure 4-26).
Alternative 4 (STA) would result in an increase in water inflows and outflows on the project site
compared to the No Action Alternative. Due to the need to operate the site to maintain STA
vegetation, the site would also require surface water diversions. Approximately 252,000 acrefeet per year of water would enter the site, while 250,000 acre-feet per year would exit the
site. Due to the necessary diversion of 5,000 acre-feet per year, Alternative 4 only has outflows
of 245,000 acre-feet of water per year. Similar to Alternative 2, Alternative 4 would result in
water depths at the project site ranging from 0 to 4 feet and the site would be inundated with
water at depths of 1.5 feet or more for 60 percent of the time (Figures 4-26, 4-27). For five
months of the year, the site would average around 1.5 feet, varying from 0.5 feet to almost 2.5
feet, while water depths would average from 1.5 to 2.5 feet during the rainy season (Figure 430). As compared to the No Action Alternative, Alternative 4 would increase the ponding stages
on the site up to 4 feet under a managed operation plan (Figure 4-26).

STA 2 and STA 3/4

A summary of STA 2 and STA 3/4 inflow and outflow volumes, water diversions (water routed
around the STAs into the WCA due to high water events), and urban water supply (water routed
around the STAs during low water events) are provided in Table 4-4. For the Alternatives 2,3,
and 4, which reflect the increased inflows and outflows of the project site as modeled, rainfall
and evapotranspiration for the project site are simulated by the DMSTA model, which does not
result in runoff from the site. Instead runoff as being stored within the FEB or STA facilities and
is eventually discharged from the project site with other FEB or STA discharges. For the No
Action Alternative, where no discharge from the site is expected, rainfall and
evapotranspiration are simulated by the 2x2 model, which results in runoff from the project
site. This results in slight variation in the calculations which are explained below.
Values from the bottom seven rows (STA 2, STA 3/4 and A-1 STA) of Table 4-4 are used to
compare alternatives. For the No Action Alternative, central flow-path runoff is distributed to
STA 2 and STA 3/4 consistent with existing conditions. Some surface water is diverted around
STA 2 and STA 3/4 and is delivered directly to the Everglades Protection Area without entering
the STA treatment works. A reduction in the diversion volumes in Table 4-4 means that less
untreated runoff is sent to the WCAs.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 all result in less STA diversion, although some STA diversion is still
expected to occur as there will continue to be some flows that will exceed the physical capacity
of the STA inflow structures or result in substantial damage to the STAs. Under the No Action
Alternative, the ϲ͛nflow and Diversionϳ row in Table 4-4 is consistent with the Total Source Basin
Flow Volume from Table 4-1. ϼϲζ ΨϲΚ̎Ϩζ π̤̍̕ ̲ϲζ ϲ͛̎π͙̇̕ Κ̎β Dϵ͘ζ̨̤ϵ̎̕ϳ ̤͙̕ Κ̎β ̲ϲζ ϲͷ͍̲π͙̇̕

be attributed to seepage, evaporation and effects from the modeling analysis. Change across
the rows from the No Action Alternative to Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 will be due to factors such as
runoff reduction, diversion/urban water supply, and rainfall/evapotranspiration/seepage.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 each result in different volume of water being diverted and different
evapotranspiration and seepage rates. The resultant decreases in inflow and outflow volumes
(to STA 2, STA 3/4, and the A-1 STA) summarized in Table 4-4 are due mainly to the following
two reasons: 1) the project site has external levees and act as an impoundment and surface
water runoff is not being exported as aggressively from the project site as compared to the No
Action Alterative since water levels within the project site are not being managed for
agricultural production; and 2) simulated water levels within an FEB or STA are substantially
higher than water levels under the No Action Alternative and will result in higher

evapotranspiration losses from the project site as compared to the No Action Alternative.
Therefore, the volume of water as shown in the outflows, diversions, and urban water supply
varies.

Compared to the No Action Alternative, average daily depths within STA 3/4 and STA 2 for each
Action Alternative are described below:
Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB):
As compared to the No Action Alternative, the Shallow FEB would increase inflows into STA 2 by
72,000 acre-feet per year and outflows by 84,000 acre-feet per year, while diversions are
decreased by 12,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4). Figures 4-33 and 4-34 provide ponding
depth hydrographs for STA 2 and STA 3/4, respectively, for Alternative 2. The Shallow FEB
would slightly decrease the peak stages and raise the low water stages in STA 2.
For STA 3/4, the Shallow FEB would decrease inflows 103,000 acre-feet per year and outflows
by 103,000 acre-feet per year, while diversions are decreased by 6,000 acre-feet per year (Table
4-4). In general, the Shallow FEB would lower the peak water stages in STA 3/4 as the majority
of high water elevations are lowered.

Alternative 3 (Deep FEB):
As compared to the No Action Alternative, the Deep FEB would increase inflows into STA 2 by

diversions by 12,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4). Figures 4-35 and 4-36 provide ponding

slightly lower the peak water stages in STA 2, and increase the low water stages as the majority
of low water events would be raised (Figure 4-35).
For STA 3/4, the Deep FEB would decrease inflows by 97,000 acre-feet per year and outflows
by 98,000 acre-feet per year, while decreasing diversions by 11,000 acre-feet per year (Table 44). The Deep FEB would lower the peak water stages in STA 3/4 approximately one foot as the
high water events would be reduced (Figure 4-36).

Alternative 4 (STA):
As compared to the No Action alternative, utilization of the A-1 site as a STA would decrease
inflows into STA 2 by 48,000 acre-feet per year and outflows by 48,000 acre-feet per feet,
while diversions are decreased by 12,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4). Figure 4-37 and Figure
4-38 provide ponding depth hydrographs and ponding depth duration curve for STA 2 an STA
3/4, respectively, for Alternative 4. The STA would decrease the peak stages as excess water
would be shared among the STAs (STA 2, STA 3/4, and the project site STA), but low water
stages in STA 2 would be increased as the need to maintain water levels in the project site STA
would preclude preferentially routing water from this site to STA 2 to maintain water levels
there.
For STA 3/4, utilization of the A-1 site as a STA would decrease inflows 229,000 acre-feet per
year outflows by 226,000 acre-feet per feet (Table 4-4). Diversions would also be decreased
7,000 acre-feet per year for STA 3/4. For STA 3/4, the STA would lower the peak water stages,
and decrease the low water stages resulting in lower water tables during the dry seasons. The
lower water elevations during the dry season are due to the STA requiring water to maintain its
wetland vegetation. This is because additional water would be provided to WCA 2A. Figure 439 and Figure 4-40 provides ponding depth hydrographs and ponding depth duration curve for
STA 3/4 for Alternative 4.

The ability of DMSTA to accurately predict the duration and severity of STA dryout is limited.
Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the number of dryout events simulated to be
eliminated/created within STA 2 and STA 3/4 by the different alternatives. It can be conceived
that Alternatives 2 and 3 would result in less frequent dryout conditions in STA 2 and STA 3/4
since these alternatives send water in an advantageous manner to the existing STA. As for the
A-1 STA Alternative, dry-outs in the existing STAs could actually increase with Alternative 4 due
the operations of the proposed STA, which would need a portion of water currently sent to the
existing STAs to keep it hydrated during dry periods. Dryouts are considered deleterious to STA
performance because with rewetting there may be an undesirable release of phosphorus.

4.5.2.2.3

WCA 2A

WCA 2A inflows include treated flows from STA 2 and STA 3/4, STA 2 and STA 3/4 diversion
flows and urban water supply flows. The total outflows from STA 2 and STA 3/4 including
diversions and urban water supply is 858,000 acre-feet per year under the No Action
Alternative. Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 2A would receive
approximately 458,000 acre-feet per year of inflows via the L-6 Canal and the S-7 pump station
for the No Action Alternative. All of the action alternatives produced ponding and hydroperiods
very similar to the No Action Alternative, with only some minor variations (Table 4.5).
Alternative 2, 3, and 4 result in 10,000; 14,000; and 13,000 acre-feet less water per year
entering into WCA 2A.

respectively for WCA 2A.
Alternative 2:
For Alternative 2, there is an increase in the total outflows (72,000 acre-feet more per year)
from STA 2 as compared to the No Action Alternative, while there is a decrease in total outflows
from STA 3/4 (109,000 acre-feet less per year). This change is seen in the downstream areas as
Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) delivers approximately 10,000 acre-feet per year less flow via the L6 Canal to WCA 2A, producing very slightly deeper ponding and slightly longer hydroperiods in
localized areas in northwest WCA 2A. Alternative 2 results in approximately 600 acres of WCA
2A (0.6 percent) experience hydroperiods 17 days per year longer than the No Action
Alternative (Figure 4-43).

Alternative 3:
For Alternative 3, there is an increase in the total outflows including diversions (70,000 acrefeet more per year) from STA 2 as compared to the No Action Alternative, while there is a
decrease in total outflows from STA 3/4 (109,000 acre-feet less per year), including diversions.
This change is seen in the downstream areas as Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) delivers approximately
14,000 acre-feet per year less flow via the L-6 Canal to WCA 2A, producing very slightly deeper
ponding and slightly longer hydroperiods in areas in northwest WCA 2A compared to the No
Action Alternative. Alternative 3 results in 3,000 acres of WCA 2A (3.1 percent) experiencing
hydroperiods 15 to 18 days per year longer than the No Action Alternative (Figure 4-46).

decrease in total outflows including diversions from STA 3/4 (233,000 acre-feet less per year)

WCA 3A

WCA 3A inflows include treated flows from STA 3/4, STA 3/4 diversion flows and urban water
supply flows. WCA-3A receives water from Lake Okeechobee, WCA 2 and the EAA via the North
New River and Miami Canals with the majority of the inflows delivered from WCA 2A through
the S-11 spillways. Another large source of water entering into WCA 3A is from STA 3/4 and STA
5, which enter through the S-8 and G-404 pump stations, and the S-150 and G-357 culverts, all
of which are located at the northern boundary of WCA 3A.
Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 3A would receive approximately
401,000 acre-feet per year of inflows for the No Action Alternative, while Alternatives 2, 3, and
4 results in 25,000; 24,000; and 28,000 acre-feet per year less water than the No Action
Alternative. (Table 4.6). This reduction is mainly due to project site retaining water without any
discharge to the surrounding area. Performance measure graphics were generated for several
gauge locations within WCA 3A and for the entire area.

For Alternative 2, there is an increase in the total outflows including diversions (72,000 acrefeet per year) from STA 2 as compared to the No Action Alternative, while there is a decrease in
total outflows from STA 3/4 (109,000 acre-feet less per year). WCA 3A receives 25,000 acrefeet per year less inflows than the No Action Alternative. This change is seen in the
downstream areas as Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) produces slightly shorter hydroperiods in an
area in WCA 3A adjacent to the northern reach of the Miami Canal in comparison to the No
Action Alternative. Approximately 11,000 acres of WCA 3A (2.2 percent) experience
hydroperiods 14 ̌ 30 days per year shorter than the No Action Alternative (Figure 4-50).

of WCA 3A (0.2 percent) experience hydroperiods 14 to 30 days per year shorter than the No

Alternative 4:
For Alternative 4, there is a decrease in the total outflows including diversions (60,000 acre-feet
less per year) from STA 2 as compared to the No Action Alternative, and a decrease in total
outflows including diversions from STA 3/4 (223,000 acre-feet less per year). This is because
the A-1 STA would accept 252,000 acre-feet per year of inflows and 250,000 acre-feet per year
of outflows. WCA 3A receives 28,000 acre-feet per year less inflows than No Action Alternative.
Alternative 4 (STA) produces ponding and hydroperiods in WCA 3A that are very similar to the
No Action Alternative as there are no observed differences (Figure 4-52).

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

No impacts to the surface water hydrology are anticipated to occur for the Action Alternatives
since the action alternatives would not increase or decrease surface water in the Holey Land.
As a result, no changes to Holey Land ponding depths are anticipated to occur.

No Action Alternative
Project Site

The two principal aquifers in and around the project site ̌ the surficial aquifer system, and the
Floridan aquifer system ̌ would not be affected by the No Action Alternative. Under the No
Action Alternative, the groundwater hydrology in and around the project site would remain as
it is today, as described in Chapter 3. The groundwater hydrology of the STAs, the WCAs, and
Holey Land would remain as it is currently.

4.5.3.2

Action Alternatives

The two principal aquifers in and around the project site ̌ the surficial aquifer system, and the
Floridan aquifer system ̌ would be minimally, if at all, affected by the Action Alternatives. The
Floridan aquifer system is divided into the Upper Floridan and Lower Floridan, by an
intermediate confining unit, which restricts communication between these two layers.
Therefore, the Lower Floridan would not be affected by any of the Action Alternatives.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in the construction and operation of a Shallow FEB, Deep
FEB or STA that may inundate 15,000 acres with water depths ranging from approximately 1 to
12.5 feet. Under these conditions, water within the project site would be in direct contact with
the groundwater through the surface soils and may be lost to the surficial aquifer system and
Upper Floridan aquifer. However, due to the proposed seepage collection and return systems
proposed for all of the Action Alternatives, the contribution of seepage that would occur would
have a minimal effect on groundwater. Expected contributions to seepage from Alternative 2, 3
and 4 are expected to be equivalent.
No impacts to the groundwater hydrology of the STAs, WCAs, or Holey Land are anticipated to
occur for the Action Alternatives as operational changes are not proposed and water levels
within the STAs would remain approximately the same as described in Chapter 3.

4.5.4 STA PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL
4.5.4.1

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to experience dry-outs.
Between Water Years 2002 and 2012, STA 2 experienced dryout conditions in at least five (5)
water years, with approximate durations ranging from 1 to 5 months. STA 3/4 experienced
dryout conditions one time since Water Year 2005, with a duration of less than one month. If
similar weather conditions occur, it is anticipated that similar frequency of dry outs would occur
in the future.

4.5.4.2

Action Alternatives

The primary objective of the Action Alternatives is to improve delivery rates to STA 2 and STA
3/4 by attenuating and temporarily storing peak stormwater flows to assist with the
achievement of the WQBEL. Minimizing the potential for STA dryout is an additional benefit.
The ability of DMSTA to accurately predict the duration and severity of STA dryout is limited.
One assumption in the DMSTA modeling and STA operation is that the treatment cell is not
allowed to dryout. Therefore, the DMSTA results do not quantify the number of dryout events
simulated to be eliminated. In general, as additional STA acreage is added (as in Alternative 4),
the potential risk of STA dryout, and associated impacts to phosphorus removal performance
within existing and new STAs, increases, whereas, when additional storage is added (as in
Alternative 2 and 3), the potential for dryout within existing STAs decreases.
Additionally, the dryout within STA 3/4 that occurred in 2011 may not have been avoided with
the Action Alternatives in place due to the hydrologic conditions that occurred during early
2011. However, the damaging conditions that resulted from the rapid re-filling of STA 3/4
would have likely been prevented, as this is the type of event that an FEB (Alternatives 2 and 3)
is intended to address. The rapid re-filling of STA 3/4 resulted in peat pop-ups, rapid flux of
phosphorus into the water column and overwhelming stress on the vegetative communities
within the STA. With the FEB Alternatives (Alternative 2 and 3) in place, stormwater flows
would have been directed first to the FEB for storage and attenuation, and then distributed to
STA 3/4, ultimately providing short- and long-term performance benefit to the STA.
In general, lower phosphorus concentrations in the water column coming from the STAs into
the WCAs would not increase soil phosphorus concentrations in the soils at the WCA discharge
points as less phosphorus in the water would leach into the soils than currently does. Ḟ̤̕ϵβΚϳ̨

TP exceeds 500 milligrams TP per kilogram of soil; therefore, if the TP concentrations in the
soils are below 500 milligrams per kilograms, these soils would be considered unimpacted.

4.6

WATER QUALITY

The water quality (phosphorus) modeling of EIS alternatives was conducted using DMSTA.
Average annual flow volumes and TP loads and TP concentrations summarized by source basin
are provided in Table 4-7. Water quality improvements (i.e. reductions in TP concentrations)
are anticipated to occur such that both STA 3/4 and STA 2 are projected to discharge at the
WQBEL with Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. These improvements in STA discharges would result in
improvements at WCA 2A and WCA 3A inflows which would subsequently lead to
improvements in water quality within WCA 2A and WCA 3A. Each STA is required to discharge
at the WQBEL, which is based on a long-term discharge of 13 ppb flow-weighted (Section
1.3.1.2). DMSTA projections of STA outflow concentration, such as those in Table 4-8, are
interpreted in this context. Modeling uncertainty for DMSTA results is estimated at + or - 15%
of the predicted long-term flow-weighted mean for each STA (USEPA 2010, Attachment H),
without accounting for uncertainty in the assumed future flows and loads.

2. S-7 runoff is reduced to 231,000 acre-feet per year for Action Alternatives due to
runoff no longer occurring from the project site.
3. S-7 total phosphorus load is reduced to 28.4 metric tons per year for the Action
Alternatives due to runoff no longer occurring from the project site.

4.6.1 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE
4.6.1.1

Project Site

Under the No Action Alternative, and if the area remains fallow, the water quality of the project
site would likely remain as it is today as described in Section 3.6. The project site would
continue to experience periods of dryout, which would lead to additional soil oxidation and
release of nutrients upon rewetting. If the lands are converted back to active agriculture, it is
expected that the stormwater runoff from the project site would likely contain relatively high
levels of nutrients (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen from particulate matter and fertilizers) as
with other agricultural lands in the EAA, though farming practices would follow best
management practices in place for the area.

4.6.1.2

STA 3/4 and STA 2

Under the No Action Alternative, STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to receive peak stormwater
flows and continue to experience dryout conditions that occur as a result of extreme hydrologic
conditions that exist in south Florida. Extreme wet conditions would likely continue to result in
water depth durations that are longer and deeper than optimal, excessive hydraulic loading
rates and phosphorus loading rates to the STAs, or diversion of untreated water around the
STAs into the EPA. Extreme dry conditions would likely continue to result in periods of dryout
causing additional soil oxidation and nutrient release. As a result, achievement of the WQBEL
at discharges from both STAs would likely not occur. For the No Action Alternative, the outflow
TP concentration for STA 2 (including Compartment B) is projected to be 13 ppb, based on the
results of DMSTA modeling. This improvement, compared to the information provided in
Section 3.6.2 (STA 2 historic outflow of 22 ppb, Table 3-1), is mainly due to the addition of
7,000 acres of treatment area (Compartment B) in 2012. The DMSTA-simulated outflow TP
concentration of STA 3/4 is 18 ppb for the No Action Alternative, which is consistent with the
information provided in Section 3.6.2. Under the No Action Alternative, the WQBEL would not
be met at STA 3/4. Table 4-8 provides DMSTA-simulated inflow and outflow volumes, inflow
and outflow TP loads and inflow and outflow TP concentrations.

WCA 2A

Under the No Action Alternative, the water quality of WCA 2A would improve from the
conditions described in Chapter 3, due to the phosphorus reductions that would occur with the
additional 7,000 acres of treatment area at STA 2 (Compartment B). Compartment B
construction was completed in December 2011 and was flow capable in April 2012. Water
quality improvements at the STA 2 discharge may be seen as early as in WY2012. Table 4-9
provides the inflow volumes, inflow TP load and inflow TP concentrations for WCA 2A from STA
2 and STA 3/4 for the No Action Alternative.

4.6.2 ACTION ALTERNATIVES
4.6.2.1

Project Site

Because the shallow FEB and the STA alternatives both operate by channeling water through
shallow marshes, these two alternatives would reduce both TP loads and concentrations on the
project site. The STA most efficiently removes the TP loads and concentrations as it would
contain managed cells with both emergent and submerged wetland vegetation cells. The
shallow FEB also provides benefits of phosphorus removal; however, its operation is not
designed to optimize phosphorus removal on the project site. Therefore, the ability to remove
phosphorus on the project site is limited for the Shallow FEB. The Deep FEB would not contain
submerged or emergent wetland plant species that remove phosphorus and therefore, would
not be expected to provide the reductions in phosphorus loads and concentrations that would
be provided by the Shallow FEB and STA alternatives. A summary of DMSTA-simulated project
site inflow and outflow volumes, inflow and outflow TP loads and inflow and outflow TP
concentrations for all alternatives is provided in Table 4-11.

The project purpose is to meet the WQBEL in water at the STA 2 and STA 3/4 discharge points
as it enters into the EPA. If the WQBEL is met at both STAs, and the STAs are able to adequately
treat wet season flows, then future loading of excess phosphorus into the Everglades will be
prevented. The WQBEL applied at the STA discharge is based on 13 ppb long-term as a flow
weighted mean (which is equivalent to the 10 ppb long-term geometric mean criterion in the
EPA marsh). The DMSTA modeling presented is interpreted against the objective of meeting
the WQBEL: 13 ppb or below for STAs 2 and 3/4. With the addition of 7,000 acres of treatment
area at STA 2 as a result of Compartment B, as modeled all four alternatives would meet the
WQBEL at STA 2. However, the WQBEL is required to be met for both STA 2 and STA 3/4. All of
the three Action Alternatives are projected to meet the WQBEL for both STAs.

A summary of WCA 2A inflow and outflow volumes, inflow and outflow TP loads and inflow and

the TP concentration of WCA 2A inflows decreases by 3 ppb and the TP load in WCA 2A inflows
decreases by 1.4 metric tons per year (16 percent) when compared to the No Action

WCA 3A

For all three Action Alternatives, the water quality of WCA 3A would improve as compared to
the No Action Alternative, since the phosphorus concentration of WCA 3A inflows is reduced
and STA 3/4 is projected to discharge at 13ppb. Table 4-14 provides a summary of WCA 3A
inflow and outflow volumes, inflow and outflow TP loads and inflow and outflow TP
concentrations from STA 3/4 for all alternatives. For Alternative 2, the TP concentration of WCA
3A inflows decreases by 5 ppb and the TP load of WCA 3A inflows decreases by 2.1 metric tons
per year (30 percent) when compared to the No Action Alternative. For Alternative 3, the TP
concentration of WCA 3A inflows also decreases by 5 ppb and the TP load of WCA 3A inflows

VEGETATION

4.7.1 GENERAL VEGETATION
4.7.1.1

No Action Alternative

4.7.1.1.1

Project Site

The vegetation at the site would continue to be dominated by weedy and invasive species. The
187 acres of higher quality depressional wetlands that were present in 2005 are now in a
degraded condition with 90% nuisance and exotic species such as Elephant grass (Pennisetum
purpureum) and castor bean. A continued expansion of these nuisance species and degredation
of wetlands at the site would be expected if the site were to remain fallow. If agricultural
activities would resume, the existing vegetation on the site would be replaced with agricultural
plants (crop species such as sugar cane or sod farm).

4.7.1.1.2

STA 3/4 and STA 2

Under the No Action Alternative, the vegetative community types in STA 2 and STA 3/4, which
contains a mixture of EAV (Typha spp.) and SAV (Chara and Najas), would not change. Under
the No Action alternative, impacts to vegetation resulting from increased hydraulic and nutrient
loading rates and extended dry-out periods would occur as described in Section 3.7.2.

4.7.1.1.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

It is anticipated the No Action Alternative would allow the nuisance cattail vegetation to
continue to dominate and poliferate in the areas within the phosphorus enrichment gradients
downstream of inflow points as described in Chapter 3. The aerial extent of cattail expansion
may continue to increase as demonstrated in WCA 3 from a comparison of aerial photographs
from 1995 to 2004; however with the recent expanded treatment area of STA 2 the rate of
expansion in WCA 2A may be reduced.

4.7.1.1.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

No change to the vegetation in community structure in the Holey Land is expected under the

Action Alternatives

4.7.1.2.1

Project Site

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Hydrologic conditions at the site with the shallow FEB, coupled with vegetation management,
would favor the establishment of native marsh vegetation. The primary goal of vegetation
management is to establish and maintain healthy EAV dominated communities, a community of
plant species that have roots anchored to the bottom of the marsh and leaves that grow up
through the water and emerge above the surface. The vegetative community structure that is
anticipated within the A-1 FEB includes EAV with native plant species such as sawgrass (Cladium
jamaicense), Carolina willow (Salix caroliniana), bulrush (Scirpus californicus), pickerel weed
(Pontederia cordata), duck potato (Sagittaria lancifollia), muskgrass (Chara sp.), Illinois
pondweed (Potamogeton illinoensis), coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum), and cattail (Typha
spp.). The wetlands created would be protected from further development, managed to
eliminate undesirable vegetation, and would provide improved functionality in perpetuity for
the system. In addition, it is assumed in the DMSTA modeling that this EAV wetland vegetation
would provide a greater phosphorus removal benefit than a deep FEB.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Due to the variable hydrology of the Deep FEB (approximately 1 foot to 12 feet) and anticipated
water depth above 4 feet for 30 percent of the time, it is not anticipated that this feature would
support stable vegetative communities. The Deep FEB would act more like a reservoir due to
the inability for a stable plant community to develop.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Under the STA alternative the project site would support vegetation similar to what is found in
the existing STAs 2 and 3/4 with both EAV and SAV. The dominant SAV species include Chara,
which is commonly called muskgrass, and Najas, which is water-nymph. The dominant EAV is
cattail. Existing vegetation at the site would be removed during construction and replaced
with vegetation similar to what is found in existing STAs as per the SFWMD planting guidelines
for STAs.

4.7.1.2.2

STA 3/4 and STA 2

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) and Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
With the shallow and deep FEB alternatives, the impacts to vegetation from heavy hydraulic
loading rates and extended dry-out periods would be reduced. The FEB would attenuate

stormwater runoff from the basins and deliver it in a more advantegous manner to STA 2 and
STA 3/4. This steadier flow would help optimize the performance of the existing STAs.
Alternative 4 (STA)
The STA alternative would lessen impacts from heavy hydraulic loading rates, although to a
lesser extent than either the proposed FEB alternatives. Extended dry-out periods with STAs 2
and 3/4 are anticipated to remain as described in Chapter 3 and the phosphorus removal
efficiency of these STAs reduced as a result.

4.7.1.2.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
The shallow FEB, the deep FEB and the STA alternatives all showed similar reductions in
phosphorus concentrations in inflows entering WCA 2A and WCA 3A from the EAA. The
expected result is a reduction in cattail proliferation and expansion within the areas
downstream of inflow point S-7 in WCA 2A, and inflow points from the S-11 spillways and S-8
and G-404 pump structures in WCA 3A. Also, open water areas may increase, providing habitat
for the periphyton communities that are essential to the Everglades. These reductions
represent an incrimental step towards achieving the overall EPA marsh criterion of 10 ppb,
which would help to restore the natural balance of native Everglades flora and fauna.
The changes to vegetation from the slightly altered hydroperiods in isolated areas of WCA 2A
and WCA 3A are not anticipated to impact vegetation. In WCA 2A the RSM model predicted
slightly higher hydroperiods (17 days longer) in sparse areas in northwest WCA 2A. In WCA 3A
the RSM model predicted slightly lower hydroperiods (14-30 days less) in already disturbed
areas along a narrow stretch north of the Miami Canal in WCA 3A. Despite this slight decrease
in hydroperiod, there is no difference in hydroperiod classes in this area between the no action
and the shallow FEB. Hydroperiod classes in the affected area range primarly from 240 to 300
days (8 to 10 months), followed by a few cells at 180 to 240 days (6 to 8 months), and two
lower hydroperiod cells at the very northeast portion of the affected area. An edge effect from
the Miami Canal in this area is apparent and the majority of this area is already heavily
impacted by cattails with shrubs.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Anticipated vegetative responses from reductions in phosphorus are equivalent to those
described for the Shallow FEB alternative above. The RSM model predicted very minor changes
in hydroperiod within WCA 3A and WCA 2A with the Deep FEB alternative. These slight
decreases in hydroperiod (14 to 30 days) are located in the very northeast of the Miami Canal,

and area that experiences an edge effect from the Miami Canal and the majority of which is
already heavily impacted by cattails with shrubs. The very localized hydroperiod increases (15
to 18 days longer) in WCA 2A are not considered significant enough to shift vegetation in the
area since this WCA is almost entirely already innundated for 300 or more days per year.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Anticipated vegetative responses from reductions in phosphosphorus are equivalent to those
described for the Shallow FEB alternative above. There were no RSM modeled changes to
hydroperiod or ponding depth with the STA alternative. There would however be a new
upstream water demand to keep the STA hydrated which is not considered in the modeling
effort or quantified.

4.7.1.2.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

No impacts to vegetation within Holey Land would occur with Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) and
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) since no changes to the vegetation community is proposed.
Alternative 4 (STA) would cause direct impacts to vegetation in Holey Land to construct a
conveyance discharge canal located within the Holey Land boundary adjacent to the project site
along the northern portion of the east border of Holey Land. Alternative 4 would impact
approximately 250 acres of wetlands withn Holey Land to construct the new discharge canal,
which would allow treated discharges from the A-1 STA to be conveyed to the L-5 Canal.
Acconding to the 2005 Florida Natural Areas Inventory survey this area is primarily a cattail
monoculture wetland (SFWMD 2012- 2012 SFER Volume III Appendix 5-4).

4.7.2 WETLANDS
4.7.2.1

No Action Alternative

4.7.2.1.1

Project site

Under the No Action Alternative there would be no additional discharges to waters of the
United States, including wetlands; however, the wetlands would experience other effects. The
A-1 project site would either remain in its existing condition or be utilized for agricultural
purposes. If the site were to remain undisturbed, the vegetation at the site would continue to
be dominated by weedy and invasive species. The 187 acres of true depressional wetlands that
were present in 2005 are now in a degraded condition with 90% nuisance and exotic species
such as Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and castor bean. A continued expansion of
these undesirable species and degradation of wetlands at the site would be expected. If the
agricultural activities would resume on the project site, the wetlands would be cleared of

4.7.2.2.1

Project site

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Construction of the Shallow FEB would lead to 537 acres of unavoidable adverse wetland and
surface water impacts due to placement of fill and excavation. Of the 537 acres of impacts,
296.5 acres of wetlands would be filled to construct the levee, 164.5 acres of waters of the U.S.
would be filled to raise the elevation of canals and ditches to the adjacent wetland elevation,
and 75.8 acres of canal would be excavated. The Shallow FEB would be operated at an average
depth of 1.5 feet and the maximum depth is 4 feet. Emergent aquatic wetland vegetation is
expected to be maintained or grow within the Shallow FEB. Therefore, approximately 10,517
acres of wetlands will be inundated with water up to four feet.
The construction features causing permanent wetland impacts include an interior and exterior
perimeter levee, a collection canal and inflow and out flow structures. Wetland conditions
would occur within the Shallow FEB after construction is complete and operation of the FEB
begins.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Construction of a Deep FEB would result in 626 acres of unavoidable adverse impacts to
wetlands and waters of the U.S. as a result of levee and canal fill, canal excavation, and
excavation of freshwater wetlands. Of the 626 acres of impacts, 550 acres of wetlands would
be filled to construct the levee and 76 acres of canal would be excavated. Alternative 3 would
not require fill in canals or ditches. The Deep FEB would be operated at an average depth of six
feet and the maximum depth is 12 feet. No rooted wetland vegetation is expected to be
maintained or grow within the Deep FEB. There would be about 10,517 acres of wetlands that
would be flooded as a result of this alternative.

Alternative 4 (STA)
Construction of a STA would result in impacts to 1,055 acres of wetlands and waters of the
United States to include 370 acres of fill to construct the levee, 164.5 acres of fill to raise the
elevation of canals and ditches, 270 acres of canal excavation, and 250 acres of excavation
within Holey Land Wildlife Management Area. Wetland impacts within the Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area are required to construct a new discharge canal to allow treated discharges
from the A-1 STA to be conveyed to the L-5 Canal. The STA would be operated at an average
depth of 1.25 to 1.5 feet and the maximum depth is 4 feet. The impacts would be due to
construction of interior and exterior levees, interior cell/flowway earthwork to bring areas to
appropriate elevations and construction of internal and external water control structures.
Emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation is expected to be maintained or grow within the
STA. Similar to the shallow FEB, approximately 10,517 acres of wetlands will be inundated with
water up to four feet.

4.7.2.2.2

STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A, Holey Land

There are no impacts to downstream wetlands with any of the action alternatives. Improved
water quality resulting from the action alternatives would slow the spread of nuisance cattail
within these areas (especially the WCAs) causing an overall improvement in wetland conditions.

Under the No Action Alternative, no significant change would likely result to fish and wildlife
populations on the project site if the site were to remain fallow. The project site would
continue to provide habitat to wildlife utilizing the property. However, it is anticipated that
exotic plant species would continue to encroach on the site. The increase in exotic plant
species may reduce the wildlife utilization in the future as the dominance of exotic plant species
as elephant grass and castor bean lowers the function and value of the wetlands. If the site
were to return to agricultural use, the fish and wildlife populations on the site are expected to
be reduced as the agricultural activities may disturb nesting and foraging.

STA 2 and STA 3/4

Currently, the STAs provide high quality habitat for fish and wildlife species as described in
Chapter 3. Under the No Action Alternative, the fish and wildlife habitat is expected to
continue to support a wide variety of wading birds and other wildlife in the STAs.

4.8.1.1.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

Colonial wading birds utilize the WCAs as both feeding and breeding habitat. The most
common species utilizing the WCAs include the white ibis, great egrets, snowy egrets, cattle
egrets, great blue herons, tricolored herons, little blue herons, green herons, black-crowned
night herons, yellow-crowned night herons, wood storks, and glossy ibis, with populations
varying widely in relationship to seasonal water level fluctuations. Current trends in water
quality within the WCAs impact fish and other aquatic wildlife populations directly and
indirectly by altering the vegetation, which affects foraging habitat of wetland dependent
species. As nutrient loadings to surface water within the WCAs decrease, water quality should
continue to improve. Under the No Action Alternative it is expected that STA discharges would
not meet the WQBEL and water quality and the aquatic habitat within the WCAs would
continue to decline.

4.8.1.1.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Similar to WCAs, Holey Land provides aquatic habitat to a wide variety of fish and wildlife
species. Under the No Action Alternative, the wildlife species use is not expected to change in
the Holey Land.

4.8.1.2
4.8.1.2.1

Action Alternatives
Project Site

Construction of a shallow FEB and a STA would improve the fish and wildlife usage on the
project site. The site conditions would change from low quality wetlands with several areas
containing a dominance of exotic plant species to a wetland containing native plant species and
depths of water up to four feet. Exotic plant species would be removed and the site
maintained in perpetuity. Existing STAs are evidence that water depths up to four feet in the
impoundment provides abundant habitat for a diverse array of wildlife species.
Although the deep FEB would provide more aquatic habitat than the existing site conditions,
the deep FEB would provide less functional aquatic habitat than the shallow FEB or STA. Many
of the wading birds require shallow water depths to capture prey fish that utilize emergent

vegetation. The 12-foot water depths would preclude emergent vegetation from establishing
and foraging habitat for the shallow water dependent species.

4.8.1.2.2

STA 2 and STA 3/4

The shallow and deep FEB alternatives would improve fish and wildlife habitat as the FEBs
would operate in a manner as to avoid dryout in the STAs. The STAs would maintain a more
steady state of water depths as the FEBs would provide water when the STAs require. In
addition, there would be less impact to nesting birds in the STAs with the two FEB alternatives.
Currently, if the STAs dry out, migratory birds nest in the dry lands. As the areas are re-flooded,
there is the potential for the sudden increases in water depths to flood the nesting birds. The
FEB alternatives would assist the STA and avoid dryouts.
There would be no change to wildlife usage in STA 2 and STA 3/4 if the STA Alternative were
constructed.

4.8.1.2.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

Overall wildlife habitat benefits are expected to occur in WCA 2A and WCA 3A with the
construction of the Action Alternatives. Specifically, improved water quality within STA 2 and
STA 3/4 would decrease the phosphorus loading entering into the WCAs, which would help to
restore the vegetation communities within the WCAs over the long-term. Currently, annual
average flow-weighted TP concentrations in WCA 2A and WCA 3A for water year 2011 is 18 and
20 micrograms per liter (ug/L), respectively (SFWMD, 2011, Chapter 3A.). As seen in WCA-2A,
increased TP loads entering the WCA have contributed to dense monotypic stands of cattail
vegetation at the areas where water enters the WCA. The monotypic and dense growth
patterns of invasive vegetation support less diverse fish and wildlife than native vegetation.
Native marsh vegetation is necessary for roosting and nesting, and shallow water areas are
important habitat for prey species and important foraging habitat for predators. Therefore, a
reduction in TP entering the WCAs would likely improve foraging and nesting habitat for fish
and wildlife species.

4.8.1.2.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

The construction of the shallow FEB or the deep FEB is not expected to affect wildlife usage in
the Holey Land since the FEB Alternatives would have no effect on the water entering the Holey
Land. With the STA Alternative, a conveyance discharge canal would be constructed within the
Northern portion of the eastern boundary of the Holey Land. The area is currently cattail, but
would be converted to a canal. Therefore, the construction of the STA would convert a portion

of cattail wetlands to a canal with floating aquatic vegetation, which would impact the species
currently utilizing the cattail marsh.

4.8.2 FEDERALLY LISTED THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES
The following sections document potential impacts to federally-listed threatened and
endangered species, species of special concern (SSC), and designated critical habitat that could
occur from the No Action Alternative and Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The impact analysis
includes listed species that have the potential to occur within the project footprint, the STAs
directly affected by the proposed project (STA 2 and STA 3/4), and the downstream secondary
project-affected regions (WCA 2A and WCA 3A).
Direct impacts are defined as impacts that occur within the footprints of the proposed project
site during or as a direct result of construction and operation activities. Indirect impacts are
defined as impacts that occur outside of the footprints of the proposed project but are still
within the affected regions, or that occur within the footprints of the downstream STAs and
WCAs. Due to the potential for adverse impacts to fish and wildlife, in particular threatened or
endangered species and their habitat, the operational and monitoring plans for the proposed
project are of particular importance to USFWS.
The Action Alternatives provide the opportunity for minor to major changes in the
hydropatterns of the WCAs dependent upon the ability to provide improved treatment capacity
of STA 2 and STA 3/4. With the No Action Alternative, a regional trend towards improvements
in water quality, quantity, and timing may occur from planned restoration projects in the
Everglades. Overall, this is anticipated to improve habitat within the project primary and
secondary affected regions as defined in Chapter 3. The Proposed Action (Alternative 2, Shallow
FEB) is expected to further increase these improvements. The extent of the enhancements with
the No Action and Action Alternatives would depend on the manner in, and extent to which,
the treatment capacity provided by existing and anticipated features is used in the context of
other regional water management infrastructure and system operations made possible by the
presence of any additional treatment or storage capacity.
The Proposed Action is not intended to propose, direct, or otherwise mandate specific changes
in C&SF project operations identified in existing operations manuals (i.e., Lake Okeechobee
Regulation Schedule or WCA Regulation Schedule), as determined in the future for restorationrelated purposes. The effects on listed species discussed below are based on wildlife surveys,
field observations, literature, reasonable scientific judgment, SFWMM, DMSTA, and SSDM
results.

The American alligator is found within freshwater and brackish aquatic habitats in South
Florida. American alligators were not observed on the A-1 project site during the field visits to
the site, but are commonly found in and on canal banks within the EAA. Although the American
alligator is not actually threatened or endangered it is listed due to the similarity in appearance
to the threatened American crocodile. No consultation is required for the alligator.

Upland and dry habitats (flatwoods, dry prairies, tropical hardwood hammocks, and coastal

habitat is limited in the project-affected regions, these species may also forage along the edges
of freshwater marshes and in agricultural fields and along their banks within the EAA. This
species also utilizes gopher tortoise burrows, so potential gopher tortoise habitat was
considered in determining potential effects of the Action Alternatives on the eastern indigo
snake. In addition to gopher tortoise burrows, the eastern indigo snakes use natural and manmade holes and burrows for refugia. Eastern indigo snakes were found on the project site
during construction activities for the A-1 Reservoir.

4.8.2.2.1

No Action

No direct impact on the eastern indigo snake is expected with the No Action Alternative. The
site would either remain undisturbed or agricultural activities could resume. If agricultural
activities continue on the site, approximately 10,517 acres of wetlands within the A-1 project
site would remain undisturbed or be utilized for agriculture. The Eastern indigo snakes use
agricultural fields as habitat and depending on the particular type of agricultural use, these
areas may provide habitat that support a higher density of snakes found in natural upland
habitat.
Indirect impacts could be attributed to soil subsidence. Wetter conditions are expected in the
EAA by 2050 because of soil subsistence. Subsidence could therefore cause conditions in the

EAA to be less favorable for the eastern indigo snake, which prefers drier, upland habitats.
However, eastern indigo snakes may still utilize these areas as habitat.

4.8.2.2.2

Action Alternatives

Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 are anticipated to have a direct impact on the eastern indigo
snake. Construction of the Action Alternatives would result in the conversion of 10,517 acres of
wetlands to an above ground impoundment containing either 4 feet of water or 12 feet of
water. Disturbed wetlands may be used by eastern indigo snakes, but are not preferred
habitat. The eastern indigo snakes may forage along the edges of the FEBs or the STA during
drier periods, but conditions within the impoundments would generally not be suitable because
these areas would be permanently inundated.
Construction activities may also result in eastern indigo snakes leaving the area, abandoning
den sites, and possibly losing foraging and mating opportunities. In addition, construction
activities associated with the earth-moving equipment may increase the likelihood of Eastern
indigo snakes being adversely impacted. Heavy machinery, which would be re-contouring
ground levels, removing and relocating berms, and constructing roads, may unearth eastern
indigo snakes and cause inadvertent impacts to occur. The applicant would require the
construction workers to be aware of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, and be informed
how to identify the snake if found. The eastern Indigo Snake Construction Precautions would be
required to be adhered during all construction activities.
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives to the eastern indigo snake could occur with all
Action Alternatives from increased traffic and post construction activities. Increased traffic
could increase the likelihood of direct mortality along roads in the area. The post-construction
activities associated with the proposed FEBs and the STA that may cause impacts to the eastern
indigo snake include post-construction maintenance of the roads, levees, pump stations, and
cells (including vegetation management methods such as mowing, herbicide application, and
physical removal). In addition, indirect impacts may occur to the eastern indigo snake due to
the potential inundation of snakes during rehydration of the cells in the event the cells become
dry after initial flooding. Protective measures alerting the contractor of the potential presence
of this species and its protected status would also be used during the construction to avoid
direct takes of the species. Indirect effects from changing the water elevations in downstream
areas (STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, and WCA 3A) are not anticipated to cause an unacceptable
adverse effect to the eastern indigo snake as.

outward from a nesting tree. The secondary zone is 6,600 feet outward from an active nesting
tree. The project site is located within a USFWS consultation area for the crested caracara;
however, no juvenile gathering areas are located within these areas. During field surveys, no
!͍β͍Χ̎̕ϳ̨ crested caracaras were observed on the project site. In addition, there are no
cabbage palm trees located on the project site.

4.8.2.3.1

No Action

No direct or indirect impacts to caracara are anticipated under the No Action Alternative.
Caracaras prefer dry and wet prairies with scattered cabbage palms but have adapted well to
improved pasture (USFWS 2004). Although the existing vegetative communities within the
project site may provide some foraging habitat for caracara, it is primarily fallow cropland with
taller, woody vegetation that is not preferred for foraging as the current vegetative coverage is
greater than 1 foot in height. The vegetative communities would remain as is (no effect) or
would return to active agriculture (moderately improved foraging habitat).

4.8.2.3.2

Action Alternatives

No direct impacts to caracara are anticipated with construction of Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The
exotic vegetation in the wetlands are above 1 foot high and thereby do not provide suitable
foraging habitatϰ ϼϲζ !͍β͍Χ̎̕ϳ̨ crested caracara generally does not forage in vegetation
greater than 1 foot in height.
The project site is located within a USFWS consultation area for the crested caracara but
outside known juvenile gathering areas. The Species Conservation Guidelines for Crested
Caracara (USFWS 2004) state that no effect from the project is anticipated on the caracara if
on-site surveys of suitable habitat within the consultation area do not detect caracara nests.
The site does not contain palm trees; therefore, the site is not expected to provide suitable
nesting activity. No known nest sites are located within 6,600 feet of the project site.
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives to the caracara include an increase in traffic
volume and changes to downstream habitats. Caracaras frequently prey on wildlife struck by
vehicles. An increase in traffic would likely increase road kills, thereby increasing the risk of

the STAs so not provide suitable foraging habitat. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would improve water
quality in WCA 2A and WCA-3A by reducing phosphorus loads and concentrations, thereby
maintaining the existing crested caracara foraging habitat by decreasing the rate of cattail
expansion and that of other invasive plants. The indirect effect on the caracara would be that
native wet prairie vegetation used for foraging would remain for a greater period of time.
The increase in water levels within WCA 2A and WCA 3A are minor. For alternative 2, WCA 2A
would experience hydroperiod to extend 17 days longer per year than the No Action
Alternative, 15-18 day longer for Alternative 3, and no change in Alternative 4. For WCA 3A, the
hydroperiod would be 14-30 days shorter per year for Alternatives 2 and 3, and no change to
the hydroperiod for Alternative 4. Therefore, access to pray availability would not change in
the WCAs.
No changes in the Holey Lands are expected to occur as a result of Alternatives 2 and 3;

Alternative 4 (STA) would convert cattail wetland to a canal. Since the wetlands are not foraging
habitat, the construction of the STA would also have no effect on the caracara.

4.8.2.4

Everglade snail kite

The project site, STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA-2A, WCA-3A, and the Holey Land are all within USFWS
consultation area for the Everglade snail kite. In addition, WCA- 2A and WCA 3A are located
within designated critical habitat for the Everglade snail kite. Everglade snail kite nesting or
foraging was not observed on the project site.
In Florida, Everglade snail kites forage almost exclusively on apple snails that are found in
freshwater marshes and shallow vegetated littoral zones of lakes. Therefore, this evaluation
focuses on both potential impacts to the snail kite itself and the apple snail, its most important
prey item.

4.8.2.4.1

No Action

No direct impacts to snail kites, apple snails, or designated snail kite critical habitat would be
expected with the No Action Alternative. Marsh and scrub wetlands on the project site may be
converted back to agricultural lands. Although apple snail populations may occur within
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

4-84

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

remnant natural wetlands, ditches, and canals, no apple snail egg casings were observed in the
surveys on the project site, which indicates it is unlikely that Everglade snail kite currently use
this area for foraging.

4.8.2.4.2

Action Alternatives

The potential for direct impacts to snail kites exists from construction of Alternatives 2, 3, and
4. With these alternatives, approximately 10,517 acres of freshwater wetlands and waters of
the United States would be converted to aquatic habitats containing a variety of EAV, SAV,
and/or FAV plant species. Relatively clear and open marshes and littoral zones with low-profile
marshes (10 feet or less in depth) are ideal foraging habitat for the Everglade snail kite (USFWS
1999). Therefore, the construction of the deep FEB would offer the least benefits to the snail
kite. The wetland systems that would be created as a result of the shallow FEB and the STA
would provide better habitat for apple snails and the Everglades snail kite. During normal
operations, the SAV and EAV cells would be operated at target depths of less than 4 feet of
water, which is suitable foraging habitat for the snail kite.
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives would likely vary by alternative and include
increased traffic levels as well as changes in hydrology and vegetation in affected regions,
primarily the WCAs. The three main parameters considered in the evaluation of potential
indirect impacts with the Action Alternatives are traffic, the cycle and duration of dry-down
events, and changes in vegetation, each of which are described below.
Traffic: Increased traffic could result in a higher risk of direct mortality; however, since the snail
kites do not typically forage along roadways increases in traffic is not expected to cause an
unacceptable adverse effect.
Dry Down Events: Apple snails need EAV to thrive. Both apple snail and snail kite population
success are directly affected by depth and duration of marsh flooding (Johnson et al. 2007). The
following are the hydrologic parameters/criteria that were considered in evaluating potential
impacts to snail kites and apple snails:
̓ Dry-down periods with a 1- to 2-month period were considered optimal for apple snails, while
greater than a 2-month dry-down was considered unfavorable;
̓ A dry-down period between March and April was considered unfavorable as this time period
was documented by Darby (1997, 2003) to be a peak in apple snail egg cluster production;

A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

4-85

February 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

̓ Dry-down events occurring in a 3- to 5-year cycle were considered optimum snail kite habitat;
and
̓ Dry-down events occurring in a 2- to 3-year cycle (slightly drier than optimum) or occurring in
a 5- to 6-year cycle (slightly wetter than optimum) were considered marginal snail kite habitat.
Alternatives 2 (Shallow FEB) and Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) are designed to minimize the drydown events in the STAs (STA 2 and STA 3/4) so the FEBs would improve conditions for the
Everglades snail kites utilizing the STAs. Alternative 3 (STA) offers the least amount of benefits
within STA 2 and STA 3/4 since the intent of the proposed STA would not operate to prevent
dry-downs events.
Changes in the water levels within WCA 2A and WCA 3A are minor. As compared to the No
Action Alternative, the hydroperiod within WCA 2A would experience wet conditions 17 days
longer per year with Alternative 2, 15-18 day longer for Alternative 3, and no change in
Alternative 4. Alternatives 2 and 3 would benefit the Everglades snail kite, while Alternative 4
would not cause any additional impacts. For WCA 3A, the hydroperiod would be 14-30 days
shorter per year for Alternatives 2 and 3, and no change to the hydroperiod for Alternative 4.
Therefore, Alternatives 2 and 3 (the FEB alternatives) would reduce the available foraging areas
slightly while Alternative 4 would have no change.
Vegetation: Because the Action Alternatives would decreases phosphorus loads and
concentrations within the WCAs, all of the alternatives would not contribute to the cattail
expansion within the WCAs. By meeting the water quality criteria for phosphorus in the EPA,
improvements to the Everglades snail kite foraging habitat are anticipated. Everglade snail
kites forage by either still-hunting from a perch or by flying above the water surface and visually
locating prey. Relatively clear and open marshes and littoral zones with low profile marshes (3
meters or less in depth) and shallow open water are ideal foraging habitat for the Everglade
snail kite (USFWS 1999). Increased levels of phosphorus in Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades
have resulted in dense stands of emergent invasive vegetation that has replaced the foraging
habitat for the Everglade snail kite. A decrease in cattail coverage is considered beneficial to
the Everglade snail kite and its designated critical habitat.

4.8.2.5

Wood Stork

Wood stork foraging and nesting habitat occurs on the project site, STAs 2 and 3/4, and WCAs
2A and 3A. Wood storks were observed on the project site.

4.8.2.5.1

Environmental Effects

No Action

Direct impacts from the No Action Alternative include decreasing the amount of preferred
aquatic foraging habitat for wood storks from the conversion of 10,517 acres of freshwater
wetlands to active agriculture. Atypical sod and sugar cane fields would still provide foraging
habitat, but would be of a lower quality than the freshwater marsh and wetland scrub habitat
that exists there currently.
Indirect impacts are not anticipated under the No Action Alternative. STA 2 and 3/4 are
intended to be operated under their current operational plans and discharges into WCA 2A and
WCA 3A would continue.

4.8.2.5.2

Action Alternatives

Anticipated direct impacts from construction of the shallow FEB and STA would likely increase
the preferred aquatic foraging habitat available to the wood stork from the conversion of
10,517 acres of low quality wetlands to flooded cells with EAV and SAV, which may include
areas over open water and appropriate water depths for foraging. This conversion would result
in beneficial effects for wood storks by replacing lower-quality foraging habitat with higher
quality shallow, inundated wetlands. Existing agricultural canals and ponds within the project
site would be filled to create wetland habitat, but deeper canals (conveyance and collector
canals) would continue to be in use and available to the wood stork. The construction of the
deep FEB would not provide wood stork foraging habitat as the 12-foot water depths are too
deep to support foraging.
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives would likely occur and would include impacts
associated with changes to hydrology and vegetation in affected regions from altered
hydroperiods and phosphorus levels. Overall regional improvements to foraging and nesting
habitat, as a result of improved vegetative communities and fish and wildlife habitat are
anticipated. However, effects within the STAs may vary for the Action Alternatives.
The FEB alternatives (Alternatives 2 and 3) would reduce the frequency of dry-downs within
STA2 and STA 3/4. Therefore, the FEBs would improve wood stork foraging habitat within the
STAs. Alternative 4 (STA) would not operate to reduce the potential for dry-downs within the
existing STAs; therefore, Alternative 4 would have no effect on the wood stork foraging habitat
within STAs 2 and 3/4.
An overall anticipated regional trend toward restored water quality is expected to improve
vegetative communities, water quality, and fish and wildlife habitat in WCA 2A and WCA 3A. It

is anticipated that this improvement would likewise enhance wood stork foraging habitat and
access to prey items in these areas. Wood storks typically forage in water depths 18 inches or
shallower. The Action Alternatives would not change the average high and low water levels
during the wet or dry seasons to be either deeper or shallower than 18 inches compared to
existing conditions.

4.8.2.6

Florida panther

Panther telemetry data from 1981 to 2005 show panthers in the EAA, including areas directly
adjacent to the project site and in WCA 3A (USFWS 2006). Figure 3-14 describes Panther
telemetry data from 1997 through 2006 (URS 2007c) while Figure 3-15 indicates recent
occurrences in the area (FWS database). Panthers may hunt on the project site, but it is
unlikely that they would use these areas for any extended length of time because of the lack of
suitable long-term panther habitat (URS 2007). Panthers were not observed on the project site
during the field surveys.

4.8.2.6.1

No Action

No anticipated direct impacts in the form of mortality, injury, or loss of habitat to the Florida
panther would occur with active agriculture resuming on the project site because the project
site is not considered preferred habitat for the Florida panther. Although panthers may traverse
through the project site, they are not expected to use these areas for an extended period
because of a lack of suitable, long-term habitat. Conversion of wetlands to active agriculture
would reduce suitable habitat for feral hogs and white-tailed deer, two prey items for the
panther. Although this habitat is not ideal for panther foraging, this conversion would decrease
the hunting ability of the panther within the A-1 project site and would result in an indirect
effect through decreased prey availability.
Indirect impacts are anticipated as a result of loss of habitat for prey items as well as a
cumulative loss of ranging, resting, and foraging habitat in the EAA as a result of other CERP and
Environmental Restoration projects in the EAA. The cumulative effect of other large scale
projects in the EAA and surrounding areas̎including construction of reservoirs, STAs, and
widening of canals̎may force the panther to cross greater distances through portions of the
EAA. The effects also may result in a loss of potential ranging, resting, and foraging habitat with
the conversion of wetland, agricultural, or other terrestrial areas within the EAA to aquatic
reservoirs. However, improved habitat conditions in the WCAs and areas south of the EAA are

Environmental Effects

Action Alternatives

Direct impacts to panthers from the construction of Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would likely occur
from conversion of 10,517 acres of freshwater wetlands to deeper water wetland areas with
EAV and SAV, thereby reducing potential ranging, resting, and foraging habitat on the A-1
project site. In addition to becoming permanently inundated, the build-out areas would not be
as accessible to the Florida panther because of the network of canals and ditches, leading
panthers to travel longer distances to cross these portions of the EAA. Nevertheless, panthers
would still be able to traverse through these lands or use them for resting after they are
converted to the shallow FEB or STA, but would not be able to utilize the land if they are
converted to the deep FEB. All Action Alternatives would reduce potential habitat for feral hogs
and white-tailed deer in on the project site, two prey items for the panther. Although this
habitat is not ideal for panther foraging, the conversion could decrease the hunting ability of
the panther, resulting in an indirect impact similar to the No Action Alternative. In addition,
construction of the build-out areas would contribute to the cumulative effect of other CERP and
large-scale environmental restoration projects, causing panthers to travel longer distances
through portions of the EAA.
Indirect impacts on panthers include increased traffic levels, increased noise disturbance and
reduction in value of panther habitat adjacent to the project due to habitat fragmentation. In
past years, several road kills have occurred on CR 835/833 as a result of vehicles entering in and
off the project boundaries. However, the project construction would result in increased traffic
consisting of heavy equipment and employee vehicles. All vehicles would be required to obey
posted speed limits for off road and for improved road travel. Impacts associated with
construction traffic would be localized due to construction occurring in phases such that
panthers can avoid the areas that are under construction. Additionally, all entrances would be
secured with gates to control access. Noise levels would also be localized as the different
phases are under construction.
With Alternatives B, C, and D, slight changes to the hydrological conditions in WCA-2A and WCA
3A are anticipated, but these changes are not anticipated to impact the Florida panther.
Indirect impacts are also not anticipated in the Holey Lands.

4.8.3.2

Action Alternatives

The Shallow FEB and STA alternative would improve foraging and nesting habitat for the state
listed wading birds as the Shallow FEB and STA would provide foraging and nesting habitat. The
Deep FEB would not provide foraging or nesting habitat as water levels are too deep. All of the
Action Alternatives would provide foraging habitat for the black skimmer; however the Shallow
FEB and the STA alternative may also provide areas of nesting. The levees in all of the Action
Alternatives would provide nesting habitat for the burrowing owl as they nest in the ground in
areas with little understory vegetation. Each of the Action Alternatives would not provide
habitat for the Gopher tortoise, gopher frog, and the Florida mouse, as site conditions would be
too wet.

4.8.4 MIGRATORY BIRDS
Migratory birds have been sighted within the A-1 project site, in particular black-necked stilts

highly disturbed landscape. The A-1 site has been the subject of multiple investigations to
determine the presence of cultural, historical and archeological resources. In 2006, the State
Historic Preservation Officer determined that the site was no longer eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places The most recent Phase I archeological survey was conducted
in July 2012 by the State Bureau of Archaeological Research (BAR), on behalf of the District and
the Corps. No NHRP eligible sites were found in the project area. The survey conclusions
recommended no further archaeological work at the A-1 property at this time. (A Cultural

There would be no effects to cultural resources within the STA 2, 3/4 or Water Conservation

historical variation of water depths and durations for these areas.
The creation of a conveyance features associated with Alternative 4 (STA) which would convey
STA outflows to the L-5 canal for distribution to WCA 2A and 3A would require impacts to
wetland areas within the Holy Land WMA. A Phase I cultural resource survey would need to be
conducted prior to construction for areas to be impacted to determine whether there are any
eligible sites for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

to offer the maximum amount of recreational opportunities that are determined to be
consistent with the project purpose. There are several factors that need to be considered in
deciding which activities may be allowed, such as how would recreational activities affect water
quality and the health and function of the vegetation community structure and how would
water depths vary over time and how would these varying water levels affect recreation.

4.11.2.1

Project site

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) and Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
As discussed above, once the Shallow or Deep FEB is constructed there would be a flooding and
optimization period. In this time period no recreational activities would be allowed. Once the
flooding and optimization phase is complete, a recreational plan for the project would be
developed and additional recreational opportunities would be provided in the area. Additional
opportunities for wildlife viewing, such as wading birds, would be possible.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Under the STA alternative, recreational activities would be consistent with recreational
opportunities allowed in the other existing STAs (e.g., hiking, biking, wildlife viewing, hunting,
fishing). Wildlife viewing opportunities would increase if the STA alternative were
implemented. Many waterfowl and wading birds take advantage of other STAs in the region for
nesting and foraging.

4.11.2.2

STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A and WCA 3A

None of the action alternatives would have direct effects on existing recreational opportunities
within STA 2, STA 3/4, and WCA-2A and WCA-3A.
Indirect effects associated with the Action Alternatives include the potential for temporary
disturbance to recreational users in STA 2 and STA 3/4 while the construction of the project is
ongoing. These disturbance effects would be limited to the adjacent portions of the STA and
the WMAs, and would cease when construction is completed. In addition, modeling results
establish that changes in flows and stages within WCA 2A and WCA 3A are very limited, and it is

unlikely that these changes are of a sufficient magnitude or duration to adversely influence
water related recreation in those areas.

4.11.2.3

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Effects to the Holy Land could occur due to construction of a discharge canal adjacent to the
existing STA 3/4 Cells 3A and 3B from the STA alternative to the L-5 canal. These direct impacts
to the Holy Land could cause temporary disturbance to recreational users while construction is
ongoing.

4.12 AESTHETICS
4.12.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

The existing aesthetic character of the A-1 project site is similar to the EAA as a whole, as
described in Section 3.12. The landscape is flat and has a predominantly uniform and organized
appearance. The prior construction activities on the site have created differences in site
conditions in various areas on the project site. Areas that have been scraped down exhibit
natural aesthetics with functioning wetland systems, while areas that have stockpiles of rock,
gravel, and much offer poor aesthetics for the area. Other low quality aesthetic areas of the
site contain wetlands dominated by exotic plant species. Under the No Action Alternative
(Alternative 1), the aesthetics would be converting those various areas to agricultural lands if
the site would resume agricultural activities.

4.12.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in construction and operation of new
impoundments that would cover approximately 10,517 acres that would be inundated on a
permanent basis. This long-term operating condition would change the visual character of the
landscape in the immediate vicinity of the proposed project. This direct effect at and near the
project site would be the primary aesthetic impact of the proposed project.
Based on the nature of the sources of change, potential aesthetic effects from the Action
Alternatives would be the same. Any of the Action Alternatives would involve an initial period
when construction would be evident to people within viewing range of the project sites. Views
of construction equipment, dust plumes, exposed excavations, and partially completed culverts
and other structures would be visible to residents and workers who pass near the construction
sites in the course of their regular activities, and to motorists traveling on roads adjacent to the
project sites. These views would be temporary in nature. Once the project is in operation, the
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

4-95

February 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

long-term appearance of the project site would consist of expansive open water areas bordered
by a variety of constructed features, including levees; roads along the tops of the levees; and
water control structures, culverts, and pump stations spaced at varying intervals. The local
landscape would retain the uniform and organized character that currently exists, while the
current mix of marsh and vegetated areas would be replaced by open water. Although the
future condition with the project would result in less overall visual diversity, the presence of
additional water area would likely be perceived as a positive change or of more visual interest
when compared with the current condition (Hettinger 2005, as cited in URS 2007a,b). On
balance, the long-term aesthetic change resulting from the project would not be a significant
adverse impact.

4.13 FLOOD PROTECTION
4.13.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

Under the No Action Alternative the existing level of flood protection would be maintained as it
currently is today with no impacts to the project site, STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A or Holey
Land.

4.13.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

4.13.2.1

Project Site

None of the Action Alternatives are expected to impact the existing level of flood protection
within the Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) System.
Both the shallow FEB and the STA alternatives are a closed system with the only hydraulic
inputs being water delivered by pumps or direct rainfall. Based on Design Criteria
Memorandum one (DCM-1), and a Levee Breach Analysis conducted for the shallow FEB, the
shallow FEB alternative has been designated a low hazard potential classification. Inundation
mapping performed during the analysis has shown at maximum water level a levee breach
would not reach the travel lanes of U.S. 27 or overtop the north STA 3/4 levee; therefore, there
is no impact to the existing level of flood protection service. Since the levee height and
maximum water depths for the STA alternative are similar to the shallow FEB, no flood
protection impacts are anticipated with the STA alternative. A potential for damage exists for
adjacent private property to the north and west of the project site.
The deep FEB alternative is classified as a high hazard potential based on the criteria outlined in
DCM-1. A seepage cutoff wall would be required within the perimeter embankment as well as
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

4-96

Chapter 4

a perimeter seepage canal to reduce and capture seepage from the deep FEB. In the event of a
levee breach additional conveyance would be required on the west side of U.S. 27 to allow for
flood waters to get away and not impact the travel lanes or overtop STA 3/4. Adjacent private
agriculture property would experience damage to the north and west of the project site if a
breach or overtopping of the deep FEB levees were to occur.

4.13.2.2

STAs 2 and 3/4, WCAs 2A and 3A, and Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area

No impacts to the existing level of flood protection in STAs 2 and 3/4, WCAs 2A and 3A, and
Holey Land would be expected with the Action Alternatives.

4.14 HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE
4.14.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

The current land use within the A-1 project site is inactive agricultural lands. Under the No
Action Alternative, the land use would remain primarily fallow agricultural lands; however,
agricultural activities may become active. There would be the potential for release of
petroleum or agricultural chemicals in these areas with active agricultural land use.

4.14.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Current areas of known contamination are described in Chapter 3 of this document. All Action
Alternatives would avoid the lands where known contamination exists and exclude those lands
from the project footprint. In particular, the footprint of the proposed shallow FEB, deep FEB
or STA has been altered such that potential risk of negative impacts to foraging wading birds
and other avian species feeding within inundated Woerner Farm 3 soils has been minimized.
The Woerner Farm 3 lands would primarily be left undisturbed as a buffer between the project
and the agricultural lands to the north.
The Action Alternatives would include the use of heavy equipment for construction of the
proposed project and associated structures. Operation of this equipment may result in the
release of petroleum products, such as fuel and hydraulic fluid. Fueling areas may experience
spills when equipment and tanks are filled or possible spills from fuel tank leaks. The use of
equipment could result in the release of hazardous and toxic materials or waste into the project
area. However, Best Management Practices (BMP) would be implemented during construction
to reduce the risk of release of hazardous or toxic materials or waste.

4.15 CLIMATE
Implementation of the No Action and the Action Alternatives would have no effect on the
climate in South Florida.

4.16 COSTS
No Action and Action Alternatives
For the purposes of this EIS, cost estimates for each alternative are a rough order of magnitude
based on the primary components that comprise each alternative. Therefore costs are
confined to the build alternatives themselves for the project footprint. Since no construction is
anticipated downstream in STA 2 and STA 3/4 or in WCA 2A and WCA 3A with any of the
alternatives, a cost analysis is not applicable in these areas.
The cost estimate for each alternative is based on the alternative description of major
components as outlined in Chapter 2, Section 2.4 Description of Alternatives. There is a certain
amount of sunk costs (costs already incurred) within each alternative associated with the
previous construction from the EAA A-1 Reservoir. These are defined as sunk costs for the land
and initial earthwork that was conducted. Table 4-15 contains each of the Alternatives listing
total cost, sunk costs and estimated new construction costs. Of the alternatives (2, 3 and 4) that
are projected to meet the WQBEL at both STA 2 and STA 3/4), Alternative 2 is the least
expensive.
The difference in cost between the Shallow and Deep FEBs results from the needed additional
excavation for the Deep FEB for an inflow pump station and fill material for larger levees, as
well as the seepage cutoff wall and additional protection features needed for flood protection
(see also Section 4.13.2.1). The STA would require additional levees to separate the EAV and
SAV cells; as well as a new discharge canal within Holey Land.

4.17 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
In accordance with Executive Order 12898, the Federal government is required to review the
effects of their programs and action on minorities and low income communities. This is
accomplished by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations. The following potential environmental
justice issues have been identified for a water storage facility in the EAA:


Displacement of minority or low income inhabitants of land within the footprints of land
purchases required for each of the project alternatives.



Change in conveyance of water required by the alternatives causing flooding or related
issues that would disproportionately impact minority groups or low income class groups.



Loss of jobs for low income and minority workers as a result of acquiring agricultural
land for the construction of the project.

The Action Alternatives would have no disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects on minority or low income populations. The Action Alternatives offer an
opportunity to benefit these communities. By judicious selection of possible locations for the
proposed project, displacement of minority or low-income inhabitants has been avoided. In
addition, land that has historically been used for agriculture, but now has limited agricultural
value, would be used for the proposed project on the A-1 project site. It should also be noted
that the proposed project is expected to contribute to water quality improvements in the EPA.
Recreational benefits are also being considered as a potential use for each of the Action
Alternatives. Socioeconomic development activities resulting from construction of the project
should include but are not limited to construction symposiums, contract opportunity assistance
for small business involvement and job cross training for local residents. These all act to make
the area more attractive to visitors and in turn, may provide jobs and subsistence for low
income and minority populations of the area.

4.18 NATURAL OR DEPLETABLE RESOURCES
4.18.1

NO ACTION

The No Action Alternative is anticipated to have an increase in the generation of agricultural or
mineral resources. The A-1 project site could be utilized for agricultural use or rock mining.

4.18.2

Environmental Effects

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

There are rock mining and/or agricultural resources that would be unavailable for exploitation
as a result of construction of the Action Alternatives. Limestone and/or rock material is a
common available mineral in the region. The impact of the proposed project upon rock mining
or agricultural resources is very minor. No other significant vegetable or mineral resource is
known to exist.

4.19 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
Section 1508.7 of the CEQ regulations defines a cumulative impact as:
϶the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what
agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts
can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period
of timeϰϷ
Many restoration programs would affect the northern and southern Everglades in the future.
These projects focus on restoration of natural hydrology and improved water quality in the
project-affected environment, as well as in other physiographic regions within the study area.
Cumulatively, these restoration efforts would provide substantial improvements in water
quality, water deliveries, and timing of these deliveries. It should be noted that additional
projects would Χζ ̎ζζβζβ ̲̕ ̍ζζ̲ ̲ϲζ ϶̲Κ̲ζϳ̨ ̕͘ζ̤Κ̇̇ ͙Κ̲ζ̤ ̣͍Κ̇ϵ̲͟ Ϩ̕Κ̇ for the Eastern and
Western Flowpaths, as described in Section 1.3.1.3. Among the specific ecological benefits from
these future projects, freshwater releases to the Northern Estuaries would assist to normalize
salinity and dissolved oxygen and reduce turbidity and nitrification. Furthermore, STAs, storage
reservoirs, and ASR wells are anticipated to improve the quality of water in the region (WCAs,
estuaries, and C-51 East Basin). Finally, implementation of BMPs to treat agricultural runoff
prior to discharge would reduce phosphorus levels in EAA waters.

4.19.1

COMPREHENSIVE EVERGLADES RESTORATION PLAN (CERP)

Described as the world's largest ecosystem restoration effort, CERP includes more than 60
major components. CERP is a regional system of water resource projects aligned to allow for
restoration of the Everglades while providing for other water-related needs of the region. The
major components are surface water storage reservoirs, water preserve areas, and
management of Lake Okeechobee as an ecological resource. Other major components include
underground water storage, treatment wetlands, improved water deliveries to the Everglades,

removal of barriers to sheet flow, storage of water in existing worries, re-use of wastewater,
pilot projects, improved water conservation, and additional feasibility studies. The many water
storage and conveyance modifications envisioned per the CERP are intended to enhance the
ability to improve the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of deliveries by capturing water
that is presently discharged to tide in excessive quantities and delivering that water to/through
the remaining Everglades. More information can be found at the CERP Web site
(http://www.evergladesplan.org/).

4.19.2

EXPEDITED PROJECTS (ACCELER8)

The Acceler8 Program was initiated by the state to accelerate the construction and operation of
critical CERP projects such that restoration benefits to Everglades might be realized at a faster
pace than might otherwise be possible given potential limitations on federal resources. The
Acceler8 projects initially consisted of eight projects which were accelerated by funding, design
and construction for Everglades restoration. The SFWMD expanded the initial eight projects to
support a number of other restoration and water quality initiatives underway in both the
Northern and Southern reaches of South Florida's interconnected ecosystem. Although the

STAs, significant reductions in phosphorus loads have been achieved through use of agricultural
BMPs within the adjacent EAA. Through WY 2011, the EAA BMPs have removed over 2,411
metric tons of phosphorus from farm runoff (SFWMD 2011). Additional background information
can be found in the annual South Florida Environmental Reports (SFWMD 2011).

LAKE OKEECHOBEE AND ESTUARY RECOVERY (LOER) PLAN

The Lake Okeechobee and Estuary Recovery (LOER) Plan would address water resource needs
and the ecological health of Lake Okeechobee and of the Northern Estuaries. It is meant to fasttrack capital projects by using state funds and incorporates construction projects, studies, and
policy changes. The construction components include reservoirs, STAs, and re-routing water
flows. The combined storage and phosphorus reduction benefits are estimated at 48,000 acrefeet and 65 to 75 metric tons. Some of the other components include establishing total
maximum daily load (TMDL) for Lake Okeechobee tributaries, implementing mandatory
fertilizer BMPs for agriculture and urban use, establishing revised ERP criteria for new
development in the Lake Okeechobee and Estuaries Watershed Basins, and, as discussed in the
next paragraph, revisions to the Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule. For more information

LAKE OKEECHOBEE REGULATION SCHEDULE STUDY (LORSS)

The Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule Study (LORSS) is the current regulation schedule for
Lake Okeechobee. LORSS is the re-evaluation of the prior operating schedule, Water Supply and

projects for water conveyance, storage, and treatment. The full benefit of the LORSS would
occur only with implementation of STAs, reservoirs, and canal conveyance projects associated
with Acceler8 and CERP projects.

NORTHERN EVERGLADES AND ESTUARIES PROTECTION PROGRAM

The Northern Everglades and Estuaries Protection Program (NEEPP) (Section 373.4595, Florida
Statutes, 2007) expanded the Lake Okeechobee Protection Act in Section 373.4595, Florida
Statutes (2000) to include protection of the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee River watersheds. It
was developed in response to legislative findings that the Lake Okeechobee, Caloosahatchee
River, and St. Lucie River watersheds are critical water resources of the state that have been,
and are continuing to be, adversely affected from changes to hydrology and water quality. The
NEEPP covers the Lake Okeechobee Watershed and the watersheds of the St. Lucie and
Caloosahatchee Estuaries. The primary intent of the NEEPP is: ϶̲̕ ̡̤̲̕ζΨ̲ Κ̎β ̤ζ̨̲̤̕ζ ̨͍̤πΚΨζ

PROPOSED U.S. SUGAR CORPORATION LAND ACQUISITION

The proposed U.S. Sugar Corporation Land Acquisition involves the purchase of approximately
26,800 acres south of Lake Okeechobee. Although the original goal was to purchase 187,000
acres of land, the SFWMD maintains the option to acquire 153,200 acres of additional lands if
future economic conditions allow. The purpose of the purchase is to acquire agricultural land
on which to build a highly engineered network of managed storage and treatment intended to
better manage the timing and quality of water delivered to the Everglades. The suite of projects
is referred to as the River of Grass project.

CENTRAL EVERGLADES PLANNING PROJECT

The goal of Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) is to implement a suite of restoration
projects in the central Everglades to prepare for congressional authorization, as part of the
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). CEPP would evaluate and develop
incremental project components that focus restoration on more natural flows into and through
the central and southern Everglades. This would be accomplished by re-establishing the
hydroperiods and hydropatterns that characterize the River of Grass project by (1) increasing
storage, treatment, and conveyance of water south of Lake Okeechobee, (2) removing and/or
plugging canals and levees within the central Everglades, and (3) retaining water within
Everglades National Park and protect urban and agricultural areas to the east from flooding,
Implementation of CEPP would allow more water to be directed south to the central
Everglades, Everglades National Park and Florida Bay while protecting coastal estuaries projects
on land already in public ownership. For more information on CEPP, visit the website:
http://evergladesplan.org/pm/projects/proj_51_cepp.aspx

4.20 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OFRESOURCES
Under NEPA guidelines, the EIS analysis includes a discussion on irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of resources as it pertains to the Action Alternatives. An irreversible commitment
of resources refers to effects to the resources that cannot be reversed or that would not be
reversed in a foreseeable amount of time. An example would be when a species becomes
extinct. Irretrievable commitment of resources describes a resource that is lost for a period of
time or as long as the action exists. For example, fishing productivity would be lost in an area
closed to be converted to oil exploration for as long as the oil exploration remains.
Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in the conversion of 10,517 acres of wetlands to
manipulated wetlands. Existing wetlands that are located in areas where placement of fill
would occur (construction of levees and filling canals) would be irreversibly lost; however, land,
including wetlands within the impoundments, would be converted or would remain wetland or
waters. Temporary, and possibly permanent, displacement would occur for some natural and
human resources during construction operations.

4.21 SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
The effects of the alternatives on the environment were evaluated. Many of the environmental
effects were similar between Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. However, changes to the affected
environment are seen in land use, soils/total phosphorus removal, surface water, water quality,
and wetland impacts as a result of the Alternatives and discussed further in Section 4.22.

4.22 IMPACT COMPARISON AND CONCLUSIONS
The environmental effects of the alternatives were evaluated and compared with the No Action
Alternative. Many of the environmental effects were similar for each of the Action Alternatives,
which are evaluated in detail in Chapter 4 and summarized in Section 4.21 (Table 4-16).
However, changes to the affected environment are seen in land use, soils/total phosphorus
removal, surface water, water quality, and wetland impacts as a result of the Alternatives. In
this evaluation, a cost benefit analysis was recognized between the alternatives and is an aid in
evaluating the environmental consequences. The differences in the affected environmental
factors, including the cost benefit analysis, are summarized below.
LAND USE
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would require the A-1 project site to be used primarily for water quality
purposes. Because the lands are to be used for environmental restoration purposes pursuant
to the Farm Bill and the Cooperating Agreement, the use of the land to provide water quality
benefits must also achieve environmental restoration benefits, as the lands were originally
purchased to provide. Therefore, each of the action alternatives would require approval for a
land use change from USFWS/DOI.
SOILS/TP CONCENTRATIONS
Lower phosphorus concentrations discharged from the STA 2 and STA 3/4 would reduce the
rate of soil phosphorus accumulation in WCA soils. Over time, reductions in soil total
phosphorus will help facilitate the restoration of impacted areas near the inflow points to WCA
2A and WCA 3A creating conditions more conducive to historic Everglades vegetative
communities. The FEBs proposed in Alternatives 2 and 3 have the potential to benefit soils
within STA 2 and STA 3/4 by maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of
dryout conditions. The probability of experiencing dryout conditions in STA 2 and STA 3/4 is
greatest under Alternative 4 (STA). In general, as additional STA acreage is added (as in
Alternative 4), the potential risk of STA dryout, and associated impacts to phosphorus removal
performance within existing and new STAs, increases, whereas, when additional storage is
added (as in Alternative 2 and 3), the potential for dryout within existing STAs decreases.

HYDROPERIOD ANALYSIS
Alternative 2 has the least change in hydroperiod in WCA 2A, while Alternative 3 has the least
change in hydroperiod in WCA 3A. Alternative 4 has no change in the hydroperiod in either
WCA. The hydroperiod changes that are simulated to occur are for all the Action Alternatives
are limited to a small percentage of area within WCA-2A (0.6 ̌ 3.1%) and WCA-3A (0.2 ̌ 2.2%).
The minor differences in WCA-2A hydroperiods for Alternatives 2 and 3 occur mainly due to a
shift in the location of WCA-2A inflows from S-7 to the L-6 Canal, however the total inflow
volumes to WCA-2A are approximately equivalent. The hydroperiod changes that occur in WCA3A are most likely due to the different structural and operational characteristics related to the
facilities (Shallow FEB, Deep FEB, STA) evaluated within the project site.
WATER QUALITY
The purpose of the project is to assist STA 2 and STA 3/4 in meeting water the WQBEL at
discharges from the STAs into the Everglades Protection Area. The No Action Alternative does
not meet the project purpose since STA 3/4 would not meet the WQBEL at the STA outflow.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 are projected to meet the WQBEL at outflows from both STAs.
The WQBEL requires that STA discharges shall not exceed: 1) 13 ppb as an annual flowweighted mean in more than three out of five water years on a rolling basis; and 2) 19 ppb as
an annual flow-weighted mean in any water year.

WETLANDS
Natural wetlands will be permanently altered within the boundaries of the project site as
unavoidable adverse wetland and surface water impacts would occur due to placement of fill
and excavation. Jurisdictional wetland impacts for levee fill vary between each alternative since

each project would require specific width, heights, and location of levees. Jurisdictional
wetland impacts for levee fill are greatest with Alternative 3 because the taller levees require a
wider base. Jurisdictional wetland impacts for Alternative 4 require external and internal
levees. Alternative 4 also requires excavation and fill in Holey Lands to construct a canal and
with berms/levees. The Shallow FEB has the lowest wetland impacts of the Action Alternatives.
Jurisdictional wetland impacts are least for the No Action Alternative. Below is a table
summarizing the wetland impacts for each alternative.

COST
Each of the alternatives would require approval for a land use change. The No Action
Alternative does not meet the project purpose since STA 3/4 would not meet the WQBEL at the
STA outflow. However, Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would meet the WQBEL for STAs 2 and 3/4.
Although meeting the WQBEL, the probability of experiencing dryout conditions in STA 2 and
STA 3/4 is greatest under Alternative 4 (STA) while Alternatives 2 and 3 offer the greatest
benefit to reducing dryout conditions. Alternative 2 would result in the least amount of
wetland impacts. In weighing the merits and drawbacks of the various alternatives, a cost
benefit analysis was also considered in this evaluation since the project is funded with tax-payer

dollars and the impacts to the public could assist in determining an important qualitative
consideration.
Of the Alternatives that are projected to meet the WQBEL at the outflow from both STA 2 and
STA 3/4, Alternative 2 is the least expensive. Alternative 3 required additional excavation for
the Deep FEB for an inflow pump station and fill material for larger levees, as well as the
seepage cutoff wall and additional protection features needed for flood protection. This
alternative would utilize more excavated rock that is already on site. Alternative 4 (STA) would
require additional levees to separate the EAV and SAV cells, as well as a new discharge canal
within Holey Land.

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

5.0 MITIGATION
As defined by the Council on Environmental Quality, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) §1508.20, mitigation requirements include the following:
• Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
• Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its
implementation;
• Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
environment;
• Reducing or eliminating the impacts over time by preservation and maintenance
operations during the life of the action; and
• Compensating for the impacts by replacing or providing substitute resources or
environments.
Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404(b)(1) guidelines implemented through 40
CFR Part 230, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) shall be required to
avoid and minimize impacts to waters of the United States (US), then provide compensatory
mitigation for unavoidable adverse impacts. Mitigation measures for the Action
Alternatives were identified as best management practices (BMPs) and compensatory
mitigation, which are discussed in the following sections.

5.1

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS

5.1.1 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
During construction activities for all Action Alternatives, the SFWMD would implement
standard construction BMPs to avoid affecting the surrounding environments. Standard
construction BMPs include, but are not limited to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Installing siltation fences to prevent erosion and to provide turbidity barriers to
minimize suspended solids in the water column;
Downstream turbidity shall be monitored to ensure state turbidity standards (29
nephelometric turbidity units) are not exceeded;
Watering construction sites and roads to reduce dust generation;
Suspending surface-disturbing activities such as grading during periods of particularly
high winds;
Maintaining construction equipment according to the manufacturer’s specifications;
Transporting demolition debris to a landfill or otherwise disposed of in accordance with
federal, state, and local requirements;

A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

5-1

February 2013

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

7.

Prior to construction, dewatering permits shall be issued by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) under Chapter 373 F.S. The permit would include
requirements for the construction contractor to submit a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan, which includes turbidity control and monitoring plans; and
8. Although not anticipated for any of the Action Alternatives, if relocation of utility lines is
needed, the SFWMD shall coordinate formally with Florida Power and Light once the
design process is complete.

5.1.2 THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES AND SPECIES OF CONCERN
Although specific details will be developed as consultation occurs between the US Amy
Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), it is anticipated
that at a minimum, the following measures shall be incorporated during project
construction to minimize effects on any threatened or endangered species that may occur
in the construction site: a) Standard Protection Measures for the Eastern Indigo Snake
(2004); b) Habitat Guidelines for the Wood Stork in the Southeast Region (2009); and c)
Everglades Snail Kite Management Guidelines (2009).

5.1.3 HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE
Under the No Action Alternative, the land may be leased or sold for agricultural use. If
agricultural activities would commence on the project site, there is the potential for release
of petroleum or agricultural chemicals, which would be subject to regulation under the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection. During previous construction activities for
the A-1 Reservoir, the SFWMD partially remediated a tract of land north of the project site,
referred to as the Woerner Tract, by excavating contaminated soils with elevated levels of
toxaphene. Portions of the Woerner Track still contain elevated levels of toxaphene.
However, under all of the Action Alternatives, those areas of known soil contamination have
been excluded from the project footprint so no mitigative measures are required.
For Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, there would be no dumping of oil, fuel, or hazardous wastes in
the work area and safe and sanitary measures for disposal of solid wastes would be
required. A spill prevention plan shall also be required.

5.2

WETLAND IMPACTS

In accordance with the CWA Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines 40 CFR Part 230, wetland and
aquatic resource impacts are first avoided, then minimized to the maximum extent
practicable. Section 404 of the CWA requires compensatory mitigation to replace aquatic
resource functions unavoidably lost or adversely affected by authorized activities.

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

Mitigation must meet the requirements of the 2008 Mitigation Rule, 40 CFR Part 230 and 33
CFR Parts 325 and 332. The following sections discuss the project’s impacts to wetlands and
the compensatory mitigation proposed.

5.2.1 SITE CONDITIONS
The A-1 project site contains 16,152 acres of land of which 14,705 acres are wetlands and
1,447 acres are uplands. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 will involve the placement of fill material
within wetlands to construct levees, berms, pump stations. The alternatives also propose
to excavate soils to remove stockpiled material and fill interior ditches and canals to achieve
designed elevations. The impacts to waters of the US for each alternative are described
below. The actual wetland acreages may slightly change for each alternative as the designs
of each project are completed.

5.2.2 DIRECT IMPACTS
The wetland impacts for each alternative are summarized on Table 5.1:

Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under the No Action Alternative, the site could either remain undisturbed or the SFWMD
could lease or possibly sell the property to allow agricultural activities to resume. If the site
were to remain undisturbed, there would be no impacts to wetlands or waters of the US;
therefore, there would be no compensatory mitigation requirements. If the agricultural
activities would resume on the project site, the wetlands would be cleared of vegetation,

Compensatory Mitigation

and pumping would drain the water off of the lands. Although the work associated with the
agricultural activites would result in an overall loss of wetlands, the agricultural activities
are exempt under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

5.2.2.2

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)

The direct impacts associated with Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) result in 537 acres of
wetlands and waters of the US as a result of levee and canal fill, as well as canal excavation.
Of the 537 acres of impacts, 296.5 acres of wetlands would be filled to construct the levee,
164.5 acres of canals and ditches would be filled to raise the elevation of the ditch/canal to
be consistent with the adjacent wetlands, and 76 acres of canal would be excavated.

5.2.2.3

Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)

The direct impacts associated with Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) result in 626 acres of wetlands
and waters of the US as a result of levee fill as well as canal excavation. Of the 626 acres of
impacts, 550 acres of wetlands would be filled to construct the levee and 76 acres of canal
would be excavated. Alternative 3 would not require fill in canals or ditches.

5.2.2.4

Alternative 4 (STA)

The direct impacts associated with Alternative 4 (STA) result in 1,055 acres wetlands and
waters of the US as a result of levee and canal fill, canal excavation, and excavation/fill of
freshwater wetlands. Of the 1,055 acres of impacts, 370 acres of wetlands would be filled to
construct the levee, 164.5 acres of canals and ditches would be filled, 270 acres of canals
would be excavated, and 250 acres of freshwater wetlands would be impacted (125 acres of
excavation to dig the canal and 125 acres of fill to build the levee adjacent to the canal) to
construct a canal connection within the Holey Land Wildlife Management Area.

5.3

COMPENSATORY WETLAND MITIGATION

The SFWMD provided a compensatory wetland mitigation plan for their preferred
alternative, the Shallow FEB, which includes hydrologic and vegetation benefits within the
footprint of the project (Appendix C). Although each alternative would vary in degree of onsite ecological benefits, it is anticipated that the hydrology and the vegetation community
within the footprint of the project would change by retaining additional water on the site.
The SFWMD is proposing to receive credit for providing and retaining the hydrology within
the project footprint and improving the aquatic habitat. Although the attenuation of water
within the footprint is expected to decrease soil loss due to oxidation and reduce water
column total phosphorous from the No Action Alternative, the various depth of water and

Compensatory Mitigation

differing operation plans would result in different site conditions between the Alternatives.
Each Alternative would contain different wetland communities, each supporting different
wetland dependent birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and animal species. Therefore,
each Action Alternative would have different aquatic function and values.
Under Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, the SFWMD would remove exotic vegetation as maintenance
once the proposed project is constructed. Routine maintenance of the levees, as well as any
wetland areas within the project footprint would also be performed. Reporting
maintenance activities, as well as monitoring the vegetation is included in the South Florida
Environmental Report (SFER), which is produced annually and provided to the USACE and all
interested parties.
Hydrologic monitoring and water quality monitoring shall also be conducted as part of
normal operations. The monitoring shall be consistent with permit compliance for the
constructed project and for operational improvements. This information is also reported on
an annual basis in the SFER.

5.3.1 HYDROLOGICAL AND VEGETATION IMPROVEMENTS
Currently, hydrology on the A-1 project site is rainfall driven. During the rainy season, over
12 inches of standing water can be seen in the wetlands. Conversely, no standing water is
present in the wetlands during the dry season. The site contains four types of waters of the
US: canals and ditches, scraped wetlands, scrub/shrub wetlands, and exotic scrub/shrub
wetlands.
The canals are approximately 50 feet wide and estimated 12 feet deep while the ditches are
20 feet wide and estimated 6 feet deep. The canals and ditches contain floating aquatic
vegetation consisting of spatter-dock (Nuphar spp.) and water lettuce (Pistia Stratiotes).
The canals and ditches typically support wildlife species such as alligators, turtles, and fish.
The scraped wetlands contain a variety of wetland plant species, such as water primrose
(Ludwigia peruviana), bushy aster (Aster dumosus), marsh fleabane (Pluchea rosea), flatsedge (Cyperus spp.), jointed spikerush (Eleocharis interstincta), and water-hyssops (Bacopa
caroliniana). Typical water depths in this wetland community are approximately 6 inches of
water.
The scrub/shrub wetlands, species such as Carolina willow (Salix caroliniana), wand
goldenrod (Solidago stricta), bushy broomsedge (Andropogon glomeratus), salt bush
(Baccharis glomerulifolia), elephant grass, primrose willow (Ludwigia peruviana) and cattail
(Typha spp.). Typical water depths in this wetland community are approximately 12 inches.
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

5-5

February 2013

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

The exotic scrub/shrub wetlands contain 90% nuisance and exotic species dominated with
Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and castor bean (Ricinus communis). Typical water
depths in this wetland community are approximately 12 inches.
On October 29, 2012, a multi-agency site visit was conducted by the SFWMD, FDEP, USFWS,
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the USACE, and again on
December 5, 2012 (USACE did not attend). The FDEP completed a detailed field visit report
on for each site visit (Appendix C). The field report depicts the route taken by vehicle around
the A-1 project site, and shows photographs of the various wetland communities and
hydrological conditions on various portions of the site.

5.3.1.1

Alternative 1 (No Action)

In the event agricultural activities would resume, the area would be drained and there
would be a loss of hydrology on the project site. The natural wetland vegetation would be
removed and the site would be planted with agricultural vegetation, possibly sugar cane or
sod.

5.3.1.2

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)

Under Alternative 2, the four wetland communities would be converted from the existing
condition, as described in the No Action Alternative, to a freshwater marsh consisting
primarily of cattail (Typha domingensis). Other native species expected within the shallow
FEB may consist of emergent aquatic vegetation (EAV) such as sawgrass (Cladium
jamaicense), Carolina willow (Salix caroliniana), bulrush (Scirpus spp), pickerel weed
(Pontederia cordata), duck potato (Sagittaria lancifolia), and Illinois pondweed
(Potamogeton illinoensis).
The Shallow FEB would contain water depths ranging from 0 to 4 feet, and is expected to be
inundated with approximately 1.5 feet or more of water for 60% of the time. The monthly
water depths average between 1 and 3.5 feet, with levels around 1-foot for 6 months out of
the year. The Shallow FEB would be operated in a manner to ensure the STA contains
appropriate water levels. The Shallow FEB would be operated to take up to 4 feet of water
and continue to store the excess water even if the water levels remain high for a period of
time that negatively affects the vegetation. During this period of time of high water within
the Shallow FEB, the wetland community within the FEB is expected to be freshwater marsh
vegetation. Conversely, the Shallow FEB most likely dry earlier than the existing STAs and
may not contain standing water during the dry periods. During this time, it is anticipated
that the Shallow FEB would contain wet prairie vegetation. Therefore, the ecological

Compensatory Mitigation

benefit or “lift” of both hydrology and vegetation will be affected by the changes and may
not be as beneficial as a typical restoration project.

5.3.1.3

Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)

For the deep FEB, the four wetland communities would be converted from the existing
condition, as described in the No Action Alternative, to a vegetation community consisting
mainly of freshwater floating aquatic vegetation (FAV) species, similar to those found in the
canals and ditches.
Alternative 3 would contain water depths ranging from 0 to 12.5 feet, and is expected to be
inundated with approximately 1.5 feet or more of water for 60% of the time and depths
greater than 4 feet 30% of the time. Due to the greater depth capacity, this Alternative may
hold additional water during excess rain events. The monthly water depths average
between two and five feet, with water levels around 2 feet for 7 months out of the year.
Similar to the Shallow FEB, the Deep FEB will also be operated in a manner that ensures the
STAs 2 and 3/4 receive preferential quantities of water to ensure more consistent water
levels in the STAs. Similar to the Shallow FEB, the anticipated lift may not be as beneficial as
a typical restoration project.

5.3.1.4

Alternative 4 (STA)

The STA would have a maximum operating depth of 4 feet. For the STA alternative, the four
wetland communities would be converted from the existing condition, as described in the
No Action Alternative, to two types of wetland communities: EAV and submerged aquatic
vegetation (SAV). The STA would be designed to route water through specified EAV cells or
SAV cells, each with a specific operating depth to support the wetland community. EAV
cells would be operated at target depths between 1.25 and 1.5 feet of water, while the SAV
cells would be operated at target depths between 1.5 and 2.0 feet of water during normal
operations. The vegetation community expected in the EAV cells consist of sawgrass
(Cladium jamaicense), Carolina willow (Salix caroliniana), bulrush (Scirpus spp), pickerel
weed (Pontederia cordata), duck potato (Sagittaria lancifolia), and Illinois pondweed
(Potamogeton illinoensis), while the vegetation found in the SAV cells would include native
plant species similar to the EAV but may also contain coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum),
muskgrass (Chara spp.), pondweeds [Potamogeton spp. (esp. P. illinoensis, P. pusillus)], and
Southern naiad (Najas quadalupensis).
Alternative 4 would contain water depths ranging from 0 to 4 feet, and is expected to be
inundated with approximately 1.5 feet or more of water for 60% of the time. The proposed
STA would contain average monthly water depths between 1.5 and 2.5 feet, with levels
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

5-7

February 2013

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

around 1.5 feet for 6 months out of the year. The STA would be operated as an additional
STA and would not be utilized to store excess water or provide water preferentially to STA 2
or STA 3/4 to ensure more consistent water levels in those STAs. As seen in the existing
STAs, the emergent and submerged cells are heavily utilized by a variety of wildlife species
including wading birds, ducks, hawks, fish, amphibians, and alligators. However, once
operated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the
wetlands within the proposed STA would no longer be jurisdictional waters of the United
States and therefore, may not be appropriate to be utilized as compensatory mitigation.

5.4

UMAM ASSESSMENT

The USACE utilizes Unified Mitigation Assessment Methodology (UMAM) to determine the
function and value of the wetlands. The SFWMD has performed a preliminary UMAM
assessment and submitted their UMAM proposal for the pre- and post-project conditions
for review. The UMAM specifically assessed the construction and operation of the
SFWMD’s preferred alternative, the shallow FEB. If another alternative is selected as the
least environmentally damaging practical alternative, the SFWMD will provide a separate
UMAM assessment for the other alternative. However, the USACE is providing an
estimated UMAM score for the other alternatives (Deep FEB and STA) for purposes of this
Environmental Impacts Statement (EIS). These scores have not been reviewed by the
applicant or the coordinating agencies, but will be finalized after public review and provided
in the final EIS.

5.4.1 ALTERNATIVE 2 (SHALLOW FEB)
ased on the SFWMD’s assessment, the impacts from the Shallow FEB project would result
in a loss of 296.5 acres of wetlands as a result of fill to construct the levees, 164.5 acres of
fill in canals and 75.8 acres of excavation in canals. The SFWMD is proposing that the post
project site conditions within the Shallow FEB would improve the aquatic function and value
from the existing site conditions. By providing hydrology to the wetlands and improving
elevations, the low quality wetlands on the site would be improved. Wetland impacts
resulting from construction of the Shallow FEB would result in the loss of 269.37 functional
capacity units while the improvements to the wetlands within the interior of the shallow
FEB may result in a gain of 2916.6 functional capacity units (FCUs). Overall, the project may
result in a net gain of 2647.23 functional capacity units. See Table 5-2 and Table 5-3 below
for a breakdown of the impacts and the credits. The UMAM sheets are included in this draft
EIS as Attachment 2 (UMAM Mitigation Sheets).
There are concerns for on-site mitigation as an acceptable proposal. The proposed
compensation would migitate shallow, short hydroperiods wetlands (marsh and shrub

wetlands) for deeper and longer hydroperiod wetland marshes. The shallow, short
hydroperiod wetlands are unique in that they are flooded during the wet season, then dryout and act as uplands. The cooperating agencies have initially reviewed the SFWMD’s
UMAM score for the Shallow FEB and have raised concerns with the time lag and risk.
Further discussion with the agencies will occur to finalize the proposed compensation.

Compensatory Mitigation

5.4.2 ALTERNATIVE 3 (DEEP FEB)
The Deep FEB would not offer wetland benefits on the project site since the reservoir would
be operated at depths up to 12.5 feet. The Deep FEB is anticipated to exhibit longer
durations of water at deeper water depths, which is expected to encourage floating aquatic
vegetation to establish in the Deep FEB. Rooted wetland vegetation is not anticipated to
establish at times when the Deep FEB contains deeper water depths, and therefore, the site
may not exhibit characteristics of a wetland but rather an open water pond or lake.
Therefore, the reservoir itself would not be an appropriate mitigation to offset the wetland
impacts. The USACE would require that the applicant provide an alternative compensatory
mitigation plan, possibly at a federally approved mitigation bank or another appropriate
offsite location. The construction of the Deep FEB would result in impacts to 626 acres of
waters of the US, including 550 acres of wetland impacts as a result in fill and 75.8 acres of
impacts as a result of excavation in canals and ditches. The construction of the Deep FEB
would require 314.2 FCUs to be offset (Table 5-4).

5.4.3 ALTERNATIVE 4 (STA)
ased on the US!E’s draft assessment, the impacts resulting from construction of the ST!
may result in a loss of 501.5 functional capacity units. See Table 5-5 below for a breakdown
of the impacts. The SFWMD has not provided a compensatory mitigation plan for
Alternative 4. The USACE has concerns that the STA itself may not be appropriate
mitigation. The STA, once operated, would no longer be considered a water of the US as it
would be operated under a NPDES permit. Also, the use of constructed treatment wetlands
as compensatory mitigation conflicts with USEP!’s Guiding Principles for Constructed
Treatment Wetlands, which states “in general, wetlands constructed or restored for the
primary purpose of treating wastewater will not be recognized as compensatory mitigation

to offset wetland losses” (!ppendix ). As such, STAs are not typically utilized as
compensatory mitigation. However, some exceptions have been permitted by the USACE in
cases where the STA itself is for environmental restoration purposes and the losses are
offset only for agricultural wetlands. If the SFWMD were to propose environmental
benefits within the interior of the STA as their compensatory mitigation plan, further
coordination with the USEPA would be required.

LEDGER SYSTEM

The SFWMD’s UM!M assessment for Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) may result in a surplus of
potential credits. The SFWMD is proposing to utilize the remaining credits to offset any
unavoidable wetland impacts for future SFWMD’s Restoration Strategies projects. The
SFWMD is proposing to create a ledger system to utilize any excess credits generated as a
result of this project for future SFWMD Restoration Strategies projects. The SFWMD’s
proposed surplus is approximately 2,650 credits (Table 5-6).

Compensatory Mitigation

The USACE is evaluating whether it is appropriate to utilize the shallow FEB for
compensatory mitigation to offset wetland impacts for future projects. The shallow FEB will
be operated as a water storage site to enhance the operation of the STAs. The shallow FEB
will accept water during storm events, and supply water to the STA during the dry season.
The USACE expects that the Shallow FEB would be susceptible to more drastic changes in
water elevations and sacrificially experience dry-out conditions for the STAs. The USACE
recognizes that this is a great benefit for water quality purposes within the EPA and an
improvement to the current site conditions on the Shallow FEB site; however, the effects
that such extreme hydrology may have on the wetlands on the project site have not been
fully evaluated and may not make appropriate mitigation to offset impacts for other sites.

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

6.0 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
Coordination with and evaluation of required compliance with specific federal acts,
executive orders, and other policies for the various alternatives was achieved, in part, by
coordinating this document with appropriate agencies and the public. This section
documents compliance with all applicable federal statutes, executive orders, and
policies.

6.1

CLEAN AIR ACT OF 1970, AS AMENDED

The initial Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 and was dramatically revised and expanded
in 1990, giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) broader authority to
implement and enforce regulations that reduce acid rain, urban air pollution, and toxic
air emissions. As described in Chapter 8, air quality permits may be required for pump
stations. The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) will apply for these
permits, which the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the
USEPA will review, if necessary. The Proposed Action complies with this statute.

6.2

CLEAN WATER ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 became commonly
known as the Clean Water Act (CWA) with its amendment in 1977. The act established
the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United
States. The Proposed Action would assist existing stormwater treatment areas (STAs) in
making progress towards achieving water quality goals for total phosphorus in the
Everglades Protection Area (EPA). As described in Chapter 8, the construction of the
shallow FEB, deep FEB or Reservoir, or STA alternatives would require a CWA, Section
404 Dredge and Fill Permit issued by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The
applicability of Section 404 triggers Section 401 Water Quality Certification of the CWA.
A Section 404 permit application has been submitted to USACE.
In addition, the STAs also require, and have been issued a Section 402, National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit by Florida DEP. This permit requires
compliance with applicable state water quality standards.
The Proposed Action complies with the CWA of 1972, as amended.

6.3

COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1972

The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, provides the national policy to
preserve, protect, develop, and restore the nation’s coastal zones and was established
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin
Draft Environmental Impact Statement

6-1

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

to encourage states to better manage their coastal resource. The statute assists coastal
states in developing state coastal management programs and achieving a balance
between competing uses of coastal resources. The statute requires that federal actions
that may affect any land or water use of the coastal zone be “consistent” with the
enforceable policies of a coastal state’s or territory’s federally approved coastal
management program. The Proposed Action is consistent with the Florida Coastal
Management Program. No comments on the Notice of Intent (NOI) for this
environmental impact statement (EIS) have been submitted by the Florida State
Clearinghouse.

6.4

ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OF 1973

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 replaced the Endangered Species Conservation Act
of 1969 and provides protections for species that are threatened or endangered
throughout all or a significant portion of their geographic range and the habitats that
those species use. In the ES!, “endangered” species are defined as in danger of
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, “threatened” species are
likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a
significant portion of its range, and “species of special concern” might need
concentrated conservation actions. The EIS assesses effects to all federal and state listed
species that are expected to occur in the project-affected area, described in Chapter 3.
Coordination for threatened and endangered species was initiated with USFWS on
December 10, 2012. Per agreement between USACE and USFWS, the biological
assessment (BA) for the project site will determine the effects to listed species by
comparing the baseline condition defined as the projects that have been previously
consulted with the USFWS to the changes resulting from the construction and operation
of the applicant’s preferred alternative. ! biological opinion will be obtained from
USFWS before USACE issues the record of decision (ROD) and makes a permit decision
on the Section 404 permit application. The US!E’ decision will comply with the ES!.

6.5

ESTUARY PROTECTION ACT OF 1968

The Estuary Protection Act emphasizes the values of estuaries and the need to conserve
these natural resources. The Act authorized an inventory and studies of U.S. estuaries to
determine whether these areas should be acquired by the federal government for
protection, and authorized cost-sharing between the federal and state governments for
management of estuary resources.
Water management in Lake Okeechobee periodically involves releasing large quantities
of water into these estuaries, resulting in changes in salinity and in dissolved oxygen
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

content, increased turbidity, and nutrification within the estuaries. None of the action
alternatives would change freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee to the Northern
Estuaries, which include the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee Estuaries and the Indian River
Lagoon. Therefore, all of the action alternatives would not change the frequency,
duration, or timing of lake releases. The alternatives discussed within this document
would not adversely affect estuaries nor increase the frequency and/or duration of
releases to the estuaries. The project complies with this statute.

6.6

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11990, PROTECTION OF WETLANDS

Executive Order 11990 requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, the
adverse impacts associated with destruction or modification of wetlands. The action
complies with the goals of this executive order.

6.7

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988, FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT

Executive Order 11988 requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, the
long and short-term adverse impacts associated with occupancy and modification of
floodplains. It further directs federal agencies to avoid direct and indirect support of
floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative. The project is in the
base floodplain (100-year flood) and has been evaluated in accordance with this
executive order. The action is in compliance.

6.8

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866, REGULATORY PLANNING AND REVIEW

Executive Order 12866 aims to improve the process of planning and reviewing of
regulations and to make it more efficient. Its objective is to re-establish the federal
government’s primary position in the regulatory decision-making process and to make
the process more accessible to the public. This Executive Order is intended only to
improve the internal management of the Federal Government. The action is in
compliance.

6.9

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12875, ENHANCING THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL
PARTNERSHIP

The purpose of Executive Order 12875 is to enhance intergovernmental consultation
and collaboration on federal matters and to prevent the federal government from
imposing unfunded regulations on state, local, and tribal governments. It prohibits
federal agencies from putting into effect any regulations that are not required by
statute unless the affected state, local, and tribal governments are provided funds by
A-1 Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

the federal government. However, this executive order only applies to those regulations
which the federal government has the power to waiver. It requires federal agencies to
provide the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a representation of all
consultations and collaborations that occur between the agency and the affected
governments. This executive order also requires that the federal agency allow time for
state, local, and tribal governments to participate in the development of such
regulations. The agency shall take into account any application provided by the affected
government to waiver regulatory requirements in order to provide flexibility to the
affected government as long as these are in compliance with the federal policy
objectives. The action is in compliance.

6.10 EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Executive Order 12898 requires federal agencies to identify and address, as appropriate,
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.
Executive Order 12898 requires the Federal government to review the effects of their
programs and actions on minorities and low income communities. As described in
Chapter 4, the effects of the Proposed Action would not be disproportionate toward any
minority or low-income populations. The action complies with the goals of this
Executive Order.

6.11 EXECUTIVE ORDER 13112, INVASIVE SPECIES
Executive Order 13112 requires federal agencies to, among other tasks, prevent the
introduction of invasive species, monitor invasive species populations, restore native
species and habitat where invasions have occurred, and promote public education. The
proposed Action Alternatives would reduce total phosphorus loading, which should
reduce the proliferation of invasive cattails in the EPA. This action complies with this
executive order.

6.12 FARMLAND PROTECTION POLICY ACT OF 1981
The purpose of the Farmland Protection Policy !ct (FPP!) is to “minimize the extent to
which Federal programs contribute to the unnecessary conversion of farmland to
nonagricultural uses...” The act specifically targets the urban sprawl resulting from the
conversion, and the associated wastes of resources and energy. This project has been
coordinated with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and complies with
this statute.

6.13 FISH AND WILDLIFE COORDINATION ACT OF 1958
The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) requires that fish and wildlife receive
equal consideration as other project components for proposed water resource
development projects and that appropriate mitigation for impacts be provided. This
statute is implemented through consultation with the USFWS.
As described in Chapter 7, the Department of Interior (DOI) and the USFWMD are
cooperating agencies in developing this EIS. An ongoing consultation process between
the USACE and the USFWS has involved regular communication and exchange of input
between the agencies through monthly interagency coordination meetings, public
scoping meetings, and correspondence. A final record of the USFWS determination is
included in the Final EIS in Appendix L.

6.14 MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION ACT
The 1996 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (MSFCMA) mandated NMFS and the Fisheries Management Council
include the identification and protection of essential fish habitat (EFH) in all federal
fishery management plans. NMFS implements and enforces the MSFCMA through
consultation with federal agencies required for any federally funded, permitted, or
proposed work that may affect EFH. As documented in Chapter 3, no EFH exists within
the footprint of the project or within an extended distance of the proposed project. As a
result, consultation with NMFS was not initiated. The Proposed Action complies with
this statute.

6.15 MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED
The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits the taking of marine mammals in U.S.
waters and by U.S. citizens on the high seas, and also prohibits importation of marine
mammals and marine mammal products into the United States. The only marine
mammal known to enter waterways within the EAA is the West Indian manatee. The
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) Interagency Manatee Task Force
showed that manatees navigated through the Okeechobee Waterway and accessed the
EAA canals through the gates at the S- 351, S-352 and S-354 structures (CERP
Interagency Manatee Task Force, 2006). (The task force is made up of representatives
from USFWS, FWC, USACE, USGS, the National Park Service, the Miami-Dade
Department of Environmental Resources Management, and private researchers.)
Subsequently, manatee barriers have been installed at these control structures;

therefore, manatees are not expected within canals adjacent to the project. The
Proposed Action complies with the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

6.16 MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT OF 1918, AS AMENDED, AND THE
MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION ACT
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918, as amended, prohibits pursuing, hunting,
taking, capturing, killing, or selling migratory birds, as identified in the Act, through
international conventions between the United States and Great Britain, Mexico, Japan,
Canada, and Russia. The Migratory Bird Conservation Act establishes a Migratory Bird
Conservation Commission that makes decisions acquiring lands or waterbodies
identified by the Secretary of the Interior as necessary for the conservation of migratory
birds.
Many wading birds, including the wood stork, use the project area for foraging. Wading
birds were observed feeding in the footprint of the proposed project, but no nesting
activity was observed during the site visits in October and November 2012. Foraging
habitat within the project site is marginal because of past land-use practices and
encroachment by exotic plant species. It is anticipated that the construction of a shallow
FEB or a STA would improve foraging habitat within the STA expansion, but the
construction of the deep FEB would not improve foraging habitat due to the deep water
depths. No migratory birds or their nests will be adversely affected by the Proposed
Action. This action complies with these statutes.

6.17 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF 1969
The purpose of the National Environmental Policy !ct (NEP!) is “To declare a national
policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his
environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the
environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the
understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation;
and to establish a Council on Environmental Quality” (42 US Section 4321). It
encourages public participation and comment, and it ensures that all branches of
government consider environmental consequences of federal projects.
NEPA requires environmental impacts be considered within the federal decision-making
process. Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) established regulations for
implementing NEPA (under Title 40 CFR Section 1500). The USACE has its own
supplemental regulations for complying with NEPA (33 CFR 320) for its Civil Works
Program. These regulations call for the preparation of an EIS for authorization of any

major federal project that could have significant effects on the environment. The USACE
Jacksonville District Commander is the responsible official for NEPA actions within the
district. Ultimately, the decision whether to implement the Proposed Action, one of the
other Action Alternatives, or the No Action Alternative will be made at USACE
Headquarters in Washington DC. Any decision made will be in compliance with NEPA.
As stated above, NEPA requires environmental impacts be considered within the federal
decision-making process. The decision to grant an approval for a change in land use
under the Grant Agreement is a federal decision as contemplated by NEPA.
NEPA requires agencies to cooperate with other federal agencies and state and local
governments, and to involve public stakeholders or citizens. Chapter 8 and Appendix F
document the public involvement process completed as part of this EIS.

6.18 NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT OF 1966, AS AMENDED
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) was enacted to provide adequate
protection for historic resources, including archaeological sites. The National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP), National Historic Landmarks, and the posts of State Historic
Preservation Officers (SHPOs) were established under this act. NHPA requires federal
agencies to take into consideration the effects of their undertakings on cultural
resources that are listed in, eligible for, or nominated to the NRHP. Federal agencies
must consult with the SHPO and interested federally recognized Native American tribes.
Consultation with the Florida Department of State Division of Historical Resources was
initiated in 2006. A Phase 1 cultural resources survey report was prepared and
submitted to the SHPO. The SHPO found the report complete and sufficient in
accordance with Chapter 1A-46, FAC. Based on the report recommendations, SHPO
concluded that the construction of the A-1 Rreservoir would have no effect on any
historic properties eligible for listing on the NRHP (See Appendix F, SHPO letter dated
December 13, 2002).
In 2012, the SFWMD conducted a separate Phase 1 cultural resource assessment survey
of the A-1 project area. In the Cultural Resource Assesment Report, the Bureau of
Archeological Research concluded that there are no NRHP eligible sites in the project
area and did not recommend further archeological work at the A-1 project site. A copy
of the report is found in Appendix F. The SHPO is currently reviewing the CRAR to
determine if they concur with the ureau of !rcheological Research’s conclusions.

6.19 NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT
OF 1990
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatatriation Act of 1990 (25 USC 3001 et
seq.) establishes a means for American Indians to request the return or repatriation of
human remains and other cultural items presently held by Federal agencies or federally
assisted museums or institutions. The act also contains provisions regarding the
intentional excavation and removal of, inadvertent discovery of, and illegal trafficking in
American Indian human remains and cultural items. Major actions under this law
include: (a) establishing a review committee with monitoring and policymaking
responsibilities; (b) developing regulations for repatriation, including procedures for
identifying lineal descent or cultural affiliation needed for claims. (c) providing oversignt
of museum programs designed to meet the inventory requirements and deadlines of
this law; and (d) developing procedures to handle unexpected discoveries of graves or
grave goods during activities on Federal or tribal lands. All Federal agencies that
manage land or are responsible for archaeological collections obtained from their lands
or generated by their activities must comply with this act. USACE managers of ground
disturbing activities on Federal and tribal lands are to be aware of the statutory
provisions treating inadvertent discoveries of American Indian remains and cultural
objects. Regulations implementing the act are found at 43 CFR 10.

6.20 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 1976, AS
AMENDED
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) provides guidance for hazardous
waste disposal and gives USEPA the authority to establish waste management laws and
regulations. RR!’s primary goals are to protect human health and the environment
from the potential hazards of waste disposal, to conserve energy and natural resources,
to reduce the amount of waste generated, and to ensure that wastes are managed in an
environmentally sound manner. Chapter 3 discloses the results of investigations of
hazardous waste disposals in the project footprint. The proposed project would comply
with this statute.

6.21 SEMINOLE INDIAN CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1987
The Florida Indian (Seminole) Land Claims Settlement Act of 1987 directed the SFWMD
the State of Florida, and the Seminole Tribe to execute an agreement for the purposes
of resolving tribal land claims and settling the lawsuit filed by the Seminole Tribe of
Florida (Seminole Tribe), which involved certain land claims within the State.

Agreements to resolve tribal land claims were executed between the three parties,
which included conveyance of land and payment of consideration to the tribe, and
implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the
State of Florida. An agreement known as the Water Rights Compact (Compact) was
executed between the State of Florida, the SFWMD, and the Seminole Tribe. The
Compact specifically defined tribal water rights. This Compact was adopted into federal
and state law. It includes a series of provisions establishing the Seminole Tribe’s water
rights and creating several “entitlements” to surface water for each of the Tribe’s
reservations. This project would not alter the terms of the Compact.

6.22 SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL ACT OF 1965
The Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, as amended by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmenets of 1984 (42
USC 6901 et seq.) as amended, govern the transportation, treatment, storeage, and
disposal of hazardous waste and nonhazardous waste (that is, municipal solid waste).
Under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which amended the Solid
Waste Disposal Act of 1965, USEPA defines and identifies hazardous waste; establishes
standards for its transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal; and requires permits
for persons engaged in hazardous waste activities. Regulations imposed on a generator
or on a treatment, storage, or disposal facility vary according to the type and quantity of
hazardous waste generated, treated, stored, or disposed, and the methods of
treatment, storage, and disposal. The State of Florida has adopted by reference
portions of the Federal regulations into its Florida Administrative Code Rule 62-730.
Chapter 3 discloses the results of investigations of hazardous waste disposals in the
project footprint. The proposed project would comply with this statute.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), all agencies are required to consider all
environmental impacts for federal projects and federal rules. NEPA also requires agencies to
cooperate with other federal agencies, and with state and local governments, and to involve
public stakeholders or citizens. All persons and organizations that have a potential interest in
the Proposed Action are urged to participate in the NEPA environmental analysis process. These
persons and organizations may include federal, state, and local agencies; federally recognized
Indian tribes; interested stakeholders; and minority, low-income, or disadvantaged populations.

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

As part of public involvement, information describing the EIS process and the proposed project
was distributed following NEPA guidelines. The public scoping process was initiated when the
Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS for the proposed A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
(FEB) was published on August 28, 2012 [(77 FR 51981, Document No. 2012-21186, page
51981-51983) (Appendix E)]. The NOI provided information on the purpose and need for the
Proposed Action, background, the alternatives to be evaluated, and the geographic locations of
the project sites. The NOI further provided the date, time, and location for the scoping meeting
and the point of contact information at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to submit
comments and receive additional information.
Notification was sent on the USACE Corporate Communications e-notification list for Facebook,
YouTube, Twitter, and Flicker. A news release was published on August 29, 2012 that
requested input and comments on the project. The USACE also sent the public notice and
notice of intent to 598 interested parties who have requested to receive notifications on the
previous A-1 Reservoir mailing list, the list generated by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) for the A-1 Shallow FEB project, the Central Everglades
Planning Project (CEPP), the River of Grass project, and parties interested in the Everglades

Agricultural Area. The list includes a broad spectrum of interested parties encompassing private
individuals; local, county, state, and federal government and agencies; businesses; educational
institutions; elected officials at all levels; and special interest groups. Additionally, the public
scoping meeting and request for comments on the proposed project were announced on the
USACE Jacksonville District Web site at:
http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/PublicNotices.aspx.
In addition to posting information on the websites and mailings, the USACE conducted a
scoping meeting in West Palm Beach, Florida (Palm Beach County) on September 6, 2012 in an
effort to help identify significant issues and data gaps and to assist in evaluating the
alternatives, identifying other alternatives, and analyzing the potential impacts. The location
was selected on the basis of accessibility for the public throughout the primary regions affected
by the Proposed Action. Public stakeholders; representatives of federal, state, and local
agencies; and federally recognized Indian tribes were contacted through mail as part of the
scoping process. The mailing list was prepared using several lists of interested parties provided
by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), the FDEP, and USACE.
As interested parties were identified, the list was updated continuously throughout
development of the EIS. Anyone who requested information on the EIS was added to the
mailing list. Persons who attended the public scoping meetings or other meetings were also
added to the list. USACE considered the results of the scoping process to develop a range of
alternative actions, including the No Action Alternative, to develop this EIS and aid in its permit
decision. The overall scoping process consisted of the following elements:

AGENCY AND PUBLIC COMMENTS

Comments were received as a result of the public scoping meeting and in response to the
US!CE’s public notice. Comments were received verbally and written on comment cards at the
public scoping meeting, by email and by letter. The USACE considered the comments collected
during development of this EIS and all comments are included in the public administrative
record.

7.2.1 PUBLIC SCOPING MEETING – SEPTEMBER 6, 2012
Eighteen (18) people attended the scoping meeting in West Palm Beach (Table 7-1). Two
comments were received on comment cards, while five comments were made verbally (one of
which was also submitted on a comment card).

Suggests that the ruminant pond apple slough be restored south of Lake
Comment Form Okeechobee to reduce phosphorus levels. Also suggests flow is routed
through the Holey Land Wildlife Management Area and the Rotenberger
tract. Recommended incorporating or implementing the 1994 Recon
Study “Plan 6” but recognizes that the land is not acquired.
Verbal
Commenter reiterated comment made on the Public Comment Form
concerning the 1994 Recon Study Plan 6, and suggested pond apple slough
be restored south of Lake Okeechobee.
Verbal
Requested that a reservoir or deep FEB be evaluated as an alternative. The
alternative analysis should analyze the reservoir would have greater flow
attenuation that would have greater phosphorus reduction but would cost
more money.
Verbal
A question was asked about the difference between the A-1 and A-2 FEB.
The USACE provided a verbal response and clarified that the A1 FEB is
proposed by the SFWMD while the A-2 FEB is a separate project that is
part of the federal project, CEPP. CEPP is evaluating a separate A-2 FEB on
lands west of the A-1 project site as a federal Planning project. The EIS is
only for the SFWMD’s proposed project (the A-1 FEB) since they are
separate independent projects.
Verbal
The EIS process should compare the benefits with the cost as specified in
the White House document, Sustaining Environmental Capital: Protecting
Society and the Economy, a report completed in July 2011.

separate interagency scoping meeting was deemed not necessary and instead early agency
involvement occurred during weekly phone conference meetings and through the development
of the content of the draft EIS.

7.3.2 U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
The USACE will consult formally with the USFWS under the Endangered Species Act and provide
a Biological Assessment that analyzes the effects of the project on federally listed threatened or
endangered species.

7.3.3 STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE
The Bureau of Archaeological Research conducted a Phase I archaeological survey of the 16,593
acre A-1 project site in September 2012. The survey was conducted to comply with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665, as amended) and Section 267 of
the Florida Statutes to consider the effects upon historic properties and historic properties
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The survey also evaluated all
potential cultural resources in the project area. The Cultural Resource Assessment Report for
the A-1 project site was completed on September 27, 2012, and provided to the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO), Division of Historical Resources. The SHPO is reviewing the report.

7.4

TRIBAL COORDINATION

The USACE notified the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Seminole Tribe) and the Miccosukee Tribe of
Indians of Florida (Miccosukee Tribe) of the NOI, public notice, and public scoping meeting. On
September 4, 2012, the Seminole Tribe requested by letter that the USACE formally invite the
Seminole Tribe to participate in the NEPA process as a cooperating agency on the EIS. The
USACE and the Seminole Tribe discussed the request by telephone on September 17 and met in
person on September 27, 2012 to discuss the process and consider all possibilities of being a
cooperating agency. After the meeting on September 27, the Seminole Tribe provided a letter
stating that the NEPA and the federal Trust responsibility of formal coordination could occur
concurrently, and outlined outstanding issues: Environmental concerns with water sources,
flow routes and operation, and impacts to tribal lands and usage rights; and cultural resource
concerns with the broader landscape of environmental restoration projects. The Seminole
Tribe stated that they would reconsider their request to be a cooperating agency on the EIS.
For the Draft and Final EIS, the USACE will request Government-to-Government consultation
with all federally recognized Native American Indian Tribes with interests in the State of Florida,
including the Seminole Tribe and the Miccosukee Tribe. Consultation letters will be prepared
for the Seminole Tribe, the Miccosukee Tribe, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, the Seminole

Permits and Licenses

Chapter 8

8.0 PERMITS AND LICENSES
This section summarizes the federal permits and licenses that will be required for the
action alternatives. The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) is
responsible for obtaining the required regulatory documents and approvals. Chapter 6
described compliance with environmental requirements, which includes many of the
same agencies and regulatory requirements as described below.

8.1 CLEAN WATER ACT, SECTION 404 PERMIT
The construction of the shallow FEB, deep FEB or STA will require a Clean Water Act
Section 404 Permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Under Section
404 of the Clean Water Act, discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the
United States is subject to Section 404 regulation. This environmental impact statement
(EIS) has been prepared in accordance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
and Council on Environmental Quality Act (CEQ) regulations and will serve as the
primary document to aid the USACE in its decision to issue, issue with special conditions,
or deny the Section 404 Permit for the proposed project. A permit application has been
submitted to USACE. Once a Record of Decision (ROD) has been finalized for the EIS and
all NEPA requirements completed, final agency action for the U.S. Department of the
Army (DA) 404 permit will be made.

8.2 COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has the authority to administer
the federal Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) under the Coastal Zone
Management Act (CZMA). The purpose of the CZMP is to protect, preserve, develop,
restore, or enhance the coastal environment. States are required to develop coastal
management programs to protect and manage uses in the coastal zone. The Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) will determine CZMP consistency for
the proposed action.

8.3 SECTION 7 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
Under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), federal agencies are required to
consult with the USFWS and/or NMFS for activities that are funded, permitted, or
carried out that may affect federally listed species including designated critical habitat.
This project would require a Biological Opinion from the USFWS for the effects of the
project on the endangered Everglades snail kite. The USACE is in formal consultation
with the USFWS. The USFWS will finalize the Biological Opinion prior to final agency
action for the U.S. Department of the Army (DA) 404 permit.

Chapter 8

8.4 CLEAN AIR ACT
Pump stations would be required for the action alternatives, which may require a
permit under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Final pump station designs will be in compliance
with the requirement. The SFWMD would apply for these permits during the
construction phases, which FDEP and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
would review for compliance with the requirements of the CAA.

8.5 EVERGLADES FOREVER ACT PERMIT/SECTION 401 CERTIFICATION
Prior to issuance of a DA 404 permit, State Water Quality Certification (WQC) must be
provided. The FDEP will issue the WQC in the form of an Everglades Forever Act (EFA)
permit. Pursuant to Florida Statutes, Chapter 373.4592, Florida Legislature authorizes
FDEP to issue EFA permits to SFWMD for projects that are part of the long-term plan.
EFA permits required for construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities are
issued for 5-year terms and renewed as appropriate. SFWMD has submitted
applications implement new permit-related compliance for monitoring.

8.6 NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM PERMIT FOR
OPERATIONS
The NPDES permitting program regulates point sources that discharge pollutants in
waters of the United States; FDEP administers Florida’s NPDES permits under Sections
403.088 and 403.0885 of Florida Statute, from authority granted by USEPA. The issued
NPDES permits anticipate operation of the Shallow FEB and no modification would be
required if the Shallow FEB is authorized. If the deep FEB or STA alternative is
authorized, the existing permits would need to be modified once construction activites
are completed.

8.7 NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM PERMIT FOR
CONSTRUCTION
An NPDES stormwater permit for construction under FAC Rule 62-621.300(4) is not
required for the shallow FEB or deep FEB alternative, but would be required for the
construction of the STA. The selected contractor will apply for the NPDES permit from
FDEP and must provide a stormwater pollution prevention plan prior to start of
construction if one is required.

Chapter 8

8.8 CLEAN AIR ACT (TITLE V) PERMIT
The FDEP is responsible for Title V air permits, which regulate both major and minor
facilities based on emissions. In order to determine the applicable air permit for the
facility, there are three permitting thresholds to consider:
• Exempt from permitting: Station will consume less than 32,000 gallons per rolling
year. This is a self-implementing exemption.
• State General Permit: Station will consume less than 250,000 gallons per rolling year.
A General Permit can be obtained at least 30 days prior to operation and permit is
valid for 5 years.
• Title V Operation Permit: Station has the potential to emit more than 100 tons per
year of NOx. Title V Air Construction Permit must be issued prior to construction. It
takes about 6 to 8 months lead time to get permit and permit is valid for 5 years.
Final pump station designs will control the requirement. SFWMD will apply for the
appropriate permit during the construction phases of the project, which FDEP and
USEPA will review for compliance with the requirements of the CAA.

8.9 FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER 1996 FARM BILL, SECTION 390
The action alternatives will require the approval of the DOI. Under Section 390 of the
1996 Farm Bill (Public Law 104-127, 110 Statue 1022, April 1996), funds were provided
to the Secretary of the Interior to fund or conduct restoration activities in the
Everglades ecosystem. Under Section 390, the Secretary of the Interior has the
responsibility to ensure that Section 390 funds are used for restoration purposes. The
project site lands were purchased with Section 390 funds and title was transferred to
the SFWMD pursuant to a Grant Agreement. Pursuant of the terms of the Framework
Agreement and Grant Agreement referenced in earlier chapters of this EIS, the SFWMD
must request and receive approval of the DOI for any change in land use. This EIS serves
as the NEPA analysis for the decision on interim land use change for construction.
