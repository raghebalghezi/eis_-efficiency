Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

SUMMARY
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, in cooperation with the Nez Perce Tribe,
BPA, and USACE, has prepared this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to disclose
the potential effects of the proposed Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, in compliance
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 United States Code [U.S.C.] 4321 et
seq.) and other relevant federal and state laws and regulations. This DEIS discloses direct,
indirect, and cumulative environmental consequences and irreversible or irretrievable
commitments of resources and alternatives, including the preferred alternative.
The proposed Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project consists of restoring and improving
2.0 miles of Crooked River, known as the Meanders. The project area is located in the Crooked
River watershed, within the Red River Ranger District in the Nez Perce – Clearwater National
Forests in north-central Idaho, approximately 5 miles west of Elk City, Idaho. The project
boundary extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho
Department of Fish and Game intake weir) to approximately 2.0 miles upstream.
The project would help restore Crooked River and its floodplain that have been significantly
degraded by past land management activities, most importantly mining and road construction.
These activities have substantially affected the sediment regimes (various physical processes that
affect sediment) in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream, riparian and floodplain
functions in the main stem of Crooked River. Fire suppression, mining, road construction, and
timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural hydrologic and geomorphic processes
in the watershed. Over the long term, this shift has led to changes in streamflows and a reduction
in the amount of large pieces of wood and rock in the stream. The area surrounding Crooked
River was mined for mineral resources from the early 1900s through the 1950s. Mining waste
(also referred to as mine tailings) is concentrated in the valley bottom, altering the physical
condition of the stream system, restricting the natural migration pattern of the stream and other
changes in channel morphology (channel size, form, and function), and impairing the
recolonization of riparian vegetation and its function as a natural buffer. These alterations have
resulted in a significant reduction of productive aquatic habitat for Endangered Species Act
(ESA)-listed Snake River Basin steelhead (steelhead), spring/summer Chinook salmon, and
bull trout.

Purpose and Need for Action
Historic mining activities have altered the Crooked River valley and have led to degraded fish
habitat, causing inadequate densities of fish in Crooked River (a lower density than the stream
historically supported). The Forest Service needs to restore the Crooked River valley to improve
fish habitat and water quality in Crooked River. The proposed action would achieve goals and
objectives in the Forest Plan, improve habitat for ESA-listed and sensitive fish species, and
respond to objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe. To meet the purpose and need, the proposed action

Summary

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

is to restore channel and floodplain functions, restore instream fish habitat complexity, and
improve water quality in the Crooked River valley.
The Crooked River watershed contains important aquatic resources and has high aquatic
potential. Crooked River provides habitat for steelhead and bull trout, which are listed as
threatened species under the ESA, and is designated as critical habitat for both species. It also
provides habitat for westslope cutthroat trout, resident rainbow trout (redband), and
spring/summer Chinook salmon, all considered by the Forest Service to be sensitive fish species
in the Nez Perce National Forest (USDA Forest Service 1987a; USDA Forest Service 2011b).
Crooked River also supports whitefish and nongame species such as sculpin. Pacific lamprey
have not been found in the project area in recent years. The restoration of Crooked River could
provide appropriate sand beds for lamprey spawning and rearing habitat.
The proposed action responds to the goals and objectives outlined in the Nez Perce National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (also referred to as the Nez Perce Forest Plan, and
as Forest Plan in this document [USDA Forest Service 1987a]), as amended, and would improve
conditions in the project area and move the area toward the desired future conditions. The Forest
Plan provides direction for the management of the Crooked River project area and defines the
habitat conditions necessary for salmonid spawning and rearing. In addition, the proposed action
responds to the objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe by protecting, restoring, and enhancing
watersheds within proximity of their ceded territory. The existing conditions were determined
using field data collected by River Design Group, Inc. (RDG), for the Design Criteria Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation and Design (RDG et al. 2012), the Final Design Report
(RDG et al. 2013a), the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project Wetland Delineation Report
(Geum Environmental Consulting 2012), and the South Fork Clearwater River Landscape
Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998). The reports that resulted from these studies are not
decision documents; therefore, the recommendations provided in the reports were considered as
recommendations only, rather than direction.

Public Involvement
The Notice of Intent for the project was published in the Federal Register (Volume 77, No. 239,
Page 73976) on December 12, 2012, with a 45-day comment period. In addition, as part of the
public involvement process, the Forest Service mailed the scoping letter with a description of the
proposed action to 395 potentially interested parties on November 30, 2012. To solicit input on
the proposed action the Forest Service held two public meetings: January 17, 2013, in
Grangeville, Idaho; and January 28, 2013, in Elk City, Idaho. Issues raised by interested parties
are summarized below.
The Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register and in the
Lewiston Morning Tribune.

Issues
The December 2012 Notice of Intent and scoping letter presented to the public two project
components as the proposed action: the Crooked River Meanders and the Crooked River
Narrows Road. Comments on these proposed actions are summarized here to provide
information to the public on their comments. Below is a display of alternatives presented in the
Notice of Intent and this Draft EIS.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative A – No Action
Alternative B – Proposed Action –
Reconstruct Road 233 in place, above
the 100-year flood flow elevation.
Narrows Road

Alternative C – Deadwood Re-route,
including decommissioning a portion of
Road 233.
Alternative – Relocate Road 233,
upslope above the 100-year flood flow
elevation.

Considered as a future foreseeable
action in cumulative effects. The
Narrows Road Improvement Project
(Alternative B) would reconstruct
Road 233 in place, above the 50year flood flow elevation.

During the public involvement process, various issues were identified. The public raised several
issues that drove the development of alternatives, added design or mitigation measures, or
affected analysis of consequences. Other issues raised were considered to be not relevant or
outside of the scope of this project.
Some comments were used to add design or mitigation measures to reduce effects, including:
effects to water quality and fish habitat, soil resources, cultural resources, mineral claims and
public access during implementation, and control of invasive species. Concerns about effects to
natural resources or the public were grouped into the following categories: aquatic resources,
water resources, cultural resources (including historic sites), soil resources, wildlife resources,
rare plants, invasive plants, recreation (including fishing access), air quality, mineral resources,
transportation (including access, maintenance, safety, and costs), social and economic resources,
and cumulative effects. Most commenters were supportive of the Meanders valley and stream
restoration; however, one commenter thought that the valley should be left alone. Alternative 1
(No Action) addresses this concern.
Concerns were raised about preserving moose and elk habitat and about effects to natural
resources. The effects analysis in this document addresses this concern.
Some comments were in support of moving the Narrows Road (Road 233) out of the valley
bottom, but most were in support of leaving the road in its current location and improving the

road condition. Alternative B (see Appendix C and the project record) addresses this concern.
Concerns were expressed about the potential relocation of a portion of Road 233.
One comment was that the proposed action for the Narrows Road (Alternative B as described in
Appendix C and the project record) would not provide enough benefit and that the Narrows area
of Road 233 should be decommissioned or converted to a foot trail. Alternative C (see
Appendix C) was developed to address this concern.
During analysis, the Narrows Road component of the project was considered but eliminated from
detailed study in this EIS. The Narrows Road component of the project may be implemented in
the future (5 years or more) and the potential effects from implementing this project are included
in the cumulative effects sections in Chapter 3 and Appendix C.
The following alternatives were developed to address these issues.

Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
The action proposed by the Forest Service and the Nez Perce Tribe is to improve fish habitat in
Crooked River by implementing the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. The Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project includes two alternatives: No Action and Proposed Action.
Detailed description of alternatives, comparison of alternatives, and a summary of the effects are
provided in Chapter 2. The Narrows Road component of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project was removed from detailed study in this EIS by the deciding official in
December 2013. See Chapter 2 for more details.

No Action (Alternative 1)
This alternative provides a baseline for comparing the environmental consequences of other
alternatives as required by NEPA. Under the No Action alternative, no project actions, including
funding from BPA, any construction actions by USFS and the Nez Perce Tribe, or permitting
decision(s) by the USACE would be implemented.

Proposed Action (Alternative 2)
This alternative was developed in response to the purpose and need for action identified from
existing conditions to improve fish habitat and water quality, which have been altered as a result
of past mining and other activities. It was presented for public scoping in December 2012.
Alternative 2 would move the project area towards habitat considered optimal for salmonid
spawning and rearing, the desired future condition as identified in the Forest Plan.
Alternative 2 proposes to rehabilitate the lower 2.0 miles of Crooked River, known as the
Meanders. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the
mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir) to approximately
2.0 miles upstream. The valley width includes Road 233 on the east side of the valley to the base
of the hillslope on the west side of the valley. This alternative would rehabilitate up to 115 acres

of floodplain by moving dredge tailings, reconstructing approximately 7,400 feet of stream
channel, installing woody bank structures, constructing more than 2,700 feet of side channels,
creating conditions for 64 acres of wetlands, and replanting the valley bottom with native plant
communities. The project would be implemented over approximately 6 years (2015–2021).

Major Conclusions
Major conclusions related to potential consequences from proposed activities include:
•

Proposed activities would move the Lower Crooked River watershed towards the Forest
Plan Fishery/Water quality objectives identified in the Forest Plan. Proposed activities
would provide improvement to fish habitat conditions by improving pool quality,
increasing large woody debris recruitment, and increasing spawning habitat and higherquality rearing habitat. These changes would improve overall fish habitat complexity in
Crooked River from the existing condition.

•

Proposed activities would have a short-term potential to adversely affect ESA-listed
threatened fish species (steelhead and bull trout), and may impact five sensitive fish
species (westslope cutthroat trout, interior redband trout, Pacific lamprey, western
pearlshell mussel, and spring Chinook salmon). Endangered Species Act, Section 7,
consultation with federal agencies would be completed prior to signing the decision.

•

Proposed activities would have a short- and long-term effect on the geomorphology of
the lower 2 miles of Crooked River. Channel morphology and sediment transport/bed
mobility would be improved.

•

Floodplain function would be improved by increasing the floodplain area, with the
bankfull floodplain area increasing and upland floodplain decreasing. Interaction
between the stream channel and floodplain would be restored with floodplain inundation
occurring more frequently at flows greater than the 1.1-year recurrence interval, and
sustainable floodplain morphology would be established that is capable of supporting
aquatic habitat and desired vegetation communities, which would provide more
ecological functions than currently exist. All required permits would be obtained prior
to implementation.

•

Proposed activities would have a short- and long-term effect on wetlands. The proposed
activities would adversely impact 31 of 52 total acres of wetland during construction, and
create 42 acres of wetlands. The result would be an overall increase from 52 acres to
64 acres of wetlands in the long term. Wetlands are expected to increase in both area and
diversity with the proposed action. The Forest would apply for a Joint 404 Permit and
Stream Channel Alteration Permit, from Idaho Department of Water Resources and
USACE.

•

Proposed activities would have a short- and long-term effect on water quality. Multiple
mitigation measures have been developed to manage instream turbidity levels during

construction. Water temperature in Crooked River currently exceeds state standards.
The proposed activities to restore channel and floodplain functions and re-establish
vegetation would move toward meeting requirements in the South Fork Clearwater River
Total Maximum Daily Load in Crooked River to reduce water temperatures in the
long term (IDEQ et al. 2004).
•

Proposed activities would have both short- and long-term effects on one National Historic
Register site. Measures meant to recover significant values of the site have been
identified. All cultural properties in the project area have been evaluated for their
National Register eligibility. Consultation with Idaho State Preservation Office would be
completed prior to signing the decision. A project-specific Forest Plan amendment
is proposed.

•

Proposed activities would change the conditions of the Meanders area to have desired
plant communities that would improve soil conditions over time. Both the alder and
mixed shrub communities (riparian) would increase substantially compared to the
existing conifer/tall forb communities (upland/ tailing piles). Proposed activities would
lay the foundation to rebuild soil functions, including chemical and biological properties
adjacent to Crooked River.

•

Proposed activities would change the amount of detrimental soil disturbance from a level
that currently exceeds the Forest Plan standards. By implementing proposed activities
the amount of detrimental soil disturbance would decrease from 65 to 4 percent, over the
next 20 years. A project-specific Forest Plan amendment is proposed.

•

Proposed activities would have no effect on one threatened wildlife species (lynx) and is
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of one proposed species (wolverine). The
proposal may impact four sensitive wildlife species (western toad, gray wolf, harlequin
duck, and fisher). Western toads are present in the project area and direct effect to habitat
would occur. A loss of potential breeding habitat and mortality during construction could
occur. Non-breeding habitat would increase and overall habitat conditions would
improve as the floodplain functions are restored.

•

Proposed activities would displace Forest Plan management indicator species (elk,
moose, pine marten), and other species in the short term. A long-term reduction in
ponded foraging moose habitat would occur with channel and floodplain restoration;
however, foraging habitat in the floodplain would improve over time. No change to elk
habitat effectiveness level would occur in any elk units.

•

The proposal may impact one sensitive plant species (Idaho barren strawberry) following
the restoration of the floodplain, which would make the habitat too wet for the species.

•

Proposed activities would have a short-term effect on two developed and 18 dispersed
recreation sites in the project area, for up to 6 years during implementation. In the long
term, the same number of existing dispersed and developed sites would be available for
use. Fishing access would be limited during construction because of the area closure, but

Summary

ix

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

in the long term the public would have walking access to fishing in the restored Crooked
River stream channel. No changes to the recreation opportunity spectrum would occur,
and visual quality objectives would be met.
•

Proposed activities would have negligible impacts to air quality.

•

Proposed activities would have the potential to have a short-term effect on access to some
mineral claims and an increase to placer claim reclamation bonds in the future. There
would be no effect on actual mineral resources.

•

Invasive plant species are present and the extent of weed spread following
implementation would depend on the implementation and effectiveness of design and
mitigation measures.

•

Proposed activities would have short-term effects to the public during construction in the
form of traffic delays and a Forest Supervisor area closure for up to 6 years.

•

Proposed activities would have potential beneficial short-term effects for employment
and long-term recreation-based economic benefits. The cost of the project is estimated at
$2.5 million and would potentially be funded through the BPA Fish and Wildlife
Program.

Cooperating Agencies
Cooperating agencies identified in preparing this DEIS are: the Nez Perce Tribe, BPA, and
USACE.

Decision Framework
Based on the effects of the alternatives, the responsible Forest Service official would decide the
following:
•

Should the lower Crooked River valley be rehabilitated or not, and if so, to what extent?

•

What design and mitigation measures would be included?

•

What, if any, monitoring would be included?

•

Whether the decision requires any Forest Plan amendments, and if so, what elements of
the Forest Plan are to be amended for this project?

Following the Forest Service decision:
•

BPA would decide whether or not to fund the proposed project.

•

USACE would decide whether or not to provide permits for the project.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

CHAPTER 1. PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION
Purpose and Need
Historic mining activities have altered the Crooked River valley and have led to degraded fish
habitat, causing inadequate densities of fish in Crooked River (a lower density than the stream
historically supported). The Forest Service needs to restore the Crooked River valley to improve
fish habitat and water quality in Crooked River. The proposed action would achieve goals and
objectives in the Forest Plan, improve habitat for Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed and
sensitive fish species, and respond to objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe. To meet the purpose
and need, the proposed action is to restore channel and floodplain functions, restore instream fish
habitat complexity, and improve water quality in the Crooked River valley.
The activities proposed by the Forest Service and the Nez Perce Tribe consist of restoring and
improving 2.0 miles of Crooked River, known as the Meanders. The project area is located in
the Crooked River watershed, within the Red River Ranger District in the Nez Perce –
Clearwater National Forests in north-central Idaho, approximately 5 miles west of Elk City,
Idaho. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends from 0.1 miles upstream from the
mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir) to approximately
2.0 miles upstream. The valley width includes Road 233 on the east side of the valley to the base
of the hillslope on the west side of the valley. The location is Township 29 North, Range 7 East,
Sections 25 and 36; and Township 28 North, Range 7 East, Section 1. A vicinity map depicting
the location of the proposed activities is shown in Figure 1-1.

Existing Condition
During the 1930s through 1950s the entire main stem of Crooked River was heavily impacted by
dredge mining, which left large tailings piles and deep ponds throughout the valley bottom.
Physical changes to the valley bottom have altered stream and riparian processes, and have
affected aquatic and terrestrial habitat conditions that resulted in degraded ecosystem conditions
relative to historic conditions. The lower 2.0 miles have been altered so drastically that
hydrologic and geomorphic condition resemble that of a spring-fed creek instead of a snow-melt
dominated system, instream complexity is low, the majority of the streambed is armored, and the
recolonization of native riparian vegetation has been impaired.

Desired Condition
Desired aquatic habitat in the project area is a rehabilitated stream corridor capable of supporting
natural aquatic processes and sustaining the habitat requirements of the focal aquatic species for
a range of life stages and seasonal behavior patterns. This would include an accessible and
functioning floodplain, natural stream meanders, complex fish habitat, healthy riparian
vegetation, and improved water quality (USDA Forest Service 1987a).

Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action

1-1

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Proposed Action
The proposed action is to reconstruct 2.0 valley miles of Crooked River. Restoration of the
valley bottom and stream channel would provide habitat for ESA-listed fish. This would be
achieved by grading the majority of the tailings piles and reconstructing the river and its
floodplain to create natural stream sinuosity and morphology; restoring floodplain and
hydrologic functions; constructing instream channel structures to provide spawning and rearing
habitat for steelhead, spring/summer Chinook salmon, bull trout, and cutthroat trout; improving
water quality; and restoring riparian areas.
In addition, the proposed action would maintain campsites in the project area and preserve
heritage resource areas as identified by the Forest Service Archeologist through consultation with
the State Historic Preservation Office.
Primary elements of the proposed action would include:
•
•
•
•

•

•
•
•

Salvaging existing material onsite (trees, brush, rocks, etc.) to use in the reconstructed
channel and floodplain.
Constructing a temporary bypass channel to provide fish passage during construction.
Constructing a temporary access route for the movement of heavy equipment through the
project area.
Creating stream morphology features, including stream slope, meanders, and pool/riffle
ratios, that would provide quality habitat for fish and allow for a more natural hydrologic
function to maintain these features in the future.
Balancing earthwork quantities to maximize bankfull floodplain area by filling in tailings
ponds and developing a sloped valley bottom along the east edge of the project area
without removing material from the project area.
Stabilizing re-constructed streambanks using woody material and brush.
Creating areas that would support wetland development over time.
Re-vegetating the floodplain with native vegetation and maintain for several years after
project completion through replanting and protection from browse.

Details of the current condition and proposed action (e.g., stream channel dimensions) are
provided in Chapter 3, Appendix A, and the project record.

Scope of Analysis
The scope of this proposal is limited to activities related to the purpose and need as well as
measures necessary to mitigate the effects these activities may have on the environment. Direct,
indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions are analyzed in Chapter 3 for all of these activities. Cumulative effects are also discussed
in Appendix C.

Decision Framework
Based on the effects of the alternatives, the responsible Forest Service official would decide the
following:
•
•
•
•

Should the lower Crooked River valley be rehabilitated or not, and if so, to what extent?
What design and mitigation measures would be included?
What, if any, monitoring and evaluation would be included?
Whether the decision requires any Forest Plan amendments, and if so, what elements of
the Forest Plan are to be amended for this project?

Following the Forest Service decision:
•

BPA would decide whether or not to fund the proposed project.

•

USACE would decide whether or not to provide permits for the project.

Project Background
The Crooked River valley bottom was dredge mined with a bucket dredge from the 1930s
through the 1950s, which left large tailings piles and ponds. Mining waste (also referred to as
tailings piles) is concentrated around the stream corridor, altering the physical, hydrologic, and
geomorphic conditions of the stream system; restricting the natural pattern of stream migration
and other changes in channel morphology (channel size, form, and function); and inhibiting the
recolonization of native riparian vegetation.
In the Crooked River watershed, past land management activities, most importantly mining and
road construction, have substantially affected the sediment regimes (various physical processes
that affect sediment transport) in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream, riparian and
floodplain function in the main stem of Crooked River. Fire suppression, road construction, and
timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural processes in the watershed. For
example, disturbances shift from less frequent events of mixed severity to chronic events (such
as mass erosion). Over the long term, this shift has led to changes in streamflows, greater
deposition of sediment in streams, and a reduction in the amount of large pieces of wood and
rock in streams. These alterations have included degraded channel morphology and reduced
quantity of productive aquatic habitat.

The Nez Perce Forest Plan guides all activities related to the management of natural resources
and establishes management standards for lands administered by the Nez Perce National Forest
(USDA Forest Service 1987a). The Nez Perce Forest Plan describes resource management
practices, levels of resource production and management, and the availability and suitability of
lands for resource management.
On February 24, 1995, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management signed a decision
adopting an interim strategy for managing anadromous-fish-producing watersheds on lands
administered by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in eastern Oregon and
Washington, Idaho, and portions of California, commonly referred to as PACFISH (USDA
Forest Service and USDI BLM 1995). This decision amends regional guides and forest land and
Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action

resource management plans that guide the management of lands in the National Forest System.
Where compatible, the decision also provides management direction that is consistent with
Bureau of Land Management land-use plans and, thereby, establishes interim goals, objectives,
and standards and guidelines for these anadromous-fish-producing watersheds. The intended
effect of the decision is to provide additional protective management of the watersheds in the
affected areas to avoid limiting the choice of reasonable alternatives that may be developed in
geographically specific environmental analyses of long-term management strategies.
The South Fork Clearwater River Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998)
characterized the ecological and social conditions in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin
and provided the context for subsequent ecosystem analyses, including Crooked River. Within
the Crooked River Ecological Reporting Unit, the integrated area theme for lower Crooked River
was identified as Restore Aquatic Processes (Map 48). Review of the existing conditions in
lower Crooked River identified the primary departure from historic disturbance regimes in
Crooked River as being associated with the riparian and instream processes of the mainstem
channel. A very high priority rating was identified with the aquatic theme for lower Crooked
River for the restoration of stream/riparian processes and the sediment regime in the main
channel of Crooked River. Restoration in the lower watershed was recommended to focus
primarily on restoring, to the extent possible, the hydrologic and riparian processes of the
mainstem channel, with aquatic habitat creation being the end result. This type of restoration
would provide increased habitat potential for steelhead and spring Chinook, along with
subadult/adult rearing habitat for bull trout and westslope cutthroat in the upper subbasin.
Restoration of this channel would greatly improve the connectivity to the rest of the subbasin of
the existing good habitat and populations in the upper watershed.
The Clearwater Subbasin Management Plan (NPCC 2005) was the first of approximately
60 subbasin plans intended to provide an up-to-date biological assessment of fish and wildlife
populations, a synthesis of past and ongoing fish and wildlife management activities, the
identification of factors currently limiting fish and wildlife production, a description of strategies
to address the limiting factors, and a prioritization framework for future fish and wildlife
activities in the face of limited resources for each subbasin. The document was intended to guide
future fish and wildlife projects in the Clearwater River Subbasin.
The South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and Total Maximum Daily Loads (IDEQ
et al. 2004) addresses the water bodies in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin that have
been placed on the Clean Water Act, Section 303(d) list, including Crooked River. Crooked
River has a TMDL for sediment and water temperature.
The American and Crooked River Project Environmental Impact Statement and Record of
Decision (USDA Forest Service 2005a) analyzed the environmental consequences of reducing
forest fuels through various timber harvest methods and implementing watershed improvements

in the Crooked River watershed. Most of the projects addressed by that EIS have been
completed.
The Design Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012),
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental
Consulting 2012), and Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG
et al. 2013a) summarize an investigation and evaluation of the lower 2 miles of Crooked River
that are being considered for restoration. The study was commissioned to document the existing
conditions within the stream system, provide a design and the appropriate criteria for restoring
the stream, riparian corridor, and floodplain, and evaluate the ability to mitigate the
environmental disturbance of past mining within the watershed.
The Crooked River Archaeological Survey (Desert West Environmental 2013a) describes the
heritage resources in the project area. The Gnome Townsite above the project area was fully
surveyed and documented as mitigation for the proposed action and is covered in this survey.
The Native Materials Inventory: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG and Geum
Environmental Consulting 2012) describes the inventory of existing native materials, such as
soil, trees, rocks, and instream habitat structures in the project area. The purpose of the
inventory was to estimate the quantity of native material available for use in proposed
rehabilitation efforts.

Cooperating Agencies
Nez Perce Tribe
The Nez Perce Tribe is responsible for reviewing and providing comments on the EIS. The Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests and the Nez Perce Tribe would be responsible for
implementing the decision, including mitigation and monitoring.

Bonneville Power Administration
BPA is responsible for reviewing and providing comments on the EIS and determining whether
to provide funding for the project following the decision.
The project would meet BPA’s objectives mandated under several federal laws. BPA is a federal
power marketing agency that is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. BPA’s operations are
governed by several statutes, such as the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and
Conservation Act of 1980 (Northwest Power Act) (16 U.S.C. 839 et seq.). Among other things,
the Northwest Power Act directs BPA to protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife affected
by the development and operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). To
assist in accomplishing this, the Act requires BPA to fund fish and wildlife protection,
mitigation, and enhancement actions consistent with the NPCC’s Fish and Wildlife Program.
Under this program, the NPCC makes recommendations to BPA concerning which fish and

wildlife projects to fund. The NPCC determined that this project was consistent with the Fish
and Wildlife Program, and BPA will use the analysis in this EIS to decide whether to fund the
project.
Additionally, this project would help BPA meet its obligations under the Endangered Species
Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) by fulfilling commitments to implement Reasonable and Prudent
Alternative 35, which calls for identifying tributary habitat restoration projects in the 2008
FCRPS Biological Opinion, as amended by a Supplemental Biological Opinion in 2010 and 2014
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries 2008, 2010, 2014).

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a federal agency in the U.S.
Department of Defense. The USACE administers and enforces Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act. Under Section 404, a Department of Army permit is required for the discharge of
dredge/fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. The USACE has
jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act with respect to the Crooked Valley
Rehabilitation Project EIS over project alternatives that would involve the discharge of dredged
or fill materials into wetlands and open waters in the Crooked River floodplain, including manmade remnant gold dredge ponds.
The USACE role in the Crooked Valley Rehabilitation Project EIS is to assist the Forest Service
and other partners in reviewing information for the preparation of the environmental analysis in
regards to the permit review process under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. This entails
reviewing portions of the EIS or supporting documents, and advising the Forest Service with
respect to project compliance under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

Public Involvement
The Notice of Intent for the project was published in the Federal Register (Volume 77, No. 239,
Page 73976) on December 12, 2012, with a 45-day comment period. In addition, as part of the
public involvement process, the Forest Service mailed the proposed action letter to 395
potentially interested parties on November 30, 2012. To solicit input on the proposed actions the
Forest Service held two public meetings: January 17, 2013, in Grangeville, Idaho; and January
28, 2013, in Elk City, Idaho. Issues raised by interested parties are summarized below.
The Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register and Lewiston
Morning Tribune.

Issues
Public comments on the proposed action were received in response to the mailing in December
2012, and public meetings in January 2013. The Notice of Intent and scoping letter presented to
the public two project components as the proposed action: the Crooked River Meanders and the

Considered as a future foreseeable
action in cumulative effects. The
Narrows Road Improvement Project
(Alternative B) would reconstruct
Road 233 in place, above the 50year flood flow elevation.

The Forest Service and the Nez Perce Tribe reviewed and identified issues raised during the
scoping period. Issues are actual or perceived effects, risk and hazards identified by the public,
other agencies or by the interdisciplinary team. Issues were categorized as follows: (1) issues
decided by law or policy, (2) issues addressed through design criteria or mitigation, (3) issues to
be addressed in effects analysis, (4) issues used to develop alternatives to the proposed action,
(5) issues not affected by the proposed action, or (6) issues outside the scope of the project,
including conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The public raised
several issues that drove the development of alternatives, added design or mitigation measures,
or affected analysis of the proposed project.
In Section 1501.7(a)(3), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations direct
the lead agency to “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not
significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…” A full
description of issues and reasons why they are not evaluated further in this EIS are briefly
discussed below. Additional information on issues may be found in the project record at the Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests office in Grangeville, Idaho. The following issues were
identified and addressed as indicated below:

effects on water quality and fish habitat, soil resources, cultural resources, mineral claims
and public access during implementation, and control of invasive species. See Chapter 2.
Comments were expressed about the potential effects to natural resources or the public.
These comments were grouped into the following categories, and the potential effects are
presented in Chapter 3: aquatic resources, water resources, cultural resources (including
historic sites), soil resources, wildlife resources, rare plants, invasive plants, recreation
(including fishing access), mineral resources, transportation (including access,
maintenance, safety, and costs), social and economic resources, and cumulative effects.
Comments were expressed about the loss of moose and elk habitat and re-vegetation in
the Crooked River Meanders. See the analysis completed in the Wildlife section in
Chapter 3.
Comments were expressed about the cumulative effects of mining operations in the
Crooked River watershed and the potential of future mining operations on the proposed
project. See the analysis completed in the Mineral Resources section in Chapter 3.
Concerns were expressed about preserving the recreational and mining opportunities in
the watershed. See the Mineral Resources and Recreation Resources sections in Chapter
3 for the comparison of current and proposed access in the watershed, by alternative.
Comments were expressed about the consequences of the proposed project on water
quality in the project area. See the analysis in the Water Resources and Aquatic
Resources sections in Chapter 3.
Comments were expressed about preserving access to historic roads, trails, and rights-ofway, and that the tailings piles are historic and should not be altered. See the analysis in
the Cultural Resources section in Chapter 3.
Comments were expressed about the safety, seasonal access, and maintenance of
Alternative C for the Crooked River Narrows Road (Deadwood Road Re-route). This
alternative was developed and considered by the deciding official, but eliminated from
detailed study (Chapter 2). See the analysis in the Transportation report in the project
record.
Comments were expressed that the proposed action for the Crooked River Narrows Road
(Alternative B) would not provide enough benefit and that the road needs to be
decommissioned or converted to a foot trail, and Alternative C needs to be fully analyzed.
Alternative C was developed and considered by the deciding official, but eliminated from
detailed study (Chapter 2). See the analysis in the Water Resources report in the
project record.

Regulatory Framework
As part of the analysis for this project, the Interdisciplinary Team evaluated various alternatives
under the laws, regulations, and requirements relating to federal natural resource management.
Several of the design features presented in Chapter 2 were developed and incorporated to ensure
that these requirements would be met. Additional details can be found in Chapters 2 and 3 (by
resource area), Chapter 4, and the project record.

Forest Plan Direction
Although the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests were administratively combined in
February 2013, management of the lands formerly within the boundary of the Nez Perce
National Forest will continue to be guided by direction found in the Nez Perce Forest Plan until
the plan is revised. The Nez Perce Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, as amended)
includes goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines that direct management of forest resources.
Forest Plan direction is established at two scales: (1) Forest-wide direction is applicable
throughout the Forest, and (2) management area direction ties specific goals, objectives, and
standards to the unique capabilities of given parcels of land.
Nez Perce Forest Plan standards apply to National Forest System (NFS) lands within the Nez
Perce National Forest boundary. The standards are intended to supplement, not replace, national
and regional policies, standards, and guidelines found in Forest Service manuals and handbooks
and the Northern Regional Guide (USDA Forest Service 1999a).
The development and analysis of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project was guided by
the goals, objectives, standards, guidelines, and management area direction within the Nez Perce
Forest Plan. The Forest Plan provides direction for the management of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project area and defines the desired future conditions. The proposed action
responds to the goals and objectives outlined in the Forest Plan. This project would improve
conditions in the project area to bring them more in line with the desired future conditions
described in the plan. In addition, the proposed project responds to the objectives of protecting,
restoring, and enhancing watersheds within proximity of the ceded territory of the Nez Perce
Tribe. The need for this project was identified by comparing the existing conditions in the
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project area with the habitat objectives considered optimal
for salmonid spawning and rearing. This project would help move the Forest toward desired
conditions as described in the Forest Plan and other relevant planning direction.
Forest-wide management direction in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan that relate to this
project include Goals 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21, and 22 (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pages II-1
and II-2):

Tribal Treaty Rights
American Indian tribes are afforded special rights under various federal statutes: National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (36 CFR 800), National Forest Management Act (NFMA),
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (43 CFR 7), Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA [43 CFR 10]), Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1993 (P.L. 103141), and American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978
(42 U.S.C. 1996, 1996a) (AIRFA). Some of these statutes and federal guidelines direct federal
agencies to consult with tribal representatives who may have concerns about federal actions that
may affect religious practices, other traditional cultural uses, or cultural resource sites and
remains associated with tribal ancestors. Any tribe whose aboriginal territory occurs within a
project area is afforded the opportunity to voice concerns for issues governed by NHPA,
NAGPRA, or AIRFA.
Federal responsibilities to consult with tribes are enumerated in the NFMA; Interior Secretarial
Order 3175 of 1993; and EOs 12875, 13007, 12866, and 13084. EO 12875 (Enhancing the
Intergovernmental Partnership) calls for regular consultation with tribal governments. EO 13007
(Indian Sacred Sites) requires consultation with tribes and religious representatives on the access,
use, and protection of sacred sites by land management agencies. EO 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review) requires that federal agencies seek views of tribal officials before
imposing regulatory requirements that might affect them. EO 13084 (Consultation and
Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) provides direction regarding consultation and
coordination with tribes relative to fee waivers. EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs
federal agencies to focus on the human health and environmental conditions in minority and lowincome communities, especially in instances where decisions may adversely impact these
populations. NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500–1508) invite tribes to participate in forest
management projects and activities that may affect them. The Crooked River watershed is a part
of the more than 13 million acres in central Idaho, northeastern Oregon, and southeastern
Washington included in the pre-treaty area of use by the Nez Perce Tribe. Prior to the treaty of
1855, the Nez Perce used Crooked River and the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin for
hunting, fishing, gathering food, horse pasturing, and other cultural uses.
In 1855, the United States negotiated a treaty with the Nez Perce Tribe: Treaty of June 9, 1855,
12 Stat. 957. In Article 3 of this treaty, the Nez Perce Tribe explicitly reserved for itself certain
rights, including the exclusive right to take fish in streams running through or bordering the
Reservation and “the right to fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with the citizens
of the Territory.” These rights include the right to fish, hunt, and gather within the Nez Perce –
Clearwater National Forests, including Crooked River watershed. Crooked River lies entirely
within the ceded territory of the Nez Perce Tribe.
Federal courts have recognized that “it is undisputed that Indian tribes have legally protected
interests within their aboriginal Territory” (Idaho v. Forest Service, No. CV 99-611-N-EJL, slip

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

op. at 3 [D. Idaho Sept. 8, 2000]). By virtue of its treaty and trust obligations to the Nez Perce
Tribe, the United States and its agencies, including the Forest Service, have substantive duties to
consult with the Nez Perce Tribe and to implement measures necessary to protect and enhance
tribal resources (Klamath Tribes v. U.S., 24 Ind. Law Rep. 3017, 3020 [D. Or. 1996]).
Treaty tribes, such as the Nez Perce, have been recognized as managers of their treaty-reserved
resources (U.S. v. Washington, 384 F. Supp. 312, 339-40, 403 [W.D. Wash. 1974]). As a
manager, the Nez Perce Tribe has devoted substantial time, effort, and resources to the recovery
and co-management of treaty-reserved resources within its ceded territory. To guide these
efforts, the Nez Perce Tribe, through its own fisheries programs and the Columbia River InterTribal Fish Commission (CRITFC), has developed and implemented a comprehensive salmon
recovery plan (CRITFC 1996).
The national forests, including the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, within the Nez
Perce Tribe’s ceded territory are central to both tribal and federal efforts to recover imperiled
species. The Nez Perce Tribe believes that projects in national forests, such as the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation, are needed to enhance efforts to recover and restore anadromous
fish species and their habitat.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project has been presented to the Nez Perce Tribe at
quarterly staff-to-staff meetings since January 2013.

Project Record
This EIS incorporates by reference, pursuant to 40 CFR 1502.21, the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project Record, which contains specialist reports and other technical
documentation used to support the analysis and conclusions in this EIS.
Relying on specialist reports and the project record helps implement the CEQ regulations’
direction to reduce NEPA paperwork (40 CFR 1500.4). This EIS also incorporates documented
analyses by summary and reference where appropriate. The intent is to furnish enough sitespecific information to demonstrate a reasoned consideration of the environmental consequences
of the alternatives and how these consequences can be mitigated, without repeating detailed
analysis and background information available elsewhere. The project record is available for
review at the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests office, in Grangeville, Idaho.

CHAPTER 2. ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE
PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE
Introduction
This chapter compares the alternatives being considered for the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project. It defines the differences between the alternatives and provides a clear
basis for the deciding official and the public choosing between them. The choice will be based
on the design of the action alternative, as well as the environmental, social, and economic effects
of implementing each alternative.

Alternatives Considered in Detail
In response to issues raised by the public, the Forest Service has developed two alternatives to be
considered in detail: no action and proposed action. The decision to proceed with the proposed
action could include the entire proposed action or less than what has been proposed in the
proposed action alternative.
NEPA requires the inclusion of a no-action alternative when federal agencies enter into the
decision-making process to consider the environmental, historical, and cultural consequences of
a proposed action. Alternative 1, no action, provides a mechanism for evaluating the potential
effectiveness of the existing management policy as well as considering the implications of a
hands-off approach. Alternative 1 does not necessarily preclude further action or plausible
changes in management policy; instead, it represents the continuation of the existing
management strategy.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Under Alternative 1, no stream rehabilitation would occur. BPA would not provide funding
toward the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project; the Corps would not grant appropriate
permits; and the Forest Service and NPT would not construct the project. This alternative provides
a baseline for comparison of environmental consequences of the proposed action to the existing
condition, and is a management option that could be selected by the Responsible Official. The
results of taking no action would be the current condition as it changes over time due to natural
forces. Current management plans, such as the Forest Plan, and ongoing activities would
continue to guide the management of the project area (see Appendix C for more details). No
rehabilitation of Crooked River Valley would occur.
Following the Forest Service decision, BPA would not provide funding toward the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation Project and USACE would not issue a 404 permit.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

2-1

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action (Preferred Alternative)
Under Alternative 2, the lower 2 miles of the Crooked River valley and Crooked River would be
reconstructed to improve fisheries habitat (Figure 2-1 and Appendix A). This alternative would
follow the specific design and mitigation measures identified in the Design and Mitigation
Measures section in the Draft EIS below. Additional measures may be identified during
consultation or from public comments and may be included in the Final EIS or decision.
This proposed action alternative is based on designs and design criteria provided in the Final
Design Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a) and the Design
Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012). The stream
restoration is proposed to address areas of impact in the lower 2 miles of Crooked River. For
engineering design details on the proposed action, see Appendix A.
Alternative 2 project area spans from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir intake
structure, which is approximately 0.1 mile upstream of the confluence with the South Fork
Clearwater River, to about 2.0 miles upstream where the valley narrows. The valley
rehabilitation/reconstruction is proposed to address the areas that have been adversely impacted
by historic dredge mining.
Alternative 2 proposes to re-grade approximately 115 acres of floodplain by moving dredge
tailings. No dredge material would be removed from the project area. Approximately 10,960
feet of current channel would be filled in and approximately 7,400 feet of new stream channel
would be reconstructed. The new stream channel would have woody bank treatments to provide
stability. Large woody debris would be added to the stream channel along approximately 9,400
feet. More than 2,700 feet of side channels would be constructed. The stream channel would be
constructed so as not to interfere with Road 233 in the lower 2 miles. An illustration of the
proposed floodplain features, including the side channels and vegetation communities, is
provided in Figure 2-2.
The floodplain would be re-graded so that about 50 acres would seasonally flood every 1.5 years,
which would create conditions for the formation of approximately 64 acres of wetlands,
including 14 acres of open water. Appendix B provides the Clean Water Act 404(b)(1) analysis
that describes the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative for the alteration of
wetlands. The valley bottom would be replanted with native plant communities, including alder
and spruce, to facilitate the continuous and natural recruitment of wood and instream substrate
material. Large wood, from re-grading the floodplain or from other approved sources, would be
placed on the newly constructed floodplain to increase upland, riparian, and future instream
habitat complexity. The remaining valley bottom would be constructed to seasonally flood every
10 years. Figure 2-3 shows a cross section of distribution of floodplain vegetation communities.
Alternative 2 proposes a temporary river bypass channel to reduce the direct impacts of
construction to water quality, fish, and aquatic organisms in Crooked River. The bypass channel

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

would be constructed prior to any instream or floodplain work, and remain in use until
completion of the new floodplain and stream channel (2–3 years). Cofferdams and/or headgates
would be constructed on the mainstem channel. This temporary river bypass channel (about
6,000 feet) would be constructed along the east side of the valley using existing mining ponds to
pass water, fish and aquatic organisms during construction of the project. The bypass channel
would be constructed to contain a 10-year flow event of Crooked River. Fish and aquatic
organism salvage would occur in the main channel, ponds, and bypass channel before dewatering actions. Following construction, Crooked River would be slowly re-watered during
low flow, cofferdams removed, and the bypass channel would be reshaped into the floodplain.
Alternative 2 proposes a temporary haul/access route in the project area to reduce the impact to
Road 233 and the public traveling on Road 233 during river rehabilitation. Approximately
23,200 cubic yards of material would be excavated for the bypass channel and the material
would be used in construction of the temporary access route. There are three existing access
roads into the project areas: these areas would be used to access the valley bottom from Road
233. Stream crossing structures would be installed on these existing access routes in three
locations over the temporary bypass channel (see Appendix A). Following construction of the
channel, the temporary haul/access road structures would be removed and the road
decommissioned. Existing access roads would be retained for recreational use.
Materials such as large woody debris, rock, wood chips, and soil would be stockpiled in the
dispersed campsites near Campground 4, which would require the closure of four dispersed sites
(about 1.5 acres) prior to beginning construction. These dispersed campsites would be closed for
the duration of the project. Campgrounds 3 and 4 may also be closed year-round for the duration
of the project to store materials and ensure public safety. Much of the material would come from
within the project area, but some would be imported. Large woody debris and wood chips would
be imported from the Crooked River watershed through the Orogrande Community Protection
project (USDA Forest Service 2013a draft) or other projects evaluated through a NEPA process.
See Appendix C for more details. Large woody debris would be added to the stream channel for
habitat complexity, and to the floodplain to provide microsites and roughness. Wood chips
would also be added to the floodplain to increase water retention in the substrate in order to
improve plant survival.
To provide nutrients and a food source for fish, cobble substrate and large woody debris may be
added to the newly created channel from the temporary bypass channel. Salmon carcasses may
be used to provide additional nutrients to the new channel.

Construction Phasing
The project would split implementation into multiple construction phases that could be
accomplished within annual budget allocations. The phasing sequence is summarized in
Table 2-1 below, and depicted in Appendix A in Figures A-1a and A-1b (RDG et al. 2013a).
Phasing considerations include:
•
•
•
•

Water management (bypass channel) requirements
Temporary stabilization measures of unconsolidated material required to transition from
each phase to prevent flood damage to newly constructed features
Earthwork volumes (balancing cut and fill)
Environmental compliance considerations (fish passage).

The project would be constructed in phases over several years. The construction phasing
approach involves: (1) stockpiling large woody debris in designated upland areas,
(2) constructing bypass channel and removing vegetation from floodplain, (3) new floodplain
grading and new channel grading, (4) new channel bank treatments, woody debris placement,
and new channel activation, (5) bypass channel reclamation and upland floodplain grading, and
(6) replanting with native plant communities and long-term maintenance of vegetation.

Design and Mitigation Measures by Resource Area
The following project design and mitigation measures have been developed to eliminate or
reduce to acceptable levels the effects of proposed activities. Their potential effectiveness is
described in italics, in Chapter 3, and in more detail in the project record.
Soils, Water Quality, and Fish Habitat
1.
Complete ground-disturbing activities during low-flow conditions. Adjust instream
work dates site-specifically through coordination with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team
(USDI Fish and Wildlife Service, NOAA-National Marine Fisheries Service, USDA
Forest Service, and USDI Bureau of Land Management) and other agencies.
(Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
2.
Thoroughly wash and inspect all equipment used in stream restoration activities before
it enters the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests to help prevent the introduction of
chemicals to the site. Keep all equipment in a well-maintained condition to minimize
the likelihood of a fluid leak. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
3.
Stage all construction equipment in a location and manner to minimize air, soil, and
water pollution. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
4.
Require a Spill Prevention and Control Plan that is approved by the Forest Service
contracting officer representative for handling and storage of petroleum products. Keep
any storage of petroleum products in excess of 200 gallons within constructed
containment structures that have an impervious liner with a capacity equal to or larger
than the storage container. Locate the containment structure at least 150 feet from live
water. Before being used within 300 feet of the stream reconstruction site, inspect all
heavy equipment or other machinery for hydraulic leaks or other leaks. Do not use
leaking or faulty equipment. Clean equipment that has accumulations of oil, grease, or
other toxic materials prior to use in these areas. Do not permit disposal of petroleum
products on national forest land. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
5.
Fuel and lubricate at least 150 feet from all waterbodies. Service and refuel in a
manner that avoids spills and overfills. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
6.
Require a pollution and erosion control plan, approved by the Forest Service
contracting officer representative, prior to commencing construction activities. Ensure
that erosion control measures are in place before construction or staging of erodible
materials begins. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on experience)
7.
Divert or pump stream around work site. Place screens on pump intakes.
(Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on experience)
8.
Install silt fences, straw bales, and/or sand bag windrows as needed before excavation
occurs to separate the disturbed areas from the live water and prevent eroded soil from
entering the stream channel. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience [Clarkin et al.
2003])

result in minimal injury or disturbance to behavior. Ensure that a fisheries biologist is
present onsite during dewatering and all salvage operations. Reduce water volume
using pumping or diversion. Set up block nets to isolate areas to ensure that all species
are moved. Conduct electroshocking only when a biologist with at least 100 hours of
electrofishing experience is onsite to conduct or direct all activities associated with
capture attempts in accordance with Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing
Salmonids Listed under the Endangered Species Act (NMFS 2000) and Best
Management Practices for Pacific Lamprey (USFWS 2010). (Effectiveness: Moderate

move or avoid underground power lines. Restore all utility lines upon completion of
the project so that no loss of power occurs. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
Stage sanitary facilities such as chemical toilets at least 150 feet from waterbodies to
prevent contamination of surface or subsurface water. (Effectiveness: High, based on
experience)
Obtain and comply with all appropriate permits prior to ground-disturbing activities
(such as Joint Application for Stream Alteration Permit [Clean Water Act Section 404],

observed and activities would impact individuals or populations during implementation.
Appropriate measures would vary depending upon the ecology of the species involved
and nature of the activity. (Effectiveness: High, based on monitoring and experience)
25. Revegetate the project area using native and non-native species, as approved by the
forest native plant coordinator, immediately upon completion of the project.
(Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience)
26. Apply only certified weed-seed-free mulching material and seed. Seed inspection
testing is to be completed by a certified seed laboratory against the state noxious weed
lists and documentation of the test provided to the contracting officer representative or
designated inspector. Mulch material would be state certified weed free.
(Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience)
27. Soil, gravel, rock, and any material hauled to the project area must come from sources
determined to be weed free. Sources would be approved by a contracting officer
representative or designated inspector as weed free. (Effectiveness: High, based
on experience).
28. Following implementation, monitor to detect invasive and noxious weeds. Treat
identified weed infestations following the Nez Perce National Forest Noxious Weed EA
(USDA Forest Service 1988a), Biological Assessments (USDA Forest Service 2013b
draft), and Biological Opinions for Herbicide Treatment of Invasive and Noxious
Weeds on the Nez Perce National Forest (2013–2022) (NMFS and USFWS 2013 draft)

Other Specific Design and Mitigation Measures
45. The temporary bypass channel construction and fish and aquatic organism salvage
operations from the mainstem channel would occur after July 1 when steelhead and
Chinook salmon have emerged from redds and bull trout would not be migrating in the
project area. These dates may be adjusted for the particular site through coordination
with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team and other agencies. Fish passage would be
provided at all times for salmon, steelhead, bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and
redband/resident rainbow trout. (Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience and

48. Operate dewatering within the construction area continuously until project construction
has been completed to minimize turbidity and sedimentation. Turbid water may be
pumped to the floodplain or settling ponds to keep areas dry during construction and
reduce sediment input. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on experience)
49. Construct a temporary haul/access road through the project area to reduce potential
degradation to Road 233 and impacts to the public. Install crossing structures for the
bypass channel in 2 to 3 locations prior to watering the bypass channel. Decommission
haul/access road following use, but retain existing access roads for recreation.

floodplain work, and use until completion of the new floodplain and stream channel
(2–3 years). Install cofferdams and/or headgates on the mainstem channel to contain a
10-year flow event. Water bypass channel during high flows (estimated April to June),
but not fully use until the low-flow work window (July 1, or as agreed to during
consultation). The bypass channel would be evaluated for stability through cross
section and longitudinal analysis prior to watering. Slowly re-water the newly
constructed channel during low flow. Remove cofferdams and reshape the bypass
channel into the new floodplain. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience [i.e.
observations and work in Red River Narrows and Mill Creek])
Monitoring
The Forest Service and Nez Perce Tribe would inspect the projects during implementation for
implementation and compliance to ensure that they are completed per contract specifications and
to ensure that best management practices are followed. The project would also be monitored for
effectiveness to ensure that mitigation activities are meeting or working towards the desired
condition.
A fish biologist and/or other qualified personnel (stream restoration specialist, hydrologist, etc.)
from the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests or Nez Perce Tribe would ensure that the
mitigation measures and best management practices are being adequately implemented. The
Forest Service Contracting Officer Representative would be present most days during
construction, and a designated inspector would be onsite. Any last-minute changes made to
accommodate site-specific conditions must be within the range of effects analyzed in the EIS or
biological assessment, or authorized by permits to be prepared for this project. A fish biologist
or other qualified personnel would conduct compliance monitoring that tiers to regulatory
documents, including biological opinions, Section 404 Clean Water Act permits, and Section 401
water quality certification.
In addition, monitoring for vegetation survival and invasive plants would occur in the longer
term. Vegetation would be monitored in years 1, 3, and 5, 10 post-project for survival. Areas
would be replanted if success rates are less than 80%. Invasive weeds would be monitored and
treated at years 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 if new infestations are found. Photos, at established points,
would be taken of the floodplain prior to and post construction to document changes. The Nez
Perce Tribe may contract aerial photography prior to construction and post construction to
document the overall changes in the valley bottom. Additional monitoring such as large woody
debris counts, measuring entrenchment ratios, cobble embeddedness, and temperature may be
conducted over the long term to document changes in the project area from the proposed project.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study
Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all
reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that
were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the
solicitation of comments on the proposed actions in December 2012 and January 2013 suggested
additional alternatives for achieving the project purpose and fulfilling the need for the project.
Some of these alternatives were outside the scope of the project or duplicated the components of
the alternatives considered in detail. These alternatives were considered but dismissed from
detailed consideration, for reasons summarized below:

Meanders
•

Reconnect ponds to the river; no floodplain grading. This alternative was dropped
from further analysis because it did not meet the purpose and need of the project. Past
restoration activities in the Crooked River Meanders section included connecting the
river to the ponds. The ponds act as sediment sinks that impair overall fish habitat and
the gradient of the river channel is currently too low to adequately sort necessary
substrate for spawning and rearing habitat. This alternative would also continue to limit
the re-establishment of riparian vegetation that is necessary for shading, large woody
debris inputs, and food sources for aquatic organisms.

•

Reconstruct 11,000 feet of stream channel and 115 acres of floodplain; maintain
1-year bypass channel. This alternative would include reconstructing the stream
channel in the lower and upper ends of the project area along with the proposed stream
channel construction. This alternative would also regrade the floodplain such that
material would be terraced along the road side of the valley so that flooding would occur
only during a 500-year event. A bypass channel would be constructed and
decommissioned each year to pass water and fish. Under this alternative, there would be
fewer areas of wetlands being created than filled, there would be a high risk of adversely
affecting the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir downstream, and the phasing of
the project and the regraded material could not be redistributed within the constraints of
the construction season (June through September). Constructing a 1-year bypass channel
would mean conducting fish-salvage operations twice each year for each phase of
construction, which would likely increase the amount of take of ESA-listed fish. This
alternative was dropped from further analysis because it was un-constructible within the
construction window, posed high risks of damaging structures downstream, and
potentially increasing impacts to ESA-listed fish.

•

Remove mine tailings from valley and use for road material; maintain river channel
and ponds. This alternative would entail using large equipment to remove tailings piles
from the valley bottom and build up a road base for Road 233 through the Narrows.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

2-14

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

This alternative was dropped from further analysis because the material in the tailings
piles is unsuitable as road base material, the cost of hauling the material would be
prohibitive (>$6 million), and maintaining the current pond features would impair
substrate distribution, would impair hydrologic functions, and would not improve stream
temperatures of the river; thus, this alternative would not meet the purpose and need of
the project.
•

Phase the project with four reaches and complete all aspects of an entire reach
during one construction season. This alternative would entail completing all aspects of
an entire reach during one construction season, including constructing a temporary
bypass channel, regrading the floodplain, reconstructing the new channel and bank
stabilization structures, installing large woody debris, rewatering the new channel, and
decommissioning the bypass channel. Temporary stabilization measures would be
required for the first three phases in the newly constructed stream channel and floodplain
to prevent downcutting of the new channel during high spring flows. Temporary
stabilization measures would include grade control structures to step down the new
channel 3 feet into the existing channel and address the risk of head-cutting back
upstream into the new channel. Similarly, temporary stabilization measures would be
required to transition the new floodplain to existing ground and prevent floodplain
erosion. These structures would prevent fish passage through the project area between
construction phases. Constructing a 1-year bypass channel would mean conducting fishsalvage operations twice each year for each phase of construction, which would likely
increase the amount of take of ESA-listed fish. This alternative was eliminated due to
channel in-stability between construction seasons (i.e., high flow) and the risk of
increased impacts to ESA-listed fish.

•

Various small fixes to the stream channel to improve fish habitat. Alternatives such
as adding large woody debris to the current channel and cutting off Meander bends to
increase the stream gradient, as well as reconnecting some of the ponds to the main
channel, were considered but dropped from further analysis. These types of projects have
been implemented over the last 35 years in the Crooked River watershed and the South
Fork Clearwater tributaries. Periodic monitoring of these efforts indicate that small,
piecemeal restoration projects have failed to substantially restore the fisheries; therefore,
it was determined that these types of actions would not meet the purpose and need of the
project. A long-term improvement to instream habitat and the overall fisheries in the
watershed requires restoring the hydrologic functions of the watershed. This requires
stream channel-floodplain interactions, which cannot be achieved without floodplain
regrading.

•

Regrade 115 acres of floodplain and reconstruct up to 7,400 feet of stream channel
in other configurations. Some commenters requested analysis of the same concept of
floodplain regrading and channel reconstruction, but with various alternatives to the

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

proposed layout of the stream channel. The stream channel was developed to exhibit a
meandering pattern and a range of riverbed elevations to support development of variable
flow condition, which would in turn maintain instream habitat features (riffles and pools)
for aquatic habitat. The stream channel could have been designed to meander on one side
of the valley or the other. There are an infinite number of configurations for the new
channel. All of these would have met the purpose and need of the project; however,
designing each of these configurations would be cost prohibitive and the overall benefits
to resources from the small changes in channel location would be similar in their effects.
Therefore, the alternative involving various stream channel configurations has been
dropped from further analysis.

Narrows Road
The Narrows Road component of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project was removed
from detailed study in this EIS by the deciding official in December 2013. The reasons for
removing the Narrows Road component include the priority to directly improve habitat in the
Meanders area. The Narrows Road design plan is also currently at 25 percent so more
information and planning is necessary to analyze impacts and complete the required
environmental analysis for NEPA, Endangered Species Act consultation and Clean Water Act
Section 404 permitting efforts in a timely manner. Moreover, the Narrows Road project is a
separate action from the Meanders and not dependent or connected to the Meanders proposed
actions so the NEPA analysis for the Narrow Road component, referred to as the Crooked River
Narrows Road Improvement Project, could be completed in the future (Appendix C).
Because the Narrows Road component was removed from this EIS, the alternatives listed in this
section were eliminated from detailed analysis. The following is a summary of the alternatives
considered for the Narrows Road.
•

No Action (Alternative A). This alternative was eliminated because it is not needed for
this analysis.

•

Proposed Action (Alternative B). Leave the 3 miles of Road 233 in the valley bottom
through the narrow canyon, but re-aligning sections to be out of the 2- and 50-year
floodplain. All material excavated to move the road would be used in the construction of
the new road base. This alternative is considered as a future foreseeable action once
more planning and design is completed and is considered in the cumulative effects
analysis in sections of this EIS and Appendix C.

•

Re-route Access Using Deadwood (Alternative C). Re-routing access from Road 233
and using Roads 1803 and 522 (Deadwood Road) as the main access route. This
alternative would decommission 3 miles of Road 233 into a non-motorized trail.

•

Decommission all roads in the watershed. Some commenters advocated
decommissioning more or all of the roads in the Crooked River watershed. Some access

to the watershed needs to be maintained for private property, recreation, fire suppression,
and other future management activities. This alternative was not considered in detail
because it would not meet the purpose and need of the project and management
objectives of the Forest Plan and is of larger scope than this project. This alternative
would also be cost prohibitive.
•

Relocate road out of the 100-year floodplain. The Forest Service reviewed an
alternative for moving Road 233 out of the 100-year floodplain, but maintaining it in the
valley bottom. This would require disturbing more than 30 acres and removing more
than 650,000 cubic yards of material, and cost prohibitive (> $6 million). This alternative
was eliminated due to the excessive impact on the environment and prohibitive cost.

•

Relocate road onto the near (east) hillside, constructing 4.8 miles of road. The Forest
Service reviewed an option for moving Road 233 onto the near (east) hillside. This
would disturb more than 30 acres and remove more than 395,000 cubic yards of material
and have road grades greater than 12%. This alternative was eliminated due to the
excessive impact on the environment and cost prohibitive (> $5 million).

•

Relocate road onto the near (east) hillside, constructing 5.6 miles of road. The Forest
Service reviewed an alternative for moving Road 233 onto the near (east) hillside. This
would disturb more than 30 acres and remove approximately 470,000 cubic yards of
material, and have greater than 12% road grades. This option was eliminated due to the
excessive impact on the environment and prohibitive cost.

•

Relocate road onto hillside across the river. The Forest Service reviewed an
alternative for relocating the road across the river onto the far hillside. This would have
the same environmental and economic consequences as relocating the road out of the
100-year floodplain, as well as the impacts and cost of constructing two additional
bridges across Crooked River; thus, the option was eliminated.

Meanders and Narrows Road
•

Administratively withdraw mineral activities in the project area. Some commenters
advocated the withdrawal of mining claims and actions within the project area. This
alternative was not considered in detail because it is more appropriately considered in the
current Forest Plan revision effort than at a project level and is, therefore, outside the
scope of the project and this EIS.

Proposed Forest Plan Amendments
See Appendix D for details of the project-specific proposed Forest Plan Amendments.

Soils
Past mining activities have altered soil conditions in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project area. The current Forest Plan standards and the Forest Service Region 1 soil quality
guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. A proposed project-specific
amendment would exempt this project from Forest Plan Standard #2, allowing for activities to
occur on areas with greater than 20% soil detrimental disturbance, as long as soil improvement
activities are implemented.
Based on current soil conditions, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for
Alternative 2 to allow the Meanders stream restoration of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project.

Heritage
Past mining activities along the Crooked River have created cultural properties and historic sites.
The current cultural resource Forest Plan standards provide direction to: identify sites and
protect on a site-by-site basis (Standard #2), and to protect and preserve National Register and
National Register–eligible cultural resources (Standard #4). In addition, Management Area 3 –
Standard #4 directs the forest to protect National Register and National Register–eligible sites
from deterioration or destruction. The proposed action would not protect the large majority of
identified cultural properties in the project area and would have adverse effects on these
properties.
A proposed project-specific amendment would exempt this project from Cultural Resource
Forest Plan Standards #2 and #4, or Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource Standard #4,
allowing for activities to impact or destroy National Register and National Register–eligible
cultural resources. To mitigate effects on cultural resources, as part of the proposed action
several representative areas of historic dredge mining would be preserved and interpretation
materials would be installed. Consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office would
also occur.
Based on current heritage conditions, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for the
preferred alternative to allow the Meanders stream restoration of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project.

Summary of Short-term Impacts
The short-term adverse effects that could be caused by the proposed project include:
•

Increased turbidity in Crooked River due to instream restoration work and culvert
replacement/removal

•

Potential increased water temperature due to removal of existing riparian vegetation for
channel reconstruction and temporary bypass construction

•

Reduction in shading due to removal of existing larger trees in the Crooked River
riparian area
Disturbance of individual fish and macroinvertebrates
Disturbance of existing wetlands
Modification of wildlife species habitat and distributions of sensitive and management

Summary of Long-term Benefits
The long-term benefits to be gained through the implementation of the proposed project include
the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Improved fish habitat in Crooked River by restoring stream and floodplain function,
restoring instream fish habitat complexity, and improving water quality
Recovery of natural processes in the Crooked River floodplain, which would improve
habitat conditions (cover and forage) for many of the wildlife species using this area
Decreased soil compaction and surface/substratum erosion problems in the watershed
Improved fish habitat due to reduction in sediment yield, increased pool habitat quality,
and improved health of the riparian plant community
Reduced water temperatures in Crooked River with potential attainment of water
temperature criteria and removal from the §305(b) list for temperature impairment.

Summary of Unavoidable Adverse Effects
Under Alternative 2, there would be impacts on fish within the project area and downstream to
the South Fork Clearwater River. Efforts would be made to work within the in-water work fish
“window” as designated by the USFWS and NMFS, and to reduce sediment and turbidity during
construction. Fish would be provided migratory passage for the duration of the project. Under

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

2-29

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2, there would be direct mortality to adult western toads, egg masses, tadpoles, and
juveniles during construction of the temporary bypass channel and dewatering/rechanneling of
existing open water ponded environments; construction of the temporary bypass road;
dewatering of the main Crooked River channel; dewatering of the temporary bypass channel;
regrading/reshaping of the valley bottom, stream channel, and tailing piles; and equipment
traffic. The alternatives are consistent with Forest Plan direction to the extent that proposed
management actions would not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive wildlife
populations.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
Alternative 2 would result in the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of heritage resources.
Mining waste and associated artifacts are not only physical representations of history, they—
even when newly created—give a visual sense of history. Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act makes reference to this visual sense of history when allowing that historic
properties may still be eligible for listing even when they have been newly modified, as long as
they maintain their visual sense of place. Nowhere is this more applicable than to historic
mining areas, known as historic vernacular landscapes. The mining waste and associated
artifacts are irretrievable. Once removed from their contextual resting places, artifacts lose their
archaeological value as information resources, and if restoration were to take place, the inability
to recreate the tailings piles exactly as they were would be irreversible.
Cutting of live and dead trees from the project area for channel construction and floodplain
development would be an irreversible commitment of that resource. Areas stripped of trees
would be replanted or allowed to regenerate.
Human resources would be used for the construction and maintenance of the project. Economic
commitments are also an irretrievable investment. The estimated approximate cost of the
preferred alternative is $2.5 million. Funds have already been committed or spent for planning,
design, environmental studies, and drafting the environmental impact statement.
Implementation of any action alternative would commit an undetermined amount of fossil fuels
in order to transport material and implement other activities.
The project implementation would result in some loss of fish and wildlife habitat and
displacement of fish and wildlife during construction. Stream habitat lost would be replaced by
construction of a new channel. Wetland habitats and their associated functions and values lost as
a result of the project would be replaced.
Proposed project activities would modify wildlife species habitat and would result in short-term
changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive and management indicator wildlife
species. The project would result in some loss of wildlife habitat and displacement of wildlife

species during implementation of project activities. There would be an irretrievable commitment
of resources with the loss of potential breeding sites (ponds) for western toads.
Proposed project activities would modify sensitive plant species habitat and would result in
short-term changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive plant species. However,
long-term habitat conditions would not be irretrievably or irreversibly lost.
The loss of native vegetation to new or expanding weed infestations would be a possible
irretrievable effect if active restoration to native species is not pursued. Intensive invasive
treatments and native plant restoration work would improve habitats and plant communities,
which would minimize and avoid irreversible effects.
The commitment of resources is based on the belief that the condition of the natural environment
in the watershed would be improved by the proposed project. The primary benefits would be
improved fish habitat and water quality.

Scope of Analysis
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the environment, in and adjacent to the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project area on the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, that
may affect or be affected by the alternatives presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also describes
the potential environmental consequences of implementing each of the alternatives. Effects are
quantified where possible, and/or are qualitatively discussed. The individual discussions are
organized by issue and resource concern. Appendices A through F present additional drawings,
plans, maps, and other information used in this analysis.

How past decisions and directions were considered and relate to this project (e.g., Nez
Perce Forest Plan FEIS, other past project EAs or EISs, project-specific resource reports,
and other sources of information, as indicated).

Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects
Environmental consequences form the scientific and analytical basis for comparison of
alternatives, including the proposed action, through compliance with Forest Plan standards and a
summary of monitoring required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the
National Forest Management Act (NFMA). The discussion centers on direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects along with applicable mitigation measures. Irreversible and irretrievable
effects are also discussed. Effects of each action can be neutral, beneficial, and/or adverse. The
terms are defined as follows:
•
•
•

Direct effects are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place.
Indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or further removed in
distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.
Cumulative effects are those that result from the incremental impact of the action when
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.

Irreversible effects are permanent or essentially permanent resource uses or losses; they
cannot be restored or returned to their original condition. Examples of irreversible effects
include minerals that have been extracted or soil productivity that has been lost.
Irretrievable effects occur when a resource is removed or consumed.

Pursuant to CEQ’s NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500.1(b) and 1500.4), this document
summarizes the completed analysis and forms the scientific and analytical basis for the
comparison of alternatives at the end of Chapter 2. Unless specifically stated otherwise,
additional supporting information, as well as analysis assumptions and methodologies, are
contained in the project planning record (project file) located at the Nez Perce – Clearwater
National Forests Supervisor’s Office in Grangeville, Idaho. The project record also contains
information resulting from public involvement efforts. The project record is available to review
during regular business hours and information is available upon request.

Consideration of Past, Ongoing, and Reasonably
Foreseeable Activities
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has provided guidance to federal agencies on the
consideration of past actions in cumulative effects analysis (CEQ 2005).
Cumulative impact is defined in CEQ’s NEPA regulations as the “impact on the environment
that results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions…” (40 CFR 1508.7). CEQ has interpreted this regulation
as referring only to the cumulative impact of the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action
and its alternatives when added to the aggregate effects of past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions (CEQ 2005).
As CEQ stated, “The environmental analysis required under NEPA is forward looking, in that it
focuses on the potential impacts of the proposed alternatives that an agency is considering.
Thus, review of past actions is required to the extent that the review informs agency
decisionmakers regarding the proposed action.” As the CEQ further stated, “Generally, agencies
can conduct an adequate cumulative effects analysis by focusing on the current aggregate effects
of past actions without delving into the historic details of individual past actions” (CEQ 2005).
In Lands Council v. Powell, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that, under the
circumstances presented in the case, proper cumulative impact analysis required some cataloging
of past projects and their effect on the current project area. Furthermore, such cataloging should
provide sufficient detail to allow for analysis of the differences between prior projects and
proposed projects, which could provide the information necessary to consider alternatives that
might have less impact on the environment.
While CEQ found that cataloging past actions and specific information about the direct and
indirect effects of a past project’s design and implementation could in some contexts be useful to

predict the cumulative effects of the proposal, the regulations do not require the Forest Service to
catalog or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past actions (CEQ 2005).
There is a marked difference between past and current Forest Service land management practices
and policies. This evolution in land management practices (including those related to stream
rehabilitation and road management projects) is the result of the application of scientific
principles/research science and our ongoing monitoring actions.
During the analysis process and subsequent preparation of this DEIS, the Forest Service
determined what information regarding past actions was useful and relevant to the analysis of
cumulative effects. We have provided a discussion of known past activities and their general
effects by each resource area, with more detail in Appendix C and the project record. The
aggregate effects of past, ongoing, and future foreseeable actions are reflected in the description
of existing resource conditions in this chapter and have been considered in the analysis of effects.

Aquatic Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project alternatives
on aquatic resources, including aquatic species that are listed as threatened and endangered under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Forest Service sensitive species and management
indicator species (MIS).
The geographic scope of the analysis for aquatic resources focuses primarily on the Crooked
River watershed, but also includes Deadwood Creek sub-watershed, a tributary to Red River.
Crooked River drains north into the South Fork Clearwater River, approximately 57 miles
upstream of Kooskia, Idaho.
Project Area
The proposed project and direct and indirect effects analysis area consists of 2 miles of stream
restoration. The project boundary extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked
River and includes the entire valley bottom. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends
from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game weir) to approximately 2.0 miles upstream. Indirect effects are considered throughout the
entire Crooked River watershed as bull trout and steelhead, along with numerous sensitive
species, inhabit and migrate throughout the Crooked River watershed (Figure 3-1).
Cumulative Effects Area
For aquatic resources, the cumulative effects area includes the project area, the Crooked River
watershed, as well as the South Fork Clearwater River from the mouth of Crooked River
downstream to the Forest Service boundary at Mount Idaho Grade bridge. See Appendix C,
Figures C-1 and C-2, for a display of watersheds used in this analysis.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Information for this analysis has been gathered from a variety of sources. The Nez Perce –
Clearwater National Forests and Nez Perce Tribe have conducted site-specific inventories of fish
habitat conditions and population status throughout the watershed. Several studies that directly
relate to Crooked River and its aquatic resources were completed, including the Design Criteria
Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Crooked River Wetland
Delineation Report (Geum 2012), and Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
Design (RDG et al. 2013a). The Design Criteria Report summarizes an investigation and
evaluation of approximately 2 miles and 115 acres of lower Crooked River valley being
considered for restoration. Additional temperature data were collected through the summer of
2013 by the Nez Perce Tribe. In addition, peer-reviewed scientific literature has been used as the
primary source of information regarding the life histories and habitat requirements of the aquatic
organisms of Crooked River and the effect of natural and human-caused disturbance upon
those organisms.

Indicators
The analysis compares the effects of the alternatives using the following indicators:
•

Pool Quality/Quantity
o The ratio of pools to riffles (pool:riffle ratio) is an indicator of habitat quantity,
and complexity, both of which are important elements for salmonid fishes in
streams. In addition, the quality of pools is an important consideration. Pool
quality is generally indicated by pool volume and pool depth. However, in this
project area, indicators of habitat quality or complexity are pool-forming
processes such as large woody debris input, lateral migration of channel potential
(entrenchment), and flow acceleration from riffle-pool morphology.

•

Habitat features (large woody debris, spawning and rearing habitat, fish passage,
floodplain connectivity)
o Large woody debris provides habitat complexity and cover, and assists in pool
creation and maintenance in stream systems, as well as macro-invertebrate
habitat.
o Spawning and rearing habitat are analyzed through flow velocities, depth, cover,
substrate quality and quantity, and off-channel refuges.
o Ability for all life-stages of fish to move, unimpeded, to spawning, rearing, and
overwintering habitat, is critical for the survival and continuance of migrating
species.
o Fish passage was analyzed through hydraulic modeling of maximum velocities
and comparisons with literature review of fish swimming abilities.
o Floodplain connectivity is important for sediment transport and deposition
processes; riparian vegetation growth and recruitment; and juvenile fish refugia at
high flows.

•

Temperature
o Water temperature, which controls the rate of biologic process, is of critical
concern for fish populations and is a primary indicator of habitat conditions. The
South Fork Clearwater River is included on the 1998 Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality (IDEQ) Section 303(d) list (IDEQ 1998) of water-qualitylimited water bodies because of temperature. Decreases in streamside shading in
riparian habitat conservation areas result in increases in water temperature.
Changes in shading can be due to a variety of factors, including vegetative
succession (the replacement of one plant community with another over time),
mortality, and/or project activities.
o Potential increases or decreases in stream temperature were analyzed by assessing
the conditions and the nature and extent of activities in riparian areas that may
result in increased or decreased solar radiation to streams and connected wetland
areas.
o Groundwater maintains a near constant temperature, and interaction with the
stream can influence and benefit nutrients and temperature in the channel.
Connection of the stream with the ground- and hillslope water is imperative for
decreases in water temperature.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
This section includes a description of existing conditions in the Crooked River watershed and the
direct and indirect effects on aquatic resources in Crooked River within the project area
(Figure 2-1 in Chapter 2). This section also includes a discussion of species in the project area
that are included on the list of threatened and endangered species established under the
Endangered Species Act and species in the project area that have been designated by the Forest
Service as sensitive species or MIS.
Pool Quality & Quantity
Pools offer important habitat functions for most life stages of the listed and sensitive fish species
present in Crooked River. Juveniles utilize pools and pool margins for rearing and
overwintering; adult anadromous fish use pools during migration as resting zones; and resident
ESA-listed and sensitive fish overwinter in pools, as well as use pools for depth cover.
Riffles are dually important for salmonid species. Salmonids feed mainly on the
macroinvertebrates that live in the riffle habitats. Most salmonids spawn at the tailout of pools
(shallow crest at downstream end of pool) or in riffle-type habitats where the eggs will be
sufficiently aerated and stay free of deposited sediments.
The ratio of pools to riffles (pool:riffle ratio) is an indicator of habitat quantity, and complexity,
both of which are important elements for salmonid fishes in streams. In addition, the quality of
pools is an important consideration. Pool quality is generally indicated by pool volume, depth,
and cover. However, in this project area, indicators of habitat quality or complexity are pool
forming processes such as, large woody debris (LWD) input, lateral migration of channel
(entrenchment), and flow acceleration from riffle-pool morphology.
The quantity of pools in the 3.1-miles of Crooked River through the project area is fairly high
(n>70). Many are the result of past rehabilitation efforts of connecting dredge ponds or are
legacy from the dredging activity. These pool types can be deep, but due to the lack of
functioning hydraulics, most act as sediment traps for fine sediments and will eventually fill in.
Additionally, the pools lack cover or complexity preferred by focal fish species (e.g., steelhead
and bull trout).
Snorkeling observations in September 2013 (conducted by NPT and Nez Perce – Clearwater
National Forests) indicated very low numbers of all fish in the lower reaches of the project area.
In Reach 4, five larger westslope cutthroat trout were observed in a pool formed by a small LWD
jam. Reach 4 had 5 pools/100 meters with an average residual pool volume of about 2,000 ft3
(RDG et al. 2012). In Reach 3, one large cutthroat was observed in a mid-channel scour pool,
with a very small number of juvenile chinook and whitefish also in the lower portion of the pool.
Reach 3 had 10 pools/100 meters with an average residual pool volume of about 9,500 ft3.
Reach 2 had the highest density of fish observed, with a much higher species and size class
diversity. Two large bull trout, as well as juvenile bull trout were observed; all seemed to be

associated with LWD complexes. In addition, a very large school of adult whitefish, schools
(n>20) of juvenile chinook, two adult cutthroat, and a few adult brook trout were all observed
within one meander wavelength (see Figure 3-2). Reach 2 had 9 pools/100 meters and an
average residual pool volume of about 5,000 ft3.
Pool-forming and maintenance processes are lacking through most of the project area. The
current conditions include: a disconnected floodplain; diminished large woody debris
recruitment potential; limited lateral migration, and the inherent lateral scour is restricted due to
the tailing piles; and lack of stream bed complexity. Field observations indicate the hydraulics,
due to the dredge activity, are forced into 90-degree corners in these large meanders. The stream
channel has been so drastically altered standard pool-forming and maintenance processes are
hardly present; water eddies on the outside corner and flows back upstream. This causes the
majority of the flow to be pushed to the inside corner. This translates to fine sediment settling on
the upstream side of the outside of the bend. Snorkeling surveys indicated very little fish use in
the these large pools and eddy areas. Macroinvertebrate communities could shift from one
associated with cobbles and gravels (which are highly available to fish due to drift) to one more
unavailable such as burrowing insects. See Figure 3-2.
Large woody debris complexes and potential recruitment is very low. Conifers are the dominant
overstory throughout the project area, but very few are within feet of the stream to provide
effective shade or contribute terrestrial invertebrate prey to aquatic organisms. There is little
interaction between the woody species and the stream, due to distance from the stream and a
disconnected floodplain. In Figure 3-2, woody species and distance to stream can be seen. See
more discussion about large woody debris in Habitat features section below.
Entrenchment can be a surrogate for lateral migration potential on a stream system.
(Entrenchment quantifies the accessibility of the floodplain; it is the ratio of the floodplain width
to the bankfull width—the lower the number, the greater the entrenchment.) Through the
Crooked River project area, entrenchment varies from 1.7–2.5. The greatest entrenchment value
(1.7) was measured within the severely meandered section with the very high dredge piles. This
accounts for approximately one-third of the project area. In a functioning system similar to
Crooked River, entrenchment values would be greater than 2.4 (Rosgen and Silvey 1996),
indicating a low, wide floodplain.
A ratio of pools to riffles can begin to quantify habitat complexity. Overall in the project area,
pools are the dominant habitat type with up to 63% of the morphology consisting of pools. With
over 60% of the habitat in one habitat type, the current condition lacks complex bed form.

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the Meanders section of Crooked River in a manner that would minimize future
disturbance or degradation of aquatic resources, but there would be no actions to improve aquatic
habitat. Under this Alternative, BPA would not provide funding toward the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project; the Corps would not grant appropriate permits; and the Forest Service and
NPT would not be able to construct the project as described. The natural recovery processes would
be the only mechanism for improvement to the channel or floodplain.
Pool habitat would remain in the highly altered condition that currently exists in Crooked River
under Alternative 1. The pool:riffle ratio would remain at the existing conditions (63:37),
maintaining many pools with low complexity. LWD input would remain limited. Entrenchment
would remain at current conditions at 1.7–2.5.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The natural recovery process would result in a gradual adjustment to an equilibrium state
(sediment inputs equal to sediment outputs), with a more natural ratio of pools and riffles
throughout the project area; however, these processes would be extremely long term. Major
flood events would slowly undercut the dredged materials, scouring and redistributing the piles
of mining waste. The redistribution of these materials would result in the formation of a more
naturally sinuous channel with pool habitat occurring on the corners, at large woody debris jams,
or against bedrock outcrops. Through these natural processes, under Alternative 1, the area
would eventually return to a more natural condition; however, in Crooked River, the expected
rebound would be very slow. From hydraulic analysis, it is estimated that a 500-year flow event
would be necessary to move the material in the tailings piles (RDG et al. 2012). A feasibility
study conducted on Newsome Creek, a heavily mined tributary to the South Fork Clearwater
about 10 miles downstream from the mouth of Crooked River, estimated that natural recovery
within the project area would require between 1,000 and 5,000 years or more (Clear Creek
Hydrology and North Wind 2004). Aquatic habitat would remain degraded and hamper fish
recovery efforts in Crooked River during this recovery process.
Two events that were at or near 100-year return interval flows have occurred in the Crooked
River watershed since the dredging ceased: one in the 1970s, and the most recent in 1996–97.
Very little change was observed following these flows. Of note, a restoration project was
completed in the upper end of the project area in the 1980s that removed the floodplain dredge
materials but retained the tortuous meander pattern. Little to no change to the channel planform
has been observed in this section in the past 20–25 years, even with two very large flow events.
Figure 3-8 shows a comparison of intact dredge piles and stream channel (left) and the area of
past dredge pile removal and stream channel (right). Because the high flows can access the
floodplains, fine sediment can settle out in the channel. The channel is shallower, but no change
has occurred to the planform of the channel, as it is still in a tortuous meander pattern. Also, few
woody species have recolonized the floodplain. There is nearly 100% solar radiation on the
stream channel where the dredge piles were removed and no planting occurred or was
unsuccessful.
The natural recovery of stream morphology and riparian conditions would be very slow due to
the extreme level of alteration across the entire valley bottom. The slow pace of recovery would
do little in the short term to improve habitat complexity and aid in the recovery of sensitive,
threatened, or endangered species within the project area. There would be no short-term direct
or indirect effects such as those that are associated with Alternative 2.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 activities would include building a bypass channel around the project area to pass
fish and water while the floodplain and new channel were being constructed to minimize impacts
to fish and water quality. The bypass channel would be constructed by connecting the ponds on
the east side of the valley. This would create a fairly diverse habitat structure; however,

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

spawning and rearing would not be expected nor planned for in the bypass channel design
because it would be used short term (3-4 years). Channel design of the bypass channel was
modeled to ensure fish passage and water holding capacity for flows up to the Q10 (about 1,000
cfs) (RDG et al. (2013a) used the HEC-RAS model to evaluate). Maximum velocities at this
flow level would range from 1.6 to 11.3 ft/s with an average of 6.9 ft/s. Velocities along the
margins would be much lower (0.1 to 2.5 ft/s). With lower flows (≤ Q2), velocities would likely
be considerably lower and could support juvenile rearing habitat. The current ponds are 2–6 feet
deep, which would allow for potential rearing and rest for migrating adults. The bypass has been
designed to not inhibit up- or down-stream anadromous and fluvial fish migration patterns.
Additionally, there is little spawning in the majority of the project area by steelhead or Chinook
(Kiefer and Lockhart 1997; Hall-Griswold and Petrosky 1998). Most Chinook redds are
observed in the upper reach of the project area (Reaches 1), where wood could be added and
floodplain dredge piles removed but which would not be dewatered or new channel built.
Under Alternative 2, a more natural sinuous channel would be constructed with floodplain
connectivity, woody debris habitat features, channel spanning woody debris cover, and
revegetation of native species. All of these elements would enhance pool habitat by increasing
pool-forming processes, thermoregulation, and protective cover necessary for aquatic species.
The proposed design incorporates 30% pools, 40% riffles, 10% runs, and 20% glides (see
Figure 3-3), creating a much more diverse habitat structure with much more spawning habitat for
Chinook salmon and steelhead. In the South Fork Salmon River drainage the highest numbers of
salmonids were associated with a pool:riffle ratio of about 30:70 (Platts 1974). Glides, or, in
most cases, pool tailouts have the highest spawning site selection among Chinook salmon and
steelhead (Sommer et al. 2001). Riffles are important macroinvertebrate producing habitat types,
and are sometimes selected for spawning if not too shallow or fast (Platts et al. 1983).
Also, with a more natural meander wavelength and structure than in the current condition, the
stream slope would be doubled, from the existing 0.003 to 0.006 (ft/ft) through the valley. By
increasing the slope towards the natural slope of the valley, sediment transport processes would
be regained in the system; proper slope for sediment transport processes is important to minimize
aggradation (sediment deposition) or down-cutting in a stream system, as well as creating clean,
unembedded spawning gravels. This design creates the opportunity for variable hydraulics to
maintain the bedform and a highly complex habitat to increase spawning potential and higherquality rearing sites.

Recruitment of large woody debris would be expected to increase following floodplain and
stream rehabilitation due to proximity of the riparian area proposed planting, and establishment
of riparian vegetation. The proposed riparian community would be a spruce/alder-dominated
system. Both of these species are hydrophilic (water-loving) and would thrive on the newly
created floodplain. In roughly 30–50 years, trees would be large enough to begin to influence
pool-forming and maintenance processes if they entered the stream course. Floodplain grading
and channel reconstruction would increase the entrenchment value to 2.5–10 throughout the
project area, thus decreasing entrenchment (Table 3-1). Figures 3-4 and 3-5 depict the difference
in floodplain access between the current condition and the proposed design of Crooked River at a
2-year return interval stream flow (Q2). Floodplain access has many benefits, including
deposition of fines, decreased shear stress in channel/on banks, off-channel refugia for juvenile
salmonids, high potential for allochthonous inputs into the stream system, and seed dispersal.

Habitat features (large woody debris, spawning and rearing habitat, fish passage,

Large woody debris provides habitat complexity and cover, and assists in pool creation and
maintenance in stream systems. It also has the added benefit of increasing diversity in the
macro-invertebrate habitat and species (Hrodey et al. 2008). The extreme level of past
disturbance in Crooked River has left the project area devoid of LWD and recruitment potential.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-12

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Stream surveys yielded 2–5 single pieces and 1–2 LWD aggregates per 100 meters of stream
(Table 3-2).
Large woody debris increases the ability of stream habitat to support and produce salmonid
species through pool creation and maintenance (Cederholm et al. 1997), added cover and hiding
from predators (Fraser and Cerri 1982), refuge from high-velocity flows (Bustard and Narver
1975), and greater macro-invertebrate diversity (Hrodey et al. 2008; Rogers 2003).
The past dredge mining activities removed all of the woody debris and vegetation throughout the
valley bottom. The highly disturbed valley and dredge tailing piles have naturally re-vegetated
with lodgepole pine providing little shade or large wood recruitment (Geum 2012). Although
conifers compose 30% of the project area, they are growing on top of the dredge piles and not
recruiting wood or contributing shade to the stream. The three greenline surveys yielded seven
mature trees (>10 years old) along the greenline of the stream, and in total only 18 conifers were
counted in the greenline. No dead trees, considered near-future LWD recruitment, were counted
in the surveys. Greenline surveys are conducted along the first perennial vegetation that forms a
lineal grouping of community types on or near the water’s edge (Winward 2000).
Spawning and rearing habitat were analyzed using five components: flow velocities, depth,
cover, substrate quality and quantity, and off-channel refugia. Existing condition spawning
habitat, as modeled by using substrate size class 50–75 mm, is less than 2 acres (Table 3-2;
RDG et al. 2013a). This is less than the potential for the area based on the altered flow velocities
and habitat complexity to transport and sort the necessary substrate sizes. It is also very limited
to the upstream and downstream ends of the Meanders project area. The Meanders section has
very little potential spawning gravels due to the altered flow velocities. Data obtained from 2004
suggests cobble embeddedness was 80%, which exceeds the 30% standard set for the Nez Perce
Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 2005a).
Rearing habitat, modeled with parameters of depth less than 1 foot and velocity less than 1 foot
per second, was quantified at 2.45 acres (Figure 3-6) through the project area (Hillman et al.
1987). The modeled juvenile-rearing area does not take into account overhead cover,
temperature, and substrate; therefore, this number is likely high. Most of the ponds in the project
area, created by past mining, are not connected at low flow, which limits juvenile rearing to the
main channel.
Upstream and downstream passage is critical to most fish species in the South Fork Clearwater
drainage. Salmon, steelhead, bull trout, and lamprey depend on uninhibited upstream passage to
the cold headwaters streams to spawn during the fall or spring and seek refuge during the hot
summer months. Juvenile salmonids and other native fish species utilize Crooked River and its
many tributaries for refuge during high spring flows on the South Fork Clearwater. Cutthroat
trout move in and out of the tributaries, moving for desired temperature, increased feeding
opportunities and spawning habitat (personal communication, M. Dobos, 2013).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Crooked River through the Meanders reach has highly altered hydraulics and runoff hydrology.
Spring flows are attenuated through the unnatural morphology of the valley bottom, namely the
highly porous and conductive tailings and ponds adjacent to the river. During base flow, there
are areas of atypical flow patterns (Figure 3-2) where flow eddies in large pools, or large
backwater areas in the main channel. Fish are currently passing through the area, but few have
been observed staging in the project area, waiting for the right water conditions or cues to move
up to spawning areas. Spawning and most rearing occurs upstream of the area that would be
bypassed during project implementation (NPT surveys 2013, Kiefer and Lockhart 1997; HallGriswold and Petrosky 1998).
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, habitat complexity and spawning and rearing areas in the Meanders project
area would remain in the current condition, or decrease over time. New conifer growth potential
in the riparian area is low due to the steep, nutrient-poor slopes of the dredge piles. Future LWD
recruitment would remain very limited. Levels of LWD would remain about the same (2–5
single pieces and 1–2 LWD aggregates per 100 meters of stream) (see Table 3-2).
Spawning and rearing habitat, under Alternative 1, would remain in a similar condition and of a
similar amount (less than 2 acres spawning and 2.45 acres juvenile-rearing habitats) or decrease
over time (Table 3-2). There is potential in the very long term that recovery of the valley bottom
could occur, but would take up to thousands of years. Cobble embeddedness in the riffles and
pool tailouts is very high compared to areas that have not been altered by dredge mining,
resulting in a reduction in quality spawning habitat Hydraulic complexity would remain low
and, therefore, lead to increased sedimentation, thereby decreasing suitable salmon, steelhead,
and bull trout spawning area. Overwinter rearing habitat would decrease at the same rate as
sedimentation of the cobbles occurred. Off-channel rearing would remain low, and possibly
decrease due to sedimentation over time.
Fish passage would remain in the current state through the Meanders reach. It is assumed,
because there are no barriers, that fish pass up and down stream through the reach.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Activities proposed under Alternative 2 would have short and long term effects to fisheries in
Crooked River. The bypass channel, as stated above, would not be designed or built for specific
fish habitat needs. The bypass channel would potentially reduce the amount of spawning and
rearing habitat; however, there is very little spawning occurring in the proposed instream impact
area (IDFG redd surveys). Also, extremely low densities of juvenile steelhead were observed
during a snorkeling survey in 2013 (two juvenile steelhead in three 300-foot snorkel lengths).
Other fish densities were low as well, although there were large (n>20) schools of juvenile
Chinook observed in Reach 2. The pools in the bypass channel could serve as surrogate rearing
habitat for the short term (3–4 years) while floodplain and channel construction is occurring.
Under Alternative 2, habitat complexity would be immediately increased following proposed
rehabilitation activities. Addition of large woody debris is proposed under this alternative, and it
would be expected to increase through the project area up to and greater than 100 pieces per
100 meters (Table 3-2). The cover and habitat complexity created by addition of large woody
debris would be expected to be beneficial because the project design would result in creation of
debris jams similar to those that existed prior to the dredge mining, as indicated by large woody
debris data from similar stream reaches in undisturbed watersheds, in which densities of juvenile
fish are much higher (Cederholm et al. 1997).
Photographs from the 1980s show conifers just beginning to become established on the dredge
piles and near the stream. From that evidence, the conifers planted would result in a shadeproducing overstory, and provide a source of large woody debris in about 30 years. As shown in
Figures 3-2 and 3-8, the 30- to 50-year-old vegetation is adding little shade to the stream channel
through the project area. In 30–50 years following the project with a connected floodplain,
natural meander pattern, and heavy woody revegetation efforts, the vegetation should be
interacting with the stream for both shade and LWD recruitment.
The hydraulic complexity created through a more natural meandering pattern and the LWD
component would increase spawning habitat from less than 2 acres to nearly 3.5 acres (RDG et
al. 2013a) through the project area; juvenile-rearing habitat would be decreased from 2.45 acres
of low- to marginal-quality habitat to 1.94 acres of better quality rearing habitat (Table 3-2;
Figure 3-7). Off-channel alcoves and side channels would offer higher-quality rearing potential
than the margins of the current condition of Crooked River.
Juvenile-rearing habitat was modeled using parameters of depth less than 1 foot and velocity less
than 1 foot per second; Figure 3-7 shows that 1.94 acres would be developed (RDG et al. 2013a).
These numbers do not include side channels that are connected or the connection of the existing
ponds that would remain. The quality of rearing habitat would also be increased due to proper
substrate sorting, overhanging riparian vegetation, reduced instream temperatures, and improved
instream complexity from increases in large woody debris (Fraser and Cerri 1982, Bustard and
Narver 1975). Additionally, 2,700 feet of side channels and about 10 off-channel alcoves would

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

be constructed, both for the purpose of increasing beneficial juvenile rearing habitat and high
flow refugia (Figure 3-7).
Under Alternative 2, fish passage could be altered temporarily if extreme high flows (>Q10)
occurred while water is routed in the bypass channel. The temporary bypass channel was
modeled to design a stable channel capable of carrying a Q10 flow (1061 cfs) plus 1 foot of
freeboard (distance from the water surface to the top of the levee; RDG et al. 2013a). The
primary risks are lateral and vertical stability. The model results suggest that the presence of
large cobble and larger material (150–300 mm) would result in fairly stable conditions. Recent
observations of existing site conditions indicate that the 150–300mm material is common on site
and reinforcement would not be needed for the entire channel. In addition, the bypass channel
would flow through several existing ponds, which would serve as pools and areas of lower risk
of instability.
Because of lateral constraints posed by the Crooked River Road and the project area, the bypass
channel requires building up a berm along the west bank to prevent flow from entering the
project area. The berm height would vary up to 4 feet above the design floodplain elevation.
The proposed berm cross section would have a top width of 16 feet with side slopes of 2:1. The
berm would serve multiple purposes, including use as a haul road during construction and use as
a staging area for material that would eventually be used to fill the bypass channel after
floodplain and channel construction is complete.
The temporary bypass channel should provide fish passage for a range of flows. The range of
mid-channel velocities at a Q10 flow would be 1.6–11.3 feet per second (RDG et al. 2013a). The
average mid-channel flow velocity of a Q10 flow would be about 7 feet per second. Margin
velocities are much less (0.1-2.5 at Q10). The bypass channel would be constructed with fish
passage as a primary design criterion, mostly with large boulders as velocity breaks and grade
control (>340 mm, maximum mobile particle size at Q10; RDG et al. 2013a).
The existing ponds would provide areas of lower velocity and deeper water to facilitate
movement up and down the bypass channel. The bypass channel would be inspected following
large flows in order to assess channel changes that could affect fish passage and stability.

Temperature
Water temperature is a critical concern for cold water fish such as trout and salmon and is a
primary indicator of habitat conditions in north central Idaho. The South Fork Clearwater River
and Crooked River have a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for temperature that was
established in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDL (IDEQ et al.
2004). Reduction in streamside shading can result in increases in water temperature. The
TMDL and percent effective shade is discussed in the Water Quality section of the Water
Resources report. Changes in shading can be due to a variety of factors, including vegetative
succession (the replacement of one plant community with another over time), mortality, or
project activities.
Late-summer temperatures in lower Crooked River exceeded 20 degrees Celsius (ºC) for
numerous days when monitored in 2005, 2012, and 2013. The National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) developed a matrix of pathways
and indicators of watershed condition for Chinook, steelhead, and bull trout (NMFS and USFWS
1998). The document provides appropriate temperature conditions for ESA-listed species
adapted to the South Fork Clearwater River (Table 3-3). Temperatures in the Crooked River
Meanders project area are well above temperature ranges considered optimal for steelhead and
bull trout spawning, rearing, and migration (optimal temperatures shown below in Table 3-3).
Monitoring also showed temperatures much greater than 13ºC through September, during critical
times for Chinook spawning (13ºC is the upper optimum temperature limit for Chinook
spawning). Bull trout are known to use the Crooked River Meanders reach for migration,
juvenile rearing, and possibly overwinter habitat for the larger adults. However, the mean
summer temperatures are higher than the cold water requirements for spawning and rearing.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The elevated temperatures in Crooked River are due to the severely altered riparian condition
throughout the watershed from past activities (Appendix C). Within the project area, the stream
is over-widened with little riparian shade or cover in the stream. Due to the high hydraulic
conductivity through the dredge tailings in the valley, temperatures are slightly lower at the
downstream end; this is potentially an effect of groundwater influxes, side drainage inputs, and
most likely from the near-constant subsurface temperature. Diurnal fluctuations of 10 to 15ºC
were common instream, as 5 to 8ºC fluxes were recorded in the ponds in 2012.
Although the ponds have lower temperatures and less diurnal flux than instream, their potential
as rearing habitat for Chinook and steelhead is low due to access limited to only high flows. For
the most part, ponds are not connected on an annual basis. Except for a few ponds that are
connected year-round, fish could not escape if the temperatures were too warm or too cold; some
ponds appear to freeze solid, as some are not very deep. During the winter, there is high
likelihood that the conditions in the ponds, such as low dissolved oxygen due to vegetation decay
and ice, are not conducive to fish survivability. Very few ponds have fish. Ponds that do
support fish are usually connected at all or most flows.
Potential increases or decreases in stream temperature were analyzed by assessing the conditions
and the nature and extent of activities in riparian areas that may result in increased or decreased
solar radiation to streams and connected wetland areas.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, there would be no immediate changes to shade or other temperature-altering
processes in the project area. The lack of vegetation and minimal shading would continue to
impair stream temperatures in the project area. Dredge tailings would continue to restrict
riparian growth in the project area. Leaving the tailings in place would allow the large trees
currently growing among the piles to remain in place; however, these trees currently provide
little shade to the stream.
Solar radiation is the radiant energy emitted by the sun, of which a portion is available for energy
uptake on the earth in the form of light and heat. Solar pathfinder monitoring (instrument used to
measure the amount of solar radiation available to the ground) in 2012 yielded an average of
74.7% solar radiation available for the summer months (May through September; Table 3-4;
RDG et al. 2012). Readings in the heavily dredged areas with little to no vegetation increased up
to 93.2%. Reed canary grass comprised the largest area of survey and ranged from 63.2 to
90.4% solar radiation availability. Herbaceous plant communities recorded the highest
percentage of available solar radiation, and conifer-dominated communities recorded the lowest
available solar radiation readings. However, only 3% of greenline vegetation communities are
conifers. Under Alternative 1, conifers would continue to grow slowly in the nutrient-poor
cobble tailing piles. Due to their steep slopes, the dredge tailings typically do not support
conifers; therefore, trees are typically located a number of feet, both horizontally and vertically,
from the edge of the channel, which provides little shade to the channel. See Figure 3-8.

Temperature data collected in 2012 (August to November) and 2013 (June to October) suggest
groundwater influence and hillslope interception (RDG et al. 2013a). However, the stream
temperature is fairly warm. Figure 3-9 shows the stream temperatures throughout the Crooked
River watershed, from Orogrande to the mouth. As expected, the temperature gradient mostly
moves from coldest upstream to warmest downstream. However, a thermograph placed in the
middle of the Meanders project area showed a nearly constant temperature around 14°C. This is
most likely due to a groundwater upwelling microsite from either valley or hillslope hyporheic
(subsurface) flow.
Due to the extremely altered valley bottom, surface water and hyporheic flow are not as
connected as in an unaltered state. The 2013 temperature data suggest that there are points of
hyporheic expression within the stream channel through the project area; however, the valley
bottom ponds are most likely intercepting the majority of the subsurface flow. Under Alternative
1, the valley bottom would likely remain in the current condition for up to 5,000 years (Clear
Creek Hydrology and North Wind 2004); subsurface cool water would interact with the stream
on a minimal scale, as compared to the stream intercepting the majority of the subsurface flow.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, direct effects to water temperatures would be minimal. Reaches 2 and 3
have minimal shade availability currently so the increase in solar radiation would be negligible.
Reaches 1 and 4 would not be realigned; therefore, mature vegetation would remain along the
banks to continue to input shade to Crooked River. Figure 3-8 shows Reaches 2 and 3 in
July 2013. The lack of shade inputs can be seen as well as solar radiation potential in the ponds.
Long term, rehabilitation activities would be expected to slowly decrease temperatures through
the project area via groundwater interaction in the stream and increased shading from planting
overstory vegetation.
Temperature monitoring conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggests substantial subsurface flow
through the valley bottom. By grading the floodplain and decreasing areas where subsurface
water can come to the surface other than the stream channel, the subsurface flow should remain
cooler and influence the instream temperatures via exchange. Grading the floodplain and
creating a pathway for the hillslope water to enter the valley and Crooked River would increase
the likelihood of those cold water springs or seeps influencing the subsurface and surface water.
Figure 3-9 illustrates temperatures in Crooked River from June to October 2013. Temperatures
showed a warming trend from upstream to downstream, as is typical in most drainages.
However, the two anomalies were the gauges in the middle of the project area and at the IDFG
intake structure (the downstream extent of the project area). The gauge in the middle of the
project area tracked with the other temperatures until Crooked River reached base flow. Then, it
was a near-constant 14ºC with little diurnal fluctuation or response to rain events, suggesting that
the gauge was located where groundwater is expressed in Crooked River. Temperatures in a
pond surveyed in 2012 showed the same near-constant temperature through the warm months of
the summer, again suggesting influence by groundwater or hillslope water into the pond.

Subsurface water temperature data collected in July 2013 showed 2–4ºC difference between
subsurface water and surface water, with subsurface being cooler. Some of the subsurface
temperatures were taken less than 5 feet from the edge of surface water and showed up to 4ºC
difference. Grading the floodplain would potentially reestablish a more natural hyporheic/
surface water interaction. In only one of eight locations, the subsurface and surface water
differed by less than 0.5ºC, suggesting high exchange between surface and hyporheic water
(NPT unpublished data 2013).
The project area would be re-planted with 1- to 5-gallon alder, willow, dogwood, and spruce
along with understory species. These plants would have access to groundwater due to re-grading
the floodplain and there would be greater water holding capacity of the floodplain material due
to the addition of woodchips and soil material in the floodplain. This would provide greater
growth potential for these species. Vegetation planting would lead to shade over the stream
channel as well as other surface water areas like the remaining and created wetlands. Solar
radiation averaged at 75% throughout the project area. With increased vegetation growth and
connection with Crooked River, the solar radiation availability should decrease over time, which
could lead to decreases in stream temperature.
Under Alternative 2, instream water temperatures should decrease over time due to increased
shade and groundwater connectivity. Amount of temperature change is very difficult to predict;
however, Meadow Creek, a tributary to the South Fork Clearwater, had a 3ºC decrease over 10
years following extensive riparian planting on approximately 2 miles of streambank (NPT
unpublished data). These types of decreases would be expected over the long term in Crooked
River from the proposed project. Similar results would move the Habitat Condition Rating from
low to moderate for juvenile steelhead rearing and migration.

Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Species
Snake River Fall Chinook Salmon
Fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) are listed as Threatened under the
Endangered Species Act in the Clearwater River subbasin (Federal Register, Vol. 57, page
14653 [57 FR 14653]). The listed evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) includes all natural
populations of fall-run Chinook salmon in the mainstem Snake River and the following river
basins: Tucannon River, Grande Ronde River, Imnaha River, Salmon River, and Clearwater
River. Critical habitat for fall Chinook salmon has been designated in the Clearwater subbasin
and includes the mainstem Clearwater River from Greer, Idaho, downstream to its confluence
with the Snake River, including all river reaches currently and historically accessible. Fall
Chinook salmon spawn and rear in the mainstem Clearwater River, as well as the lower reaches
of the South Fork Clearwater River downstream of the project area.
Fall Chinook salmon have not been documented in Crooked River or in the South Fork
Clearwater River within 30 miles. Because of the distance of the project area to the nearest
occupied habitat, effects to spawning and rearing habitat for fall Chinook salmon are
not expected.

Snake River Steelhead Trout/Interior Redband Trout
Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) found in the Clearwater River and Salmon
River subbasins, including Crooked River, are part of the Snake River ESU currently listed as
threatened under the Endangered Species Act (62 FR 43937). Steelhead trout are an MIS in the
Nez Perce Forest Plan. Interior redband trout, which are the resident form of O. mykiss, are
designated as a Forest Service sensitive species in Region 1 but are not currently ESA-listed. In
Crooked River, the O. mykiss population is largely anadromous, but there may be a small
component that is resident, primarily at the headwaters of smaller tributaries upstream of the
project area. Additional effects to resident O. mykiss, other than what is discussed below for
anadromous steelhead, are therefore not expected.
The South Fork Clearwater River subbasin and all accessible tributaries were designated as
critical habitat for steelhead (70 FR 52630), including Crooked River from its mouth to the
headwaters. Steelhead trout use Crooked River for both spawning and rearing purposes and
maintain a naturally reproducing population, which has been supplemented with hatchery fish.
Steelhead supplementation by Idaho Department of Fish and Game in Crooked River occurred
up to 2010 in most years (http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/fish/stocking/).
Adult steelhead trout generally arrive at the mouth of the Clearwater River from September
through November, and migrate to tributary streams from January through May. Spawning
occurs from mid-March through early June, typically on a rising hydrograph and prior to peak
stream flows (Thurow 1987; Columbia River DART 2013). Fry emergence typically occurs
during June in the upper South Fork tributaries, and juveniles will rear for 2 or 3 years in
freshwater, typically out-migrating in the spring high flow (Mullan et al. 1992).
Crooked River was probably a historic stronghold for steelhead spawning and early rearing
(USDA Forest Service 1998). Habitat degradation, including changes in aquatic habitat related
to mining activity and road building, limit habitat potential for steelhead trout in lower Crooked
River. Historic dredge mining activities have substantially reduced habitat potential (relative to
historical conditions) in some areas of the watershed through changes in channel structure and
function and substrate availability and distribution. Threats to steelhead include predation,
competition, migration barriers, habitat degradation, and harvest (Ford 2011). Habitat
degradation is probably the most substantial limiting factor to steelhead trout within the Crooked
River watershed. Much of the accessible habitat area for steelhead has been altered by dredge
mining, resulting in a loss of summer and winter rearing habitat. Alteration of riparian
communities from mining and other disturbances resulted in less woody debris available to fall
into the stream, lost floodplain function, and altered hydrologic regimes.
Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) parr monitoring data from 1985 to 2003 suggest
variable mean densities across years, with a high of 12 fish/100 m2 in 2002 and a low of 0 fish
counted in 1987. Mean densities generally ranged between 5 fish/100 m2 and 1 fish/100 m2
(Kiefer and Lockhart 1997). Although these numbers are typical for many streams on the Nez

Perce National Forest, they are much less than densities observed in Gedney Creek, a tributary to
the Selway River, Idaho, (Byrne 1994) and other wilderness and roadless streams, where
densities are frequently 25 fish/m2 and higher (Nez Perce National Forest unpublished data).
In addition, examination of fry data (undifferentiated salmonid fry other than salmon) suggests a
highly variable but general decline in mean densities from the 1980s and early 1990s. Although
data are inconclusive, they do suggest variable but low levels of recruitment in naturally
produced steelhead (Kiefer and Lockhart 1997).
Redd count data are available for a limited number of years in the Crooked River watershed
(South Fork Clearwater TMDL, IDEQ et al. 2004). 1990 surveys resulted in the highest number
of redds counted (over 25), with 4 redds counted in 1991, 1 redd in 1992, and 2 redds in 1993,
1994, and 1995. It should be noted, however, that accurate counts of steelhead redds are difficult
to obtain because detection may be comprised during high water conditions; also many steelhead
spawn in smaller tributaries that are not routinely surveyed. Therefore, redd count data probably
do not provide an accurate census of all redds in the watershed.
Adult steelhead trapping data are also available from 1990 to 2000 (South Fork Clearwater
TMDL, IDEQ et. al 2004). Total number of returns each year reached about 50–55 adults from
1990 to 1993. Following 1993, number of returns precipitously declined to less than 15 from
1994 to 1999. In 2000, 17 were trapped. Seven adults were trapped in 2001, and 13 were
trapped in 2002 and 2003. It is possible that there are greater returns of adults to Crooked River
than indicated by these trapping data, if adults are migrating outside the trapping period. These
data do not correspond well with increased adult counts at Lower Granite Dam in 2001, 2002,
and 2003.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct or indirect effects to steelhead trout. The status quo
regarding habitat in the Meanders section would be maintained, however, with limited potential
for improvement over both the short and long term. Available information suggests that the
existing condition of the habitat has reduced the capability of the Meanders section to support
spawning and rearing habitat, as indicated by very low densities of observed juvenile steelhead
trout in this section compared to reaches upstream. Alternative 1 would be expected to maintain
this condition into the foreseeable future and not result in improvement or higher densities
of juveniles.
Alternative 2 would result in direct and indirect effects to steelhead trout. Direct effects would
occur during the project construction phase. Juvenile steelhead would likely be present when
Crooked River is de-watered and would therefore be subjected to disturbance, handling, and
potential mortality, although design criteria and salvage are expected to minimize mortality. In
addition, recent snorkel surveys suggest densities of juvenile steelhead are very low, and if this is
the case when the channel is de-watered, the number of fish affected is expected to be low
as well.

The same could happen when the bypass channel is decommissioned at the end of the channel
reconstruction phase. Individual fish immediately downstream of the bypass channel would also
be temporarily affected by short-term increases in suspended sediment when it is initially
watered, and then again when the new channel is watered following reconstruction and
decommissioning of the bypass channel. In addition, adult and juvenile steelhead are expected to
use the bypass channel for up- and down-stream migration for the duration of the channel
construction phase as it is designed to do, so fish passage would continue to occur.
Indirect effects to steelhead would generally include long-term improved habitat conditions tied
to the indicators previously discussed, such as cover, spawning and rearing areas, and potentially
lower temperatures. Carrying capacity for steelhead is expected to increase long term from
creation of high-quality pools and spawning habitat and improved stream temperatures during
the summer. More juvenile steelhead would be expected to be present in the project area, and
more adult steelhead would be expected to spawn, resulting in increased recruitment.
Although individual juvenile steelhead would be affected by the project in the short term during
implementation, effects to staging or spawning adult steelhead and redds are not expected
because of the timing of the de-watering events, lack of redds documented in the past 3 years,
and design measures intended to reduce or eliminate the potential to affect adults and/or
de-water redds.
Steelhead, as well as, spring/summer Chinook salmon and bull trout have the potential to be
vulnerable to climate change in the Colombia River Basin. Modeled responses to climate change
in the Columbia River Basin include a shift from a snow melt dominated system to a rain
dominated system, diminished snow packs in all but the highest elevations, increased peak
streamflow and increased stream temperature (ISAB 2007; ISAB 2011; Clark and Harris 2011).
Changes in timing of peak flow are also likely to occur (Croizer et al. 2008), with spring runoff
occurring earlier and summer base flows likely to be lower in the future. These hydrologic
changes can have significant impacts on salmonids. Increased peak flows can scour redds, and
change overall stream channel morphology (increased width to depth ratio). Changes in flow
timing can alter smolt outmigration and lower base flows can lead to increased energy
expenditure for migrating adults and reduce potential holding areas (Croizer et al. 2008).
Warmer stream temperatures encourage adult Chinook salmon to return to freshwater earlier and
warmer freshwater temperatures also delays spawning timing therefore adults are spending more
time in freshwater, which increase pre-spawning mortality (Croizer et al. 2008).
Indirect and beneficial effects of the proposed project include increasing habitat diversity,
restoring hydrologic and hydraulic processes towards a more natural state, and providing
resilience capacity within the system to future stressors. As stated by the Independent Scientific
Advisory Board (2011):

It is important to consider the diversity, spatial array, and connectivity of habitats
for conserving and restoring the diversity of movement patterns and life histories
in this age of climate change. The suitability of different habitats will change due
to increasing temperatures in both fresh water and the ocean (ISAB 2007), to
changes in the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling, to rising sea levels and to
increasing ocean acidity. This diversity is therefore a hedge against uncertainty
and climate change that threaten the resilience and productivity of many
populations.
The proposed project has several features that, when implemented, would serve to ameliorate the
adverse effects that climate change could have on fish and their habitat. Floodplain restoration
and riparian restoration have the obvious benefits of attenuating peak flows and providing stream
shading. Providing streambank capacity of water storage can allow for a slow release of water
during low summer base flows. Improving instream complexity by providing quality pools,
overhead cover (large woody debris), and sinuosity will provide more holding areas for adult
salmon prior to spawning and for juveniles during rearing. Improved sinuosity can also improve
hyporheic flow and groundwater interaction to reduce stream temperatures.
Under Alternative 2, ESA consultation with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on the
actions and potential effects would occur, a very detailed description of the direct and indirect
effects to steelhead trout would be included in a biological assessment, and NMFS would issue
an incidental take statement for direct effects to individual steelhead trout. This project is
consistent with habitat restoration goals outlined in the draft Snake River recovery plan for
salmon and steelhead (draft NMFS 2011).
Columbia River Bull Trout
Columbia River bull trout were listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act
in 1998 (Federal Register, Vol. 63, No. 31647). Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) are widely
distributed throughout the South Fork Clearwater River, including Crooked River. Bull trout
rear in headwater streams, and migrate to larger rivers or lakes at age two or three (Rieman and
McIntyre 1993). In fall, adult bull trout migrate to smaller streams to spawn. Habitat
requirements include complexity (large woody debris), deep pools, clean substrate, cold
temperatures below 15°C, and stable channels. Threats to bull trout include harvest of adults,
watershed disruption, introduced species (hybridization and competition with brook trout), and
isolation/fragmentation of populations (USDI-FWS 2002).
The South Fork Clearwater River and many of its tributaries, including Crooked River, are
designated critical habitat for bull trout (Federal Register, Vol. 75, No. 200). In Crooked River,
critical habitat is designated from its mouth to the headwaters of East and West Fork Crooked
River, as well as river reaches in the mainstem South Fork Clearwater downstream from
Crooked River potentially affected by the project. The draft recovery plan for Columbia River
bull trout identified a local population in Crooked River (USDI-FWS 2002). Available
information suggests West Fork Crooked River (upstream of the project area) is a primary

spawning and rearing area for fluvial bull trout in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin (USDA
Forest Service 1998, USDA Forest Service 1999b).
IDFG surveys in 1993 resulted in observations of 24 bull trout, or 0.89 bull trout/100 m2 (USDIFWS 2002). It is likely that densities are higher in West Fork Crooked River. A total of
34 migratory bull trout were collected at the Crooked River trap in 1997. In 1998, bull trout
captured at the weir were radio tagged and tracked over 25 miles as they migrated from the
middle reaches of mainstem South Fork Clearwater River. All data strongly support high use of
Crooked River by fluvial bull trout, perhaps the highest in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin.
Limited trend data exist for bull trout in Crooked River. These data are associated with capture
of adults at the Crooked River weir and juveniles in the screw trap. In the early 1990s, the
number of adult bull trout was very low, with 0 trapped in 1992 and 1994 and 2 in 1993. From
1994 to 2002, there appears to have been an increasing trend, with 15 trapped in 1995, 19 in
1996, 15 in 1997, 36 in 1998, and 19 in 2002. Increasing numbers are correlated with
implementation of statewide no-harvest regulations on bull trout, which began in 1992. In 2003,
however, only 2 adults were trapped.
Juvenile trapping data are variable but suggest a possible increasing trend (IDFG unpublished
data, 2004). These data are downstream migrant data from scoop and screw traps located near
the mouth of Crooked River. Data were as follows: 31 trapped in 1992, 2 in 1993, 13 in 1994,
33 in 1995, 3 in 1996 and 1997, 8 in 1998, 12 in 1999, 14 in 2000, 27 in 2002, and 52 in 2003.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct or indirect effects to bull trout. The status quo regarding
habitat in the Meanders section would be maintained, however, with limited potential for
improvement over both the short and long term. The existing condition of the habitat is probably
limiting the habitat available for adult and juvenile bull trout in the Meanders section. Although
most bull trout spawning occurs upstream in the East and West forks of Crooked River, the
Meanders section does function as a migratory corridor for adults and could provide optimal late
rearing habitat for juvenile bull trout, particularly if summer water temperatures were lower.
Under Alternative 1, improvement in habitat condition for bull trout would not occur into the
foreseeable future, and current conditions would be maintained.
Alternative 2 would result in direct and indirect effects to bull trout. Direct effects would occur
during the project construction phase. It is possible that adult and juvenile bull trout could be
present when Crooked River is de-watered and would therefore be subjected to disturbance,
handling, and potential mortality, although design criteria and salvage are expected to minimize
mortality. In addition, recent snorkel surveys suggest densities of bull trout are very low, and if
this is the case when the channel is de-watered, the number of fish affected is expected to be low.
Indirect effects to bull trout would generally include long-term improved habitat conditions tied
to the indicators previously discussed, particularly stream temperature. Improved pool quality
and increases in habitat complexity from addition of large woody debris would be expected to

create additional holding areas for migrating bull trout and rearing areas for juveniles. Higher
densities of fish overall would be expected to benefit bull trout as available forage would be
increased. Improvements in habitat conditions in this section of Crooked River would contribute
to the quality of habitat overall in this stronghold watershed and contribute to recovery efforts for
this species, particularly considering its importance in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin.
Under Alternative 2, ESA consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on the
actions and potential effects would occur, a very detailed description of the direct and indirect
effects to bull trout would be included in a biological assessment, and the USFWS would issue
an incidental take statement for direct effects to individual bull trout. This project is consistent
with habitat restoration goals outlined in the draft recovery plan for Columbia River bull trout
(draft USDI-FWS 2002).
Spring Chinook Salmon
Spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are not listed under the Endangered
Species Act in the Clearwater subasin but are included as a sensitive species in Region 1 of the
U.S. Forest Service. They are also identified as a species of special concern in the State of Idaho
and are an MIS in the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Spring Chinook salmon are present in the South
Fork Clearwater River and many of its tributaries. Indigenous Chinook salmon in the Clearwater
subbasin were eliminated by Lewiston Dam in 1927, which functioned as a block to Chinook
salmon migration until the early 1940s, but naturalized stocks exist in Crooked River and other
areas of the subbasin as a result of reintroduction efforts (Matthews and Waples 1991).
Idaho Department of Fish and Game operates a weir and trapping facility for spring Chinook
salmon near the mouth of Crooked River, downstream of the project area. Fish are moved to a
holding facility until spawning in August and September. Juvenile salmon are reared and
acclimated at a facility upstream from the project site and released into Crooked River the
following spring. Idaho Department of Fish and Game parr monitoring indicates variable
densities from the mid-1980s through 2003, with an overall decline from the late 1980s.
Numbers are somewhat stable from 2000 to 2003, with relative stability attributable in part to
hatchery supplementation. Redd count data and adult return data (taken at the collection weir
near the mouth) suggest an increased number of adult returns after 2000, which are correlated
with increased counts of spring Chinook at Lower Granite dam and likely reflect improved ocean
conditions, increased survival of both juveniles and adults at dams in the Columbia and Snake
rivers, and consistent hatchery supplementation supported by Idaho Department of Fish and
Game’s Crooked River’s rearing and propagation facility. In 2004, 654 adult Chinook salmon
were captured and counted at the Crooked River trap.
Adult Chinook salmon numbers returning to Crooked River range from around 350 fish to about
800 fish (IDFG 2010b, 2011, 2012). Of these, only about 30 fish are passed above the weir
because of the Idaho Supplementation Study, which is a hatchery program for spring Chinook
salmon, (IDFG 2010b, 2011, 2012); half of those were females or an undetermined sex.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Redd counts in the watershed ranged from 4 to 17 from 2007 to 2011, which corresponds to the
number of females and unknown sexes that were passed above the weir.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct or indirect effects to spring Chinook salmon and would
therefore not result in effects to the species viability. The status quo regarding habitat in the
Meanders section would be maintained, however, with limited potential for improvement over
both the short and long term. The existing condition of the habitat is probably adversely
affecting spring Chinook salmon in the Meanders section because of reduced spawning habitat,
low-quality spawning habitat, and high summer water temperatures.
Alternative 2 would result in direct and indirect effects to spring Chinook salmon. Direct effects
would occur during the project construction phase. Juvenile salmon would likely be present
when Crooked River is de-watered and would therefore be subjected to disturbance, handling,
and potential mortality, although design criteria and salvage are expected to minimize mortality.
The same could happen when the bypass channel is decommissioned at the end of the channel
reconstruction phase. Individual fish immediately downstream of the bypass channel would also
be temporarily affected by short-term increases in suspended sediment when it is initially
watered, and then again when the new channel is watered following reconstruction and
decommissioning of the bypass channel. In addition, adult and juvenile salmon are expected to
use the bypass channel for up- and down-stream migration for the duration of the channel
construction phase as it is designed to do, so fish passage would continue to occur.
Indirect effects to salmon would generally include long-term improved habitat conditions tied to
the indicators previously discussed, such as cover, spawning and rearing habitat, and potentially
decreased temperatures. Carrying capacity for salmon is expected to increase long term from
creation of high-quality pools and spawning habitat and improved stream temperatures during
the summer. More juvenile salmon would be expected to be present in the project area, and
more adult salmon would be expected to spawn.
Although individual juvenile salmon would be affected by the project for the short term during
implementation and limited mortality could occur, effects to staging or spawning adult salmon
and salmon redds are not expected because of the timing of the de-watering events, and lack of
redds documented in the past.
Effects to spring Chinook salmon populations in Crooked River and the upper South Fork
Clearwater River are not expected for the following reasons. First, implementation of design
criteria and fish salvage operations are expected to minimize direct mortality of any juvenile
salmon. Second, high numbers of juvenile salmon have not been observed in reaches proposed
for de-watering during snorkel surveys conducted in 2013; therefore, the potential to affect large
numbers of juveniles is low. Third, IDFG collection, propagation, and supplementation practices
in Crooked River provide a source of locally adapted smolts that are stocked in high numbers
annually in Crooked River; fourth, connectivity to other source populations of spring Chinook

salmon in the upper South Fork Clearwater is high; and fifth, the project is expected to result in
long-term improvements to Chinook populations and a reduction in extinction risk, due to
improved spawning and rearing habitat.
Westslope Cutthroat Trout
Westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) are included as a sensitive species in
Region 1 of the U.S. Forest Service and are designated as a species of special concern by the
State of Idaho. Westslope cutthroat trout are also identified as an MIS in the Nez Perce
Forest Plan.
Currently, this subspecies is not listed or proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act.
Westslope cutthroat trout are distributed widely in the Crooked River watershed and have been
found in virtually every tributary where surveys have been conducted.
Although population status of resident westslope cutthroat trout is thought to be strong in some
streams, particularly in West Fork and East Fork Crooked rivers, larger adult fluvial fish that
migrate between Crooked River and the South Fork Clearwater River appear to be less abundant.
Recent establishment of restrictive harvest regulations by Idaho Department of Fish and Game in
both the South Fork Clearwater River and Crooked River appears to be resulting in increased
abundance of larger fish (J. DuPont, IDFG, personal communication).
IDFG parr monitoring data show no definitive trend in westslope cutthroat trout densities. Mean
densities appear to be less than other tributaries in the South Fork Clearwater, including
Newsome Creek and Red River. Highs of 1.8 and 1.6 fish/100 m2 were documented in 1989 and
2001, respectively; mean densities ranged between 0 and 0.6 fish/100 m2 in all other years where
data are available (1985–2003). It should be noted, however, that monitoring sites are not
located in the areas of the watershed with the highest known cutthroat densities, such as West
and East Fork Crooked rivers. Monitoring sites are limited to mainstem areas (Kiefer and
Lockhart 1997).
Limited density data are also available from the Nez Perce National Forest database, but these
data were taken in largely the same areas as IDFG parr monitoring data and indicate similar
mean densities. Although it is generally understood where the population strongholds exist,
density data are not available.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct or indirect effects to westslope cutthroat trout and would
therefore not result in effects to the species population. The status quo regarding habitat in the
Meanders section would be maintained, however, with limited potential for improvement over
both the short and long term. The existing condition of the habitat is probably adversely
affecting the numbers of cutthroat trout that could use this area, both as a migratory corridor and
for spawning and rearing.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-34

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 would result in direct and indirect effects to individual westslope cutthroat trout,
assuming that they were present during implementation of the project. Direct effects would
occur during the project construction phase. Individual cutthroat trout could be present when
Crooked River is de-watered and would therefore be subjected to disturbance, handling, and
potential mortality, although design criteria and salvage are expected to minimize mortality. The
same could happen when the bypass channel is decommissioned at the end of the channel
reconstruction phase. Individual fish immediately downstream of the bypass channel would also
be temporarily affected by short-term increases in suspended sediment when it is initially
watered, and then again when the new channel is watered following reconstruction and
decommissioning of the bypass channel. Migrating cutthroat trout would be expected to use the
bypass channel for the duration of the channel construction phase as it is designed to do, so fish
passage would continue to occur.
Indirect effects to cutthroat trout would generally include long-term improved habitat conditions
tied to the indicators previously discussed, such as cover, spawning and rearing habitat and
potentially decreased temperatures. Carrying capacity for cutthroat trout is expected to increase
long term from creation of high-quality pools and spawning habitat and improved stream
temperatures during the summer. More adult fluvial cutthroat trout would be expected to be
present in the project area, especially during the summer.
Effects to westslope cutthroat trout populations in Crooked River are not expected because the
primary areas in which cutthroat currently spawn and rear are well upstream of the project area
and would not be affected. In addition, Crooked River is well connected to other tributaries in
the South Fork Clearwater subbasin. High connectivity combined with increasing numbers of
migratory cutthroat trout, which may be occurring as a result of restrictive harvest regulations in
the South Fork Clearwater River, are expected to result in increased cutthroat trout in upper
South Fork Clearwater tributaries, including Crooked River. Long-term improvement in the
Meanders sections would be expected to contribute to such increases.
Pacific Lamprey
Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) is designated a USDA Forest Service sensitive species
and a State of Idaho endangered species. Pacific lamprey are a keystone species for the Nez
Perce Tribe culture, being used for subsistence, ceremonial, and medicinal purposes.
Pacific lamprey is one of the oldest of all vertebrates (Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish
Commission 2013). Lamprey juveniles (called ammocoetes) burrow in mud and sand in
freshwater habitats where they undergo metamorphosis over 5 to 7 years into adults. Adult
lamprey migrate to the ocean where they spend 1 to 2 years before returning to freshwater to
spawn. These species are an important component of the ecosystem, serving as a prey base and a
source of marine-derived nutrients in freshwater habitats (NPT 2013a).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-35

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Similar to other anadromous fishes, the distribution and abundance of Pacific lamprey has been
reduced by the construction of dams and water diversions as well as degradation of spawning
and rearing habitat. Lamprey are excluded from large areas where they were historically present,
including upstream from Hells Canyon Dam on the Snake River and Chief Joseph Dam on the
Columbia River (USDA Forest Service 1998).
Sampling in the South Fork Clearwater River conducted in the early 2000s indicated the
presence of juvenile lampreys in the South Fork Clearwater River and lower reaches of Red
River (Cochnauer and Clair 2003). Similar sampling conducted in Crooked River in 2001 did
not identify any lampreys (Cochnauer and Clair 2001, 2002). The lower reaches of Crooked
River were likely historic habitat for lamprey (NPCC 2005).
Although long-term trend data have not been collected, all available data regarding presence/
absence in the South Fork Clearwater River and trends of returning adult lamprey to Snake River
and Columbia River mainstem dams indicate that the population is severely depressed and has
declined substantially from historic levels. Habitat degradation in the Columbia River and Snake
River basins associated with mining, livestock grazing, stream channelization, logging, road
construction, and urbanization, in combination with hydroelectric impacts, are implicated as the
major factors contributing to the declines of Pacific lamprey (Cochnauer and Claire 2003;
Close et al. 1995; Jackson et al. 1996; Jackson et al. 1997). Hydroelectric dam upstream passage
ladders are difficult structures for adult lamprey upstream migrants to navigate.
The Nez Perce Tribe is actively restoring Pacific lamprey population in the Upper South Fork
Clearwater River. Lampreys have been released in Newsome Creek and Red River (E. Crow,
personal communication, 2012); however, no lampreys have been released into Crooked River
to date.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct or indirect effects to Pacific lamprey and would therefore
not result in effects to the species population in Crooked River or the South Fork Clearwater
River.
Alternative 2 would result in direct effects to lampreys if they were present. Previous surveys
suggest lampreys are not present in Crooked River, although suitable habitat is present.
Additional surveys would be conducted prior to implementation of this alternative to confirm
absence. If lampreys are found, best management practices to reduce the effects of instream
projects would be implemented (USDI-FWS 2010). Effects to lamprey populations are therefore
not expected.
Western Pearlshell Mussel
Western pearlshell mussels (Margaritifera falcata) are designated a sensitive species in Region 1
of the U.S. Forest Service. This species lives in cold streams and prefers stable sand and gravel
substrates. Large boulders are an important habitat feature, stabilizing the habitat type. Mussels
are sedentary in their adult stage and are reliant on salmonid hosts during the parasitic larval

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

portion of their life cycle. Individuals can live many years, leading to populations existing for
many years without successful reproduction occurring (Montana Field Guide 2013). Although
mostly sedentary, adult mussels are capable of making short movements, and if disturbed can
burrow back into substrates.
Western pearlshell mussels are known to be present in Crooked River, including the Meanders
section, and the South Fork Clearwater River near the mouth of Crooked River. A robust
population is present in American River, and mussels are present in Red River. Trends on
populations are not known, but available information suggests mussels are widely distributed in
the South Fork Clearwater River and in American River and Red River.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct or indirect effects to Western pearlshell mussel and
would therefore not result in effects to the species population.
Alternative 2 would result in direct effects to mussels where they are present within the
Meanders section of Crooked River, and where de-watering and reconstruction are proposed.
Design criteria specify removal of any stranded mussels and placement upstream when dewatering occurs. Although effects to individuals would occur, only a short section of stream
would be de-watered (relative to the entire occupied area), any stranded individuals would be
moved to watered areas, and mussels would continue to be present up and downstream from the
affected area so only a small portion of the entire population in Crooked River would be
affected. In addition, robust colonies located nearby in the South Fork Clearwater River could
serve as source populations if repopulation was necessary. Long-term improvement in habitat
conditions would benefit mussels as well as fish.
Table 3-6 summarizes information regarding these species and provides preliminary
determinations of effect for Alternative 2. The effects analysis and determination rationale
would be described in a Biological Assessment/Biological Evaluation under this alternative.

Cumulative Effects
Geographic Boundary: For aquatic resources, the cumulative effects analysis area includes the
entire project area, as well as the South Fork Clearwater River from the mouth of Crooked River,
downstream to the Forest Service boundary at Mount Idaho Grade bridge.
Time frame: These effects are considered for the aquatic species potentially affected by this
project from 2015 through the proposed and reasonably foreseeable future (approximately 10-20
years).
Past actions: The primary management activities that have influenced aquatic habitat in the
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation area include past timber harvest and supporting road
construction, instream and floodplain restoration, recreation, wildfires, and mining. Of these
activities, mining has been extensive in the past and have resulted in highly altered aquatic
conditions. Ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed activity areas consist of
recreation, road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration,
and weed treatments. Refer to Appendix C for a complete list and details of past, present, and
foreseeable future actions. The two specific reasonably foreseeable actions are the Orogrande
Community Protection project and the Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. Both
projects are upstream and adjacent to the proposed action.
Crooked River

Discussion of cumulative effects for fisheries is addressed through the general trend of the
suitable habitat required by these species as a result of past, present, and future management
actions. The changes in condition and abundance of specific habitats important to these species
are largely unknown, but can be inferred through stream reaches in the Upper South Fork
Clearwater River that have incurred much less impact than Crooked River. Therefore, the effects

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

of these past projects can be qualified only through general discussions. However, the results of
past projects contribute to the current condition, which can be used to discuss and quantify
effects of proposed activities on fisheries.
Alternative 1 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, additional effects to fisheries or their habitat would not occur in
the project area, as compared to past activities. No cumulative effects on fisheries or their
habitats would occur because there are no direct or indirect effects from the No Action
alternative. The effects of the past activities and extreme valley and stream conditions would
continue, including altered hydrologic regime and function, directly affecting fish habitat and
productivity in the project area. Alternative 1, while presenting no short-term risks, would not
result in significant long-term improvement in watershed condition or the indicators analyzed
above. Pools, habitat, and woody debris would all improve slowly, but would take many years.
Under Alternative 1 there would likely be very slow vegetation growth and due to the valley
condition, shade inputs would probably not increase substantially so there would likely be a
long-term impact on temperature. Alternative 1 could cause slow changes but would take
many years.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Alternative 2 would have cumulative effects with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
activities in Crooked River. Past actions include timber harvest, mining, recreation, fire and road
building. The most extensive and lasting of these was mining. The entire valley, from the South
Fork Clearwater River to Orogrande, and even in the uplands and up the tributaries, shows signs
of varying degrees of mining. Fire has also had a strong impact on the Crooked River watershed.
Since 1996, nearly 10,000 acres have burned in the watershed. Most are in the upper portions of
the East and West forks, which are nearly roadless areas.
Sediment inputs of the Meanders project, sediment inputs and alleviations of the proposed
Crooked River Narrows Road project, along with harvest, thinning, burning, and road building in
the Orogrande Community Protection project, would be increased during parts of
implementation. The sediment inputs of the Meanders actions would be at discrete times, as
permitted by regulatory agencies. The predicted Orogrande Community Protection project
sediment inputs could overlap with the implementation of this project. However, though the
projects would overlap in time, there would be very little direct overlap in space. The proposed
Crooked River Narrows Road Project would yield a long term decrease in the sediment inputs
upstream of the Meanders; the project would occur after the completion and upstream of the
Meanders. The Meanders would improve sediment transport processes to deposit sediment in
the most natural, beneficial locations in the stream system (i.e., inside of stream bends). The
short-term impacts of sediment should be outweighed by the long-term benefits of more
naturally functioning instream and floodplain processes. Impacts are expected to decrease, and
condition is expected to improve in the ensuing years, resulting in a habitat condition that is

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-39

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

improved compared to the current condition. Alternative 2, while presenting a moderately high
short-term increased risk of sediment inputs, would have a long-term benefit of proper sediment
transport processes and long-term improvement in watershed condition.
Stream temperature is also an indicator at high risk of cumulative impacts, given the stream’s
existing condition. Alternative 2 would reduce temperature in the long term through increased
floodplain function, groundwater connection, and increased riparian and instream cover.
Pools, habitat, and woody debris would all improve throughout the project area under
Alternative 2. There are many miles of stream throughout the watershed that have drastically
reduced habitat features from legacy mining impacts; by improving the lowest 2 miles of valley
bottom, fisheries habitat should increase exponentially locally and could beneficially impact
upstream species with a more connected system to the South Fork Clearwater River.
South Fork Clearwater River

Substantial physical changes to aquatic resources in the Crooked River and South Fork
Clearwater River have occurred since the initiation of human disturbances in the 19th century.
Specific activities included mainstem dams, in-channel mining in the mainstem rivers and
tributaries, timber harvest throughout the subbasin, road construction and encroachment on
streams, domestic livestock grazing, home construction and private land development,
agriculture and cultivation, fire suppression, and many other activities. Water quality and habitat
in the South Fork Clearwater River is in a degraded condition, both from sediment and
temperature impacts (USDA Forest Service 1998; USDA Forest Service 1999b).
As described in this section, dredge mining and hydraulic mining caused significant erosion in
the tributaries, and accelerated sediment deposition in the mainstem river.
Fish passage in the South Fork Clearwater River has been impacted by mainstem dams since the
early days of settlement. The first dam reported in the South Fork Clearwater River was the
Dewey Mine Dam, which was in place by about 1895. This dam was reported to be 6 to 8 feet
high and located about 3.3 miles above the Harpster Bridge. The dam was in place for a few
years with no documentation of fish passage conditions. Lower in the South Fork, near the town
of Kooskia, was the site of the Kooskia Flower Mill Dam. This dam was in place from 1910 into
the 1930s. The dam was estimated to be about 6 feet high. The Washington Water Power Dam
was reportedly built in 1911 (Siddall 1992). This dam was a total barrier to fish migration; a fish
ladder was constructed in 1935 but was washed out in 1949. This dam was reported to be 33 or
56 feet high, depending on the source. It was removed on August 3, 1963. The existing salmon
and steelhead populations are a result of fish stocking, likely supplemented by straying adults
from the Clearwater River.
Current land uses occurring on private lands include livestock grazing, timber harvest,
agriculture, residence construction, road construction, sewage treatment, and water withdrawals
for domestic use and irrigation. Increases in general land uses would likely occur in the next
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

decade. Additional information on private land activities is found in the South Fork Clearwater
River Biological Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1999b).
Given all the above information, the South Fork Clearwater River is at high risk for cumulative
impacts, especially from additional sediment and increased water temperature. The Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project is designed to improve overall fish habitat by reducing nonpoint sediment sources and improving instream fish habitat. Sediment increases from instream
restoration and road improvement activities would, however, increase sediment in the short term.
In general, the level of activity on federal lands is currently substantially less than in recent
decades, and many federal actions contain watershed improvements as part of the projects
(USDA-FS 2005a, 2006, 2013c). Proposed mining activities may contribute to the conditions in
the subbasin, but mitigation for these projects is expected to reduce some of these impacts.
Proposed timber sales on National Forest lands are subject to similar mitigation and upward
trend requirements (USDA-FS 1987a) as the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, and
although spikes of sediment may occur, in general stream habitat is expected to improve at
least locally.
The South Fork Clearwater River TMDL for sediment and water temperature would govern
activities on state and private lands as well as federal lands (IDEQ et al. 2004). Under this
guidance, aquatic conditions should continue to improve in the South Fork Clearwater River.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The following design and mitigation measures are to be implemented for the action alternative.
The measures are specified in full in Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures.
Sediment/Turbidity
The following design and mitigation measures related to sediment and turbidity would be
implemented for Alternative 2: #1, 6–10, 13, 16–19, 46–49, and 52.
Aspects of the proposed project that have the potential to elevate turbidity and increase sediment
include: construction of temporary bypass channel and road; clearing of vegetation; preparing
staging areas; watering the temporary bypass channel; and re-watering the stream. Floodplain
grading activities and new channel construction would increase sediment production; however,
sediment basins would be constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle out
sediment. Design and mitigation measures, such as installing sediment barriers (#8) and
mulching/stabilizing side slopes (#19), would reduce the overall amount of sediment that reaches
live water, but would not prevent all sediment from reaching the stream.
Sediment effects of fish are dictated by timing, duration, intensity, and frequency of exposure
(Bash et al. 2001). The extent of the effect is higher when turbidity is increased and particle size
is decreased (Bisson and Bilby 1982). Protective mucus levels of individual fish are lower
during periods when instream sediment backgrounds are lower (i.e., low flow work window),

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-41

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

which may increase turbidity effects on fish during this period (Bash et al. 2001). Watering the
temporary bypass channel and re-watering the newly constructed channel are the activities that
would increase turbidity the most. The project area is primarily composed of larger cobble since
most of the fine sediment was washed out during the dredging activities, which would reduce the
overall amount of sediment produced during construction activities. Timing of watering the
temporary bypass channel would be coordinated with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team (ESA
Section 7 Consultation Team) and other agencies to reduce the impacts on ESA-listed fish (#45).
The temporary bypass channel may be watered during high flows (April–May) when turbidity
background levels are naturally higher to reduce the impacts on fish. Re-watering the newly
constructed channel would likely occur during low flow. However, since fine sediment is
already lacking in the project area, the amount that is mobilized during the re-watering process
would be reduced.
Providing a temporary bypass channel and constructing a road that separates the bulk of the
construction area from the temporary channel would reduce the amount of sediment from
entering live water (#45, #46, #52 [RDG et al. 2013a]). As a part of the design, temporary ponds
would be constructed to capture sediment across the work area to prevent any from reaching the
bypass channel or the South Fork Clearwater River. Turbid water may be pumped to the
floodplain or settling ponds to keep areas dry during construction to reduce sediment inputs to
Crooked River and South Fork Clearwater River.
Design and mitigation measure #16 includes monitoring to be conducted as directed by the
USACE, EPA, NMFS, and USFWS, and adaptive management would be applied if turbidity
reaches 50 NTUs over background during low flow. The Idaho standard for turbidity is 50 NTU
instantaneous measurement over background, which is considered protective of cold water
aquatic life.
Petroleum-Based Products
The following design and mitigation measures related to petroleum-based products would be
implemented for Alternative 2: #2, 3, 4, and 5.
Fish have the potential to be affected by chemical contamination from the proposed project
activities. Heavy equipment would be used in most aspects of the project activities (floodplain
re-grading, new channel construction, LWD placement). Machinery would likely be working in
live water due to the high water table of the valley, even though the stream would be diverted
into a temporary bypass channel. Washing and maintaining all equipment would reduce the
amount of petroleum-based products entering the water from day-to-day operations. Staging
areas for machinery, fuels storage, and maintenance work would occur off site and far enough
away from live water that fish would not likely be exposed to petroleum products in the case of a
spill (#3, #5). Since much of the project area is composed of porous cobble, any spills would
percolate to the groundwater quickly. Storing petroleum products in containment structures with

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-42

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

impervious liners would prevent much of the chemical from entering the water, and having spill
containment kits and a spill containment plan on site would allow for a quick response to reduce
the amount of chemicals leaching into the groundwater (#4).
Toxics
The following design and mitigation measures related to toxins would be implemented for
Alternative 2: #15 and 20.
Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the environment that has several forms. Metallic
mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid. Metallic mercury (inorganic mercury and its
compounds) enters the air from mining and manufacturing activities and from burning coal and
waste. It has also been added to the environment from historic gold mining activities. Although
mercury was not used in dredge mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a small
potential to find this element during restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies, including
the Crooked River Stream Survey and In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water Quality
Status Report 80: Crooked River (Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ 1988), and
Idaho Champion Group Lode and Pacific Group Load Claims: Preliminary Assessment and Site
Inspection Report (IDEQ 2011), have all shown that concentrations of heavy metals in both soil
and water are generally equivalent to background levels or below detection limits.
Because of its color, mercury would be visible to contractors, Forest Service, and Nez Perce
Tribe personnel on site during construction. Any mercury that is found would be removed from
the site following methods outlined in Appendix E. This would reduce the potential for
bioaccumulation of mercury in aquatic species in Crooked River and the South Fork
Clearwater River.
Temporary Bypass Channel
The following design and mitigation measures related to the temporary bypass channel would be
implemented for Alternative 2: #45, 48, and 52.
The temporary bypass channel would be constructed prior to any instream or floodplain
activities. The bypass channel would be constructed to accommodate a 10-year flow recurrence
and would remain in operation until the floodplain and new channel are complete. Cofferdams
and/or a head gate would be constructed on the main channel to control the flow to the bypass
channel. This would allow for increasing the flow in both the bypass channel and newly
constructed channel to reduce the amount of sediment mobilized during re-watering. The bypass
channel would allow for migration of all fish species during their migratory periods. The
temporary bypass channel would not likely provide suitable spawning habitats for steelhead,
spring/summer Chinook salmon, or bull trout due to limited spawning sized gravels. However,
primary spawning sites for spring/summer Chinook salmon are upstream of where the bypass
channel would be constructed. Bull trout have not been found to spawn in the lower Crooked

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

River, and the current channel conditions of low velocity and high cobble embeddedness limit
steelhead spawning in the project area.
The temporary channel would be watered during high flows if possible. This would allow
sediment produced to be flushed out during periods when natural sediment background is already
high and there is enough water so as not to dewater the existing channel. The bypass channel
would not be fully used until the low-flow work window of July 1 or as specified in consultation
with NMFS or USFWS.
Fish and Aquatic Organism Salvage
The following design and mitigation measures related to fish and aquatic organism salvage
would be implemented for Alternative 2: #11 and 45.
Fish salvage would occur in the mainstem Crooked River and connected ponds after July 1 or as
consulted on by NMFS and USFWS. Juvenile steelhead, spring/summer Chinook, westslope
cutthroat trout, and other aquatic species would likely be present. Mainstem fish salvage would
include a combination of dewatering, netting, and electrofishing. Methods for salvaging the
ponds would include blocknetting, electrofishing, staged dewatering, and seining.
Dewatering/Seining/Netting. Cofferdams and/or a head gate would be constructed on the
mainstem channel. Water would slowly be released into the temporary bypass channel to reduce
flows in the mainstem channel. This would allow fish to move downstream and out of the
project area. Seining and netting would be used in combination with dewatering to “encourage”
fish to move downstream and out of the project area in the main channel and ponds that are
connected to the channel.
Electrofishing. It is uncertain how many electrofishing passes would be needed to
remove fish from the mainstem channel and ponds. Since the channel and ponds would be
slowly dewatered, the amount of area needed to be electrofished would be reduced. It is not
likely that the in-channel pools or the ponds would completely dry up due to the high elevation
of the water table across the valley. It is possible that many of the fish could be chased into these
pools during dewatering and only the pools and ponds would require electrofishing.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with forestwide standards for fisheries resources in the Nez Perce
National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-18 through II-20). Full details of
consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Cooperative efforts would occur among Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, BLM, Nez
Perce Tribe, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to monitor

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

population levels of all MISs. Government-to-Government consultation has occurred to
recognize fishing and hunting rights guaranteed to the Nez Perce Tribe. The Forest Service and
Idaho Department of Fish and Game would continue to coordinate to achieve mutual goals for
fish and wildlife.
Alternative 2 would restore degraded fish habitat, but Alternative 1 would not. Alternative 2
would move the conditions within Crooked River toward meeting established fishery/water
quality objectives in Crooked River, which is currently not meeting objectives.
With respect to Management Area 10 (Riparian Areas), short-term decreases in streamside
canopy would occur under Alternative 2, but thousands of plants would be planted to increase
streamside canopy. Alternative 2 would implement riparian improvements, including connecting
vegetation to groundwater and floodplain processes and planting native grasses, forbs, shrubs,
and trees. Alternative 2 would implement habitat improvements in all drainages presently below
stated objectives.
Nez Perce Forest Plan, Amendment 20 (PACFISH)

The PACFISH decision amended the Nez Perce Forest Plan in 1995 and was incorporated into
the Forest Plan as Amendment 20 (PACFISH; USDA Forest Service 1995b). PACFISH
establishes riparian goals and riparian management objectives (RMOs) and defines riparian
habitat conservation areas. It includes specific direction for land management activities within
riparian areas adjacent to streams, lakes, wetlands, and landslide-prone terrain. Riparian goals
establish an expectation of the characteristics of healthy, functioning watersheds, riparian areas,
and fish habitat. The goals direct the Nez Perce National Forest to maintain or improve habitat
elements such as water quality, stream channel integrity, instream flows, and riparian vegetation.
Standards and guidelines specific to watershed and habitat restoration include the following:
•

•

WR-1: Design and implement watershed restoration projects in a manner that promotes
the long term ecological integrity of ecosystems, conserves the genetic integrity of native
species, and contributes to attainment of Riparian Management Objectives.
WR-3: Do not use planned restoration as a substitute for preventing habitat degradation
(i.e., use planned restoration only to mitigate existing problems, not to mitigate the
effects of proposed activities).

Alternative 2 would be consistent with these standards and guidelines. The objective of this
alternative is to restore the ecological and watershed integrity of the Meanders sections of
Crooked River and would contribute to attainment of RMOs, which are currently not being met.
Planned restoration under Alternative 2 is not proposed to mitigate the effects of other activities
in the watershed.

Endangered Species Act and Biological Opinions
The Endangered Species Act requires the listing of species that are threatened or endangered
with extinction, federal agency consultation on activities affecting these species, and the
development of recovery plans. These missions are the responsibility of NMFS for anadromous
fish species and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for resident fish species and terrestrial
wildlife. The ESA-listed aquatic species found in Crooked River are steelhead trout and
bull trout.
Under Alternative 2, the Forest Service and Nez Perce Tribe would submit a biological
assessment documenting the project effects on listed species to the regulatory agencies, and
formal consultation would be concluded prior to a record of decision being signed.
The USFWS and NMFS have developed draft recovery plans for ESA-listed fish in the project
area. The USFWS identified the South Fork Clearwater as a core area for bull trout recovery and
Crooked River as supporting a local population (draft USDI-FWS 2002). Historic dredge mining
was identified as a principal factor degrading bull trout habitat in Crooked River, with ongoing
legacy effects. Although previous restoration efforts were acknowledged, it was noted that they
did not fully restore the stream channel.
Actions identified to meet recovery goals for bull trout included identification of problem mine
sites and remediation of tailings, ponds, and other associated waste. Within the South Fork
Clearwater core area, Newsome Creek and Crooked River were identified as the top priorities.
Therefore, Alternative 2 is consistent with recovery goals identified in this draft plan.
In the draft Snake River Steelhead Recovery Plan for the Clearwater subbasin the South Fork
Clearwater steelhead population was described as “intermediate” based on size and historic
habitat potential (draft NMFS 2011). Crooked River was identified as a major spawning area.
The draft plan emphasized the importance of riparian habitat restoration in American River, Red

River, Newsome Creek, and Crooked River, citing the loss of riparian vegetation, which has
reduced recruitment of large woody debris to stream channels and reduced habitat complexity.
It also cited channel modification and simplification, most commonly resulting from historic
dredging mining, which has affected both rearing and spawning habitat.
Priority areas identified for restoration in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin were primarily
associated with major spawning areas, which included lower Crooked River in the Meanders
section. Direction to meet recovery goals specifically included the following: “Restore stream
channels and floodplain function in reaches impacted by historic dredge mining and other land
uses in the Newsome, Crooked, American, and Red River watersheds. Many of these stream
reaches have straightened channels, infrequent pools, inadequate pool depth, inadequate riparian
vegetation, and reduced habitat complexity, including lack of cover. Projects may include
restoring natural floodplain meander patterns by reconnecting historic meanders or
reconstructing stream channels.”
Since Alternative 2 proposes these types of activities, it is consistent with the recovery goals
identified in this draft plan.
Magnuson–Stevens Act
Pursuant to Section 305(b) of the Magnuson–Stevens Act and its implementing regulations
(50 CFR 600.920), federal agencies must consult with NMFS regarding any of their actions that
are authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or undertaken that
may adversely affect essential fish habitat. The Magnuson–Stevens Act, Section 3, defines
essential fish habitat as “those waters and substrate necessary for fish for spawning, breeding,
feeding, or growth to maturity.”
Federal agencies may incorporate an assessment of essential fish habitat into biological
assessments required by the Endangered Species Act. The following designation for essential
fish habitat occurs in the project area:
•

Essential fish habitat for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha). Essential fish
habitat for Chinook salmon includes all historically accessible reaches of the Clearwater
River subbasin (except the North Fork above Dworshak Dam). Essential fish habitat for
Chinook salmon is present in Crooked River.

Clean Water Act and Idaho Water Quality Standards
The Clean Water Act stipulates that states are to adopt water quality standards. Included in these
standards are provisions for identifying beneficial uses, establishing the status of beneficial uses,
setting water quality criteria, and establishing best management practices to control nonpoint
sources of pollution.
Designated beneficial uses have been established for Crooked River and South Fork Clearwater
River up and downstream of the mouth of Crooked River (IDAPA 58.01.02, IDEQ 2013). These
beneficial uses include coldwater biota, salmonid spawning, secondary contact recreation in
Crooked River, and primary contact recreation in South Fork Clearwater River.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Water Resources
Scope of Analysis
The purpose of the proposed Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project is to improve fisheries
habitat degraded from historical dredge mining by restoring stream and floodplain functions.
The project area is located in the Crooked River watershed within the Red River Ranger District
of the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests in north-central Idaho, approximately 5 air miles
southwest of Elk City, Idaho.
The proposed action would rehabilitate the lower 2 miles of Crooked River valley by re-grading
115 acres of the floodplain and by reconstructing 7,400 feet of new stream channel (see
Figure 2-1 and Appendix A). The resources of concern that could potentially be affected by the
proposed action are water quality, geomorphology, wetlands, and floodplains. The effects on
water yield (the quantity of precipitation after plant use that is available as surface and
subusurface flow) would be minimal given that the floodplain to be re-graded has extensive
tailings piles and is not densely vegetated; therefore, water yield is not a resource of concern.
Project Area
The project area is located in the Lower Crooked River 6th Hydrologic Unit Code (6th Code
HUC) Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) prescription watershed as defined in the
Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a), which is within the Crooked River watershed and a
tributary to the South Fork Clearwater River. The project boundary is the Crooked River valley
from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth to approximately 2 miles upstream from the mouth to
where the valley constricts and narrows. The area for direct and indirect effects on water quality,
geomorphology, wetlands, and floodplains is the project boundary.
Cumulative Effects Area
The area for cumulative effects includes the Crooked River watershed and the South Fork
Clearwater River to its confluence with the Middle Fork Clearwater River near Kooskia, Idaho.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
This section describes the indicators used in the analysis to evaluate the effects of the proposed
action on the water resources of concern, the analysis methods used, and the data and
information used for the analysis.

Project-specific road feature data collected by Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests.

The resources of concern that could potentially be affected by the proposed action are water
quality, geomorphology, groundwater–surface water interactions, wetlands, and floodplains.
Groundwater–surface water interactions in the project area are highly variable with much
uncertainty, and the disturbed nature of the site makes it difficult to determine whether the reach
of Crooked River within the project area is gaining or losing reach groundwater, and how much
flow is traveling subsurface through coarse valley bottom substrates (RDG et al. 2012). For
these reasons, effects on groundwater–surface water interactions could not be evaluated.
The effects on water yield would be minimal since the floodplain that would be re-graded has
extensive tailings piles that are sparsely vegetated; therefore, effects on water yield in response
to the clearing of vegetation is not a resource of concern.
Water Quality
The indicator used to evaluate potential effects on water quality is water temperature. For this
analysis, a surrogate indicator of effective shade is used for water temperature. Effective shade
is the percent reduction of solar radiation by streamside vegetation, and is used as a surrogate
indicator for water temperature for the purpose of consistency with South Fork Clearwater River
Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs (IDEQ et al. 2004) and South Fork Clearwater River TMDL
Implementation Plan (South Fork Clearwater River Watershed Advisory Group 2006).
Mine tailings have potential issues with soil and water contamination from heavy metals, and
mercury is typically the heavy metal of concern. Although mercury was not used in dredge
mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a small potential to find this element during
restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies, including the Crooked River Stream Survey and
In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water Quality Status Report 80: Crooked River (Mann
and Lindern 1988), and Idaho Champion Group Lode and Pacific Group Load Claims:
Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection Report (IDEQ 2011), have all shown that
concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and water are generally equivalent to background
levels or below detection limits. Recent heavy metals monitoring data collected within the
project area in 2013 by the Nez Perce Tribe did not exceed cold water biota water quality
standards (Nez Perce Tribe 2013 unpublished data). Based on these studies, mercury levels were
not used as a water quality indicator.
The turbidity water quality criteria state that turbidity shall not exceed background turbidity by
more than 50 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) instantaneously or more than 25 NTU for

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

more than 10 consecutive days (IDEQ 2013, IDAPA 58.01.02, sec 250). Design and mitigation
measures would be implemented to minimize turbidity; however, it is anticipated that exceeding
the instantaneous and 10-day turbidity criteria would be unavoidable for specific activities such
as coffer dam installation and removal, and de-watering /watering of the main channel and
temporary bypass channel. The specific design and mitigation measures that would be
implemented to minimize turbidity include: completing ground-disturbing activities during lowflow conditions and adjusting instream work dates site-specifically through coordination with the
Central Idaho Level 1 Team and other agencies; diverting or pumping stream water around the
work site and placing screens on intake pipes; installing silt fences, straw bales, and/or sand bag
windrows as needed before excavation occurs to separate disturbed areas from waterbodies; and
operating dewatering systems continuously until project construction has been completed on
each reach to minimize turbidity and sedimentation.
Geomorphology
Geomorphology is the examination of river forms and processes that operate through mutual
adjustments to achieve a condition of stability, where a river attains balance between erosion and
deposition. Geomorphic processes have been altered in the project area, resulting in a condition
of instability and degraded aquatic habitat. These processes include channel–floodplain
interaction and sediment transport/bed mobility. The following geomorphic indicators were used
to evaluate the potential effects from the proposed action on these geomorphic processes.
•

•

•

•

Channel entrenchment ratio is a measure of how incised a river is, or the extent of
vertical containment of a river relative to its adjacent floodplain. It is calculated as the
ratio of flood-prone area width to bankfull width, and used as an indicator of floodplain
connectivity (flood-prone area width/bankfull width).
Channel width-to-depth ratio is a measure of the shape of a channel cross section (e.g.,
wide and shallow or narrow and deep). It is calculated as the ratio of bankfull surface
width to mean bankfull depth, and is used as an indicator of the shape of the channel
(bankfull width/mean bankfull depth).
Channel sinuosity is a measure of the degree of meandering and channel migration
within a valley. It is calculated as the ratio of valley gradient to channel gradient, and is
used as an indicator of flow velocity (valley gradient/channel gradient).
Sediment Transport/Bed Mobility is the movement of sediment, and is used as an
indicator of the channel’s ability to maintain appropriately sized spawning gravel and
clean interstitial spaces, where interstitial spaces are the gaps between gravel particles.

Floodplains
The proposed action would alter the existing tailings piles to restore the Crooked River stream
channel and floodplain function. The indicator used to evaluate the potential effects on
floodplains is floodplain type and area (acres).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

3-50

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Wetlands
The proposed action would alter the existing wetlands in the project area. The indicator used to
evaluate the potential effects on wetlands is wetland class and area (acres).
The proposed action would be subject to permitting by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) under the Clean Water Act, Section 404(b)(1) guidelines (40 CFR 230) for
discharge of dredge and fill material into waters of the United States.
Crooked River Hydrology
Although hydrology is not identified as an indicator, this section presents a discussion of the
hydrology within the project area, including baseflow, bankfull flow, and groundwater–surface
water interactions, and the design flows used for the reconstructed Crooked River. Information
for this section was summarized from Design Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Groundwater–surface water processes in the project area are heavily disturbed due to both
mining impacts and rehabilitation efforts. Channel capacity estimates calibrated to fieldsurveyed bankfull indicators suggest that channel capacity in the middle of the project area
(Reaches 2 and 3; see Figure 3-14) is roughly 50 percent less than the upstream (Reach 1) and
downstream (Reach 4) project limits. Low flow discharge measurements were taken at four
instream locations in the project area in August 2012. Discharge measurements varied from
24.4 cfs to 25.8 cfs, and indicate that baseflow discharge is consistent throughout the
project area.
Temperature data collected suggest potential groundwater influence. Vegetation data suggest
that lateral groundwater and surface water inputs to the valley bottom from ephemeral tributaries
may be influencing the floodplain water table, whereby groundwater elevations are higher near
the edges of the valley relative to the center of the valley bottom. LiDAR data were used to
evaluate low flow surface water elevations throughout the valley bottom for ponds, wetlands,
side channels, and the main channel. Results indicate that surface water elevations are highly
variable, and the analysis yielded no distinct trends that would be useful for predicting
groundwater gradients or surface water relationships.
In summary, groundwater–surface water interactions in the project area are highly variable with
much uncertainty. The disturbed nature of the site from both mining and rehabilitation makes it
difficult to determine whether Crooked River within the project area is gaining or losing
groundwater, and how much flow is traveling subsurface through coarse valley bottom
substrates. Additional data collection and analysis would be useful only for characterizing a
highly disturbed existing condition that ultimately would be changed upon implementation of the
design, and would not provide useful information to inform project design.

Low flow, or baseflow, frequency statistics are useful to determine the minimum water
availability for fish passage under extreme conditions as well as to evaluate the risk of channel
dewatering. For Crooked River, baseflow statistics were estimated using the regional regression
equations presented in USGS SIR-2006-5035, which utilize drainage area, mean annual
precipitation, and percent of developed land. A summary of baseflow estimates for a
consecutive number of days and recurrence intervals is presented in Table 3-8. The baseflow
discharge used in the hydraulic model to design the reconstructed channel is the 30-day, 5-year
flow return interval (Q5) of 10 cubic feet per second (cfs).
Bankfull discharge was evaluated using multiple methods for hydraulic geometry and calibrating
roughness based on empirical data as well as measured field data for observed bankfull
indicators. Field discharge measurements were taken to calibrate bed roughness. Estimates of
bankfull discharge using field-surveyed bankfull indicators are summarized in Table 3-9.
Results indicate that the recurrence interval for bankfull discharge is Q1.1 or less, which is much
less than a Q1.5 recurrence interval that is typically associated with bankfull discharge.
Hydrologic analyses identified a significant disparity among methods for estimates of bankfull
discharge. Estimates of bankfull discharge using field data (bankfull indicators, channel cross
section geometry, water surface slope, and roughness derived from bed substrate) resulted in
values that were one-quarter to one-half of those derived from regional regression equations and
USGS gage data from nearby drainages (Table 3-10). One possible reason for the disparity is
flow attenuation caused by water storage in dredge ponds in the project area as well as the upper
watershed near the town of Orogrande. Another possible reason for the disparity is subsurface
flow through disturbed coarse deposits.
The design bankfull discharge was assumed to be between the estimates using field-surveyed
bankfull indicators and the estimates derived from regional regression equations and gage data
from nearby drainages, and the bankfull discharge of 300 cfs with a recurrence interval of
1.1 years was used in the model to design the reconstructed channel (personal communication
with Matt Daniels, RDG, 2013).

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
This section defines the existing condition and presents the analysis of direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects of the proposed action and alternative on water resources.
Affected Environment – Water Temperature
Information for the water temperature analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek is assessed under §305(b) of the Clean Water Act
as water quality impaired for temperature, and a temperature TMDL (total maximum daily load)
has been developed and approved (IDEQ et al. 2004). The TMDL states that increased stream
temperatures in the South Fork Clearwater River are primarily the result of increased heat
loading from increased solar radiation reaching the water surface and increased local
environmental temperatures as a result of the removal of riparian shading (IDEQ et al. 2004).
Percent effective shade targets were established in the TMDL as surrogate measures necessary to
achieve temperature criteria, with a percent increase effective shade target of 24 percent for
forested tributaries of the South Fork Clearwater River (IDEQ et al. 2004). The means of
achieving these effective shade targets is through restoring and protecting riparian vegetation,
and narrowing stream channel widths (IDEQ et al. 2004).
Disturbed riparian conditions alongside Crooked River have resulted in altered plant
communities and reduced canopy cover, which has contributed to elevated water temperatures by
increasing solar radiation and decreasing effective shade. Disturbed riparian conditions
alongside Crooked River include a lack of floodplain connectivity due to channel entrenchment,
and extensive tailings piles with coarse, well-drained substrates. Lack of floodplain connectivity
limits the interaction between Crooked River and its floodplain, which inhibits the process of
sediment deposition along the river and within the floodplain that initiates woody plant
community succession. The coarse, well-drained tailings piles lack sufficient fine-grained
rooting material to support a healthy, diverse plant community, and their extent significantly
limits the area available for woody plant communities to establish.
The existing plant communities within the project area are displayed in Figure 3-12, which
shows the extent of reed canary grass located streamside along Crooked River, and herbaceous
plants and conifers located streamside on the tailings piles along Crooked River. The existing
percent composition of streamside plant communities and streamside average percent summer
solar radiation and average percent summer effective shade are presented in Table 3-11. The
existing percent composition of streamside plant communities and streamside maximum percent
summer solar radiation and minimum percent summer effective shade are presented in
Table 3-12. As shown by Tables 3-11 and 3-12, reed canary grass currently occupies 40% of the
streamside with average and maximum percent summer solar radiation of 82 and 94%,
respectively. Corresponding streamside average and minimum summer percent effective shade

for the current reed canary grass are 18 and 6%, respectively. Conifer and herbaceous plants
currently located streamside on tailings piles each occupy 8% of the streamside, and have
average percent summer solar radiation of 41% and 80%, respectively, and average percent
summer effective shade of 59% and 20%, respectively. Conifer and herbaceous plants currently
located streamside on tailings piles have maximum percent summer solar radiation of 85% and
94%, respectively, and minimum percent summer effective shade of 15% and 5%, respectively.
The existing streamside weighted average percent summer effective shade is 30%, and the
existing streamside weighted minimum percent effective shade is 16%, indicating surface water
temperatures are elevated due to high solar radiation and low percent effective shade from
disturbed riparian conditions.

Direct and Indirect Effects

The proposed project would reconstruct Crooked River to reduce channel entrenchment and
increase floodplain connectivity; re-grade the floodplain to remove tailings piles; and import
suitable substrate. These actions would create the conditions necessary to support the
establishment and succession of desired riparian plant communities, including woody vegetation
that increases percent effective shade. Alder and spruce would grow rapidly, and can form dense
stands that would provide shade within 10 years or less; however, a minimum of 20 years would
be needed for conifer communities to grow to sufficient heights to provide shade (RDG et al.
2013a).
The proposed project would reduce the potential for establishment of reed canary grass on the
new floodplain surface by constructing diverse topography and incorporating woody debris in
these areas. This would create a mosaic of microsites to promote the establishment of woody
vegetation. Reed canary grass productivity is reduced by shade, and dense woody vegetation
establishment on the floodplain surface would create conditions less suitable for reed canary
grass.
The expected post-project plant communities within the project area are shown in Figure 3-13,
which displays the extent of streamside alders expected to replace reed canary grass that is
currently occupying 40% of the streamside. A comparison of the extent in acres of existing and
expected vegetation communities is presented in Table 3-13. Reed canary grass is expected to
decrease by 13%, and alder is expected to have the greatest increase (32%). The expected postproject streamside average percent summer shade is 83% (RDG et al. 2012b), which would be an
increase of 177% over existing streamside average percent summer shade of 30%. Data are not
available to calculate expected post-project streamside minimum percent summer shade, but if an
increase of 177% is assumed, the value would be 44%. These percent effective shade increases
exceed the TMDL target of 24% for forested watersheds tributary to South Fork Clearwater
River, and exceeding this target could result in Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek
cooling to temperatures that do not exceed the water temperature criteria. If that occurs, the
condition of attaining water temperature criteria for removal from the §305(b) list would be met,
and Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek could be removed from the §305(b) list.

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the Meanders, which would not result in further increases in water temperature
pursuant to IDEQ Antidegradation Policy (IDEQ 2013; IDAPA 58.01.02, sec. 52), and does not
include restoration. Current elevated water temperatures would persist, water temperature
criteria would likely not be attained, and Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek would
likely remain on the 305(b) list as water quality impaired for temperature. Hydraulic analysis
estimates it would require at least a 500-year return period flood flow event to mobilize large
cobble material (RDG et al. 2012), which is present in the tailing piles. An event of that
magnitude has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year; thus, the time frame for natural
recovery to erode the tailings pile and restore floodplain connectivity, which would create the
conditions for streamside vegetation that would provide enough effective shade to decrease water
temperatures, would occur on an estimated time scale of thousands of years.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, there would likely be a short-term increase in water temperature with the
removal of streamside vegetation along the reconstructed channel and the temporary bypass
channel and associated decreases in effective shade. This short-term increase would continue
while flow is diverted to the temporary bypass channel (approximately 3 to 6 years), and until
desired riparian vegetation has grown to sufficient height to provide effective shade
(approximately 10 and 20 years for alders and conifers, respectively). However, under
Alternative 2, there would be a long-term beneficial effect (decrease) on water temperature.
Water temperatures would decrease with the expected increase in effective shade of 177% with
the establishment of desired riparian plant communities, including woody vegetation. This
increase in effective shade would exceed the TMDL target of 24% increase in effective shade for
forested tributaries of the South Fork Clearwater River. Exceeding the TMDL effective shade
target could result in Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek attaining water temperature
criteria. The time for this to occur would be a minimum of 20 years (the time needed for conifer

communities to provide shade). Attaining the water temperature criteria would meet the
condition for removal from the §305(b) list for temperature impairment. While 10 to 20 years
are anticipated for the growth of riparian plant communities that would provide shade for cooler
water temperatures, in the 75 years since the project area was disturbed, riparian growth has
resulted in 30% average summer effective shade and 16% minimum summer effective summer
shade, and without project implementation, natural recovery within 20 years would not occur.
Cumulative Effects: Water Temperature

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions.
The cumulative effects analysis area for water temperature includes the Crooked River watershed
and the South Fork Clearwater River to its confluence with the Middle Fork Clearwater River
near Kooskia, Idaho. A full description of past, present, and future foreseeable actions
considered in this analysis is presented in Appendix C.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Past dredge mining has had the most notable management-related effects on water temperature in
Crooked River. Several different large bucket dredges operated in Crooked River between 1936
and 1958. The Mount Vernon dredge first operated in Crooked River in 1938, and except for a
few interruptions, continued to work in the area until the late 1950s. In several of the years that
it operated in Crooked River, the dredge ran 24 hours a day with shifts of up to 20 men. It
consistently topped annual production in the Orogrande Mining District, and several times
ranked number one in Idaho County. These intensive mining activities disturbed riparian
conditions alongside Crooked River and left extensive tailings piles with coarse, well-drained
substrates that are a poor growth medium, resulting in undesirable riparian vegetation with high
solar radiation that has caused elevated water temperatures. Ongoing actions include recreation,
road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and weed
treatments. The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project is a reasonably foreseeable
future action within the Crooked River watershed, and would include prescribed burning,
vegetation treatments, and temporary road construction.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions. Since no direct or indirect effects would occur
under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would occur.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, water temperatures in Crooked River would likely increase in the short term
with the removal of existing riparian vegetation for the construction of the new channel and the
temporary bypass channel, which could cause a cumulative effect of increased water
temperatures in South Fork Clearwater River. This short-term temperature increase in South

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

3-62

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Fork Clearwater River could dissipate in the downstream direction from its confluence with
Crooked River with instream mixing and tributary inflows. Water temperatures are not expected
to increase in the short- or long-term in Crooked River or South Fork Clearwater River from the
implementation of the proposed Orogrande Community Protection project. Some vegetation
treatments would occur in riparian habitat conservation areas along Crooked River, but not to the
extent that they would prevent the attainment of Riparian Management Objectives that include
adequate water temperatures for cold water biota, and no shading trees would be affected (USDA
Forest Service 2013 draft). In the long term, water temperatures are expected to decrease in
Crooked River as desired riparian vegetation grows and provides effective shade to the channel.
As with temperature increases, decreased temperature effects could occur in South Fork
Clearwater River beginning at its confluence with Crooked River. However, these effects could
also be expected to dissipate in the downstream direction with instream mixing and tributary
inflows.
Affected Environment – Channel Entrenchment Ratio
Information for the channel entrenchment ratio analysis was summarized from Design Criteria
Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Channel entrenchment ratio is a measure of how incised a river is, or the extent of vertical
containment of a river relative to its adjacent floodplain. It is calculated as the ratio of floodprone area width to bankfull width (flood-prone area width: bankfull width), and used as an
indicator of floodplain connectivity. The desired condition for Crooked River is low channel
entrenchment per Rosgen Stream Classification (Rosgen and Silvey 1996).
Geomorphology through the project area is altered, and existing channel entrenchment is
moderate per Rosgen Stream Classification (Rosgen and Silvey 1996), with mean channel
entrenchment ratios for the four river reaches within the project area ranging from 1.7 to 2.5, as
presented in Table 3-14. The locations of the four river reaches are presented in Figure 3-14.
Flow direction is from south to north (Reach 1 to Reach 4).
Channel entrenchment between tailings piles is containing Crooked River within its banks, and
in most cases the 100-year flood flow event (Q100) is contained in narrow overbank areas
between the channel and the tailing piles. This is preventing channel-floodplain interaction, and
floodplain connectivity is lacking. More than 50% of the valley bottom is elevated greater than
1.5 feet above the bankfull elevation (Table 3-15 and Figure 3-15), suggesting that a majority of
the valley contains tailings piles and is not part of the functioning floodplain.
Hydraulic analysis estimates that at least a 500-year return period flood flow event would be
required to mobilize large cobble material (RDG et al. 2012), which is present in the tailing piles.
An event of that magnitude has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year; thus, the time

Environmental Consequences – Channel Entrenchment Ratio
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. Moderate channel
entrenchment would persist with entrenchment ratios ranging from 1.7 to 2.5, and floodplain
connectivity would remain lacking. Natural recovery processes that could erode the tailings piles
and re-grade the floodplain to an elevation that reduces channel entrenchment and restores
floodplain connectivity would occur on an estimated time scale of thousands of years.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 proposes to excavate the majority of the tailings piles, re-grade the floodplain, and
size the new channel capacity for bankfull discharge to reduce channel entrenchment and restore
floodplain connectivity. Estimated channel entrenchment ratios for the re-constructed channel
were calculated using channel design criteria data (RDG et al. 2013a), and range from 10.0 to
12.5 (Table 3-16), indicating slight channel entrenchment and thus restored floodplain
connectivity. A summary comparison of channel entrenchment ratios by alternative is presented
in Table 3-17. The increase in channel entrenchment ratio from the existing 1.7–2.5 to 10.0–12.5
under Alternative 2 represents a change from moderate channel entrenchment to slight channel
entrenchment per Rosgen Stream Classification (Rosgen and Silvey 1996), indicating that
Crooked River would be reconnected with its floodplain and more natural and frequent flooding
of the floodplain would occur.

The existing channel width-to-depth ratios for the four river reaches of Crooked River within the

Environmental Consequences – Channel Width-to-Depth Ratio
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. The existing moderate to
high channel width-to-depth ratios (17 to 31) indicating a wide and shallow channel shape would
persist, as would elevated water temperatures that exceed the temperature criteria. Wide and
shallow channel shapes have slower water velocities and larger surface areas; therefore, they
have greater exposure time and area to solar radiation if there is little shading of the stream, and
water temperatures become elevated.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 proposes to re-construct two miles of Crooked River with expected channel widthto-depth ratios ranging from 23 to 36, as presented in Table 3-19, which are moderate to high
and indicate a wide, shallow channel shape. A comparison of channel width-to-depth ratios by
alternative is presented in Table 3-20, which shows that there would be little effect on channel
shape under Alternative 2 initially, and the channel shape would remain wide and shallow in the
short term. In the long term, however, width-to-depth ratios are expected to decrease in response
to increased complexity of the channel margins through the addition of woody debris structures,
and increased complexity within the channel through the addition of large woody debris. This
increased complexity would cause localized backwater and localized flow acceleration, which
would result in deeper flow from backwater effects, and scour and the formation of deeper holes

with deeper flow depth from flow acceleration effects. In addition to localized flow acceleration
resulting from increased channel complexity, stream velocity would increase in Reaches 2 and 3
where channel slope would be increased, as discussed in the Channel Sinuosity sections.
Increased stream velocity and expected post-project streamside average percent effective
summer shade of 83 percent, as discussed in the Water Temperature sections, could result in
decreased water temperatures.

Affected Environment – Channel Sinuosity
Information for the channel sinuosity analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Geomorphology in the project area has been altered by the past mining, which has left tailings
piles and resulted in a tortuous meander pattern (Figure 3-16, Appendix C). Channel sinuosity is
1.2 and 1.4 in the upper and lower reaches, respectively (Reaches 1 and 4, Figure 3-14), with
higher channel sinuosity of 2.2 and 2.7 in the tortuous Meanders middle reaches (Reaches 2 and
3, Figure 3-14). The higher channel sinuosity in the tortuous Meanders reaches indicates lower
channel gradients, which are approximately half the gradients of the upper and lower reaches
(Table 3-21). Lower channel gradients result in slower water velocities, which reduce the river’s
sediment transport competence and capacity. Sediment transport competence is the maximum
particle size that can be transported, and sediment transport capacity is the maximum amount of
sediment that can be transported. Low competence in the tortuous Meanders reaches (Reaches 2
and 3) coupled with an abrupt decrease in channel gradient that exists between Reaches 1 and 2
have caused gravel entering the project area from upstream (south) to deposit in Reach 2, thus
depriving downstream Reaches 3 and 4 of suitable spawning substrate, as presented in
Table 3-21.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 would remove the majority of the tailing piles and reconstruct the channel and its
floodplain to create more natural stream sinuosity and meet the design objective of restoring
geomorphology in the project area. Existing channel sinuosity ranging from 2.2 to 2.7
representing the tortuous meander pattern would be decreased, and more natural channel
sinuosity ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 would be created. This more natural channel sinuosity would
provide higher channel gradients and corresponding higher velocities, which would increase the
river’s competence to transport gravel and provide suitable spawning substrate to the
downstream reaches. A comparison of the existing and expected channel sinuosity and channel
gradients by alternative is presented in Table 3-22.

Affected Environment – Sediment Transport/Bed Mobility
Information for the sediment transport/bed mobility analysis was summarized from Design
Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design
Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a), and Hydraulic
Modeling and Habitat Mapping for Existing Conditions (RDG 2013b).
Natural processes influencing sediment supply in the Crooked River watershed include geology,
soils, hillslope mass wasting, forest fires, and lateral migration/bank erosion. Granitic geology,
relatively stable hillslopes, infrequent fires, and low bank erosion rates appear to be factors
contributing to a low sediment supply. Sediment transport in the Crooked River is affected by
valley gradient, stream type, and supply. An evaluation of valley gradients and stream types
indicates that sediment transport capacity likely decreases downstream of the Narrows, creating
the potential for sediment deposition near the upper boundary of Reach 2 (Figure 3-14).
Similarly, past rehabilitation efforts to increase channel sinuosity by routing the river through
large dredge ponds have reduced channel gradient and increased the potential for sediment
storage, thus making the dredge ponds function as large sediment traps capable of depleting
downstream reaches of sediment supply. Downstream, the reduced stream power through
meandering channel segments combined with a lack of sediment supply have resulted in static
bed conditions and subsequent armoring of the riverbed with the over-sized remains of coarse
dredging deposits. These static conditions represent bed immobility.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

As discussed in the Channel Sinuosity section, lower channel gradients have resulted in slower
water velocities, which have reduced the river’s sediment transport competence and capacity and
caused gravel entering the project area from upstream to deposit in Reach 2, thus depriving
downstream Reaches 3 and 4 (Figure 3-14) of suitable spawning substrate (see Table 3-21).
Environmental Consequences – Sediment Transport/Bed Mobility
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. Channel gradients and
water velocities would remain low, the river’s sediment transport competence would remain low,
static conditions representing an immobile and armored riverbed would persist, and downstream
reaches would continue to be deprived of gravel needed for suitable spawning substrate.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, the channel would be reconstructed to support a mobile gravel bed, which
would provide downstream reaches with appropriately sized spawning gravel and support the
maintenance of clean interstitial spaces. This would be accomplished by increasing channel
gradients in Reaches 2 and 3, as presented in Table 3-22, which would increase water velocities
in the meandering reaches and increase sediment transport competence and capacity to provide
suitable spawning gravels to downstream reaches. A comparison of channel gradients by
alternative is presented in Table 3-22.
A summary comparison of areas for particle size mobility is presented in Table 3-23, which
shows an increase in gravel mobility under Alternative 2 for both the bankfull discharge of
300 cfs with a recurrence interval of 1.1 years, and the Q2 discharge of 597 cfs with a recurrence
interval of 2 years. Figures 3-17 and 3-18 illustrate particle bed mobility for bankfull and Q2
discharges, respectively, where the reconstruction of the floodplain and channel would result in
smaller particles being distributed across more of the floodplain and larger particles suitable for
spawning to move into Reaches 3 and 4 of Crooked River (see also Aquatic Resources section).

The cumulative effects analysis area for the geomorphic indicators channel width-to-depth ratio,

Since no direct or indirect effects would occur under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would
occur.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 would have direct effects on channel sinuosity, channel entrenchment ratios, and
channel width-to-depth ratios. Since no other actions would affect these indicators, there would
no cumulative effects.
Affected Environment – Wetlands
Information for the wetlands analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report: Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design Report: Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a), and Crooked River Rehabilitation Project
Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012).
Within the 115-acre project area, 52.5 acres of wetlands have been delineated. Wetland classes
delineated include palustrine aquatic bed, palustrine emergent, palustrine scrub shrub, palustrine
forested, and riverine as presented in Table 3-24 and Figures 3-19, 3-20, and 3-21. Each of the
wetlands types provide various wetland functions, including: aquatic and terrestrial habitat,
debris recruitment, surface and groundwater storage, sediment and nutrient filtering, streambank
stabilization, thermal cover, and terrestrial habitat.
Palustrine aquatic bed wetlands account for 9.7 acres (18.5%) of the existing wetland area in the
project area, and include dredge ponds and low-gradient side channel features flowing along the
edges of the valley. Aquatic bed wetlands in the project area provide surface and groundwater
storage that maintain streamflows, and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species. The
function of aquatic bed wetlands is limited through lack of connectivity with the mainstem
Crooked River.

Palustrine emergent wetlands are the most abundant wetland class in the project area, and
account for 28.1 acres (53.5%) of the existing wetland area. Emergent wetlands, defined by the
dominance of erect rooted herbaceous (not woody) wetland plants, occur throughout the
floodplain including on streambanks of Crooked River, alongside channels, around dredge
ponds, at the toe of valley slopes, and on floodplain surfaces. Sedges and reed canary grass are
the dominant emergent wetland species on streambanks and connected floodplain features. As
discussed in the water temperature analysis, reed canary grass occupies 40% of the streamside
and provides average and minimum summer percent effective shade of 18 and 6%, respectively,
thereby providing little thermal cover.
Emergent wetlands are supported by a number of hydrologic regimes, including: temporarily
flooded, seasonally flooded, and semi-permanently flooded. Emergent wetlands provide surface
and groundwater storage that maintain streamflows, and provide habitat for aquatic and
terrestrial species. Where connected to Crooked River, these wetlands provide sediment and
nutrient filtering and streambank stabilization functions. The function of emergent wetlands is
limited due to lack of connectivity with Crooked River.
Palustrine scrub shrub wetlands account for 1.7 acres (3.2%) of the existing wetland area in the
project area, and are located in a few scattered locations on the floodplain that supports this
wetland class. Scrub shrub wetlands are located mostly along the main Crooked River channel
and support a range of floodplain and aquatic habitat functions, including thermal cover, debris
recruitment, and streambank stability. These wetlands provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial
species. Function of these wetlands is limited due to the lack of floodplain connectivity and the
small area occupied by this wetland type.
Two palustrine forested wetlands accounting for 0.5 acres (1.0%) of existing wetland area were
delineated in the project area. Both wetlands are associated with seep features on slopes on the
east side of valley that drain into the floodplain. In the project area, forested wetlands are rare
and associated with seeps along valley slopes. These wetlands provide habitat for terrestrial
species, including terrestrial insect input as a food source and leaf drop as a nutrient source for

other wetlands and aquatic habitat. Function of these wetlands is limited due to the small area
occupied by this wetland type.
Riverine wetlands accounting for 12.5 acres (23.8%) of existing wetland area were delineated in
the project area. These wetlands provide habitat for fish and other aquatic species, convey water
and sediment, and provide an influx of nutrients and organic matter to adjacent wetland features,
which supports nutrient cycling.

Environmental Consequences – Wetlands
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. Emergent wetlands that do
not provide thermal cover and currently account for the majority (53.5%) of the existing
52.5-acre delineated wetland area would likely persist at these high levels. Desired scrub shrub
wetlands that provide thermal cover and currently account for only 3.2% of the wetland area
would likely persist at these low levels. Existing wetlands by area, function, and class are
presented in Table 3-24.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, a mosaic of vegetation communities would be created that would provide
more ecological functions than currently exist. This would be accomplished by restoring
channel-floodplain interaction through decreased channel entrenchment in the reconstructed
channel, whereby the floodplain would be inundated more frequently at flows greater than the
1.1-year recurrence interval, and through the construction of side channels that would connect to
the main channel at elevations above baseflow and below bankfull stage and would convey less
than 10 percent of the total flow.
Two types of wetland features would be constructed: slope wetlands and side channel wetlands.
Slope wetlands are lateral seeps entering the valley bottom from side drainages. Side channel
wetlands are wide, shallow depressions connected to side channel features. Side channel
wetlands would create areas of low velocity along the side channels to promote natural
recruitment of vegetation and organic matter and retain late-season moisture in the floodplain.
Existing aquatic bed and emergent wetlands would be converted to shrub and forest-dominated
vegetation communities that would provide aquatic and terrestrial habitat and increase
streamside shading. Alternative 2 is expected to impact 30.6 acres of the existing 52.5 acres of
wetland during construction (Figure 3-22), and create 42 acres of wetlands (Figure 3-23).
Following implementation, the expected wetland area would be 64.1 acres, which would be a
total net gain of 11.6 acres of wetlands in the long term.
A comparison of the areas of existing and expected wetland classes by alternative is presented in
Table 3-25. Existing wetlands outside construction limits would be preserved in their present
condition. Table 3-26 shows the existing wetland area, estimated project-related wetland impact
area, estimated area of wetland creation resulting from the project, and the total estimated area of
wetland post-project.
Alternative 2 would comply with Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) as: (1)
potential effects to wetlands in the project area have been evaluated; (2) design and mitigation

measures have been developed to avoid adversely impacting wetlands wherever possible or to
minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values of wetlands; and (3) Alternative 2 would

This estimate includes existing wetlands that would not be impacted by project actions combined with wetlands expected to be
created by the project.

Wetlands are expected to increase in both area and diversity in the project area as a result of the
project, and associated wetland and floodplain functions are also expected to increase. The
project design would create a diverse floodplain surface that is hydrologically connected with the
Crooked River channel. The floodplain would include a variety of geomorphic surfaces,
including a defined main channel, point bars, bankfull floodplain, side channels, and large and
small depression features. Frequent disturbance from floods, combined with groundwater and
hyporheic exchange, would result in a heterogeneous mosaic of habitats across the floodplain,
each capable of supporting a variety of plant species. These enhanced hydrogeomorphic
conditions would cause many of these diverse, newly created habitats to develop into ephemeral,
seasonal, or persistent wetland types.
The time needed for wetlands to develop in the floodplain depends on a number of factors.
Some wetland types, such as riverine wetlands, would be present immediately after project
implementation. Other wetlands, such as shrub and forested wetlands, would not be present until

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

woody vegetation has a chance to colonize and establish these areas. The diversity of features
incorporated into the design floodplain would provide both sources and storage of organic
matter, which would promote soil development over time. Deposited and accumulated sediment
within the hydrologically diverse floodplain would influence the development and maintenance
of wetland and riparian vegetation communities. Hydrologic conditions would dictate what
vegetation communities would ultimately develop and thrive in the floodplain and what type of
soils would develop over time.
Table 3-27 presents design vegetation communities with the expected wetland classes that are
likely to develop over time. Most of the rehabilitated floodplain is designed to support riparian
shrub and forest plant communities. The rehabilitated floodplain includes approximately
32.6 acres of alder vegetation community type, which is expected to develop into a palustrine
scrub shrub wetland over time (Figure 3-24). Other design features that are expected to develop
into wetland over time include bare colonizing surfaces, water features such as the main channel,
alcoves and side channels, and sedge vegetation communities. Palustrine forested wetlands may
develop in portions of the conifer/tall forb, mixed shrub, and spruce design vegetation
community types when they are located in areas with wetland hydrology (i.e., slope wetlands)
but these are not included in the estimated total expected wetland area because it is unclear how
the hydrology would develop in these areas.
Alternative 2 would create a connected, topographically heterogeneous floodplain with a mosaic
of vegetation communities, where the rehabilitated Crooked River floodplain would be able to
provide more ecological functions compared to the existing conditions. Conversion of existing
aquatic bed and emergent wetlands that are disconnected from the main channel by extensive
tailings piles to shrub and forest-dominated vegetation communities connected with the river
would support sediment and water retention, provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species,
increase allochthonous inputs of carbon and other nutrients, as well as increase shading of the
channel to help maintain water temperatures.

Affected Environment – Floodplains
Information for the floodplains analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report: Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report: Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
As discussed in the channel entrenchment analysis, tailings piles are extensive on the valley
floor, Crooked River is confined within its banks as a result, and more than 50 percent of the
valley bottom is not part of the floodplain (Table 3-15 and Figure 3-15). As discussed in the
water temperature analysis, this lack of floodplain connectivity limits the interaction between the
stream channel and the floodplain, which inhibits the processes that support desired riparian
vegetation communities. Within the 115-acre project area, there are approximately 22.7 acres of
floodplain, of which 15.6 acres are bankfull floodplain and 7.1 acres are upland floodplain.
Environmental Consequences – Floodplains
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. The majority of the project
area would remain outside of the floodplain, the lack of floodplain connectivity would persist,
and conditions to support desired vegetation communities and desired aquatic habitat would not
be created. The area of existing floodplain, by alternative, is presented in Table 3-28.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, the floodplain and channel profile would be gradually raised 2.8 feet
beginning near the upstream boundary of Reach 2 (Figure 3-10) and then gradually lowered to
transition back to the existing channel and bankfull indicators near the downstream boundary of
Reach 4 (Figure 3-10). Interaction between the stream channel and floodplain would be restored
with floodplain inundation occurring more frequently at flows greater than the 1.1-year
recurrence interval, and sustainable floodplain morphology would be established that is capable
of supporting aquatic habitat and desired vegetation communities, which would provide more
ecological functions than currently exist. Under Alternative 2, approximately 22.7 acres of
floodplain would be impacted during construction, and 56.3 acres of new floodplain would be
created. Of the new floodplain created, 43.1 acres would be bankfull floodplain, and 13.2 acres
would be upland floodplain. Following implementation, the floodplain area would be 56.3 acres,
for a total net gain of 33.6 acres of floodplain. A comparison of the area of existing and
proposed floodplain types, by alternative, is presented in Table 3-28. Table 3-29 shows the
existing floodplain acres, project-related floodplain impact acres, and the post-project acres of
new floodplain created.

The new floodplain would be characterized by complexity and diversity, and consist of surface
elevations that correspond to a range of desired floodplain vegetation communities and desired
geomorphic features. These include wetlands, side channels, and oxbow or pond features of
varying depth that would create an abiotic template to support complex and highly functioning
plant communities. The result would be a wide range of ecological niches within a diverse
mosaic of plant communities for both short and long term. Further diversifying the floodplain
through placement of varying textures and thicknesses of substrate, and integrating woody debris
in patterns mimicking natural recruitment, would create the physical components necessary for
river processes to initiate development of a highly functioning floodplain environment. The
width of the bankfull floodplain would vary from 100 to 400 feet with the valley width, with an
average width of 300 feet. The bankfull floodplain would correspond to the elevation from the
top of the new channel banks to 1.5 feet higher, and would be inundated frequently at flows with
recurrence intervals greater than the 1.1-year flood flow event. The upland floodplain would be
constructed as a transition area between the bankfull floodplain and existing ground, and the
elevation would correspond to 1.5 to 2.0 feet above the top of the new channel banks. The
upland floodplain width would vary from 0 to 200 feet based on the balance of earthwork. The
height of the upland floodplain would be set at an elevation corresponding to slightly drier
vegetation community types. The upland floodplain would be inundated infrequently at flows
with recurrence intervals greater than the 25-year flood flow event (or, on average, inundated
every 25 years).
Alternative 2 would comply with Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) as:
(1) potential effects to floodplains in the project area have been evaluated; (2) design and
mitigation measures have been developed to reduce short-term impacts to floodplains; and
(3) Alternative 2 would restore the function of the floodplain.

Cumulative Effects – Wetlands and Floodplains

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions. The cumulative effects analysis area for
wetlands and floodplains is the project area.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Past dredge mining has had the most direct notable management-related effects on wetlands and
floodplains in the project area. A full description of past, present, and future foreseeable actions
considered in this analysis is presented in Appendix C.
There are no present or foreseeable future actions within the project area that would affect
floodplains or wetlands.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Past dredge mining would continue to affect floodplain and wetlands currently in the project area
because these systems have been physically altered. However, since no direct or indirect effects
would occur under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would occur.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Past dredge mining continues to affect the Crooked River floodplain and wetlands. The
proposed action would reduce the effects from past dredge mining on the Crooked River
floodplain and wetlands in the project area through the proposed rehabilitation efforts.
Alternative 2 would have short-term adverse effect on wetlands with the reconstruction of the
channel and the re-grading of the floodplain; however, not all wetlands would be impacted. Of
the existing 52.5 acres of wetlands, 30.6 acres would be impacted, and 21.9 acres would be
preserved. These short-term adverse effects on wetlands are expected to be off-set by long-term
improvements that include the conversion of existing aquatic bed and emergent wetlands to
higher-quality shrub and forest-dominated vegetation communities that would provide aquatic
and terrestrial habitat and increase streamside shading, and by the net increase of 11.6 acres of
wetlands from the existing 52.5 acres to 64.1 acres post-project (Table 3-26).
Alternative 2 would have short-term adverse effects on the existing 22.7 acres of floodplain with
the re-grading of the floodplain; however, these short-term adverse effects would be offset by the
restoration of floodplain connectivity and improvement of floodplain function, and by the net
gain of 33.6 acres from the existing 22.7 acres to 56.3 acres post-project (Table 3-29).
Since there are no present or foreseeable future actions within the project area that would affect
floodplains or wetlands, there would be no cumulative beneficial effects under Alternative 2.

Cumulative Effects: Watershed Condition

The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would have minimal direct
and indirect effects on total and streamside road densities and no direct or indirect effects on
watershed condition; therefore, no cumulative effects on watershed condition would occur.
Cumulative Effects: Sediment Yield

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions. The cumulative effects area for sediment yield
is the Crooked River watershed, Campbell Creek, and Deadwood Creek. A full description of
past, present, and future foreseeable actions is presented in Appendix C.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Existing roads have had the most notable management-related effects on sediment yield in
Crooked River watershed, Campbell Creek, and Deadwood Creek. Ongoing actions include road
maintenance.
There are two reasonably foreseeable future actions within the Crooked River watershed that
were considered. The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project would include
prescribed burning, vegetation treatments, and temporary road construction activities. The
proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would reconstruct a portion of
Road 233. Both future activities, with the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, as
modeled by NEZSED, would be below Forest Plan sediment yield guidelines, and therefore
would have no cumulative effect on sediment yield.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The following project design and mitigation measures meet the intent of Clean Water Act,
Section 303, and are considered project-specific best management practices for the action
alternative (Alternative 2). The measures are specified in full in Chapter 2, Design and
Mitigation Measures. See, also, Federal Consistency Check List in the project record.
Erosion Control/Sediment Yield/Turbidity
The following design and mitigation measures related to erosion control, sediment yield, and
turbidity are to be implemented for Alternative 2: #1, 6–10, 13, 16, 19, 46, 48, 49, and 52.
Activities of the proposed action with the potential to increase turbidity and sediment yield
include: reconstruction of channel; construction of the temporary bypass channel and temporary
haul road; clearing of vegetation; regrading the floodplain; preparing staging areas; watering the
temporary bypass channel; and re-watering the reconstructed channel. Floodplain regrading
activities and channel reconstruction would increase sediment production; however, sediment
basins would be constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle out sediment.
Design and mitigation measures, such as installing sediment barriers (#8) and mulching/
stabilizing side slopes (#19), would reduce sediment yield to waterbodies but would not prevent
all sediment from reaching waterbodies.
Watering the temporary bypass channel and re-watering the reconstructed channel are the
activities that would increase turbidity the most. The project area is primarily composed of
larger cobble since most of the fine sediment was washed out during the dredging activities,
which would reduce the overall amount of sediment produced during construction activities.
Providing a temporary bypass channel and constructing a temporary work road would physically
separate the majority of the construction area from direct contact with Crooked River and would
reduce the amount of sediment yield delivered to waterbodies during construction (#47, #48
[RDG et al. 2013a], and #52). As a part of the design, temporary ponds would be constructed to
capture sediment across the work area and prevent sediment yield to the bypass channel or the
South Fork Clearwater River. Turbid water may be pumped to the floodplain or settling ponds to
keep areas dry during construction and to reduce sediment yield to Crooked River and South
Fork Clearwater River.
Design and mitigation measure #16 may include actions or monitoring to be conducted as
directed by regulatory agencies, and adaptive management would be applied if turbidity reaches
50 NTUs over background during low flow. The Idaho standard for turbidity is 50 NTUs
instantaneous measurement over background, which is considered protective of cold water
aquatic life.
The erosion control plan ensures coordination between the Forest Service and contractor to
reduce offsite sediment and erosion. This is BMP Conservation Practice (CP) 15.03 in the

Region 1 and 4 Soil Conservation Handbook (USDA Forest Service 1988a), which was adopted
to comply with the Clean Water Act (also see BMP Fac-2 and AqEco-2 in the Forest Service
National Core BMPs [USDA Forest Service 2012]). Newly constructed or disturbed surfaces
have surface runoff as the dominant erosion mechanism for this scale of activity (Lane et al.
1997). Runoff is reduced by dispersing runoff with groundcover and shaping the surface, and by
preserving the soil’s capacity to take in precipitation.
Design and mitigation measures 9 and 13 rely on groundcover as a means to reduce erosion. The
measures tier to BMPs CP 11.03, 13.01, and 13.04 (USDA Forest Service 1988a) and National
Core BMPs Fac-2, Fac-10, Road-3, Road-6, and Veg-2 (USDA Forest Service 2012).
Groundcover is commonly used to reduce erosion for road bases and reclaimed soil areas. The
effectiveness depends on the slope and infiltration capacity of the soil. For roadsides where fill
provides poor infiltration, grasses disperse runoff but the infiltration capacity remains reduced.
However, rock and organic mulch both protect the surface and reduce the generation of overland
flow. The Water Erosion Prediction Project models illustrate the effectiveness with percent rock
and vegetation as primary inputs (Elliot et al. 1999). An annual rye is used since this grass
grows quickly and binds soil with roots. The vegetation reduces the incidence for rill forming by
minimizing the expanse of bare soil that can generate runoff. Measure 10 increases efficiency by
emphasizing use of onsite materials. Measure 26 indirectly bolsters erosion control since weeds
tend to be single-stemmed forbs that create less-effective groundcover than do grasses (Lacey et
al. 1989).
Measure 13 effectively reduces erosion by avoiding compaction and rutting that can occur when
machines operate in saturated conditions. Soil strength decreases substantially during wet
saturated conditions and operation (NCASI 2004). Saturated conditions increase runoff
incidence since soils lack capacity to take in precipitation.
Measure 10 shapes the constructed surfaces to reduce rill and gully formation from concentrated
water flow. The effectiveness is proven as a core design concept for constructing road surfaces
to shed water.
Petroleum-Based Products
The following design and mitigation measures related to petroleum-based products are to be
implemented for Alternative 2: #2, 3, 4, and 5.
Heavy equipment would be used for project activities that include floodplain regrading and
channel reconstruction. Washing and maintaining all equipment would reduce the amount of
petroleum-based products entering waterbodies from day-to-day operations. Staging areas for
machinery, fuels storage, and maintenance work would occur off site and far enough from live
water that waterbodies would likely not be exposed to petroleum products in the case of a spill
(#3, #5). Since much of the project area is composed of porous cobble, any spills would
percolate to the groundwater quickly. Storing petroleum products in containment structures with

impervious liners would prevent much of the chemical from entering waterbodies or
groundwater, and having spill containment kits and a spill containment plan on site would allow
for a quick response to reduce the amount of chemicals leaching into groundwater (#4).
Toxics
The following design and mitigation measures related to toxics are to be implemented for
Alternative 2: #15 and 20.
Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the environment that has several forms. Metallic
mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid. Metallic mercury (inorganic mercury and its
compounds) enters the air from mining and manufacturing activities and from burning coal and
waste. It has also been added to the environment from historic gold mining activities. Although
mercury was not used in dredge mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a small
potential to find this element during restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies, including
the Crooked River Stream Survey and In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water Quality
Status Report 80: Crooked River (Mann and Lindern 1988), and Idaho Champion Group Lode
and Pacific Group Load Claims: Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection Report (IDEQ
2011), have all shown that concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and water are generally
equivalent to background levels or below detection limits.
Because of its color, mercury would be visible by contractors, Forest Service, and Nez Perce
Tribe personnel on site during construction. Any mercury that is found would be removed from
the site following methods outlined in Appendix E (Best Management Practices for Mercury
Collection from Restoration Activities in Crooked River). This would reduce the potential for
bioaccumulation of mercury in aquatic species in Crooked River and the South Fork
Clearwater River.
Temporary Bypass Channel
The following design and mitigation measures related to the temporary bypass channel are to be
implemented for Alternative 2: #48 and 52.
The temporary bypass channel would be constructed prior to any instream or floodplain
activities. The bypass channel would be constructed to accommodate flows with a 10-year
recurrence interval, and would remain in operation until the floodplain and new channel are
complete. A cofferdam or headgate would be constructed on the main channel to control the
flow to the bypass channel. This would allow for increasing the flow in both the bypass channel
and newly constructed channel to reduce the amount of sediment mobilized during re-watering.
The temporary channel would be watered during high flows if possible. This would allow
sediment produced to be flushed out during periods when natural sediment background is already
high and there is enough water so as not to dewater the existing channel.

Site Rehabilitation
The following design and mitigation measures related to site rehabilitation are to be implemented
for Alternative 2: #17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 28, and 31.
The reclamation relies on local soil and plant material to ensure regrowth success (measure 18).
Local plants and soils have adapted to the local climate conditions. Measure 17 increases the site
capacity to support desired vegetation, as demonstrated by local road decommissioning
monitoring and research (Conner 2003, Lloyd et al. 2013). However, the disturbed conditions
favor establishment of noxious weeds that will compete with and exclude desired vegetation.
The exclusion of opportunistic weed species is critical to allow for desired vegetation to take
hold. Measures 25, 26, 28, and 31 would select for desired plant species using a combination of
preventive and control measures. The effectiveness would depend greatly on the ability for
follow-up treatment.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with the Forest Plan’s forestwide and management area standards for
water resources (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-22 and II-23). Chapter 2 contains a full list
of project design and mitigation measures, including best management practices (BMPs) that
have been identified to reduce effects to water quality and measures to reduce sediment delivery
from roads for the action alternative (Alternative 2). Clean Water Act Section 404, stream
alteration, or NPDES permits would be obtained for Alternative 2.
Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields from Forested Watersheds (Cline et al. 1981) and Forest
Hydrology, Part II: Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation (USDA Forest Service 1974)
were used in the above analysis to compare alternative effects on sediment and water yields.
Alternative 1 would not move toward fishery/water quality objectives in Crooked River, whereas
Alternative 2 would move toward these objectives.
Clean Water Act
Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state,
interstate, and local requirements; administrative authorities; and process and sanctions with
respect to control and abatement of water pollution. Executive Order (EO) 12088 requires the
Forest Service to meet the requirements of this Act. Therefore, all state and federal laws and
regulations applicable to water quality would be applied, including 36 CFR 219.27; the Clean
Water Act; the Nez Perce Forest Plan, including PACFISH Riparian Management Objectives
(RMOs) and Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas; Idaho State Best Management Practices
(BMPs); and Stream Alteration procedures.

The Forest would apply for a joint Clean Water Act Section 404 – Stream Alteration Permit with
the USACE and State of Idaho, Department of Water Resources, for Alternative 2. In addition, a
Section 404(1)(b) Practicability Analysis will be completed for the selected alternative
(Appendix B). The results of Section 404(1)(b) Practicability Analysis would identify the Least
Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA).
Idaho State Water Quality Standards
Short-term adverse effects on water temperature are not anticipated; however, pursuant to IDEQ
Antidegredation Policy, short-term adverse effects on water temperature may be allowed by
IDEQ without an antidegradation review where determined necessary to secure long-term water
quality improvement through restoration projects designed to trend toward natural characteristics
and associated uses to a water body where those characteristics and uses have been lost or
diminished (IDAPA 58.01.02, sec. 52).
Project-specific BMPs have been developed to reduce potential impacts to assigned beneficial
uses in the project area. Alternative 2 would be consistent with the State of Idaho
Antidegredation Policy. See Federal Consistency Check List in project record.
Executive Orders 11988 and 11990
These federal executive orders (EOs) provide for the protection and management of floodplains
and wetlands. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activities have been designed to
be consistent with the requirements of EO 11988 and EO 11990. As required, the Forest would
apply for a Joint Section 404 Permit with the USACE and a Stream Alteration Permit with the
Idaho Department of Water Resources.
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) requires each federal agency to evaluate the potential
effects of actions it may take in a floodplain to avoid adverse impacts wherever possible, to
ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management, including restoring and preserving such land areas as natural
undeveloped floodplains, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures
of this EO.
The action alternative has been evaluated for its potential effects to floodplains in the project
area (see previous analysis). Design and mitigation measures have been developed to reduce
short-term impacts to floodplains (Chapter 2).
Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands)
EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires federal agencies to take action to avoid adversely
impacting wetlands wherever possible, to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values
of wetlands, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO.

The action alternative has been evaluated for its potential effects to wetlands in the project area
(see previous analysis). Design and mitigation measures have been developed to avoid adversely
impacting wetlands wherever possible, or to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the
values of wetlands (Chapter 2).
Alternative 2 is expected to impact 30.6 acres of the existing 52.5 acres of wetlands during
construction, and create 42 acres of wetlands. Following implementation, the expected wetland
area would be 64.1 acres, which would be a total net gain of 11.6 acres of wetlands in the
long term.
The Forest would apply for a joint Clean Water Act Section 404 – Stream Alteration Permit and
apply actions or monitoring as required.
Idaho Forest Practices Act
The Idaho Forest Practices Act regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest
practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01).
The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. The Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho
Forest Practices Act.
Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act
The Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act regulates stream channel alterations between mean
and high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho (IDAPA 37.03.07). Instream activities on
NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Act. The rules are also incorporated as
BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be
consistent with the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act. The Forest would apply for a Joint
Stream Alteration permit with the State of Idaho.

Cultural Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section describes the potential effects to known cultural resources that are eligible, or
potentially eligible, for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a result of
implementing the proposed action. These two categories of sites, by law, require management
protection or mitigation and are hereinafter referred to as historic properties. Cultural properties
include things and places that demonstrate evidence of human occupation or activity related to
history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture. Historic properties, as defined by 36
CFR 800, the implementing regulations of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA; 16
USC 470 et seq.), are a subset of cultural properties that consists of any district, site, building,
structure, artifact, ruin, object, work of art, or natural feature important in human history that
meets defined eligibility criteria for the NRHP.
The types of historic properties on the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests are varied and
reflect the type of use, and pattern of use, humans have employed across what is now the Forests
for thousands of years. Locally, historic properties may include, but are not limited to,
archaeological sites, historic buildings and structures, trails, wagon roads, bridges, mining
features, rock art, cairns, traditional cultural properties, historic landscapes, communication lines,
historic trash middens, and backcountry airstrips. Historic properties are by nature nonrenewable, and are generally unable to recover from adverse effects.
The geographic and social scope of the analysis for cultural properties is the area of potential
effects (APE). The APE “means the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may
directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties, if any such
properties exist. The area of potential effects is influenced by the scale and nature of an
undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”
(36 CFR 800.16(d)) In this section, APE is also referred to as project area.
Area of Potential Effects
The APE is the lower approximate 2 miles of the Crooked River Valley bottom.
Cumulative Effects Area
The cumulative effects area is the same as the APE.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
The project area (except for extremely steep slopes) was methodologically surveyed utilizing
15-meter-wide, pedestrian transects (or less) (Desert West Environmental 2013).
Per 36 CFR 60.4, in order for cultural properties to be eligible for (or remain eligible for)
inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places they must retain integrity and meet one of
four evaluation criteria:

Would characteristics that qualify historic properties for the National Register of Historic
Places be adversely affected (irretrievably lost)? (Yes/No)

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Gold was discovered near present day Elk City, Idaho, in 1861. Miners immediately dispersed
into the surrounding mountains and developed claims. These workings resulted in tens of
thousands of mining features being located across the greater Red River Ranger District (and
beyond). Successive waves, “booms,” and mining strikes resulted in the construction of
additional features or the reworking of previously existing mining features. Today, the remains
of these activities can be seen in the form of stamp mills, ditches, prospects, adits, hand-placer
piles, dredge piles, habitation features, structures, can-dumps, trails, roads, and resulting artifact
scatters. The Crooked River Valley possesses all of these site types. Perhaps best known of
these features are the dredge piles along the Crooked River. They are considered one of the best
examples of dredge mining technology remaining in central Idaho.
Recreation along the Crooked River has also been a popular past-time for decades. This activity
has resulted in the construction of formal campgrounds, dispersed campsite development, and
related archaeological components.
Affected Environment
Four cultural properties are found within the project area, with characteristics spanning a wide
range throughout the National Register integrity/evaluation criteria continuum (see Table 3-31).
One of these properties (site SHC-32) is considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. As a
historic property, under 36 CFR 800.16(l)(1), the federal agencies must consult with interested
parties to identify ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effects of a federal
undertaking under NHPA.

No historic properties associated with American Indian use and settlement of the landscape exist within the project areas. This
does not reflect a lack of historical presence by American Indians such as the Nez Perce Tribe. Rather, the sites associated
with this use have likely been masked or otherwise removed by historic mining activity prevalent throughout the greater
project areas.
Meets definition of historic property, defined in 36 CFR 800.16(l)(1).

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would have no impact on one historic property (site SHC-32) of the
project area.
Alternative 2 would remove the dredge tailings (site SHC-32) along 2 miles of the lower
Crooked River. These tailings are perhaps the best example of bucket-line dredge mining
technology found in central Idaho and therefore are an important historical resource. The
tailings resulted from extensive dredging operations conducted by the H&H Mining Company,
which operated a Yuba-manufactured dredge (locally referred to as the Mount Vernon dredge)
along the lower Crooked River from 1938–1942. The dredge piles of the lower 2 miles are
morphologically distinct. Their U-shaped pattern reflects the technology employed by bucketline dredges, which pivot around a central anchor-spud. The resulting architecture of the dredge
piles is directly reflective of this unique mining technology. These historical features are
important to not only understanding a given mining technology and its associated engineering,
but also reflect and convey business histories, commerce and trade, and regional/local
economics. The historic features are also related to larger world events. The H&H Mining
Company was forced to cease operations on the Crooked River by order of the War Production
Board in 1942. Gold mining was declared non-essential to the war effort and its labor force
dispersed to other industries deemed more important in defeating the Axis Powers of World
War II.
Alternative 2 would adversely (irretrievably) affect the National Register characteristics of site
SHC-32 (see Table 3-32). Mitigation would thus be required to ameliorate this adverse effect
(36 CFR 800.6(a)), as described below (see Chapter 2 for a full list of design and mitigation
measures). A Forest Plan amendment would also be needed to allow this adverse effect to occur
to the historic property (see Appendix D).

Meets definition of historic property, defined in 36 CFR 800.16(l)(1).

To mitigate for the irretrievable effect to site SHC-32, the following design and mitigation
measures would be employed:
•

•

•

•

•

Thoroughly photograph, document, and map historic dredge piles that are proposed for
removal (design and mitigation measure 42). This would create a formal record of the
historic property such that it can be studied and measured, thus ensuring the resource’s
ability to convey information related to dredge mining once the resource is removed.
Retain a representative sample of dredge piles for public interpretation (design and
mitigation measure 39). Retention of a small portion of the dredge piles ensures that the
visiting public can interact with the actual resource and tangibly understand their form
and function through a first-person experience.
Construct a three-panel educational kiosk in the Meanders to inform the public of the
history of the Crooked River Valley (design and mitigation measure 40). This would
educate the public as to the greater historical context associated with dredge mining along
the Crooked River.
Record the historic Gnome village (design and mitigation measure 43). This is offsite
mitigation meant to enhance a resource that would not be affected by the project, but is
nonetheless languishing along the Crooked River. The Gnome village site is a
Depression-era hamlet built to support the Gnome Mine, which operated from about
1932–1937. The village is structurally in poor shape and its formal recording is crucial to
understanding the architecture and function of this “company-town.” Enhancement of
the Gnome village would help mitigate impacts of the project on the dredge piles because
the two resources share a similar historical theme, timeframe, and geographic scope.
Perform a social business history related to the economic contribution historic dredge
mining operations made to the local central Idaho economy (design and mitigation
measure 44). This would promote understanding of the economic value of historic
mining activities to local rural economies such as Elk City, Idaho.

Cumulative Effects

Historic properties of the greater project areas date to perhaps 1861, but many of these older sites
have been destroyed by subsequent mining activity. The last temporally significant wave of
mining within the Crooked River Valley occurred during the Great Depression. Thus, many of
the sites date from as recent as the 1930s.
The timeframe for determination of cumulative effects is circa 1938 to hundreds of years into
the future.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Past Actions

Historic mining activity has greatly altered the landscape. Evidence of American Indian use of
the landscape along with early mining features have nearly all been removed/altered by
subsequent mining actions. Recreation activity and all-terrain vehicle use has deflated
(flattened) dredge piles. Use of the dredge pile gravels for road maintenance activity has also
altered this historic landscape. Additionally, artifact collecting has removed vast amounts of
scientific data from historic mining sites. Natural events have also affected the historic
landscape. Wildland fire has burned historic properties within the greater project area, periodic
flooding and its associated erosion has affected streamside sites, and wind-throw events have
displaced historic features and artifacts as root wads were upended.
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would retain one historic property (site SHC-32) of the project area and it would
continue to exist in its current form. These dredge tailings could persist for hundreds of years.
Some deflation could occur as recreationists climb/drive over the dredge piles. Soil would
slowly build upon them, supporting a larger amount of vegetation and thus somewhat masking
their extent, form and outline. Wind-throw events could slowly displace dredge piles as root
wads are upended, deforming the once recognizable and morphologically distinct features.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 would have direct and indirect adverse effects to one historic property (site
SHC-32). This alternative would immediately and irretrievably remove virtually the entirety of
the historic property (SHC-32) from the landscape, which is the best example of bucket-line
dredge mining technology found in central Idaho. This action would adversely (irretrievably)
affect the National Register characteristics of site SHC-32; however, the application of design
and mitigation measures 39, 40, 42, 43, and 44 would ameliorate this adverse effect (36 CFR
800.16(a)) and therefore would have no cumulative effect.
Ongoing and Foreseeable Future Actions

Ongoing and foreseeable future actions include recreation, vandalism, artifact collecting,
wildland fire events, fire suppression actions, and natural decay. Within the project area, the
proposed Orogrande Community Protection project would have no adverse effect on historic
properties, and therefore would have no cumulative effect.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The Idaho State Historic Preservation Officer has concurred with the suitability and merit of the
mitigation measures proposed for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. For
additional details on the effectiveness of these measures, see Direct and Indirect Effects (above).

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with the Forest Plan’s forestwide and management area standards for
cultural resources (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-22 and II-23), except for protection of
historic property #SHC-32. A Forest Plan amendment is proposed under the 2012 Planning Rule
for Forestwide Standards #2 and 4 and Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource Standard #4
(see Appendix D). Full details on consistency with the Forest Plan are located in the project
record.
All landforms having a high probability for historic property locations would be surveyed for the
presence of cultural resources. No American Indian related sites are known to be located within
the project area. No American Indian related sites are known to be located within the project
area. Government-to-Government and staff-to-staff consultation has occurred with the Nez
Perce Tribe. All cultural properties within the APE would be evaluated for their National
Register eligibility. All landforms having a high probability for historic property locations
would be surveyed for the presence of cultural resources and would have their conditions
documented. Measures meant to recover significant values of site SHC-32 are described above
in Direct and Indirect Effects.
Other Laws and Regulations
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (16 USC 470; as amended) requires
federal agencies to take into account their actions on historic properties. The required regulatory
review of effects resulting from federal undertakings is found in Section 106 of the Act, and has
been codified in 36 CFR 800 Part B. The mitigation proposed for site SHC-32 meets the intent
of the NHPA when the Idaho Historic Preservation Officer concurs on the proposed
mitigation package.

Scope of Analysis
This analysis documents current conditions within the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project, identifies soil limitations for the Meanders floodplain restoration, and how the project
addresses these limitations.
Spatial and Temporal Analysis Bound
The analysis area includes the footprint of the restoration project to evaluate direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects, approximately 115 acres.
The timeframe used to consider effects from past activities is the past century, during which
mining and road construction created the need for the current project. Future projects that were
evaluated that could impact this project success were within the next 10 years.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Data and analysis were taken from the Design Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a), technical drawings (RDG et al. 2013b), Mining Claim
Inventory: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG 2012), Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012),
engineering specifications sheets (Great West Engineering 2013), and South Fork Clearwater
River Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998).
A concurrent study on soil impacts from the Orogrande Community Protection project located
upstream from the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project provided information on
existing condition.
Current conditions and potential soil interpretations within the Crooked River Valley project area
were verified during a field visit in spring 2013. Digital information was used from Nez Perce
corporate GIS data layers, including: transportation, streams, terrestrial ecosystem unit (now
SSURGO ID609), watersheds, and project-generated digital information from River Design
Group. Terrain calculations were derived from LiDAR and 10-meter digital elevation models.
The Forest Plan directs to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion when conducting
management activities (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-5). The regional guidelines further
clarify that soil productivity is maintained where lands managed are part of the productive
landbase (USDA Forest Service 1999a, p. 3). Roads and infrastructure such as campgrounds and
administrative structures have designated uses other than for vegetation purposes.
The intent of the project is to restore the floodplain from a disturbed, non-natural state to a
functional valley bottom. The structure and function of the valley bottom would be improved to

support a natural soil and vegetation environment. The main concerns are the interim
disturbance created by restoration earth-moving activities and the net improvement in soil
productivity at the project conclusion.
The proposed action may change soil properties for hydrologic and biologic function. The
indicators below are used to show the effects from the project and interpret long-term recovery
trends:
A. Improved soil and plant habitat: Percentage of the project area that has improved plant
and soil habitat across project area using factors of plant community composition.
Improvements to soil physical, chemical, and biological function will be qualitatively
discussed.
B. Detrimental soil disturbance (acres or percentage).
C. Forest Plan Amendment (Yes/No).
Indicator A: Improved soil and plant habitat
This indicator shows the changes to soil and plant environment from the restoration project.
Terminology in the Forest Service guidance documents refer to no net loss in productivity
(USDA Forest Service 1987a, USDA Forest Service 1999a). Production itself measures annual
yield or the amount of carbon fixed per annum (Grier et al. 1989). However, the restoration
action’s objective is to re-establish a dynamic system in which the plant and soil associations
depend on the proximity to the river. Frequently flooded areas have shallow soils from annual
scouring by water. In contrast, elevated riverine terraces have only periodic flooding at 2- to
50-year frequencies, depending on height and proximity to river. The time between flooding
events on these terraces allows for vertical soil development and a wider suite of plant and
soil communities.
For the purposes of this project, productivity in the strictest sense as yield does not represent a
good measure of success; frequently flooded areas are natural but have poor production per
square unit area when compared to elevated river terraces. Thus, the merits of the project will be
evaluated based on the extent to which the project develops the site into a natural floodplain
environment. Factors of desired geomorphic surfaces and the improved soil physical, chemical,
and biological components will be evaluated. Since soil and vegetation communities are
coupled, the desired plant groups will be used as an indicator to compare to existing groups.
Indicator B: Detrimental soil disturbance
Soil standards in the Nez Perce Forest Plan specify management to maintain a minimum of
80 percent of an activity in a non-detrimental condition (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-22).
These standards address impairments by land management activities such as timber harvest using
measures of the extent and degree of disturbance. Detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) is a
standard measure used to evaluate the impact of these management actions whereby long-term
reductions in soil productivity could occur. Detrimental disturbance is defined by indications of

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

3-104

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

erosion, compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, loss of organic matter, and soil mass
movement. Management actions on the Nez Perce National Forest (NPNF) must comply with
the Forest Plan standards; thus, this analysis documents the amount of detrimental disturbance
resulting from the restoration activities. The NPNF standards apply to the Meanders project
since this is part of the productive landbase. These standards do not apply to the Narrows Road
project since the road prism has an administrative purpose and therefore is not part of the
productive landbase.
Indicator C: Forest Plan Amendment
Indicator C evaluates the need to amend the Nez Perce Forest Plan. An amendment is proposed
that would exempt the Crooked River Rehabilitation project from the Forest Plan’s Soil Standard
#2. The goal of the Forest Plan is establish standards to comply with the National Forest
Management Act and the Multiple Use Act. Soil Standard #2 prevents permanent impairment to
productivity by limiting the amount of detrimental disturbance from management actions.
However, the standard does not provide for activities intended to restore productivity on areas
that were degraded by prior historical activities such as mining. The Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project intends to restore the floodplain and, thus, improve productivity.
Additional analysis is provided in Appendix D.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Physical Setting
The project is planned along the valley bottom of a deep set canyon. The sideslopes have steep
pitches of 50% to 70% slopes formed by metasediment bedrock. Colluvium forms thin mantles
over the bedrock on steep slopes and collects in draws and concavities, but overall slopes have
bedrock close to the surface. Warm aspects and areas of recent failure expose these bedrock
surfaces. Soil and vegetation development is highest where slope material accumulates on cool
aspects that have abundant water and may also contain remnant loess from volcanic ash
deposition.
The underlying geology structurally controls the slope topography and sets up the steep slope
pitches. The metasediments exposed on canyon are biotite schist and gneiss of the Elk City
metamorphic sequence that were most recently uplifted from the Idaho batholith pluton (75 to
100 Ma) (Lewis et al. 1990). These metasediments form a cap over the batholith which lies just
below the valley bottom surface of the Crooked River. A 285-foot-deep well drilled to sample
groundwater at the mouth of the Crooked River penetrated mostly granite bedrock from the
Idaho batholith (Mann and Lindern 1988). Thus, the Meanders section of Crooked River
overlies an impermeable bedrock surface that resists downcutting – at least in the near term of
thousands of years.
The geologic uplift is important since this started the sequence of canyon development which
frames the larger context of how and when material from the sideslopes erodes into the valley

bottom. The uplift and subsequent downcutting by the stream set up very steep slopes that
contribute sediment in only rare events of mass wasting.
Over millennia, faults formed by the geologic uplift get exploited by streams and thus advance
the development of canyons. The degree of strata movement is extensive, as evidenced by
upturned metasediments and the density of faults. The Meanders and Orogrande valley segments
of the Crooked River both follow north-to-northeast-trending faults. However, the Narrows
section of road has an eastern trend where the river “jogs” from a northeastern fault to a more
direct north-trend fault. This east orientation runs counter to the regional fault trend, which
might explain why the Narrows has exceptionally steep canyon slopes and narrow canyon width
when compared to the upstream and downstream segments.
The geomorphic sequence that contributes to valley fill is a result of rare climatic events. At
least in the recent 10,000 years, the evidence for natural erosion is rare outside of pulse climate
events that trigger debris flows (Kirchner et al. 2001). In the Crooked River setting, canyons and
particularly side draws, contribute sediment pulses from debris flows where upslopes experience
large-scale losses to vegetation from wildfire succeeded by major storm events (Meyer et al.
2001, Wondzell and King 2003). In the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests area, storms
and/or the sequence of storms that produce the level of saturation needed to start debris flows
appear to occur every 20 to 30 years, with substantial events occurring in 1945, 1975, and 1996
(McClelland et al. 1997). In the Lolo Creek area, there is evidence suggesting that a very large
storm event produced substantial floodplain deposits following the 1910-era wildfires based on
peak flow events in 1912 and examination of streamside terraces.
The debris flow deposits are redistributed along the valley bottom and integrated into the
floodplain by seasonal flooding. The factors of sediment size and texture, access to year-long
water, and annual exposure to floodwaters dictate the distribution of plants and soil communities.
Stable uplands outside the influence of Crooked River have conifer communities that grade
down in elevation to sedge and riparian shrub communities along the primary floodplain.
Mining activity
One of the primary needs for the project is to correct the arrangement of the valley bottom fill to
accommodate a natural flooding and deposition regime. The valley bottom was altered by
historic placer mining that took place from the 1930s through the 1950s (USDA Forest Service
1998 and 2005). Mining activities sifted the valley bottom material, releasing fines and leaving
rubble piles behind a dredge. Gold and silver mining affected 6 miles of the river across
200 acres (RDG 2012). The coarse cobble-sized dredge piles reach over 30 feet above the
primary floodplain, which no longer functions as a natural alluvial floodplain (RDG et al. 2012).
Despite the yearly high flow volumes, the dredge pilings have remained in situ except for a
1980s rehabilitation project that improved the channel connectivity to the dredge ponds.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Mine tailing have potential issues with soil and water contamination from heavy metals and
arsenic. In preparation for the 1980s channel rehabilitation work, the Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality commissioned several investigations to monitor dissolved and total metal
content and perform bioassays using 1-year-old steelhead and Chinook salmon (Baldigo 1986,
Mann and Von Lindern 1988). Testing took place in ponds and channel sections distributed
throughout the proposed Meanders project area to establish existing conditions. In addition, a
pilot project analyzed the metal content in response to moving the tailings.
For the existing conditions, the studies found that water samples had metal contents within
expected ranges using reference data from Red River, the American River, Deadwood Creek,
and Newsome Creek and comparing to EPA 95% thresholds. The metal contents in sediment
samples were also below the EPA’s established 95% threshold values.
Results from the pilot study found that moving the tailings produced short-term iron levels over
the 95% threshold for total iron but not for dissolved iron. The hazard was considered low since
total iron is bioavailable and the effect was short term.
Meanders soil and plant habitat
The Crooked River Enhancement Project in the 1980s increased the connectivity of the channel
to ponds and introduced riparian vegetation where possible. However, the floodplain remains
vastly departed both functionally and structurally for a typical alluvial valley form for this
setting. The Design Criteria Report (RDG et al. 2012) outlines how the current tailing piles do
not accommodate the various flows that refresh floodplains nutrients and sediment. The report
lists the limiting factors as (1) lack of floodplain connectivity, (2) the tailings create a
preponderance of coarse, well-drained substrates, (3) widespread distribution of reed canary
grass, (4) heavy browse and herbivory that selects for certain vegetation success, and
(5) recreation impacts that damage vegetation and introduce weeds (RDG 2012, p. 24).
The lack of a widespread floodplain has hindered the re-establishment of the desired species
since the valley bottom does not have the array of wetlands and terraces. The coarse cobble and
rock-sized tailings create a difficult growing medium for forb, grass, and shrub species with
insufficient water holding capacity. Likewise, the droughty conditions hinder soil development.
In a natural environment, the connection with seasonal flooding provides fine sediments that
bootstrap riparian growth with propagules, seeds, organic matter. The sediment amends soil
physical function by increasing water holding capacity and provides a substrate for seedlings to
take hold. Most of the current valley bottom remains outside the influence of seasonal flooding,
which explains why 70 years after mining disturbance the major vegetation form remains
upland conifer.
Indicator A: Improved soil and plant habitat

River Design Group et al. (2012) inventoried project vegetation and grouped the vegetation into
categories. Table 3-33 shows the distribution of vegetation forms. The columns display the

relative amount of desired vegetation groups across the area for the existing condition and the
action alternative (Alternative 2). The direct actions of the project would establish the functional
characteristics needed to return the site towards what is expected. The Meanders would need
several years of regrowth and an influx of sediment and seed source to fully reach the desired
conditions. Figure 3-25 displays a floodplain segment to illustrate the difference in the array of
vegetation between the existing and the desired conditions.

Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would not improve the current soil and plant habitat since the
Meanders does not have a functioning valley bottom.
Alternative 2 would meet the purpose and need by restoring the geomorphology of the valley
bottom to grow and redevelop into the desired diversity of plant and soil habitat.
Vegetation relies on physical, biological, and chemical soil properties for growth. Alternative 2
lays the foundation to rebuild these soil functional properties. The alternative would overcome
the current limitations for plants, including poor access to water and nutrients from floodflows,
poor water holding capacity, and insufficient growth substrate in the tailings.
Geomorphic forms

The action alternative (Alternative 2) would use three geomorphic forms to rebuild the valley
bottom that consist of a primary floodplain, upland floodplain, and upland. The streamflow
disturbance interval for these forms corresponds to flooding at 1.5 years (Q1.5), 25 years (Q25),
and 500 years (Q500). See Glossary for description of terms related to streamflow return interval
(Q). Table 3-34 outlines the type and general extent of the geomorphic forms compared to the
current extent.

The primary floodplain would have similar soil physical properties to the current floodplain, but
the areal extent would expand substantially from 27.6 to 43.1 acres (see Figure 3-25). Soils are
coarse grained with layers of silt, sand, gravel, cobble, and rock from riverwash. Soil drainage is
well drained to excessively well drained, but with shallow access to the water table and localized
saturated conditions. The wider low-elevation floodplain would also increase lateral flow from
the channel.
Soil chemical and biological properties on the primary floodplain would advance as yearly
flooding deposits nutrients and sediments and alder establishes. Alder is a nitrogen-fixing
species well suited for this primary successional environment.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Uplands floodplain habitat represents a small portion of the project area at only 2.5 acres. Soils
on the upland floodplain would experience infrequent flooding and develop shallow and
moderate depths to support a wide array of grass, forb, shrub, and trees. The soil physical
properties would be restored by limiting elevations to less than 4 feet above the river bankfull
elevation. This low elevation ensures access to the water table by mesic (water loving) shrubs
and trees. The soils would be amended with a wood chips and organic material to increase water
holding capacity since seasonal moisture deficits in the topsoil could occur. The biological and
chemical soil properties of the upland floodplain would develop incrementally over time as the
plants and soil colonize the site.
The uplands would be retained where possible since restoring soils in these environments takes
much longer than on the areas near water. The uplands rarely experience flooding and thus have
an inherently stable environment where soils develop vertically, in situ, over long periods of
time. As Table 3-34 shows, Alternative 2 would result in a net decrease in uplands from
15.6 acres to 13.8 acres. Construction would excavate tailings on the east side, but would leave
the west side river bank due to natural conditions. The biological and chemical properties of the
constructed uplands would develop incrementally as the plants and soil colonize the site.
One of the current limitations to vegetation is the lack of water and poor substrate for rooting.
The soil mix used in the upland floodplain and uplands bolsters water holding capacity with fine
sediment and organic matter. The soil medium relies on salvaged soil on site, mixed with finetextured fill, and organics from salvaged sod and vegetation residue. An estimated 17,346
cubic yards of soil would be salvaged and re-used on the project (RDG et al. 2013a, p. 75). The
soil medium would provide at least 12-inch topsoil depth and cover 50% of the area for the
upland floodplain and upland. Additional mulch using woody debris residue from the Orogrande
Community Protection project would be applied to the surface and mixed into the topsoil.
The project would advance the growth of soil and vegetation communities by bootstrapping the
site with sod that contains soil microbes for recolonization. The rooting zone is considered a
partnership among plants, soil microbes, and the soil substrate (Clapperton 2006). Plants rely on
soil microbes to access water and nutrients, while providing secretions and residues that
microbes use as a food source. An example is that all conifers have obligate relations with
ectomycorrhizae fungi to access nutrients (Horton et al. 1999). Within the upland and primary
floodplains, Alternative 2 would establish microsites that increase the diversity of soil and
vegetation habitat. Microsites include wetlands in addition to large aggregations of wood debris.
Functionally, the application increases the surface roughness to lend stability. The microsites
also provide unique habitat for wetland soils to develop and cool, moist areas for mesic soil and
plants. The swales trap seed and organic matter from passing flows and the coarse wood
provides shade that conserves moisture and stimulates overall soil development (RDG et al.
2013a, p. 68).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Large woody debris and wood chips would be distributed throughout the site and are considered
key elements for productivity (Harvey et al. 1987, Graham et al. 1994). These materials act as a
microsite and can provide biological recovery. Root crowns and roots are major foci for
microbial activity (Egerton-Warbuton 2005, Molina et al. 2011), and leaving green trees can
inoculate soils for regenerating seedlings.
Habitat diversity

Table 3-33 displays the current vegetation composition compared to the desired condition.
Figure 3-25 shows the contrast in diverse desired alder, shrub, and sedge communities to the
distribution of tailings that currently dominate the site. The greatest change from the action
alternative would be an alder increase from 1.8 to 51%. The amount of conifer would be halved
from current extent along with the intended replacement of mesic forb meadows and reed canary
grass/cattail communities with vegetation that is expected for this particular stream setting.
The reconstruction of the valley bottom would increase habitat diversity by providing for side
channels, alcoves, floodplain depressions, floodplain swales, side channel wetlands, and slope
wetlands (Figure 3-25). The provision for wetland communities would lead to a net gain in
palustrian shrub scrub from 1.7 to 34.3 acres (see Geum Environmental Consulting 2012).
Invasive species

The current conditions include abundant reed canary grass along the streams and within several
wetland areas. The action alternative avoids spreading reed canary grass by not using sod for
surface planting from infected areas. Following implementation, monitoring would be done to
detect invasive and noxious weeds, including reed canary grass. The weeds would be treated
using already approved measures (USDA Forest Service 1988a).
Weeds are a concern for the project since so much area is being returned to primary successional
conditions. Weeds are well suited for these disturbed conditions with opportunistic growth
strategies to quickly occupy sites where abundant sunlight, water, and nutrients are available
(James et al. 2010). Newly disturbed soils are characterized as having small periods of high
nutrient availability that favors forb or grass species that can grow quickly (Eviner and Firestone
2007). As the riparian and valley bottom establishes, the initial nutrient flush should decrease
and shade from overstory tree and shrub species would lessen the risk for weeds. Using the
estimate from River Design Group et al. (2013a) for alder regrowth on the floodplain, the risk
should be low after 10 years on the primary and upland floodplain. However, on the slowergrowth upland environments, the risk may extend longer.
Cumulative Effects

The action alternative would almost completely rework the valley bottom to rehabilitate past
conditions from mining dredge work. Trampling or compaction of soils may reduce
rehabilitation success adjacent to recreational sites. The project mitigates this potential impact
by designated staging sites in areas that are already compacted.

Indicator B: Detrimental soil disturbance
Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects

Alternative 1 would not result in any additional detrimental soil disturbance. The current River
Design Group estimate of the project area is 65 percent detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) based
on the need for restoration. The current conditions have persistent infertile growing conditions
of the tailings and lack the expected plant and soil habitat. The estimate is derived from the
comparison of the project area (115 acres) versus the amount of area that needs restoration
(74.8 acres).
Alternative 2. The Meanders is managed as part of the productive landbase and thus was
evaluated for long-term impact to productivity using Nez Perce Forest Plan standards.
Substantial earthwork is needed to excavate and transport the tailings into a valley form that
functions properly in order to restore the valley bottom. Approximately 65 percent of the project
area would be impacted by construction equipment. Figure 3-26 illustrates the elevation changes
needed to reconstruct the geomorphic forms for a river section. The red coloration indicates
excavation while the blue coloration shows the degree of fill needed. Much of the red
corresponds to tailings piles. The complete displacement, translocation, and re-dispersal qualify
as DSD using Nez Perce Forest Plan standards (USDA Forest Service 1987a) and Region 1 Soil
Quality Guidelines (USDA Forest Service 1999a).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The application of the Nez Perce Forest Plan standards requires an assessment of the extent of
DSD across a project area compared to the 20 percent threshold value where long-term
productivity could occur. The existing condition is 65 percent and, thus, conducting
management activities would exceed the 20 percent threshold in the Forest Plan’s Standard #2.
However, management activities would meet Region 1 Soil Quality Guidelines.
The disparity between the NPNF and the Region 1 Soil Quality Guidelines is the ability to
restore productivity on severely impaired soils. The Regional guidelines state:
In areas where more than 15 percent detrimental soil conditions exist from prior
activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from project implementation and
restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and
should move toward a net improvement in soil quality. (USDA 1999, p. 2)
The restoration actions would lead to a net improvement for soil productivity by reducing the
level of DSD to levels below the existing conditions in the first year after implementation.
Table 3-35 shows the gradual soil recovery over time, depending on plant group and location. In
the first-year recovery, the site would move from the current condition of 65 percent to
48 percent DSD with channel restoration and the bare fluvial soils put in place. Soils would
recover physical function very quickly for all geomorphic forms. Chemical and biological soil
functions would recover most quickly in the floodplain habitat where adequate water promotes
the accrual of organic matter. In the uplands, lack of water and slower growth would create a
longer term for recovery.
River Design Group et al. (2013a, p. 28) estimated alder stands would establish within 10 years
on the primary floodplain, and the upland spruce and conifer groups would take 20 years. By
10 years the DSD would be down to 13 percent with alder securing the primary floodplain and
incremental soil development on the uplands. At 20 years, the DSD would be at 4 percent as the
upland recovery continues.

Indicator C: Forest Plan Amendment
Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects

Alternative 1 would retain the existing Nez Perce Forest Plan standards. No amendment to the
Forest Plan is proposed.
Alternative 2 proposes an amendment to the Nez Perce Forest Plan to address restoration actions
(see Appendix D for details). The main purpose for the amendment is to enable active
restoration actions. The amendment would exempt the Crooked River Rehabilitation project
from Forest Plan – Soil Standard #2. The goals of the Nez Perce Forest Plan soil standards are to
prevent substantial and permanent impairment to productivity. Soil Standard #2 controls against
management activities further degrading a site. However, the standard does not provide for
restoration of productivity for severely degraded soils. The exemption of Standard #2 would
allow for the restoration activities to improve soil productivity from 65 percent DSD currently to
48 percent in the first year after implementation and 4 percent in 20 years.
Other Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects – Flooding Risk

No adverse cumulative effects were identified for the action alternative or for the potential
Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. The road would continue to receive use as a
main thoroughfare or reduced traffic trail. The future Crooked River Narrows Road
Improvement project could reduce flooding risk over time.
Cumulative Effects – Mass Movement

No past or ongoing activities would increase mass movement along the Narrows for the action
alternative or for the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. Ongoing
activities of road repair and maintenance are administrative and occur within the current road
prism. The road was initially constructed in the late 1800s. Although frequent washouts have
occurred, no evidence of hillslope failure triggered from the road construction activities or
placement was found.
Planned prescribed burning as part of the Orogrande Community Protection project poses a risk
to the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project since the burning can result
in loss of groundcover. The burning could occur within the next 5 to 10 years depending on
suitable burn windows. The effect would be from slope cutting and thus after the Narrows work
is complete. The potential risk is low since the Orogrande project would prescribe burn at low
intensity. The burning takes place on the west-facing slopes along 2.5 miles of the Narrows
(milepost 3.5 to 6.0). The project specifically addresses mass wasting risk by avoiding
concentrated burning in large expanse concave draws, high-intensity burning that removes all
groundcover. A mosaic burn pattern is planned that would moderate potential runoff effects.
The five roadcuts for road widening after milepost 4.0 have planned prescribed burning on the
hillslopes above. The road cut with high risk for cutslope failure is outside the burn areas.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The following design and mitigation measures are to be implemented for the action alternative
(Alternative 2) for the project. The measures are specified in full in Chapter 2, Design and
Mitigation Measures.
Erosion Control
The following design and mitigation measures related to erosion control are to be implemented
for Alternative 2: #1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 19, 25, 26, 46, and 49.
The erosion control plan ensures coordination between the Forest Service and contractor to
reduce offsite sediment and erosion. This is BMP CP 15.03 in the Region 1 and 4 Soil
Conservation Handbook (USDA Forest Service 1988b), which was adopted to comply with the
Clean Water Act (also see BMP Fac-2 and AqEco-2 in the Forest Service National Core BMPs
[USDA Forest Service 2012]). Newly constructed or disturbed surfaces have surface runoff as
the dominant erosion mechanism for this scale of activity (Lane et al. 1997). Runoff is reduced
by dispersing runoff with groundcover and shaping the surface, and by preserving the soil’s
capacity to take in precipitation.
Design and mitigation measures 9 and 13 rely on groundcover as a means to reduce erosion. The
measures tier to BMPs CP 11.03, 13.01, and 13.04 (USDA Forest Service 1988b) and National
Core BMPs Fac-2, Fac-10, Road-3, Road-6, and Veg-2 (USDA Forest Service 2012).
Groundcover is commonly used to reduce erosion for road bases and reclaimed soil areas. The
effectiveness depends on the slope and infiltration capacity of the soil. For roadsides where fill
provides poor infiltration, grasses disperse runoff but the infiltration capacity remains reduced.
However, rock and organic mulch both protect the surface and reduce the generation of overland
flow. The Water Erosion Prediction Project models illustrate the effectiveness with percent rock
and vegetation as primary inputs (Elliot et al. 1999). An annual rye is used since this this grass
grows quickly and binds soil with roots. The vegetation reduces the incidence for rill forming by
minimizing the expanse of bare soil that can generate runoff. Measure 10 increases efficiency by
emphasizing use onsite materials. Measure 26 indirectly bolsters erosion control since weeds
tend to be single-stemmed forbs that do not create as effective groundcover as grasses (Lacey et
al. 1989).
Measures 13, 46, and 49 effectively reduce erosion by avoiding compaction and rutting that can
occur when machines operate in saturated conditions. Soil strength decreases substantially
during wet saturated conditions and operation (NCASI 2004). Saturated conditions increase
runoff incidence since soils lack capacity to take in precipitation.
Measure 10 shapes the constructed surfaces to reduce rill and gully formation from concentrated
water flow. The effectiveness is proven as a core design concept for constructing road surfaces
to shed water.

Mitigation measures #46 and 49 serve as an operational control to minimize deleterious effects
of equipment.
Site Rehabilitation
The following design and mitigation measures related to site rehabilitation are to be implemented
for Alternative 2: #3, 17-19, 25, 26, 28, and 33.
The reclamation relies on local soil and plant material to ensure regrowth success (#18). Local
plants and soils have adapted to the local climate conditions. Measure 17-18 increases the site
capacity to support desired vegetation, as demonstrated by local road decommissioning
monitoring and research (Conners 2003, Lloyd et al. 2013). However, the disturbed conditions
favor establishment of noxious weeds that would compete with and exclude desired vegetation.
The exclusion of opportunistic weed species is critical to allow for desired vegetation to take
hold. Measures 25, 26, 28, and 33 select for desired plant species using a combination of
preventive and control measures. The effectiveness would depend greatly on the ability for
follow-up treatment. Mitigation measure #19 provides essential groundcover that adds organic
matter while retaining moisture for desired vegetation to take hold.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
This section describes the guidance for managing soils on the NPNF (USDA Forest Service
1987a). The action alternative would comply with the amended Nez Perce Forest Plan using the
determinations for detrimental soil disturbance. The project would lead to a net improvement in
detrimental soil condition and thus complies with Region 1 Soil Quality Guidelines (USDA
Forest Service 1999a). Full details on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located
in the project record.
The Washington, D.C., soil direction was used to clarify plant and soil function to address
productivity impacts (USDA Forest Service 2010a). The project intends to restore the floodplain
to a more natural state. Using vegetation and soil communities as an indicator, the greatest
improvement would be the expansion of a limited primary flood at 1.8 acres to 51 acres.
The project ultimately complies with the National Forest Management Act. The action
alternative would not produce substantial and permanent impairment of the productivity of the
land. Rather, the activities would lead to a net improvement of soil conditions in the short term
(1 year) and long term (20 years) after implementation.
The following lists how the action alternative meets the requirements of the Nez Perce Forest
Plan Standards, as proposed to be amended:
(1) Soil disturbance evaluation: The EIS displays the effects to soils for DSD.
(2) Soil disturbance thresholds: The project would comply with the Nez Perce Forest Plan
with the amendment to adopt the Region 1 Soil Quality Standards. The amendment
would enable the project to improve lands that currently impaired soil conditions beyond
20 percent DSD. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would comply with
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

3-117

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

the Region 1 Soil Guidelines by improving the site. The restoration would reduce DSD
from the existing 65 percent to 48 percent in year 1 and down to 4 percent by year 20.
(3) Effective groundcover: The project has design criteria that maintain sufficient ground
cover for the project to reduce erosion on the uplands and upland floodplain where stable
soils are desired. Roughly 60% areal cover is desired. The ground cover would be
obtained from planting and applying wood fiber mulch.
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The Nez Perce National Forest soil quality standards (Forest Plan II-22, USDA Forest Service
1987a) apply to lands in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area. The Forest Plan
directs the NPNF to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion through the application
of BMPs, careful riparian area management, use of fish/water quality drainage objectives, and
soil and water resource improvement projects (p. II-5).
The project would not meet Forest Plan soil quality standard #2, which says, “A minimum of
80 percent of an activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled upon
completion of activities….” Therefore, an amendment to the Forest Plan is proposed (see
Appendix D). Full details on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the
project record.
Region 1 Soil Direction
Regional direction is available from the Region 1 Forest Service Manual for Soil Management
(FSM 2500-99-1, USDA Forest Service 1999a), referred to as R1 Soil Quality Standards. The
analysis standards address basic elements for the soils resource: (1) soil productivity (including
soil loss, porosity, and organic matter), and (2) soil hydrologic function. The soil productivity
direction identifies a value of 15 percent detrimental soil disturbance as a guideline that indicates
potential impairment from project activities. Regional guidance for soil management provides
direction that agency activities should result in a net benefit to soil conditions when past
activities have left detrimental soil disturbance in excess of 15 percent areal extent (USDA
Forest Service 1999a). As noted above (Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws),
the project would comply with Region 1 soil direction.
Washington Office Soil Direction
New direction provided by the Washington Office Forest Service Manual (Chapter 2550, USDA
Forest Service 2010a) addresses impacts to soil function from management activities. Permanent
impairment is defined as detrimental changes in soil properties (physical, chemical, and
biological) that result in the loss of the inherent ecological capacity or hydrologic function of the
soil resource that lasts beyond a land management planning period. The current R1 Manual
direction for soil management centers on minimizing disturbance and limiting the extent of
detrimental soil disturbance from management activities (USDA 1999). Direction for
maintaining site productivity is implicit in the National Forest Management Act (1976), which
requires that management “will not produce substantial and permanent impairment of the

productivity of the land.” However, the newly released Washington Office manual (USDA
Forest Service 2010a) takes this beyond a protective role to an active role in recognition that
ecological processes are dynamic. The new manual provides soil management objectives to:
(1) Maintain or restore soil quality on National Forest System lands, and (2) Manage resource
uses and soil resources on National Forest System lands to sustain ecological processes and
function so that desired ecosystem services are provided in perpetuity. Soil quality indicators are
further defined to include factors that provide insight to inherent soil function.
Soil function extends to trees, shrubs, grass, and herb growth, as well as underground
productivity – all attributes of soil productivity (Figure 3-27).
As noted above (Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws), the project would
comply with Washington Office soil direction.

Figure 3-27. Soil quality indicator relationship to soil productivity (from 2020 WO
FSM Chap. 2550).
National Forest Management Act
The National Forest Management Act states, “…timber harvested from National Forest System
lands...only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.”
Forest plans will “insure…evaluation of the effects of each management system to the end that it
will not produce substantial and permanent impairment of the productivity of the land” [16 USC
1604(g)(3)(C) and 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i)]. As noted above (Consistency with Forest Plan and
Environmental Laws), the project would comply with the Act.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Wildlife Resources
Introduction
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project has the potential to affect wildlife species and
their habitats. This section provides an analysis of wildlife species potentially present in the
project area and the effects that proposed activities may have on them or their habitat. For the
purpose of this analysis, wildlife species include endangered, threatened, sensitive species, and
management indicator species.

Geographic Scope
Project Area
Direct and indirect effects were analyzed for the project area for the restoration and improvement
of 2.0 miles of the Crooked River Meanders.
Cumulative Effects Area
The area of consideration for cumulative effects includes lands associated with this project and
the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project:
•
•

Crooked River Meanders – 2.0 miles of stream and floodplain restoration and
improvement
Proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project – improvement of up to
4 miles of Road 233 or rerouting portions of Road 522 and decommissioning
approximately 3.5 miles of Road 233 to foot trail.

The rationale for the selection of these analysis areas is that the effects are site specific to areas
treated within the project area (as delineated in Chapter 2) and would not extend beyond the
boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area would likewise not affect the
resource within.
The cumulative effects boundary for elk is the Forest Plan elk habitat analysis units.

Methodology
Analysis of effects for terrestrial wildlife species was completed using comparisons of Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project-related effects relative to the most limiting habitat factors for
each species.
Wildlife observation databases were reviewed to establish the presence of wildlife species in the
project area. The primary reference for information on observations is Idaho Department of Fish
and Game (2010a). Additional information was provided by River Design Group et al. (2012
and 2013a) and Toweill (2011).

Table 3-36 displays each of the federally listed Threatened and Endangered species and Forest
Service Region 1 Sensitive Species that have the potential to occur on the Nez Perce National
Forest, as well as Nez Perce National Forest MIS. Wildlife species and/or their habitat were
evaluated for potential to be affected by the proposed project. Some species were eliminated
from further consideration based on range, lack of habitat, and/or lack of known occurrence in
the analysis area.
Wetlands have been delineated in the project area by Geum Environmental Consulting (2012).
Acres of wetland classifications were used to determine the amount of habitat available for the
western toad and moose (Cowardin et al. 1992).
Elk habitat effectiveness calculations were completed to determine existing elk habitat
conditions (Leege 1984 [same as USDA Forest Service 1987a, Appendix B]).
Direct and indirect effects are discussed for each species. Direct effects could result from road
and stream alteration. Indirect effects for some species may include the expansion of weeds.
Road improvements that are limited to the road prism would not have any direct or indirect
effects on any species of concern. Cumulative effects are the overall effects to species from past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects. Historically, such effects on individual
species were not measured or noted. However, the past effects on general habitat condition can
be qualified and matched to species dependent on a particular habitat.
Resource Indicators
The effect on species and their potential habitat, measured in acres, is the primary indicator used
in the analysis. For species without modeled habitat, a qualitative discussion of habitat
conditions and effects to such habitat is the indicator used in the analysis.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Past land management activities, most importantly mining and road construction, have
substantially affected the landscape in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream and
riparian function in the main stem of Crooked River (Appendix C). Fire suppression, mining,
road construction, and timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural processes in the
watershed. The area surrounding Crooked River was mined for mineral resources from the
1900s through the 1950s. Mining waste (also referred to as mine tailings) is concentrated in the
valley bottom, altering the physical condition of the stream system, restricting the natural
migration pattern of the stream and other changes in channel morphology (channel size, form,
and function), and impairing the recolonization of riparian vegetation and its function as a
natural buffer. Road 233 is within the floodplain of Crooked River for approximately 3 miles
through the “Narrows” and 1 additional mile to Relief Creek. The road often floods during high
water events, constricts the river, and contributes sediment to Crooked River. These alterations
have resulted in a reduced area of productive aquatic and terrestrial habitat.
Federally Listed Species
The U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) requires the Forest Service
to analyze threatened species for which there may be suitable habitat in a project area. In Idaho
County, the USFWS has indicated that there may be suitable habitat for Canada lynx (Lynx
canadensis) and wolverine (Gulo gulo).
The Canada lynx was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 2000.
The Nez Perce National Forest is recognized as secondary, unoccupied Canada lynx habitat and
none of the Nez Perce National Forest has been identified as critical habitat by the USFWS
(USDA Forest Service 2007a, p. 3-5; USDA Forest Service 2007b, pp. 7 and 29; USDA Forest
Service and USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). The project area is not within lynx habitat
and there are no verified sightings of lynx on the Nez Perce National Forest. There is one
incidental sighting of lynx within 3 miles of the project area. Activities associated with the
project would have “no effect” to lynx or their habitat. This species is not analyzed further in
this EIS.
The USFWS published a proposed rule for the North American wolverine on Monday, February
4, 2013, in the Federal Register (78 FR 23 2013). The proposed rule found that dispersed
recreational activities, infrastructure development, transportation corridors, and land
management activities do not pose a threat to wolverines. The land management activities in the
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project are not considered a threat to wolverine. With
regard to the proposed rule and the proposed federal action associated with the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project, the project is “not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of
the wolverine.” The threat to wolverine is loss of habitats with persistent snow cover as a result
of climate change and increasing temperatures. This species is not analyzed further in this EIS.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The project does not contain habitat (cottonwood galleries) for the yellow-billed cuckoo
(Coccyzus americanus), a candidate species; therefore, this species is not analyzed further in
this EIS.
Sensitive Species
The Northern Region Sensitive Species List, which contains those species identified as sensitive
by the Regional Forester, was last updated on February 2011 (USDA Forest Service 2011b).
This section considers those sensitive species (or their habitats) on the list that are known or
suspected to occur on the Nez Perce National Forest within the vicinity of the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area (Table 3-36).
Western Toad
Affected Environment

The analysis area for the western toad is the project area. Western toads use moist areas such as
streams, ponds, and lakes for breeding, foraging, and overwintering habitat. They prefer shallow
areas with mud bottoms and high-temperature areas, often in sites with vegetation present for
breeding. A wide variety of upland habitats are used during non-breeding times. Riparian areas
serve as migratory or dispersal corridors. Important upland habitat structure needed includes
down woody debris where individuals can access moist microhabitats during the hot daytime
summer hours to avoid desiccation.
There are three main types of habitat western toads use throughout the course of a year:
(1) breeding habitat, (2) summer or terrestrial non-breeding habitats, and (3) over-winter
hibernacula (Keinath and McGee 2005). Breeding habitat includes shallow water (<20 cm
[<8 in.]) at the edges of ponds, lakes, streams, river edges where water is pooled or very slow
moving, oxbow ponds, flooded meadows, beaver ponds, reservoirs and quarries, thermal pools
and ponds, and ephemeral pools. The water temperature at breeding sites typically ranges from
15–21°C (59–70°F) (Keinath and McGee 2005). In Montana, water temperatures for breeding
may be as low as 7.5°C, but usually more than 9°C (Montana Field Guide 2013). The active
period for western toads begins in April or May and extends to September or October (Montana
Field Guide 2013). The breeding period is from April to mid-July. Juvenile toads have been
observed in the project area in June in wetlands or wet areas near the ponds and Crooked River.
Summer habitats include a diversity of forested and non-forested wet and dry areas. Juvenile and
adult western toads use these summer habitats for foraging, shelter, resting, and dispersal. Toads
prey on anything smaller than they are and easy to catch (invertebrates and vertebrates).
Adults and young of the year use terrestrial habitats and wet areas near water as hibernacula.
They use burrows made by small mammals, dig burrows, or over-winter under debris piles (logs
and rocks).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

3-126

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Western toads are known to occur along Crooked River in the part of the project area known as
the Meanders (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012). There are approximately 53 acres of
wetland habitat and open water environments (ponds) available to the western toad as potential
breeding habitat (approximately 38 acres identified as breeding and 15 acres identified as nonbreeding habitat) (Table 3-37 and Figure 3-28). There are more than 40 permanent and seasonal
ponds that may provide breeding habitat for western toads; however, they have been observed
breeding in only one of the larger ponds. It is unknown why western toads are not seen breeding
in more of the ponds in the project area. It is also unknown if western toads use the main
channel of Crooked River for breeding. These ponds are not connected to each other, nor are
they connected to the stream, except for only one or two ponds. The rubble (tailing piles) left
from past mining and the stream edge provide marginal non-breeding habitat. Over-winter
habitat to burrow in may be currently limited due to the disturbed state of the stream and
floodplain, which consists of larger, loose cobble that does not provide suitable habitat for the
western toad.
Toads have been observed breeding in only one of the ponds within the Meanders (Geum
Environmental Consulting 2012, p. 31). Many of the shallow ponds dry up during the summer,
and tailing piles do not provide quality cover or overwinter habitat.
There is very little long-term monitoring data for western toad populations in Idaho. Species are
provided a status to show viability of populations. The status is ranged from 1 to 5 (1 being
critically impaired; 5 being secure) and G or S (G- global status and S- state status). The western
toad is apparently secure (G4/S4) across its range and in Idaho (Digital Atlas of Idaho 2012
[accessed August 7, 2013]; [G4/S3] NatureServe 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]). Declines in
abundance have been reported throughout the species’ range due to disease and parasites.
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. There would be no direct or indirect effects to western toads or their habitat. The
western toad would continue to occupy the area in the vicinity of the Meanders. It is determined
that there would be No Impact to western toads or their habitat with Alternative 1.
Alternative 2

There would be a reduction of 22 acres of breeding habitat (wetlands) available to western toads
after completion of this project within the Meanders (Table 3-38). More than 40 permanent and
seasonal ponds that may provide breeding habitat would be lost during the construction of the
temporary bypass channel and side channel, and rehabilitation/restoration of the floodplain.
These ponds are not connected to each other, nor to the stream except for only one or two ponds.
As part of the project design, a minimum of three ponds would be retained, including the ponds
where western toad breeding has been observed. In addition to the three retained ponds, swales
would be constructed in the floodplain and alcoves would be constructed along the stream and

side channels (Table 3-37). The swales or floodplain depressions might have the potential to
hold water for potential breeding sites (RDG et al. 2013b [see Appendix A, Figures A-3, A-4,
and A-5; and Wildlife specialist report – Appendix A]). The alcoves associated with the stream
and side channels provide slow backwater that could provide breeding areas. In addition, the
design to restore the main channel of Crooked River reduces the number of pools from what
currently exists. The plan is to reduce the pool:riffle ratio from 63:37 to 40:60 (see Aquatic
Resources section). This would also reduce the potential breeding sites available to western
toads in the main channel.

Alternative 2 would restore the stream channel and floodplain and would provide improved
foraging, non-breeding, and over-winter habitat as sediments accumulate and settle across the
valley floor (stream channel and floodplain). A more natural functioning stream channel and
connected floodplain would also allow for easier and safer travel of toads across the floodplain.
Approximately 60 acres of floodplain habitat would be improved by adding woody debris and
implementing the revegetation strategy, which would provide much needed cover and diversity
to the floodplain. This would reduce the incidence of toads drying out or mortality by predators
while traversing the area to and from breeding sites. Providing woody debris and restoring the
floodplain are expected to improve over-winter habitat, as well.
There is potential for western toad mortality (adults, egg masses, tadpoles, and juveniles) during
construction of the temporary bypass channel and dewatering/rechanneling of existing open
water ponded environments; construction of the side channel; construction of the temporary
bypass road; dewatering of the main Crooked River channel; dewatering of the temporary bypass
channel; regrading/reshaping the valley bottom, stream channel, and tailing piles; and equipment
traffic. Aquatic organism salvage operations are intended to reduce the loss/mortality of aquatic
organisms during construction and dewatering activities.
Activities associated with dewatering and constructing the temporary bypass channel and road
and side channel and dewatering the main Crooked River have greatest potential for mortality
and reduction in potential western toad breeding habitat. Aquatic organism salvage operations
would reduce mortality impacts during construction, watering, and dewatering activities. It is
assumed that aquatic organism salvage and construction would occur after July 1 and before
April 1. This would allow the western toads to complete their breeding cycle and tadpoles to
metamorphose and leave the water. Depending on the water temperature, breeding and egg

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

laying may be delayed because tadpoles may still be in the water and aquatic organism salvage
operations would capture and release tadpoles in appropriate wetted environments to finish the
metamorphosis process. Activities occurring between April 1 and July 1 would impede western
toad breeding activities, crush egg masses and tadpoles, and cause mortality of tadpoles,
juveniles, and adults. Any part of the breeding cycle that is not captured during aquatic organism
salvage operations would result in the desiccation of eggs, tadpoles, and metamorphosing
toadlets. Aquatic organism salvage operations; construction of the bypass channel and main
channel; regrading the floodplain; and watering of the bypass and main channel between April 1
and July 1 would result in mortality of current year’s egg masses and tadpoles and a loss of
western toad production for that year. There is also the potential to lose several years of western
toad production due to the loss of potential breeding sites associated with construction and
restoration activities as part of restoring the Crooked River Meanders.
Determination of effects for the western toad is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely
to cause trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under
Alternative 2.
Gray Wolf
Affected Environment

The analysis area for the gray wolf is the project area. Three aspects of wolf habitat were
reviewed: security of dens and rendezvous sites, prey base (elk), and security from human
disturbances and harm. The gray wolf occupies diverse habitats, from open meadows to heavily
forested stands. Wolves occupy broad territories and travel extensively in search of prey,
generally medium to large ungulates, especially elk. They are adaptable to human and land
management activity in general, but sensitive to disturbance at denning and rendezvous sites.
Wolves are known to inhabit the project area; however, there are no known den or rendezvous
sites in the project area.
The gray wolf has a global rank of G4/G5 (apparently secure) and an Idaho State ranking of S3
(vulnerable) (NatureServe 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]); S1 (critically imperiled) (Digital
Atlas of Idaho 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]).
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. Therefore, there would be no direct or indirect effects to gray wolves or their habitat.
It is determined that there would be No Impact to gray wolves or their habitat under
Alternative 1.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

3-130

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2

Gray wolves could be subject to noise disturbance effects under the action alternative
(Alternative 2). Short-term impacts would be limited to displacement of wolves from the project
area if individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Over time, revegetation of the floodplain along the Meanders area would improve habitat (cover
and forage) for prey species.
Determination of effects for the gray wolf is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to
cause trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under
Alternative 2.
Harlequin Duck
Affected Environment

This species is a Nez Perce National Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest
conservation need (IDFG 2005). Harlequin ducks use swift-flowing mountain streams on the
Forest (IDFG 2005). They feed on benthic macroinvertebrates and use 2nd-order or larger
streams containing reaches with an average gradient of 1–7%, riffle habitat, clear water, gravel to
boulder–sized substrate, and forested bank vegetation.
There have been sightings of harlequin duck along Crooked River in both the Meanders and
Narrows sections. There are approximately 13 acres of existing riverine habitat along Crooked
River that provides potential breeding and foraging habitat for harlequin ducks in the Meanders
area. The current habitat has been impacted by past mining, creating a non-functioning stream

The harlequin duck has a global rank of G4 (apparently secure) and an Idaho State ranking of
S1B (critically imperiled) (NatureServe 2013 [accessed July 29, 2013]; Digital Atlas of Idaho
2013 [accessed July 29, 2013]).
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. There would be no direct or indirect effects to harlequin ducks or their habitat. It is
determined that there would be No Impact to harlequin ducks or their habitat under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2

Direct effects include the potential to disturb or displace migrating harlequin ducks traveling
through the area to breeding sites during construction activities.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 would improve a total of 14 acres of riverine habitat, thus improving potential
breeding and foraging habitat by restoring a more natural functioning stream channel and
connected floodplain.
Approximately 60 acres of floodplain habitat would be improved by adding woody debris and
vegetation, thus increasing cover and diversity to the floodplain. Macroinvertebrates, such as
stonefly and Odenata (dragonfly larvae), are an important food source for harlequin ducks.
Macroinvertebrate habitat would be improved under Alternative 2 by providing greater riffle
habitat, reducing cobble embeddedness, and reducing stream temperatures. Altering the
morphology of the stream would provide scouring of riffles, which reduces cobble
embeddedness. Creating more, higher-quality riffle habitat would increase the abundance and
productivity of macroinvertebrates in the project area. Stream temperatures would be reduced by
reconnecting the groundwater and surface water interaction and providing a wider riparian area
that would support larger trees and shrubs.
Determination of effects on harlequin duck is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to
cause trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under
Alternative 2. Over the long term, potential breeding and foraging habitat would be improved.
Fisher
Affected Environment

The fisher is a management indicator and sensitive species on the Nez Perce National Forest.
Fisher occurrence in western North America is closely associated with low- to mid-elevation
forests with a coniferous component, large snags or decadent live trees and logs for denning and
resting, and complex physical structure near the forest floor to support adequate prey populations
(Aubry and Lewis 2003).
The Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (IDFG 2005) summarizes fisher habitat in
Idaho as a mosaic of mesic (moist/wet) conifer, dry conifer, and subalpine forests. Mature and
older forests are used during summer; early seral and late successional forests are used in
the winter.
Fisher are known to occur in the vicinity of the project area.
Fisher has a global rank of G5 (widespread, abundant, and secure) and an Idaho State ranking of
S1 (critically imperiled) (NatureServe 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]; Digital Atlas of Idaho
2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]). In Idaho, the species occurs in the northern and central parts
of the state.

Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. As a result, there would be no direct or indirect effects to fisher or their habitat. It is
determined that there would be No Impact to fisher or their habitat under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2

Displacement effects would occur under the action alternative (Alternative 2) during
implementation. Indirect effects would be limited to noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Alternative 2 would improve cover and diversity in the floodplain along the Crooked River. This
would improve habitat (cover and forage) for fisher and their prey species.
Determination of effects on fisher is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to cause
trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under the
action alternative.
Management Indicator Species
Management indicator species were designated for the Nez Perce National Forest in the 1987
Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a).
Elk
Affected Environment

Elk tend to inhabit open grasslands, brush fields, and riparian areas for foraging and dense
forested areas for cover.
The project area is located in Game Management Unit (GMU) 15. Elk populations in this GMU
are near or above objectives, with cow numbers being stable or slightly increasing and bull
numbers increasing (Rachael 2011).
Hunting pressure in Crooked River is estimated as moderate to high. Forage is mainly in open
old harvest units, open coniferous forests, and shrublands and comprises about 20% of the
project area. Vegetation management activities (primarily timber harvest with associated road
development) have changed summer habitat quality and distribution.
Elk summer habitat was analyzed using the Guidelines for Evaluating and Managing Summer
Elk Habitat in Northern Idaho (Leege 1984). The project area contains all or portions of three
elk analysis units that have been assigned a 50% effectiveness habitat objective. The Center Star
(61%) and Wheeler (51%) elk units are above Forest Plan objectives and Deadwood (46%)
is below.
Elk are known to occur in the project area.

Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. As a result, there would be no direct or indirect effects to elk or their habitat.
Alternative 2

Alternative 2 would improve cover and forage habitat for elk by improving vegetation and
diversity to the floodplain along Crooked River.
Elk could be subject to short-term disturbance effects under Alternative 2. Short-term indirect
effects would be limited to displacement from noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Alternative 2 would not change existing elk habitat effectiveness levels for any elk units.
Moose
Affected Environment

Moose are very dependent during the winter upon old-growth grand fir forest types with an
understory of Pacific yew. The analysis area for moose is the project area. In Idaho, moose
occur mainly in mountainous conifer forest. Forest vegetative types used by moose include
grand fir and subalpine fir. Winter habitat is the most limiting habitat component for moose.
Winter range is characterized by double-canopy coniferous forests, which intercept significant
amounts of snow and also provide palatable evergreen forage. Grand fir–Pacific yew habitats fit
these criteria and are favored for winter foraging. The project area does not contain grand fir–
Pacific yew communities; however, the project area is used by moose.
No population data for moose have been collected on a regular basis in the region. Some
populations appear to be increasing and seem to respond favorably to extensive habitat alteration
by silvicultural practices. However, other populations may be displaced or eliminated because
they cannot adapt to habitat changes, particularly where yew thickets are eliminated through
logging and where increased road densities make moose more vulnerable to harvest (Toweill
2011). Even though population levels and trends are unknown, moose populations are large
enough to support hunting. Moose have been observed in the project area.
Moose are secure (G5/S5) in Idaho and across their range (NatureServe 2013 [accessed August
7, 2013]; [G5/S4] Digital Atlas of Idaho 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]).

Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River

Alternative 2

Alternative 2 would improve cover and forage habitat for moose by adding vegetation and
diversity to the floodplain along Crooked River. Figure 3-29 depicts the current vegetation
communities along the Meanders and Figure 3-30 the proposed vegetation communities under
Alternative 2. At least three larger ponds would remain that would continue to provide forage
for moose. Swales and alcoves would be constructed that would also potentially provide forage
areas. Adverse impacts to moose habitat would occur during construction and for a short-term
post-implementation period until vegetation can become re-established.
Moose could be subject to short-term disturbance effects under Alternative 2. Short-term
indirect effects would be limited to displacement from noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Pine Marten
Affected Environment

The pine marten (also known as the American marten) was selected as a Nez Perce Forest MIS
to represent trapped species and high-elevation old-growth forests. Marten inhabit dense, moist
to wet coniferous forests that support abundant vole populations (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994).
They prefer higher-elevation, mature subalpine fir/Engelmann spruce forests with large woody
debris, and well-developed canopy cover (Kujala 1993). Marten avoid openings greater than
150 feet from cover. Existing project area openings do not inhibit use of the area by marten.
Pine marten have not been observed in the project area, but they are suspected to occur in the
vicinity of Road 522.
Pine marten are apparently secure (G5/S5) in Idaho and across their range (NatureServe 2013
[accessed August 7, 2013]; [G4/S4] Digital Atlas of Idaho 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]).
Samson (2006) showed that habitat on the Nez Perce National Forest is more than sufficient to
contribute to a viable population of the marten at a regional scale.

Marten could be subject to short-term disturbance effects under Alternative 2. Short-term

Neotropical and other Migratory Birds
Affected Environment

Forest landbirds include all the avian species, sometimes collectively termed “neotropical
migratory birds” and “resident songbirds.” This group of birds is not treated separately by
species, because they are an extremely diverse group of species, with widely disparate
habitat requirements.
In 1988, an amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act required the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS) to “identify species, subspecies, and populations of all migratory
nongame birds that, without additional conservation actions, are likely to become candidates for
listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.” To carry out this mandate, the USFWS
published “Birds of Conservation Concern 2002,” which recommends that its lists be consulted
in accordance with E.O. 13186. In addition, numerous birds are protected by Idaho Department
of Fish and Game (IDFG) nongame status and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Currently, there
are no Nez Perce Forest Plan standards specific to migratory birds.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act covers many ground-nesting and shrub-nesting birds. Some
migratory birds are covered by state hunting regulations; others are protected by non-game status
by the IDFG. Neotropical migrant birds use coniferous forest habitats in the U.S. during the
summer breeding season but migrate to southern latitudes to spend winters in habitats as far
south as Mexico and South America. Tropical deforestation and other environmental effects
related to bird wintering grounds are thought largely responsible for declines in some neotropical
migrant bird populations.
The Crooked River valley bottom was dredge mined with a bucket dredge from the 1930s
through the 1950s, which left large tailings piles and ponds. Mining waste (also referred to as
tailings piles) is concentrated around the stream corridor, altering the physical, hydrologic and
geomorphic conditions of the stream system, delivering sediment to the stream during both lowand high-flow conditions, restricting the natural pattern of stream migration and other changes in
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

channel morphology (channel size, form, and function), and inhibiting the recolonization of
native riparian vegetation.
The project area provides habitat primarily for riparian associated species. Species associated
with riparian vegetation include the rufous hummingbird, willow flycatcher, black-billed magpie,
American dipper, yellow warbler, and MacGillivray’s warbler.
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects

Neotropical and other migratory birds habitats found in the Crooked River Valley Restoration
project area that are most vulnerable and may be impacted by project activities are those
associated with riparian vegetation. There are currently no Forest Plan standards specific to
migratory birds.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. This alternative would have no direct or indirect effects on migratory birds.
However, the tailing piles would continue to provide less-than-desirable riparian
breeding and foraging habitat.
Alternative 2

The tailing piles are considered less-than-desirable riparian habitat for neotropical and other
migratory birds. Project activities associated with restoring the stream channel and floodplain
could cause short-term disturbance and displacement effects. There is the potential for
temporary loss of breeding sites with the removal of shrubs and trees during reshaping of the
floodplain. However, there are several preserve areas that will not be disturbed and will be
retained to provide nesting substrate for riparian-associated nesting birds.
Native plant species abundance, composition, and distribution would likely increase or improve
above current levels due to restoration of the stream channel and riparian vegetation. Improved
habitat or vegetative conditions include providing the vegetative structure, cover, and overall
habitat quality for many riparian-associated bird species.
The long-term benefits include improved stream and floodplain conditions, thus improving
nesting and foraging habitat for riparian-associated bird species. Re-vegetating the floodplain
with native vegetation and maintaining for several years after project completion through
replanting and protection from browsing will improve foraging and nesting habitat for
neotropical migratory birds as well.
Cumulative Effects
Geographic Boundary

The area of consideration for cumulative effects includes lands within the entire project area,
those areas of disturbance associated with the proposed action and with the proposed Crooked
River Narrows Road Improvement project (segments of Roads 233 and 522). The rationale for
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

3-139

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

this analysis area is that the effects are site specific to areas treated within the project area and
would not extend beyond the boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area would
likewise not affect the resource within.
Time Frame

These effects are considered only for the species potentially affected by this project from the
initial habitat transformations in the early 1900s through the present, including this project and
reasonably foreseeable future actions. The timeframe for the cumulative effects assessment is
the duration of project activities and approximately 10–20 years after the completion of project
activities (which is the amount of time expected for the riparian vegetation to become mature).
This is the length of time for the alder and conifer communities to provide shade and to have a
stable, functioning wetland/floodplain that provides for wildlife and their habitat.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Future Actions

The primary management activities that have influenced wildlife habitat in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation area include past timber harvest and supporting road construction and
mining. These activities have been extensive in the past and have resulted in much more open,
transitory habitats than likely existed historically. Overall trends of harvest activity have been
downward in recent years with a corresponding decline in initiation of early seral conditions,
although open conditions continue to be extensive. Refer to Appendix C for a complete list and
details of past, present, and foreseeable future actions that are considered in this analysis.
Ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed activity areas consist of recreation, road
maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and
weed treatments.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

The No Action alternative (Alternative 1) would produce no additional effects to wildlife or their
habitat, as compared to past activity levels. Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effects
and therefore no cumulative effects on wildlife or their habitat. Existing vegetation would not be
altered nor would these species be disturbed or displaced.
Alternative 2

Alternative 2 and the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would add
short-term disturbance effects to this landscape through associated stream restoration, road
construction, and road decommissioning activities. The construction and removal of roads may
impact existing occurrences of wildlife species or habitats that are found in the immediate
vicinity of the project.
Motorized recreation and dispersed-camping activities would change in the future, but the effects
to wildlife and their habitats would be limited to designated existing routes and dispersedcamping areas following implementation of the Nez Perce National Forest Travel Management

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Plan decision. Ongoing maintenance of these travel routes is considered routine and ongoing,
with virtually no effects to the habitat through which they pass.
Currently there are numerous mineral claims in the project area (see Chapter 3, Mineral
Resources). These activities typically occur in disturbed areas and may have some disturbance
impacts to wildlife. There is one minerals plan of operation on file with the forest at this time for
exploration activities from existing roads.
The Orogrande Community Protection project would modify wildlife habitats and cause
disturbance effects. Activities associated with Orogrande project in the vicinity of the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project are designed to reduce fuels, primarily in the understory
(prescribed burning and understory thinning). This would reduce understory cover (sapling and
pole-sized trees and shrubs), yet at the same time improve forage for big game species.
Fire-suppression activities would be anticipated in the future in the project area, but the
occurrence, extent, and/or intensity of suppression efforts cannot be estimated or predicted. As
with all these activities, the effects to the species would likely be mixed.
Noxious weed treatments would occur in the project area under the current weed management
plan in the future. Generally, spot applications should not affect any wildlife species of concern
due to avoidance by spray crews. The risk associated with herbicide treatment is the potential
that wildlife species, particularly amphibians, would accidentally be sprayed. The design criteria
specified in Chapter 2 would provide adequate protection for wildlife species by minimizing the
amount and type of herbicide to which amphibians could be exposed by restricting application
methods and applying buffer distances along streams, ponds, and wetlands.
Habitat alterations and disturbance associated with the implementation of this project have the
short-term potential to combine with ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed
activity areas consisting of recreation, road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management,
mining, watershed restoration, and weed treatments. The action alternative would cumulatively
add to the loss of some wildlife species habitats (ponds), but also provide a more natural
functioning stream and floodplain and may even be beneficial for some of the wildlife species
using this area (i.e., improved habitat). There would be no concerns for viability of these species
because of the extent and long-term improvement of suitable wildlife habitats associated with
improving the Crooked River valley bottom.
Determination of Effects
Effects on threatened, endangered, and sensitive wildlife species by management activities of
this project and the proposed Crooked River Narrow Road Improvement project are summarized
in Table 3-39. This table includes all wildlife species on the Nez Perce National Forest sensitive
list. There is potential for impacts to western toads, gray wolves, harlequin ducks, and fisher.
The proposed action would likely harm existing western toads, but would also create a more

connected and natural functioning river valley bottom and disturb or displace western toads,
wolves, harlequin ducks, and fisher. For these reasons and because only a low percentage of
habitats would be disturbed, there would be no concerns for the overall species viability.
Based on short-term impacts resulting from the project, it is determined that the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project may impact individuals, but would not lead to a trend toward
federal listing or a loss of viability for the western toad, gray wolf, harlequin duck, or fisher.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Effectiveness of Mitigation
By applying design and mitigation measures 11, 45, and 52 (as described in Chapter 2, Design
and Mitigation Measures), the effects to western toads, neotropical migratory birds, and their
habitat would be reduced. Applying aquatic species salvage operations prior to construction and
dewatering activities would reduce the amount of western toad mortality in the Meanders section
of Crooked River.
Conducting construction/dewatering activities prior to the western toad and bird breeding cycle
(April and May) or after July 1 may reduce the amount of western toad mortality and
disturbance/displacement impacts to neotropical migratory birds in the Meanders section of
Crooked River.
In response to the introduction and spread of noxious weeds, actions would be taken to restore
vegetative conditions along Crooked River. These actions would also improve habitat for
wildlife species by applying design and mitigation measures 9, 10, 18, 22, and 24–31 (see
Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures).

Regulatory Framework
The principal policy document relevant to wildlife management on the Nez Perce National
Forest is the 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan), which contains goals,
objectives, standards, and guidelines for management of wildlife species and habitats on the
Forest. Forest Plan goals (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-1 and -2) addressing wildlife and
wildlife habitats are summarized below:
•
•

•

•

Provide and maintain a diversity and quality of habitat to support viable populations of
native and desirable non-native wildlife species.
Provide habitat to contribute to the recovery of Threatened and Endangered plant and
animal species in accordance with approved recovery plans. Provide habitat to ensure the
viability of those species identified as sensitive.
Recognize and promote the intrinsic ecological and economic value of wildlife and
wildlife habitats. Provide high-quality and quantity of wildlife habitat to ensure
diversified recreational use and public satisfaction.
Protect or enhance riparian-dependent resources.

Forest Service Manual 2670 (file code for threatened and endangered species) directs that all
federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and threatened species and
shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the Endangered Species Act and to avoid actions
that may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. FSM 2670 also calls for the
Forest Service to maintain viable populations of all native and desirable non-native wildlife, fish,
and plant species in habitats distributed throughout their geographic range on system lands.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

3-143

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The three principal laws relevant to wildlife management on lands managed by the Forest
Service are the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the National Forest Management Act of 1976
and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR 219, and NEPA. Regulations promulgated
subsequent to passage of these laws require the Forest Service to maintain viable populations of
all native and desirable non-native wildlife species with emphasis on assuring that federally
listed (threatened and endangered) species populations are allowed to recover (36 CFR 219.9).
Regional Foresters provide a list of sensitive species for each Forest. Forests are required to
assure that sensitive species populations do not decline or trend towards listing under the
Endangered Species Act (FSM 2670.22).
This analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial sensitive species (i.e., Biological Evaluation),
per direction pertaining to streamlining (USDA Forest Service 1995a). The streamlined process
for doing biological evaluations for sensitive species focuses on two areas:
•
•

Incorporating the effects on sensitive species into the NEPA document
Summarizing the conclusions of effects of the biological evaluations for sensitive species
(Appendix A).

Executive Order (E.O.) 13186, “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory
Birds,” (January 10, 2001) pertains to conservation of migratory birds. A Memorandum of
Understanding to carry out the mandate of the E.O. was signed by the U.S. Forest Service and
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on January 7, 2001. In 1988, an amendment to the Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Act required the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to “identify species,
subspecies, and populations of all migratory nongame birds that, without additional conservation
actions, are likely to become candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.”
To carry out this mandate, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published “Birds of Conservation
Concern 2002,” which recommends that its lists be consulted in accordance with E.O. 13186.
In addition, numerous birds are protected by Idaho Department of Fish and Game nongame
status and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Currently, there are no Nez Perce Forest Plan
standards specific to migratory birds.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Threatened and Endangered Species – Federal agencies are required to address effects to
threatened, endangered, and proposed species during project planning (Endangered Species Act
of 1973 as amended, P.L. 96-1591531(c)). This analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial
threatened and endangered species (i.e., Biological Evaluation), per direction pertaining to
streamlining (USDA Forest Service 1995a). This project is in compliance with the Endangered
Species Act.
Sensitive Species – Sensitive wildlife species are those that show evidence of a current or
predicted downward trend in population numbers or habitat suitability that would substantially
reduce species distribution. Federal laws and direction applicable to sensitive species include the

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

3-144

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

National Forest Management Act (NFMA 1976) and Forest Service Manual 2670.22. The Nez
Perce Forest has standards to conduct analyses to review programs and activities to determine
their potential effect on sensitive species and to prepare biological evaluations. The Forest
Service is bound by federal statutes (Endangered Species Act, National Forest Management Act),
regulation (USDA 9500-4), and agency policy (FSM 2670) to conserve biological diversity on
National Forest System lands and assure that sensitive species populations do not decline or
trend toward listing under the Endangered Species Act. A biological evaluation for sensitive
species has been prepared. The action alternative would not affect sensitive species viability on
Nez Perce National Forest lands, nor would it cause sensitive species to become federally listed
as threatened or endangered. This project is in compliance with sensitive species direction. This
analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial threatened and endangered species (i.e., Biological
Evaluation), per direction pertaining to streamlining (USDA Forest Service 1995a). This project
is in compliance with the Endangered Species Act.
Species Viability – The action alternative—in combination with, and within the context of past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future management actions in the analysis area—would not
affect population viability or distribution of native and desired nonnative vertebrate species on
the Forest. This project is in compliance.
National Forest Management Act – The National Forest Management Act requires (among
other things) the Forest Service to “preserve and enhance the diversity of plant and
animal communities.”
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, National Forest Management Act of 1976, and Forest
Service regulations require federal land managers to maintain viable populations of all native and
desirable non-native wildlife species with special care taken to assure that federally listed
(threatened and endangered) species populations are allowed to recover. There are no federally
listed threatened or endangered species using the project area. The action alternative is in
compliance with the National Forest Management Act (also see Sensitive Species and Species
Viability in this section).
Neotropical Migratory Bird Laws – Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and Migratory Bird
Conservation Executive Order 13186 (dated January 10, 2001) – The action alternative is in
compliance with the MBTA and Executive Order 13186, which authorizes activities including
habitat protection, restoration, enhancement, necessary modification, and implementation of
actions that benefit priority migratory bird species (Memorandum of Understanding Between
USDA Forest Service and USDI Fish & Wildlife Service – 01-MU-11130117-028).
Nez Perce Forest Plan – As stated under Regulatory Framework, the objective for managing
sensitive species is to ensure population viability throughout their range on National Forest lands
and to ensure that they do not become federally listed as threatened or endangered. The Forest
Plan supports this direction but does not set specific standards and guides for sensitive species.

Proposed activities are consistent with this direction to the extent that proposed management
actions do not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive wildlife populations.
Applicable standards of the Nez Perce Forest Plan associated with the management of wildlife
and key habitats of threatened, endangered, sensitive, and management indicator species have
been reviewed and are being met, and in some instances, exceeded.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would be consistent with Forest Plan wildlife
standards (USDA Forest Service 1987a). The project would not lead to a loss of viability of
existing native and desirable non-native vertebrate wildlife species. A biological evaluation has
been prepared in compliance with sub-section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act.
Government-to-Government consultation has occurred for this project, and the Forest continues
to recognize the fishing and hunting rights guaranteed to the Nez Perce Tribe. The Forest has
coordinated with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) to achieve mutual goals for
fish and wildlife, including use of the IDFG Idaho Fish and Wildlife Information System for
habitat and species observation/distribution information for this project. The Guidelines for
Evaluating and Managing Summer Elk Habitat in Northern Idaho (Leege 1984) was used to
assess the attainment of summer elk habitat objectives for this project.
Regarding Forest Plan management area standards, streamside vegetation canopy, structure,
composition and diversity are currently lacking along the Meanders section of the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project (Alternative 1). Alternative 2 would implement habitat
improvements to move the area toward stated objectives.
The project would also comply with PACFISH (USDA Forest Service 1995b) standards and
guidelines applicable to this project. Riparian Management Objectives would be maintained and
enhanced by the action alternative.
Full details on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.

Rare Plants
Affected Environment
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project has the potential to affect rare plant species and
their habitats. This section provides an analysis of rare plant species potentially present in the
project area and the effects proposed activities may have on them. For the purpose of this
analysis, rare plant species include endangered, threatened, and sensitive plant species.
Geographic Scope
Project Area

Direct and indirect effects were analyzed for the project area for the restoration and improvement
of 2.0 miles of the Crooked River Meanders.
Cumulative Effects Area

The area of consideration for cumulative effects includes lands associated with this project and
the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project and the Orogrande Community
Protection project:
•
•

Crooked River Meanders – 2.0 miles of stream and floodplain restoration and
improvement
Proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project – improvement of up to
4 miles of Road 233 or rerouting portions of Road 522 and decommissioning
approximately 3.5 miles of Road 233 to foot trail.

The rationale for the selection of these analysis areas is that the effects are site specific to areas
treated within the project area (as delineated in Chapter 2) and would not extend beyond the
boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area would likewise not affect the
resource within.
Methodology
Analysis included reviewing threatened, endangered, and sensitive species observation records
and topographic and forest habitat maps to identify potential habitat for plants of concern.
Individual species requirements were reviewed to determine which species or corresponding
habitat would be expected to occur in the project area.
Vegetation information was identified in the project area in 2012 (RDG et al. 2012).
Direct and indirect effects are discussed for each species. Direct effects could result from road
and stream alteration. Indirect effects for some species may include the expansion of weeds and
the mitigating treatments of these infestations. Road improvements that are limited to the road
prism would not have any direct or indirect effects on any species of concern. Cumulative
effects are the overall effects to species from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future

projects. Historically such effects on individual species were not measured or noted. However,
the past effects on general habitat condition can be qualified and matched to species dependent
on a particular habitat.

Qualitative discussion of habitat conditions and potential for effects.
Effects determination to threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant species.

Existing Condition
Past land management activities, most importantly mining and road construction, have
substantially affected the landscape in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream and
riparian function in the main stem of Crooked River (Appendix C). Fire suppression, mining,
road construction, and timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural processes in the
watershed. The area surrounding Crooked River was mined for mineral resources from the
1900s through the 1950s. Mining waste (also referred to as mine tailings) is concentrated in the
valley bottom, altering the physical condition of the stream system, restricting the natural
migration pattern of the stream and other changes in channel morphology (channel size, form,
and function), and impairing the recolonization of riparian vegetation and its function as a
natural buffer. Road 233 is within the floodplain of Crooked River for approximately 3 miles
through the “Narrows” and 1 additional mile to Relief Creek. The road often floods during high
water events, constricts the river, and contributes sediment to Crooked River. These alterations
have resulted in a reduced area of productive aquatic and terrestrial habitat.
Federally Listed Species

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) requires the Forest Service to analyze threatened
species for which there may be suitable habitat in a project area. In Idaho County, the USFWS
has indicated that there may be suitable habitat for Macfarlane’s four-o’clock (Mirabilis
macfarlanei) and Spalding’s catchfly (Silene spaldingii). However, past assessments and
direction provided by the USFWS indicate that habitat for these species is limited to the Salmon
River basin on the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests. There are no occurrences or
suitable habitat for any federally listed plant species in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project area, which is in the Clearwater subbasin. These species will not be discussed further.
Water howellia is another listed threatened species. Even though water howellia is known to
occur in Idaho, it does not occur in Idaho County and was not detected during rare plant surveys
conducted on July 17, 2003. This species will not be discussed further.
Sensitive Species

The USFS Northern Region Sensitive Species List, which contains those species identified as
sensitive by the Regional Forester, was last updated on February 2011 (USDA Forest Service
2011b). Idaho barren strawberry is the only rare plant species known or suspected to occur in the
project area. Species not known or suspected to occur in the project area will not be discussed

further. A complete list of the sensitive plant species for the Nez Perce – Clearwater National
Forests can be found in Table 3-40.
Rare plant surveys were conducted in 2012 (RDG et al. 2012) and 2013 (Forest Service
personnel) in the project area.
Idaho barren strawberry (Waldsteinia idahoensis)

Idaho barren strawberry has a wide ecological range (Crawford 1980), and is found
predominantly in moister grand fir habitat types (cool and moist western red cedar) at midelevations (3,500–5,500 feet). Cool, moist micro sites within these general habitats are most
favorable for its development (Crawford 1980). Idaho barren strawberry is tolerant of shade but
responds favorably to increased light (Crawford 1980) and is also able to colonize disturbed soils
(Lichthardt 1999). It can be found growing in stands with open canopies, and transition zones
between riparian meadows and conifer forests.
Idaho barren strawberry is known to occur in the project area. Historical records show that Idaho
barren strawberry occurs in and around Campground 4. Rare plant surveys conducted on July 2
and 17, 2013, found Idaho barren strawberry north of Campground 3. The area along the
Meanders consists of larger, loose cobble, which does not provide suitable habitat for Idaho
barren strawberry. Idaho barren strawberry can be found along the Meanders where past
activities have maintained a soil component.

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. This would have no effects on rare plant species or habitats. It is determined that
there would be No Impact to sensitive plant species or their habitat with Alternative 1.
Alternative 2
Idaho barren strawberry (Waldsteinia idahoensis)

Idaho barren strawberry appears to be tolerant of disturbances. Population density was greater in
open stands with past harvest and in old burns as compared to a more shaded closed conifer
community (Crawford 1980). It is capable of colonizing disturbed soils (Lichthardt 1999).
Idaho barren strawberry occurs in and around the area of Campground 3 and 4 at the upper end
of the Meanders. The staging of equipment at these sites would further compact soils than what
they already are, creating less than ideal growing conditions for Idaho barren strawberry and
other plant species. Root systems would have a hard time breaking through the compacted soils.
Decompacting soils upon completion of the project would temporarily improve growing
conditions for Idaho barren strawberry. Restoring the floodplain would create conditions that are

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

too wet for Idaho barren strawberry. Determination of effects for the Idaho barren strawberry is
May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to cause trend toward federal listing or reduce
viability for the population or species under Alternative 2.
Cumulative Effects
Discussion of cumulative effects for rare plants is addressed through the general trend of the
suitable habitat required by these species as a result of past, present, and future management
actions. It is generally not possible to directly quantify effects of specific activities that are
several years or decades old on species of concern today. The status and occurrence of rare
plants was completely unknown for much of the management history of the watershed.
Historically, the changes in condition and abundance of specific habitats important to these
species are also largely unknown. Therefore, the effects of these past projects can be qualified
only through general discussions. However, the results of past projects contribute to the current
condition, which can be used to discuss and quantify effects of proposed activities on rare
plant species.
Geographic Boundary

The area of consideration for cumulative effects includes lands within the entire project area,
those areas of disturbance associated with proposed action and with the proposed Crooked River
Narrows Road Improvement project (segments of Roads 233 and 522). The rationale for the
analysis area is that the effects are site specific to areas treated within the project area and would
not extend beyond the boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area would likewise not
affect the resource within.
Time Frame

These effects are considered only for the species potentially affected by this project from the
initial habitat transformations in the early 1900s through the present, including this project and
reasonably foreseeable future actions. The timeframe for the cumulative effects assessment is
the duration of project activities and approximately 10–20 years after the completion of project
activities (construction and planting). This is length of time for the alder and conifer
communities to provide shade and to have a stable, functioning wetland/floodplain that provides
for rare plants and their habitat.
Past, Present, and Foreseeable Future Actions

The primary management activities that have influenced rare plant habitat in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation area include past timber harvest and supporting road construction and
mining. These activities have been extensive in the past and have resulted in much more open,
transitory habitats than likely existed historically. The two plant species potentially impacted by
this project would have seen habitats increased under this past management. Overall trends of
harvest activity have been downward in recent years with a corresponding decline in initiation of
early seral conditions, although open conditions continue to be extensive. Refer to Appendix C

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Rare Plants

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

for a complete list and details of past, present, and foreseeable future actions. Ongoing and
foreseeable actions within the proposed activity areas consist of recreation, road maintenance,
fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and weed treatments.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

The no action alternative (Alternative 1) would produce no direct or indirect effects on potential
rare plant habitat, as compared to past activity levels. The progression of forest succession
would improve habitat for most sensitive plant species; however, species favored by more open
conditions would decline as general forest succession progressed absent of large-scale
disturbance such as wildfire. Thus, there would be no cumulative impacts on potential rare
plant habitat.
Alternative 2

The action alternative (Alternative 2) and the proposed Crooked River Narrow Road
Improvement project would add similar short-term disturbance to this landscape through
disturbance activities associated with stream restoration, road construction, and road
decommissioning. The construction and removal of roads may impact existing occurrences that
are found on the cut/fill slopes of the road corridor or in the open edge habitats adjacent to the
road. While some plants may be lost, the activity would also provide soil scarification to benefit
the continued existence of these species at these sites. This activity along with the past road
building and harvest activities have combined to create extensive open and edge habitats
throughout much of the Crooked River watershed. For the Idaho barren strawberry, the overall
trend in suitable habitat available has been an increasing one as a result. While plants would
likely be lost due to the mechanical actions, there would be no concerns for viability of the
species because of the extent and long-term maintenance of suitable habitat.
Motorized recreation and dispersed-camping activities would change in the future, but the effects
on soils would be limited to designated existing routes and dispersed-camping areas following
implementation of the Nez Perce National Forest Travel Management Plan decision. Ongoing
maintenance of these travel routes is considered routine with virtually no effects to the habitat
through which they pass.
Currently, there are numerous mineral claims in the project area (see Chapter 3, Mineral
Resources). These activities typically occur in disturbed areas that are not considered habitat for
any of the sensitive plant species.
The Orogrande Community Protection project would maintain relatively open conditions,
allowing sun to reach the soil and provide light disturbance to which these species potentially
respond favorably. This activity would be expected to have the small but positive effect of
promoting the maintenance of the suitable habitat for the Idaho barren strawberry in areas
adjacent to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Rare Plants

3-151

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Fire-suppression activities would be anticipated in the project area in the future, but the
occurrence, extent, and/ or intensity of suppression efforts cannot be estimated or predicted.
As with all these activities, the effects to the species would likely be mixed.
Noxious weed treatments would occur periodically in the project area under the current weed
management plan in the future. Generally, spot applications should not affect any species of
concern due to avoidance by spray crews. However, in the case of the two species potentially
affected by this project, some spraying may occur along occupied road corridors and impacts
are possible.
Habitat alterations associated with the implementation of this project have the short-term
potential to combine with ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed activity areas,
including recreation, road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed
restoration, and weed treatments. The action alternative would cumulatively add to the loss of
sensitive species habitats along Crooked River by providing a more natural functioning stream
and floodplain. There would be no concerns for viability of these species because of the extent
of sensitive plant locations and suitable habitats within the Crooked River and Red River
drainages.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Actions taken to prevent the introduction and spread of noxious weeds in disturbed areas would
be beneficial in maintaining and improving rare plant vegetative communities by reducing the
incidence of introduced non-native and noxious weedy plant species. The following design and
mitigation measures (as described in full in Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures) are
proposed for the action alternative: 9, 10, 17, 18, and 24–31.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The Nez Perce Forest Plan states that no action will be taken that will jeopardize a threatened
and/or endangered species (USDA Forest Service 1987a, page VI-12). The objective for
managing sensitive species is to ensure population viability throughout their range on National
Forest lands and to ensure that they do not become federally listed as threatened or endangered.
The proposed action is consistent with this direction to the extent that proposed management
actions would not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive plant populations or habitat.
The Forest Plan does not set specific standards and guides for sensitive plants. Full details on
consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Other Laws and Regulations
Threatened and endangered species are designated under the Endangered Species Act. It is the
policy of Congress that all federal departments shall seek to conserve endangered and threatened
species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of this purpose (ESA 1531.2b). The

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Rare Plants

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area does not contain habitat or populations of
threatened or endangered plant species.
Sensitive species are defined in the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2670.5) as “those plant and
animal species identified by the Regional Forester for which population viability is a concern, as
evidenced by significant current or predicted downward trends in population numbers, density,
or habitat capability that reduce a species/existing distribution.” In FSM 2670.22, management
direction for sensitive species is in part, to ensure that species do not become threatened or
endangered because of Forest Service actions and to maintain viable populations of all native
species. The most recent update to the sensitive species list became effective in May 2011. The
Forest Service must evaluate impacts to sensitive species through a biological evaluation (BE).
Effects Determinations
Determination of effects on rare plant species by management activities of this project are
summarized in Table 3-40. This table includes all plant species on the Nez Perce National Forest
sensitive list. There is potential for impacts on Idaho barren strawberry. The proposed action
would likely harm existing plants, but would create or maintain open conditions along the road
corridor that the species would find suitable. For this reason and because only a low percentage
of habitat would disturbed, there would be no concerns for the overall viability of the species.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Invasive Plants
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project proposed
action on invasive plants. The proposed activities that could affect vegetation conditions include
removal of vegetative cover, construction activities, importing materials, and revegetation
activities.
Invasive plant species are an important ecosystem attribute to consider when assessing potential
impacts from the proposed action. Invasive plants, which include listed Idaho noxious weeds,
have the potential to affect native species’ richness and frequency, erosion rates, and ecological
processes. Invasive plants can expand following human-caused or natural disturbances and
colonize degraded as well as intact habitats. Many invasive plants found in the Intermountain
West were accidentally or intentionally introduced into North America between the 1880s and
1920s. Without their natural predators and pathogens, invasive plant populations can expand.
The Red River Ranger District implements integrated invasive plant management strategies that
deal with invasive plant infestations within the project area based on priorities outlined in the
Annual Operating Plan for the Upper Clearwater River Weed Management Area, a communitybased cooperative. The area generally has potential for invasive plant control work through the
life of the proposed project.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Invasive plant expansion and prevention in the project area is greatly influenced by habitat
susceptibility, seed source, seed dispersal, and disturbance. Invasive plants could expand in the
analysis area depending on the interaction of these four factors.
The indicators used for this analysis are:
•
•

Susceptible habitat
Weed expansion risk.

Data for this analysis comes from several sources, including past Forest Service weed inventories
(USDA Forest Service 1998 to 2012), the Design Criteria Report (RDG et al. 2012), and
personal knowledge.
Susceptible Habitats
Susceptibility refers to the vulnerability of plant communities to colonization and establishment
of invasive plants. Invasive plants can be expected to colonize those sites or habitats that
provide the necessary requirements to complete their life cycle. Those habitats that lack the
necessary resources for specific invasive plants are not considered susceptible to colonization.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Invasive Plants

3-156

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Under these conditions a site or habitat may be considered as having low susceptibility or may
even be unavailable to weed colonization.
Susceptible habitats were identified in the action area using geographic information systems
(GIS). A buffer was used around the Meanders in order to assess the maximum amount of area
impacted by the action alternative. Habitats were classified as having low, moderate, or high
susceptibility based on habitat type group (HTG) characteristics and known ability of invasive
plants to colonize in these habitat types. Highly susceptible habitats can be colonized and
dominated with invasive plants even in the absence of intense and frequent disturbance. HTGs
with a low rating are only slightly susceptible to weed colonization.
Weed susceptibility is determined by HTGs (e.g., warm and dry with overstory species of
Douglas-fir/grassland). Historically, the Crooked River Valley bottom was warm and moist with
a late seral vegetation community of alder and fir spruce overstory. With the disturbance levels
from past mining, the current site conditions are warm and dry (tailings piles are not inundated
during seasonal flow events) with seral lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir as overstory species.
Habitats moderately susceptible to weed invasion provide site characteristics where species can
invade the herbaceous layer and become a common element across the plant community in the
absence of intense and frequent disturbance. Ground- and habitat-altering disturbances are
important factors contributing to weed colonization within and adjacent to highly and moderately
susceptible habitats.
Of the 10 vegetation community sites identified by River Design Group (2012), four were
considered to represent disturbed plant communities; however, these four communities represent
over 50% of the composition in the valley bottom. Disturbed community types were dredge
conifer, dredge herbaceous, reed canary grass, and mesic forb meadow. These are also the
community types that support the greatest amount of invasive species, such as oxeye daisy,
hounds tongue, and spotted knapweed, and are currently the most susceptible to invasive plants,
with the exception of the reed canary grass community.
Weed Expansion Risk
The risk of weed expansion in the analysis area was determined by assessing the following
factors: (1) susceptibility of HTGs, (2) presence of weed infestations (seed source), (3) amount
of fire and timber harvest over the past 10 years (site disturbance), and (4) density of roads
(spread corridors). Risk was assigned a low, moderate, high, or extreme category. GIS was used
to display and calculate acres for activities occurring in each risk zone. The analysis does not
include reed canary grass. Table 3-41 displays the rationale for weed spread risk ratings.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
The analysis area has had high levels of past disturbance: the majority of the area has
experienced mining (dredging) since the 1930s, and currently there is approximately 2.0 miles
per square mile of roads within the Crooked River watershed. Within the greater context of the
South Fork Clearwater River subbasin, noxious weeds and invasive plants occupy more than
30,000 acres, on approximately 6% of the subbasin (USDA Forest Service 1998). This includes
species known to occur in the analysis area and species that currently do not occur in the analysis
area. Spotted knapweed populations have heavily infested areas along the main road and
trailhead/dispersed camp sites (spread vectors) within the project area. Reed canary grass has
been found to be increasing in the central part of the project area along the main stream channel.
Reed canary grass is not listed as a state noxious weed; however, it can easily dominate the
wetter habitats and prevent desired native species from colonizing. Reed canary grass has an
excellent stability rating. Common tansy and peavine have been found in several small sites.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Invasive Plants

3-158

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

These common tansy and perennial peavine sites were inventoried in 2012 and no plants were
found on these sites, in the project area (Doyle 2012). Other weed species found in the
Meanders area include hounds tongue and oxeye daisy. These species are primarily found on
dredge tailings, roadsides, and other high-use disturbance areas.
Noxious weeds such as spotted knapweed are spread readily via seeds. Spotted knapweed seeds
have an efficient dispersal mechanism. The seeds are capable of being carried several miles due
to fine plumes acting like a parachute for the seed. Reed canary grass and common tansy spread
rapidly with disturbance to root systems. Roads, as well as trails, are vectors spreading invasive
plants within the analysis area. The complete length of the project area has a main corridor road.
Biological control methods have been used in/or near the analysis area. “Classical biological
control is the introduction and establishment of carefully selected natural enemies to exert stress
on a noxious weed which ultimately causes plant death or reduces the competitive ability of the
invasive plants to a point where desirable plant species can out-compete them” (Jette et al. 1999).
Bio-agent release sites of Larinus minutus, a seed head feeder, on spotted knapweed have been
established within the South Fork Clearwater River drainage. These sites were established in the
year 2000 and have not shown enough activity to make any determination of effectiveness
(Winston 2012).
Weed Inventory Data
Our knowledge of weed populations in the project area is good: however, unknown weed
populations may exist. Field surveys for invasive plants have been conducted in the Crooked
River drainage for more than 14 years (USDA Forest Service 1998 to 2012). Known weed sites
may change in weed density and site boundaries on an annual basis due to factors such as
weather and effectiveness of ongoing treatments. Table 3-42 lists invasive plant species, and
their acreages, that have been identified in the project area. Figure 3-31 displays known invasive
plants, except reed canary grass, in the project area.

•

The project area is currently infested with invasive species, mostly spotted knapweed and
reed canary grass.
Knowledge of the extent of existing weed populations is good, due in part to good access
from existing roads.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Most existing populations are associated with known disturbances such as dredge mining,
roads, and camp sites.
Past dredge mining and associated road construction have increased the risk of weed
expansion in most of the project area.
Reed canary grass often dominates the lower-gradient stream banks along Crooked River
within the southern half of the Meanders area.

Habitat Susceptibility
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current management of invasive plant species.
The Meanders area would continue to have habitat susceptibility as high (1 acre), moderate
(54 acres), low (105 acres), and none (3 acres). Figure 3-32 displays habitat susceptibility to
weed invasion under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would, in the short term, increase the levels of low to moderate
habitat susceptibility with the implementation of ground-disturbing activities. Long term, habitat
is expected to move toward a historic low susceptibility level as water levels rise and wetter,
cooler habitats become established adjacent to Crooked River. Short term, levels of reed canary
grass would most likely expand. Reestablishing native shrub and conifer cover would decrease
levels of reed canary grass due to eventual increased shading from taller shrub and conifer
species.

Weed Expansion Risk
Direct and Indirect Effects

The expansion risk of weed populations and introductions is low to moderate due to the
generally wetter habitats. Most of the proposed activities are outside the high to extreme
expansion risk sites.
While it is well known that the risk of weed invasion increases with disturbance and is variable
depending on specific habitats and management activities, making exact determinations of weed
response is difficult; consequently, the implementation of design and mitigation measures would
minimize an increase in, if not decrease, weed expansion risk over time.
Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current management of the invasive plant species.
The Meanders area would continue to have weed risk as high (0 acres), moderate (21 acres), low
(140 acres), and none (3 acres). Figure 3-33 displays weed expansion risk under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would, in the short term, increase the levels of low to moderate
weed expansion with implementation of ground-disturbing activities. Long term, weed risk is
expected to move toward a historic low level as weed treatments occur, water levels rise, and
wetter and cooler habitats become established adjacent to Crooked River; however, in the short
term, levels of reed canary grass would most likely expand. Reestablishing native shrub and
conifer cover would decrease levels of reed canary grass due to the eventual increased shading
from taller shrub and conifer species.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Cumulative Effects
Time Frame
Past and present disturbances associated with vegetative treatments, added to reasonably
foreseeable actions, would create over the next 10–15 years a cumulative threat of weed
expansion through distribution of weed seed, ground disturbance, and creation of spread
pathways. Management activities that disturb the ground aid establishment of invasive plants
through increased niches or open areas that can be utilized. The risk of weed expansion would
be reduced with the implementation of design criteria and mitigation under each action
alternative as disturbed surfaces recover to native vegetation. Restoration of wetland habitats
would reduce susceptibility and risk to new and or expansion weed populations.
Ongoing and Foreseeable Future Actions
Ongoing weed management would continue under either alternative. New invaders would be
given the highest priority.
The Orogrande Community Protection project will increase weed spread risk through grounddisturbing activities such as burning.
The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would in the short term
increase the levels of low to moderate habitat susceptibility and the levels of low to moderate
weed expansion with the implementation of ground-disturbing activities. Over the long term,
implementation of design criteria and mitigation measures would lower the habitat susceptibility
and the risk of weed expansion to at least current levels.
In summary:
•

Weed spread is likely under both alternatives, including No Action.

•

Weed expansion risk is not expected to increase significantly from the proposed activities
because of the currently highly disturbed nature of the river system, and long-term risk is
already mostly moderate or lower in the project area.

•

The extent of weed spread would be dependent on implementation and effectiveness of
existing weed treatments, design criteria, and mitigation items.

•

Reed canary grass would decrease over time with greater shade/competition from shrubs
and conifers, and less disturbance from a restored stream channel.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Design and mitigation measures 25–28 and 31 (as described in full in Chapter 2, Design and
Mitigation Measures) are proposed for the action alternative to help prevent the spread of
invasive and noxious weeds.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Forest Plan
The Forest Plan calls for the coordination of a weed control program with county, state, and
other federal agencies. This directive is met through the participation of the Forest in the Annual
Operating Plan for the Upper Clearwater Weed Management Area, a community-based
cooperative. Both alternatives would be consistent with the Forest Plan standard for
implementing a weed control program (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-20). Full details on
consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Other Laws and Regulations
Executive Order 13112 for Invasive Species, Section 2a(3), directs each affected federal agency
to “not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the
introduction or spread of invasive species in the United States or elsewhere unless, pursuant to
guidelines that it has prescribed, the agency has determined and made public its determinations
that the benefits of such actions clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by invasive species;
and that all feasible and prudent measures to minimize risk of harm would be taken in
conjunction with the actions.”
Analysis and evaluation of invasive plants in this project is based on direction contained in the
Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 (as amended), Executive Order 13112 for Invasive Species,
Forest Service policy (USDA Forest Service 1995c, 2001), and the Nez Perce National Forest
Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-7, II-20, II-26, III-6).
In general, the Forest is directed to implement an effective weed management program with the
objectives of preventing the introduction and establishment of noxious weeds; containing and
suppressing existing weed infestations; and cooperating with local, state, and other federal
agencies in the management of noxious weeds.
The proposed action might cause the spread of invasive species in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project area to some degree. However, this potential harm would be outweighed
by the overall benefits to the watershed by the proposed treatments. Design criteria and
mitigation measures would be implemented to minimize any harmful effects associated with the
spread of invasive species. These measures are designed to meet the guidance of Executive
Order 13112. With the project’s alteration of the project area to a more fully functioning
hydraulic condition, it is expected that non-native invasive plant species populations would
decline over time.

documented (design and mitigation measures 25 and 26).
District and Forest weed coordinators would ensure weed management follows Forest
Standards and protocols (design and mitigation measure 28).
Sources for gravel, dirt, rock, and other material hauled for the project would be from
weed-free sources (design and mitigation measures 26 and 27).
Inventory for new weed species (design and mitigation measure 28).

(USDA Forest Service 2001; Forest Service Handbook 2080), development and
implementation of a management plan, and adjustments of weed treatments as necessary
following coordination with the District/Forest weed coordinators and the Central Idaho
Level I Team (design and mitigation measure 28).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Recreation Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project on recreation within and adjacent to the project area. Recreation along the
Crooked River Road (Road 233) consists mostly of camping and fishing; the availability of
campsites is the primary concern of forest visitors to this area.
Developed Recreation Sites
A developed recreation site is a discrete area on a Forest that provides recreation opportunities,
receives recreational use, and requires a management investment to operate and/or maintain to
standard under the direction of an administrative unit in the National Forest System.
Recreation sites range in development from relatively undeveloped areas, with little to no
improvements (Development Scale 0 and 1), to concentrations of facilities and services
evidencing a range of amenities and investment (Development Scale 2 through 5).
Dispersed Recreation Sites
Dispersed recreation sites are sites with little investment and are at Development Scale of
0 through 1. Sites were identified in accordance with Region 1 primitive sites resource condition
survey methodology.
Groomed Snowmobile Trail System
Part of Road 233 and part of Deadwood Road (Road 1803) are on the Groomed Snowmobile
Trail System and constitute an important segment of Idaho State Snowmobile Area 25B.
Groomed snowmobile trails are shown in Figure 3-34.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
This analysis included review of Nez Perce National Forest Plan direction, GIS roads, trails,
dispersed recreation and developed recreation map layers, and existing field conditions.
An inventory of dispersed recreational sites was completed by the Forest Service in 2009 and
2010 (Hammer 2009, 2010). This inventory identified the location of 18 dispersed recreational
sites in the project area. Full details are in the project record.
The indicators used for each issue by alternative were:
•
•
•

Indicator A – Impact on developed recreation (number of sites)
Indicator B – Impact on dispersed recreation (number of sites)
Indicator C – Fishing access to Crooked River.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Existing Condition
Recreation use along Crooked River is moderate with most use occurring during the summer and
early fall. The Crooked River Road (Road 233) is a popular travel way for motorists on the
“Gold Rush Loop Tour” traveling from Crooked River to Elk City via Penman Hill and Dixie.
Winter use also occurs in the area, including snowmobiling on groomed snowmobile trail SNO1083 located on Road 1803. Campers along Road 233 use these dispersed recreation sites to
access Crooked River to fish and use the camp sites as a base camp to drive all-terrain vehicles
or sport utility vehicles on the Gold Rush Loop Tour to Orogrande Summit, Wildhorse Lake, and
into the hump corridor of the Gospel Hump Wilderness.
Developed Recreation

There are two developed recreation sites and one developed recreation loop tour in the project
area (see Figure 3-34). Campground 4 is at the upper end of the project area and is a designated
campground. Campground 3 is across Road 233 from Campground 4, and has a few dispersed
campsites and a toilet. The Gold Rush loop tour follows Road 233 along the entire project area
and identifies the interpretive sign for the Crooked River mill site at the mouth of the watershed.
Dispersed Recreation

There are currently 18 dispersed camping sites in the lower 2 valley miles of Crooked River (see
Table 3-43, Figure 3-34). Many of these sites are grouped and are located off three main access
routes from Road 233. Not all of the sites are likely to be used at the same time. Typically,
recreationists who use dispersed sites will distance themselves from other campers. Therefore,
only three or four of the dispersed sites would likely be used at any one time.

Fishing Access to Crooked River

Recreational fishing is a popular activity in Crooked River. Current access to fishing is by
parking on Road 233 shoulders or driving to the 18 dispersed recreational sites and walking to
the river.
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

No direct or indirect effects would occur to existing developed or dispersed recreation sites. The
existing access points would remain and the number of sites would not change. Fishing access to
Crooked River would not change.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action)

Short-term effects to developed and dispersed recreation sites would occur during the
implementation of the project. Campgrounds 3 and 4 and 18 dispersed sites would be closed
seasonally during construction of the proposed action (April through November), for up to
6 years.
Long term, the access points to the dispersed campsites in the lower 2 miles would remain the
same under this alternative. New dispersed sites would not physically be created; however, the
opportunity to camp within the same vicinity of the current dispersed camp sites would remain.
There would be no changes to the developed camp sites under this alternative. There would be
no long-term impacts to developed or dispersed recreation, as the proposed action would
maintain campsites in the project area.
Short-term effects to fishing access to Crooked River would be similar to effects to dispersed
recreational sites. Fish would be in the bypass channel, but the area closure would limit access
in the short term. Long-term fishing access would be similar to the existing condition.
Floodplain roughness may make access along Crooked River more difficult because of log
placement in the floodplain, but access points to the river would remain the same.

Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects area includes the Crooked River watershed (Figure 3-34). The
Orogrande Community Protection project overlaps and is adjacent to the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project area, and it is possible that the proposed action and the Orogrande project
could be implemented concurrently, possibly affecting all developed and dispersed recreation in
the Crooked River drainage. The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project
is upstream of the proposed action and would not occur at the same time. This would allow for
camping in either the Narrows or Meanders during the estimated 10-year construction period.

There are an additional 18 sites in the Crooked River Meanders project area (Table 3-43), and 12 sites in the Narrows Road

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Time Frame

The implementation period for the proposed action would overlap that of the Orogrande
Community Protection project. The proposed action and the proposed Crooked River Narrows
Road Improvement project, however, would not occur at the same time.
Past Actions

In the past, fire-suppression activities have included storage of hazardous fuels in dispersed sites
for several years before being burned or disposed of as fire wood.
No Action (Alternative 1)

No direct or indirect effects would occur to existing recreation resources, developed recreation,
dispersed recreation, or the groomed snowmobile trail system. Thus, there would be no
cumulative impacts on recreation resources.
Proposed Action (Alternative 2)

Table 3-45 and Figure 3-34 display recreation resources in the Crooked River and Deadwood
subwatersheds. The proposed action would impact three developed recreation sites and 18
dispersed recreation sites over a 6-year period. Design and mitigation measure 33 for Crooked
River proposes a 1-year public notice before the Meanders area is closed to the public (18
dispersed sites, three developed sites).
The proposed action and the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project could
impact as many as three developed recreation sites and 30 dispersed recreation sites total; these
projects, however, would not be implemented at the same time.
Implementation overlap of the proposed action and Orogrande Community Protection project
could impact as many as nine developed recreation sites and 30 dispersed recreation sites.
There would be short-term effects but no long-term effects to fishing access to Crooked River
under the proposed action. If the proposed action and the Orogrande Community Protection
project are implemented concurrently, there would be additional short-term effects to fishing
access to Crooked River if fuel-reduction activities restrict access to Crooked River.
If the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation and the Orogrande Community Protection projects
are implemented concurrently, the effects on dispersed and developed recreation sites would be
the same as described above for the proposed action.
There would be no direct, indirect, or cumulative effects to the 2 miles of the groomed
snowmobile trail on Forest Road 1803 during construction (seasonally for up to 2 years).

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Design and mitigation measures 33, 35, and 36 (see Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures)
would reduce the short-term effects to recreationists during project implementation. Notifying
the public 1 year in advance that the Meanders area, including Campgrounds 3 and 4, would be
closed to camping would allow for the public to find new camp sites. Keeping Road 233 open
would allow for campers to find campsites in the upper watershed, outside of the project area.
The proposed action would also maintain dispersed campsites in the Meanders upon completion
of the project and would not impact the designated campgrounds upon completion of the project.
This would allow recreationists who frequent the Meanders area to use the same or similar
campsites upon completion of the project.

The project would be consistent with Forest Plan recreation standards (USDA Forest Service
1987a, pp. II-15 and II-16 [forestwide] and pp. III-15 and III-16 [Management Area 7]). The
project would follow the visual quality objectives (VQOs) established in the American and
Crooked River Project Record of Decision and FEIS (USDA Forest Service 2005a). VQO
retention in the foreground at Campground 3 and 4 would be met under Alternatives 1 or 2.
The rest of the project area is considered VQO modification and would be met under
Alternatives 1 or 2 (see Table 3-46). Current scenic integrity level (SIL) is very low. Full details
on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Alternatives 1 or 2 would not change recreation opportunities in the project area. Alternative 1
would not change the condition of existing developed or dispersed recreation sites. Alternative 2
would maintain the same number of dispersed recreation sites in the Meanders, some physical
impacts at these sites would be treated, and the new floodplain would be planted with riparian
and uplands species.
Alternative 2 would plant a variety of riparian and upland species adjacent to both developed and
dispersed recreational sites. Figure 3-35 displays the Forest Plan’s visual quality objectives for
the project area and surrounding area.
Alternative 1 would not construct or maintain any new facilities. Alternative 2 would not change

Air Quality
Scope of Analysis
The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects analysis focuses on air quality within the project area
and the airsheds—that is, the part of the atmosphere that behaves in a similar manner in the
dispersion of emissions—that immediately surround the project area. The Crooked River and
Deadwood watersheds lie totally within North Idaho Airshed 13. This airshed encompasses the
area from the Idaho state boundary with Montana to the east, Oregon to the west, the North Fork
Clearwater – Lochsa hydrologic divide to the north, and the Salmon River to the south.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
The indicator used for this resource was particulate matter.
A “Decision Analysis for Smoke Modeling” was used to select the level of analysis from any
burning of slash piles that may occur (Story and Dzomba 2005). A threshold in this decision
analysis for particulate matter emission is established at 100 tons/year. This threshold is based
on the minimum increase required to establish the existence of a major source for noncompliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Since neither of the
alternatives in the analysis area approaches or exceeds 100 tons/year, no further analysis
is required.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Airshed 13 has no nonattainment areas (areas exceeding U.S. EPA NAAQS). Air quality within
the Crooked River area is considered good to excellent most of the year (NPCC 2005). Local
adverse effects result from occasional wildfires during the summer and fall, and prescribed
burning in the surrounding areas during spring and fall. Smoke from wildland and prescribed
fires usually drifts eastward and eventually into Montana. Restrictions on prescribed burning in
the Nez Perce National Forest have been imposed in the past because of adverse effects on air
quality in parts of western Montana. Smoke produced by wildland and prescribed fires in
upwind airsheds, including southern Idaho and eastern Oregon, has affected the air quality in the
Crooked River area in the past.
Locally, all major canyons are subject to temperature inversions, which trap smoke and
pollutants. Temperature inversions can occur anytime during the year, but are most common in
the fall.
Based on fire history information, the range of natural variability in the analysis area probably
ranged from very clear and clean during non-fire months (November to May) to hazy and smoky
for extended periods during the fire months (June to October). Current air quality in the analysis

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Air Quality

3-177

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

area during non-fire months is probably close to the range of natural variability, while during the
fire months, air quality is probably outside the natural range (i.e., clearer and cleaner), except
when large wildland fires are burning in the vicinity. This is because under current policy, most
wildland fires are suppressed, and therefore the amount of smoke has been greatly reduced from
previous historical levels.
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action) — No direct or indirect effects would occur on existing air quality
conditions under this alternative. No particulate matter would be produced and visibility would
not be impaired in any way.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) — Dust and vehicle emissions generated from road activities
and increased vehicle traffic during project construction would temporarily affect air quality
under the proposed action alternative. This alternative requires a greater amount of earthwork
and could result in a longer duration of temporary air quality effects. These temporary impacts
are not expected to violate any of the state standards. There would be no expected long-term
effects on air quality due to this alternative.
Cumulative Effects
Consideration of cumulative effects for air quality differs from the considerations for other
resource areas. Past activities in the analysis area are not considered, except when use of
existing roads and facilities may contribute to dust levels. The focus of the cumulative effects
analysis for air quality is the Crooked River and Deadwood watersheds.
The action alternative would have a minimal and short-term effect on air quality by increased
dust and vehicle emissions generated from road activities and increased vehicle traffic during
project construction. Current and future activities that could affect air quality in the Crooked
River watershed and would have a cumulative impact include potential prescribed burning
projects, including those outlined in the Orogrande Community Protection project and the
American and Crooked River Project (see Appendix C). However, mitigation measures and
procedures outlined in the North Idaho Smoke Management Memorandum of Agreement are
intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of communications about, and coordination
of, prescribed burning to avoid adverse cumulative effects. Present and future use of the analysis
area and activities in the analysis area would not change the current assessment of good to
excellent air quality, and therefore have no cumulative effect.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
To reduce potential impacts to air quality, mitigation measures #3, 22, and 51 would be
implemented. These measures would reduce the amount of dust produced from driving on roads
as well as potential smoke from burning wood chips.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with Nez Perce Forest Plan direction to cooperate with the Idaho
Department of Environmental Quality and Environmental Protection Agency for the protection
of air quality (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-23). Forest Plan direction also dictates
following the Clearwater and Nez Perce Fire Management Plan, which incorporates existing
interagency plans and assessments. The Montana/Idaho Airshed group is composed of state,
federal, tribal, and private member organizations who are dedicated to preserving the air quality
of Idaho and Montana. The Montana/Idaho Airshed Group Operating Guide (Montana/Idaho
Airshed Group 2010) is meant to provide accurate and reliable guidance to members of the
Group and contains pertinent agreements, guidelines, deadlines, plan, and procedures inherent to
successfully operating the Group smoke management program. The intent of the smoke
management program is to minimize or prevent smoke impacts while using fire to accomplish
land management objectives. The smoke management program is designed to help burners meet
Idaho and Montana regulatory requirements. Full details on consistency of the project with the
Forest Plan are located in the project record. The Nez Perce National Forest is a party to the
North Idaho Smoke Management Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which establishes
procedures to regulate the amount of smoke produced by prescribed fire. This MOA is intended
to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of communications about, and coordination of,
prescribed fire to avoid adverse effects on air quality.
Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 by the U.S. Congress and amended several times, is the
primary legal instrument for air resource management. The Clean Air Act amendments of 1977
established a process that includes designation of Class I and II areas for air quality management.
The primary differences between Class I and II areas are in the protection and processes
provided in the 1977 amendments. Class I areas receive the highest levels of protection under
the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program. This program regulates air quality in these
areas through application of numerical criteria for specific pollutants and use of the Best
Available Control Technology.
The Clean Air Act requires that the U.S. EPA identify pollutants that have adverse effects on
public health and welfare and establish air quality standards for each pollutant. Each state is also
required to develop an implementation plan to maintain air quality. The U.S. EPA has issued
NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and particulate
matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) and 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5).
Idaho has similar standards for these pollutants. In general, concentrations of PM10 greater than
150 micrograms per cubic meter for longer than 24 hours, or greater than 50 micrograms per
cubic meter as an annual arithmetic mean, are considered a hazard to public health and welfare.

Similarly, concentrations of PM2.5 greater than 65 micrograms per cubic meter for longer than
24 hours, or greater than 15 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual arithmetic mean, are
considered a hazard to public health and welfare.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would meet the requirements of the Clean Air
Act by following procedures outlined in the North Idaho Smoke Management MOA and
Montana/Idaho Airshed Group Operating Guide.

Mineral Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation proposed action on
mineral resources. The proposed action could change access to mineral claims, lode and placer
claim corners, or mineral resources within the project area. The minerals analysis area is the
same as the project area.
Cumulative Effects Area
The cumulative effects area is the Lower Crooked River, Relief Creek, Deadwood Creek, and
Campbell Creek subwatersheds.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Information presented in this analysis is summarized from the South Fork Clearwater River
Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998), the Design Criteria Report: Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), and American River Crooked River FEIS and
ROD (USDA Forest Service 2005a). In addition, a Bureau of Land Management mining claim
report was generated for use in this analysis.
The following assumption was used to estimate the number of lode claims: within each quarter
section, there can be up to eight individual 20-acre lode claims.
For this analysis, the project (Meanders) area includes Road 233 and adjacent sections.
The indicators that were used for each issue by alternative are:
•

Access to placer or lode mining claims – Yes/No.

•

Effect to placer or lode mining claim material – Narrative.

•

Protection or re-establishment of lode and placer claim corners – Yes/No.

•

Future reclamation bond cost – No change/Increase/Decrease.

•

Number of mining claims that could be impacted.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Historical Mining Use
From the 1930s through the 1950s the lower 2 miles of the Crooked River Valley was heavily
dredge mined, leaving behind large tailing piles and deep ponds throughout the valley bottom.
Gold and silver mining affected more than 6 miles of the river and approximately 200 acres of
the valley bottom. Major mining occurred in the Meanders area using the famous Mount Vernon
dredge (Figure 3-36). For more information, see Chapter 3, Cultural Resources.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Current Mining Use
There are no patented mining claims in the Meanders area (RDG 2012).
There are two types of unpatented mining claims on Forest Service lands: lode and placer. Lode
claims are for veins or lodes or other rock in place, bearing metallic or certain other valuable
deposits, and may not exceed 1,500 feet in length along the vein or lode and may not be more
than 300 feet on each side of the middle of the vein at the surface. Adits, shafts, or open pits are
features typically found on lode claims. Placer claims are for valuable minerals that occur in
other than vein or lode form, such as in sand and gravel deposits containing particles of gold.
Techniques for removal include panning or sluice box and can range from small to large scale.
Within each quarter of a section, there can be up to eight individual 20-acre placer claims.
There are approximately 3 placer and 24 lode unpatented mining claims in the Meanders area
(Figure 1 of RDG [2012]), within 6 quarter sections (Hughes 2013).
There are two proposed Plans of Operation on file with the Forest Service in the project area:
one along Road 233 and throughout the Crooked River watershed, and one in the Deadwood
subwatershed (see Appendix C).
Other mining activities that have occurred in the past include “recreation suction dredging”
permitted by the State of Idaho. Tributaries to the South Fork Clearwater River have been closed
to suction dredging since at least 2009 (IDWR 2013a, 2013b). The South Fork Clearwater River
and tributaries are also closed to suction dredging by the EPA (USDI-EPA 2013). It is unknown
how long these closures may continue. Gold panning, which has not been regulated by the Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests, occurs on a small scale. Permits for large-scale mining
could be authorized following an environmental analysis.
Access to current placer or lode mining claims is provided through a variety of methods
including existing roads, trails, or non-motorized methods.
Access to Mineral Claims, Claim Corners, and Mineral Resources
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current access to 3 placer and 24 lode mining
claims in the Meanders area (see Table 3-47). Under this alternative there would be no change to
the existing tailings piles and no effect to mining claim access or mineral resources in the
project area.
There would be no effect to existing mineral claim corners.
No change to future reclamation bonds would occur.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Mineral Resources

3-183

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would have a short-term direct effect on access to mining
claims and mineral resources in the Meanders area (see Table 3-47).
During implementation there would be an area closure established in in the Meanders area (see
Chapter 2, design and mitigation measure 33). Claim holders would have to find an alternative
access during implementation of the Meanders. Construction of the temporary haul/access road
would reduce impacts to the mining claimants and the public by maintaining access on Road 233
during construction activities (see Chapter 2, design and mitigation measure 49); however,
access to existing claims in the Meanders area would be limited for up to 6 years (2015 to 2021).
Access to mining claims with or without an approved Plan of Operation would also be restricted
during implementation over a 6-year period. This would be a short-term impact.
Existing dredge piles (placer claims) would be moved during implementation to reconstruct the
stream and floodplain. Dredge materials are not expected to be moved outside a quarter section
area. This would be a short-term and long-term effect to the existing mining claims.
Future reclamation bonding would increase, reflecting the surface conditions (stream channel
and floodplain) following implementation of Alternative 2. All existing lode mining claim
corners would be protected or re-established to their original locations if they are moved during
the implementation (see Chapter 2, design and mitigation measure 32).

Cumulative Effects
Past and Ongoing Actions

The evidence of past mining activities is most visible in the Meanders area. There have been no
Plans of Operations for at least 5 years; as a result, there are no current disturbances by miners
for the removal of mineral resources.
Crooked River and tributaries to the South Fork Clearwater River are closed to suction dredging
by the State of Idaho since 2009. The South Fork Clearwater River is open by the State of Idaho
for suction dredging for about one month annually (July 15 to August 15). However, the South
Fork Clearwater River and all tributaries are closed by EPA to suction dredging (IDWR 2013a;
IDWR 2013b; USDI-EPA 2013).
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effect to access to mineral claims, claim corners,
or mineral resources in the project area, and would therefore have no cumulative effect.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 and the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would have a
short-term effect on access to mining claims on or adjacent to Road 233 but no effect to longterm access, and would therefore have no cumulative effect. Claim corners would be protected or
re-established.

Foreseeable Actions

Two proposed Plans of Operation are on file with the USDA Forest Service – Premium and Gold
Zone (Appendix C). The proposals are for exploratory drilling within the Meanders area,
adjacent to the Meanders area, and in the Deadwood subwatershed. These projects are planned
to be implemented (2014–2015) at the same time as the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project (2015–2024); however, there is no decision to implement at this time. Coordination
under the approval of a Plan of Operation would be needed regarding access and activities in the
project areas.
The Orogrande Community Protection project would have no effect on access to mining claims,
corners, or mineral resources (USDA Forest Service 2013a draft).
Suction dredging mining activities in the project area and downstream are dependent on project
consultation with NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the protection of
threatened and endangered fish and their habitat.
The action alternative would not restrict or control mining location or methods in the project
area. Although the proposed action could result in disturbance to individual claims, there are no
other current or foreseeable activities that would result in cumulative effects on mineral
resources in the project area.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Impacts to access to existing mineral claims would be reduced by design and mitigation
measures 32, 33, 49, and 50 (see Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures). These measures
would provide protection to established mining claim corners. The public and mining claimants
would be notified of project activities as they are implemented. The temporary haul/access road
and closure periods would reduce impacts to claimants who are traveling on Roads 233, 522,
or 1803.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The national forest land administered by the Nez Perce National Forest has been divided into
26 management areas, each with different management goals, resource potentials, and
limitations. Management Area 4 (MA 4) deals with mineral resources. The Forest Plan could
not predict where, when, and what kinds of minerals development might be proposed, nor
specific needs for surface resources. Therefore, MA 4 is not site specific, but applies to any area
that consists of active or recently active mining extraction and processing operations. The goal
of MA 4 is to “[e]ncourage valid exploration and development of mineral resources, while at the
same time minimizing surface impacts from those activities” (USDA Forest Service 1987a).
Specific standards for water resources in MA 4 are to meet established fishery/water quality
objectives for all “prescription watersheds” (USDA Forest Service 1987a). Forest Plan
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Mineral Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Amendment No. 3 (USDA Forest Service1989) makes changes and adds the following
statements to the Forest Plan, which apply to this project:
•

Page II-23 of Forest Plan: Approximately 56 percent of the Nez Perce National Forest is
open to mineral entry under the general mining laws with no restrictions other than valid
existing rights and such surface resource protection measures as may be required under
36 CFR 228.

•

Page III-11 of the Forest Plan, Management Area 4: The stated goal is to encourage
exploration and development of mineral resources, while at the same time minimizing
surface impacts from those activities.

•

Appendix O-16 of the Forest Plan, Item 2m: The monitoring plan will be a tracking
mechanism to make sure that operating plans and bonds accurately reflect the current
level of activity, that reclamation work is properly completed and the bond returned upon
cessation of mining, and that a reasonable degree of uniformity is maintained.

Within the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area there are no lands considered to be
managed as Management Area 4 at this time.
The Forest Plan’s forestwide standards for minerals resources would be met for this project
(USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-23). Reasonable access would be provided to prospect,
explore, develop, and produce mineral resources for general access to a claim but does not apply
to the project for mining that would create a significant disturbance since there are no current
approved Plans of Operation in the project area. Details on consistency of the project with the
Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Alternative 1 (No Action) would not change existing access to minerals claims. Alternative 2
would change existing access during implementation in the Meanders area for up to 6 years.
Long-term access would remain the same as exists currently.
Claimants (lode and placer claims) were notified about this project and received a copy of the
scoping letter for comment. Permission is not required to enter any of the claims associated with
this project since none of the claims have recognized surface rights.
Other Laws and Regulations
Several laws regulate exploration or mining on National Forest System lands. The Organic
Administration Act requires the Forest Service, as the land manager, to minimize environmental
impacts without materially interfering with a mining claimant’s rights under the General Mining
Laws. Since mining is a legitimate use of the national forest, the Forest Service is mandated to
integrate the development and use of minerals with the use of other resources to the extent
possible under the laws governing minerals disposal.
Forest Service regulations (36 CFR 228, Subpart A) give the authorized national forest officer
the authority to approve Plans of Operation and to require claimants to take measures to prevent
adverse impacts from occurring as a result of their mining activities. Mining claimants are
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Mineral Resources

3-187

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

required to conduct operations in an environmentally sound manner in conformance with these
regulations and with their approved Plan of Operations. While the Forest Service may influence
aspects of an operation that affect surface resources, it may not prevent mining claimants from
exercising their statutory right to enter upon their claims to search for and extract minerals.
Provided that the land in question is open to mineral entry, the Forest Service has no regulatory
basis to prohibit legitimate mining activities. There are two proposed Plans of Operation in the
project area, but they have not been approved at this time.
The Forest Service is required by law to provide reasonable access to valid existing mineral
rights, regardless of their form, whether it be an unpatented claim, lease, or private property
(such as a patented claim), or subsurface mineral right. An unpatented claim is an implied
property right that can be held, sold, or inherited, and access is regulated under the Mining Law
of 1872. Rights are restricted to the extraction and development of a mineral deposit. No land
ownership is conveyed under these claims. Patented claims are private property, in which the
federal government has passed its title to the claimant, giving the claimant title to the locatable
minerals and, in most cases, the surface and all resources. There are no patented claims in the
project area. Only unpatented federal mining claims exist in the project area. Reasonable access
to mining claims would be provided under the proposed action (Alternative 2).
A mining claim creates a possessory interest in the land, which may be bartered, sold,
mortgaged, or transferred by law, in whole or in part, as any other real property. A locator
acquires rights against other possible locators when the locator has complied with the applicable
federal and state laws. The claimant has the right to dispose of all locatable minerals on a
mining claim. The proposed action (Alternative 2) would not change the right of the mining
claimant to dispose of locatable minerals from an existing mining claim.
The Forest Service must respect claims and claimants’ property by taking precautions to avoid
damage to claim corner markers, excavations, and other mining improvements and equipment.
The claimant has a number of other rights, including: reasonable access to the claim; the right to
use the surface for prospecting, mining, and processing (but not exclusive possession); the use of
timber as necessary for the mining operation; and the right to clear timber as necessary for
mining (claimant cannot sell the timber). Design and mitigation measures have been developed
for the action alternative to protect claim corner markers. There are no currently approved
excavations, mining equipment, or improvements that have been identified in the project area.

Transportation
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project alternatives
on transportation.
The proposed project may impact public access on Road 233 during and following
implementation.
Public comments about the transportation system were focused on the Narrows Road proposed
action. Some public comments identified concerns about the proposed improvements
(aggregate), safety of traveling on roadways, and the cost of activities. There were specific
concerns about impacts to access from State Highway 14 to the community of Orogrande. The
community of Orogrande is accessed via road by Road 233 (Crooked River) or, alternatively, by
Roads 1803 (Wheeler Mountain Road), 522 (Deadwood Road), and 233 (Crooked River Road)
(see Figure 1-1). See Chapter 2, Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study,
for more information.
Analysis Area
The analysis area includes roads in the project area, specifically Road 233.
Cumulative Effects Area
The cumulative effects area is the same as the analysis area.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Information from preliminary design products was used for basic inventory and analysis. In
addition, for matters related to jurisdiction, discussions were held with the Idaho County
road manager.
The indicators used for each issue were:
•

Indicator A – Traffic delays. Amount and timing of delays from construction traffic on
Road 233 (time of year).

•

Indicator B – Safety of traveling on roadways (Roads 233).

•

Indicator C – Cost of improvements (dollars, funding source).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Transportation

3-189

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Indicator A – Traffic Delays
Existing Condition

There are no current traffic delays along Road 233 adjacent to the Meanders.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current access on Roads 233. Alternative 2
(Proposed Action) would cause some short-term delays as equipment and supplies are mobilized
into the Meanders area. This would occur over a short duration (e.g., week-long) period during
spring or summer and again in late fall when equipment is moved out of the area. The
construction of the temporary access road and bypass channel would reduce delays and maintain
access on Road 233 during implementation. Implementation could take multiple years.
Cumulative Effects

Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effect on traffic delays and, therefore, no
cumulative effect.
Short-term adverse effects of traffic delays would be present under Alternative 2 or the proposed
Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. Other ongoing road treatment activities,
such as surfacing placement or culvert maintenance, may also cause traffic delays. Because no
other construction is proposed at the same time (2015–2021), there would be no cumulative
effects.
Indicator B – Safety of Traveling on Roadways (Road 233)
Existing Condition

All roads accessing Orogrande are single-lane roadways.
The existing Road 233 has limited vehicle turnouts available to allow for opposing traffic to
pass. This is especially the case in the section through the Narrows. In addition, due to the close
proximity of Crooked River to Road 233 through the Narrows, seasonal flood flows can erode
the roadway shoulder, causing roadway widths to be reduced. Existing grades on Road 233 are
generally mild with most of the length being less than 5% gradient.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effects to safely traveling on Road 233 because
no construction would occur. The existing conditions on roadways would continue.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Transportation

3-190

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 would have construction traffic present on the lower 2 miles of Road 233 for up to
6 years. This construction traffic would pose an incremental risk to traveling the roadway.
Several design and mitigation measures have been developed to mitigate these risks (23, 33, 49,
and 50). Design and mitigation measure 23 would complete maintenance of Road 233 to offset
construction-induced impacts during implementation (see Chapter 2). Design and mitigation
measure 33 would notify the public when the Meanders construction activities are going to
occur, including construction signing (see Chapter 2). Design and mitigation measure 49 would
minimize construction traffic by constructing a temporary access road that would reduce the
direct effects to the public. Design and mitigation measure 50 would clear debris and equipment
off Road 233 as the project is implemented.
Cumulative Effects

Past actions, including construction of Roads 233, 522, and 180, have resulted in the current
location of roads to be maintained by the Forest Service or Idaho County. Traveling on these
roads has some inherent risks because of their current location, grade, and alignment.
Ongoing activities that affect safety of traveling on these roads are regular road maintenance
activities conducted by Idaho County on Road 233 and by the Forest Service on Roads 1803
and 522.
The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project occurs in the project area and would be
implemented from 2014 to 2019. Hauling of material and equipment on Road 233 could affect
the safety of traveling on Road 233 (USDA Forest Service 2013 draft); however, design and
mitigation measures developed for both projects would reduce this potential cumulative effect.
The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project is upstream of the project area
(Appendix C). This action would provide incremental improvements for safety of traveling on
roadways to access Orogrande on Road 233 through the Narrows to provide additional turnouts
and reduced shoulder erosion. Condition of Road 233 in the Narrows area along 3.5 miles would
be incrementally improved in the road condition through the Narrows. Less seasonal flooding of
the surface would occur. The Narrows project would be implemented after the Meanders
project.
Indicator C – Cost of Improvements (Dollars, Funding Source)
Existing Condition

No improvements are ongoing at this time. Road maintenance costs depend on jurisdiction and
maintenance responsibilities.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Estimated costs and funding sources for the alternatives are presented in Table 3-48.
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Transportation

Alternative 1 (No Action) would not result in direct investment for improvements.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) is estimated to cost $2,500,000 to complete stream channel and

Cumulative Effects

Implementation of the proposed action or the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road
Improvement project (estimated cost, $1,498,000) has the potential to benefit the local economy
through the development of construction-based jobs and purchasing of construction materials,
fuel, and other local products. In conjunction with other construction-based projects in the local
area, these projects have the potential to contribute to the economy.
Road Surfacing
Cumulative Effects

There are no past, ongoing, or future foreseeable actions that would change the mileage of
aggregate surfacing on roads in the project area.
The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would directly and
incrementally increase the amount of roadway with aggregate surfacing on Road 233.
Cumulatively, this would result in approximately 8 miles of aggregate surface on Road 233.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Design and mitigation measures 23, 33, 49, and 50 (see Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation
Measures) would reduce impacts to the public or the transportation system from the proposed
action (Alternative 2). The effectiveness of these measures is dependent upon implementation.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would meet Nez Perce National Forest Plan standards (forestwide and management
areas) for roads, trails, and transportation (USDA Forest Service 1987a).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Transportation

3-192

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The economics of proposed access developments have been analyzed using proven tools, and
these have been incorporated into the project design. Maintenance of roads in the project area
would continue at current levels (commensurate with use, user type, user safety, and facilityresource protection), dependent upon jurisdiction. The action alternative would meet the
standard to plan, design, and manage all access to meet land and resource management
objectives, State Water Quality Standards, and best management practices.
Impacts from construction would be minimized in identified key riparian and wildlife areas, as
described in Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures. Alternative 2 has been developed to
minimize effects to key riparian and wildlife areas from proposed activities (see Chapter 3,
Aquatic Resources, Water Resources, and Wildlife Resources). Alternative 2 would reduce
impacts or improve conditions in riparian areas. Standards for mitigation of sedimentation
would also be met. Construction and maintenance would provide public access to interpretive
facilities (see Chapter 3, Cultural Resources).
Other Laws and Regulations
The National Forest Roads and Trails Act of October 13, 1964, as amended, authorizes road and
trail systems for the national forests. The Act also authorizes granting of easements across
National Forest System (NFS) lands, construction and financing of maximum economy roads
(FSM 7705), and imposition of requirements on road users for maintaining and reconstructing
roads, including cooperative deposits for that work.
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 7700 enumerates the authority, objectives, policy, responsibility,
and definitions for planning, construction, reconstruction, operation, and maintenance of forest
transportation facilities and for management of motor vehicle use on NFS lands (USDA Forest
Service 2010b). The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project proposed action is consistent
with this policy.
The Travel Management rule (70 FR 216) requires each National Forest to formally designate
those roads, trails, and areas where summer motorized travel is permitted and to show them on a
Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Once the rule is implemented, motorized travel will be
permitted only on the roads, trails, and areas shown on the MVUM. The Designated Routes and
Areas for Motor Vehicle Use (DRAMVU) FEIS and ROD are expected to be released in 2014
for the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests. Depending on the alternative selected in the
FEIS/ROD, the DRAMVU project decision would: eliminate cross-country travel on the Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests by permitting motorized use on designated roads and trails,
except snowmobiles; implement seasonal closures on some roads and trails in Management Area
16 (Elk and Deer Winter Range) and 21 (Moose Winter Range), and other areas; add up to five
new trail connectors to create loop opportunities; identify motorized access for dispersed
camping from roads and trails; and eliminate motorized use on some roads and trails to minimize
resource damage, reduce conflicts, and provide a full array of recreation opportunities. Within

the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, the DRAMVU decision could potentially
change access prescriptions on Roads 233, 522, 1803, and spur roads; and eliminate motorized
cross-country travel.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project proposed action would meet Forest Plan
standards, moving forest resources toward the goals and objectives described in the Forest Plan,
and the project’s compliance with all state and federal regulations would minimize effects on
Forest resources.

Social and Economic Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the proposed action on social and economic resources.
The project area is the Crooked River and Deadwood watersheds. The geographical and social
scope of the analysis, as well as the cumulative effects area, is the Clearwater River subbasin
(Idaho, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Lewis, and Latah counties).

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Existing social and economic data were summarized from the Clearwater River subbasin Climate
Change Adaptation Plan (Clark and Harris 2011). The five-county region has a population of
about 104,496, with Nez Perce County having the highest population (39,211) in 2009. Idaho
County is the 19th most populous county in Idaho and the largest county in total area.
Population levels have increased by about 12% from 1990 to 2009 in Idaho County. Median age
ranged from 27.9 in Latah County to 42.5 in Lewis County. Median age increased in all of the
counties from 1990 to 2009.
Employment was chosen as an indicator relative to Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 32), potential
effect on minority and low-income populations. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project area is in Idaho County, Idaho, and within the Nez Perce Tribe ceded lands.
Recreation-based economics was chosen as an indicator based on a comment received during
scoping of the proposed action.
The indicators that were used for each issue by alternative were:
•

Indicator A – Employment

•

Indicator B – Recreation-based economics.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Indicator A – Employment
Affected Environment

The most recent income data for the Clearwater River subbasin is from 2000 (Census data).
Average income in 2000 ranged from $14,411 in Idaho County to $18,544 in Nez Perce County
(Clark and Harris 2011). Figure 3-39 provides the household income distribution of the
Clearwater subbasin in 2000.

Figure 3-39. Household income distribution for Clearwater River Subbasin, 2000
(Clark and Harris 2011).
Employment within the Clearwater River subbasin is categorized as non-service (farming,
mining, construction, agriculture), service (transportation, retail, financial services, and
wholesale), and government. Non-service and government employment make up about 17.6%
and 22.5% of the working population, respectively, while service employment accounts for
58.5% of the population in 2009 (Clark and Harris 2011). 1 Since 2000, non-service employment
has decreased from 23%, service employment has increased from 53%, and government
employment has decreased from 23.6%.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current management in the Clearwater River
subbasin and would not impact the economics or social status of the area. No short-term
increase in jobs or secondary economic activities would be created.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) could create a short-term increase in job opportunities, and
secondary economic activity would be indirectly supported during construction. Job
opportunities are directly related to construction jobs created by the proposed action, including
jobs for minorities and low-income populations. Secondary economic activity includes
purchasing supplies locally, lodging, purchasing fuel, and other such activities. However, the
proposed action is unlikely to result in a measurable effect on poverty, unemployment, or income
rates in the subbasin.

It is noted that these percentages add up to 98% instead of 100%, but these are as listed in Clark and Harris (2011).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Indicator B – Recreation-Based Economics
Affected Environment

In the Clearwater River subbasin, recreation is an important social component of the lifestyles of
the local residents, and access to recreational facilities is highly important. More than two-thirds
of the subbasin is forested, with most of the forested lands being federally managed. In 2009,
20% of jobs in the subbasin were in the travel and recreation-related businesses (Clark and
Harris 2011). In Idaho, more than 5% of gross state product is from tourism and recreation
services and retail sales.
The project area is a popular recreation area for camping, fishing, wildlife viewing, and firewood cutting. The Meanders area offers both developed and dispersed recreational camping
opportunities. Fishing access in Crooked River is by foot or from a few spur roads that go to
campsites. The Narrows Road area provides direct access to Crooked River, although the road is
narrow and has few pullouts for parking or camping.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current recreation opportunities and not provide
an overall improvement of fish habitat in the Crooked River watershed.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would improve overall fish habitat in the Crooked River
watershed, which would indirectly improve angling opportunities in Crooked River and the
South Fork Clearwater River in the long term. Access to Crooked River for angling
opportunities would be improved by the removal of the dredge tailing piles. Currently, the river
is closed to salmon and steelhead fishing. Anglers can fish for cutthroat trout, whitefish, and
other non-listed species. By providing better overhead cover, instream complexity, and food
sources for the fish, localized populations are likely to increase.
The South Fork Clearwater River is open seasonally for spring Chinook salmon and steelhead
fishing. The duration of the fishing season is dependent on the number of fish returning to the
South Fork Clearwater River. Adult Chinook salmon numbers returning to Crooked River range
from around 350 fish to about 800 fish annually (IDFG 2010b, 2011, 2012). Of these, only
about 30 fish are allowed to pass above the weir because of the Idaho Supplementation Studies;
half of those were females or an undetermined sex. Annual redd counts in the watershed ranged
from 4 to 17 from 2007 to 2011 (Table 3-49), which corresponds to the number of females and
unknown sexes that were passed above the weir. With the completion of the Idaho
Supplementation Study in 2013, more fish may be allowed to pass above the weir. Coupled with
an increase in spawning habitat from the proposed action, the potential for more adult Chinook
salmon in returning to the upper South Fork Clearwater would potentially provide greater
angling opportunities for these fish.

Stocking efforts in the Crooked River watershed are changing from spring Chinook salmon to
summer Chinook salmon. In 2012, 220,000 summer Chinook were released in Crooked River
(Becky Johnson, NPT, pers. comm.). It has not been determined by the IDFG and Tribe
Production Division how many summer Chinook fish will be passed above the weir after the
brood stock fish are collected. It is possible that the project area could be reseeded with fish
passed above the weir, and upon completion of the restoration, there would be about four times
as much spawning habitat to support an increased number of returning adults. This could
provide a summer Chinook fishing season in the South Fork Clearwater River in the long term,
which would boost recreation-based economics in the area.
Short-term impacts to recreational activities would be felt in the project area during construction
and for a few years upon completion. The project area would be closed seasonally during
construction, which would limit camping and recreation activities in the project area. The same
number of dispersed and developed campsites would remain in the project area and would be
accessible upon completion of the project (see Chapter 3, Recreation Resources). Other areas in
the Clearwater River subbasin would remain open for camping and fishing.
Cumulative Effects
Neither the proposed action nor the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project
is anticipated to generate a cumulative effect on social trends such as population or age, minority
status, or income. The anticipated impacts are not in themselves substantial enough to contribute
to changes in the social resources of the project area.
Neither the proposed action nor the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project
is anticipated to generate a cumulative effect on poverty levels, per capita income, or
employment rates. Implementation of the projects may contribute to short-term cumulative
increases in local incomes if several local firms are select at the same time to implement ongoing activities in the national forest, such as stream restoration, timber harvest, weed
treatments, road work, and ongoing fisheries studies. Implementation of the projects may
contribute to short-term cumulative increases in secondary benefits if several contracts are
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Social and Economic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

awarded at the same time, generating demand for local goods and services. The projects would
take up to 10 years to complete.
Recreation and angling opportunities would continue in the project area and in the Clearwater
River subbasin. Other campsites may be closed within the Crooked River watershed during the
area closure for the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project; however,
since many other campsites exist within the vicinity of Crooked River and in the Clearwater
River subbasin, no cumulative effects to recreation-based economics are expected.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
There are no mitigation or design measures for social and economic effects.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would meet the Nez Perce National Forest Plan forestwide goals and standards for
social and economic resources (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-1and II-24). The project
would provide a sustained yield of resource outputs at a level that would help support the
economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs. Outputs
relevant to this project—recreation opportunities, jobs, purchasing supplies locally, lodging,
purchasing fuel, and other such activities—have been analyzed. Alternatives have been
evaluated that emphasize intrinsic ecological and economic wildlife values. Analysis of the
economics of proposed changes to access developments was completed.
Other Laws and Regulations
Environmental Justice

Executive Order 12898 requires analysis of the impacts of the proposed action and alternatives to
the proposed action on minority and low-income populations. The order is designed in part
“…to identify, prevent, and/or mitigate, to the extent practicable, disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of the United States Department of Agriculture
programs and activities on minority and low income populations…”
Neither of the project alternatives is expected to negatively affect the civil rights of minorities,
American Indians, women, or any United States citizen. Consultation with the Nez Perce Tribe
has been ongoing since 2012. No environmental health hazards are expected to result from
implementation of either alternative. Income levels would not be affected by this project.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Social and Economic Resources

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Short-Term Uses and Long-Term Productivity
The National Environmental Policy Act requires consideration of “the relationship between
short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the Congress, this includes using all practicable
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to
foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and
nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements
of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101).
An evaluation of the relationship between the local short-term uses of the human environment
and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity discloses the trade-offs between
short-term adverse impacts and long-term benefits of the proposed project. Short-term impacts,
disruptions, and uses of the local environment may be worthwhile if there are long-term benefits
to the environment resulting from the actions.
Short-term uses of and impacts on the local environment are associated with the construction of
the project and are listed below. Discussions of these impacts are documented in the
Environmental Consequences section for each resource in Chapter 3. Many of these impacts
could be minimized with the application of design and mitigation measures, as recommended in
Chapter 2.
The short-term adverse effects that could be caused by the proposed project include:
•

Increased turbidity in Crooked River due to instream restoration work and culvert
replacement/removal

•

Increased water temperature due to riparian vegetation removal for channel
reconstruction and temporary bypass construction

•
•
•

Disturbance of individual fish and macroinvertebrates
Disturbance of existing wetlands
Modification of wildlife species habitat and distributions of sensitive and management
indicator wildlife species
Adverse effects due to direct mortality or displacement of individuals, or even loss of
habitat (western toad)
Changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive plant species
Increased dust and vehicle emissions
Burying of existing rock, soil, and vegetation by regrading of mining dredge tailings
Exposure of locatable minerals.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The long-term benefits to be gained through the implementation of the proposed project include
the following:
•
•
•

Recovery of natural processes in the Crooked River floodplain, which would improve
habitat conditions (cover and forage) for many of the wildlife species using this area
Decreased soil compaction and surface erosion problems in the watershed
Improved fish habitat due to reduction in sediment yield, increased pool habitat quality,
and improved health of the riparian plant community

•

Reduced water temperatures in Crooked River with potential attainment of water
temperature criteria and removal from the §303(d) list for temperature impairment.

•

Improved habitat quality for wildlife.

Unavoidable Adverse Effects
Under Alternative 2, there would be a small impact on fish within the project area and
downstream to the South Fork Clearwater River. Efforts would be made to work within the fish
“window” as designated by the USFWS and NMFS, and to reduce sediment and turbidity during
construction. Fish would be provided migratory passage for the duration of the project.
Under Alternative 2, there would be unavoidable and adverse short-term increases in water
temperature due to removal of existing riparian vegetation for channel reconstruction and
temporary bypass channel construction.
Under Alternative 2, there would be direct mortality to adult western toads, egg masses, tadpoles,
and juveniles during construction of the temporary bypass channel and dewatering/rechanneling
of existing open water ponded environments; construction of the temporary bypass road;
dewatering of the main Crooked River channel; dewatering of the temporary bypass channel;
regrading/reshaping of the valley bottom, stream channel, and tailing piles; and equipment
traffic. The alternative is consistent with Forest Plan direction to the extent that proposed
management actions would not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive wildlife
populations.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
Irreversible commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction
of a species or the removal of mined ore. Irretrievable commitments are those that are lost for a
period of time such as the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested areas that are kept
clear for use as a power line right-of-way or road.
Alternative 2 would result in the irreversible and irretrievable use of historic properties. Mining
waste and associated artifacts are not only physical representations of history, they—even when
newly created—give a visual sense of history. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act makes reference to this visual sense of history when allowing that historic properties may
still be eligible for listing even when they have been newly modified, as long as they maintain

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

3-201

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

their visual sense of place. Nowhere is this more applicable than to historic mining areas, known
as historic vernacular landscapes. The mining waste and associated artifacts are irretrievable.
Once removed from their contextual resting places, artifacts lose their archaeological value as
information resources, and if restoration were to take place, the inability to recreate the tailings
piles exactly as they were would be irreversible.
Human resources would be used for the construction and maintenance of the project. Economic
commitments are also an irretrievable investment. The estimated approximate cost of the
preferred alternative is $2.5 million. Funds have already been committed and spent for planning,
design, environmental studies, and completing the environmental impact statement.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would commit an undetermined amount of fossil fuels in order
to transport material and implement other activities.
The project implementation would result in some loss of fish and wildlife habitat and
displacement of fish and wildlife during construction. Stream habitat lost would be replaced by
construction of a new channel. Wetland habitats and their associated functions and values lost as
a result of the project would be replaced.
Proposed project activities would modify wildlife species habitat and would result in short-term
changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive and management indicator wildlife
species. The project would result in some loss of wildlife habitat and displacement of wildlife
species during implementation of project activities. There would be an irretrievable commitment
of resources with the loss of potential breeding sites (ponds) for western toads.
Proposed project activities would modify sensitive plant species habitat and would result in
short-term changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive plant species. However,
long-term habitat conditions would not be irretrievably or irreversibly lost.
The loss of native vegetation to new or expanding weed infestations would be a possible
irretrievable effect if active restoration to native species is not pursued. Intensive invasive
treatments and native plant restoration work would improve habitats and plant communities,
which would minimize and avoid irreversible effects.
The commitment of resources is based on the belief that the condition of the natural environment
in the watershed would be improved by the proposed project. The primary benefits would be
improved fish habitat and water quality.

contacts with specific resource specialists. A summary of public involvement is listed above in
Table 4-3. Scoping letters were sent to interested agencies, publics, organizations in December
2012, and to mining claimants in May 2013. The mailing list is located in the project record.

Tribal Consultation
In December 2012, a scoping letter was sent to inform the Nez Perce Tribe of the upcoming
analysis, and to solicit comments related to proposed activities. Informal consultation was
initiated with the Nez Perce Tribe at the Quarterly Meeting in January 2013.

Federal and State Consultation
Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) – National Marine Fisheries Service was initiated in February 2013.
Biological assessments for federally listed fish, wildlife, and plants are being prepared and are
located in the project record. Consultation will be completed prior to making a decision.
The Forest will consult with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Idaho Department of Water
Resources to obtain any necessary permits related to streams, wetlands, and floodplains prior to
implementation.

Investigations used for this analysis meet requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act
and provisions of the Programmatic Agreement between the Idaho State Historic Preservation
Office and Region 1 of the USDA Forest Service. The Cultural Resource Inventory Report will
be sent to the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office and consultation will be completed prior
to making a decision.

Laws and Regulations
As part of this analysis for this project, the IDT evaluated various alternatives under the laws,
regulations, and requirements relating to federal natural resource management. Several of the
design and mitigation measures presented in Chapter 2 were developed and incorporated to
ensure that these requirements would be met. Additional details can be found in Chapter 1
(Regulatory Framework), Chapter 2 (Design and Mitigation Measures), Chapter 3 (by resource),
and/or the project record. Chapter 1 contains information on the Nez Perce Forest Plan
Direction, and Tribal Treaty Rights. The project record has a full description of Forest Plan
consistency, by resource.

Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 and amended numerous times since then, is the primary legal
authority governing air quality management. This Act provides the framework for national,
state, and local efforts to protect air quality. This project is not expected to have impacts to air
quality. The Montana/Idaho State Airshed Group was formed to coordinate all prescribed
burning activities in order to minimize or prevent impacts from smoke emissions and ensure
compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the federal agency charged with enforcing the Clean
Air Act. The project area lies totally within North Idaho Airshed 13. No smoke emissions
would occur with this project. See Chapter 3, Air Quality, for more information.

Clean Water Act
Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state,

satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including compaction, displacement,
rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, and mass wasting) shall be less than 15% of an activity
area. In areas where more than 15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the
cumulative detrimental effects from proposed activities, including restoration, shall not exceed
the conditions prior to the proposed activity and should move toward a net improvement in soil
quality. Project design criteria would ensure that soil quality standards are met.
Appendix D describes, in detail, a proposed project-specific Forest Plan amendment adopting
Region 1 soils standards that would be included in Alternative 2 in this DEIS. The following
amendment to Nez Perce Forest Plan Soil Quality Standard #2, specific to the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area, is proposed: “Where detrimental soil conditions from past
activities affect 15 percent or less of the activity area, a cumulative minimum of 85 percent of the
activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddle upon completion of
activities. Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15 percent of
the activity area, the cumulative detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) from project implementation
and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a
net improvement in soil quality.” See Chapter 3, Soil Resources, and Appendix D for more
information.

Endangered Species Act
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2670 (USDA Forest Service 2005a) directs the Forest Service to
conserve endangered and threatened species and to utilize its authorities in furtherance of the
Endangered Species Act (ESA), and to avoid actions that may cause a species to become
threatened or endangered. FSM 2670 also requires the Forest Service to maintain viable
populations of all native and desirable non-native wildlife, fish, and plant species in habitats
distributed throughout their geographic range on NFS lands. As directed by the ESA, biological
assessments and consultation under Section 7 of the ESA will be completed for this decision.
The action alternative is not expected to result in a jeopardy biological opinion for any listed
species. See Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, Wildlife Resources, and Rare Plants, for more
information.

Executive Orders 11988 and 11990
These federal executive orders (EOs) provide for the protection and management of floodplains
and wetlands. Numerous floodplains and wetlands exist within the project area.
EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) requires each federal agency to evaluate the potential
effects of actions it may take in a floodplain to avoid adverse impacts wherever possible, to
ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management, including restoring and preserving such land areas as natural
undeveloped floodplains, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures
of this EO.

EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires federal agencies to take action to avoid adversely
impacting wetlands wherever possible, to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values
of wetlands, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activities have been designed to be consistent
with the requirements of EO 11988 and EO 11990. As required, the Forest would apply for a
Section 404 permit with the Army Corps of Engineers and Stream Alteration permit with the
Idaho Department of Water Resources. See Chapter 3, Water Resources, for more information.

Executive Order 12898
EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs each federal agency to make environmental justice
part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority and low-income populations. An associated memorandum emphasizes the need to
consider these types of effects during NEPA analysis. The proposed activities would not
disproportionately adversely affect minority or low-income populations, including American
Indian tribal members. See also Chapter 1 for Tribal Treaty information and
Chapter 3, Social and Economic Resources.

Executive Order 13112
EO 13112 (Invasive Species) was issued on February 3, 1999, to enhance federal coordination
and response to the complex and accelerating problem of invasive species. EO 13112 directs
federal agencies to work together [as stated in the Preamble] to “…prevent the introduction of
invasive species and provide for their control and to minimize the economic, ecological, and
human health impacts that invasive species cause.” Project activities have been designed to be
consistent with the requirements of EO 13112. See Chapter 3, Invasive Plants, for more
information.

Idaho Forest Practices Act
The Idaho Forest Practices Act regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest
practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01).
The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities
have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Forest Practices Act. See Chapter 3, Water
Resources, for more information.

NEPA Sections 101 and 102
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) was enacted on
January 1, 1970. NEPA establishes national environmental policy and goals for the protection,
maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing
these goals within federal agencies. NEPA also established the Council on Environmental
Quality.
Title I, Section 101, of NEPA contains a Declaration of National Environmental Policy that
requires the federal government to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions
under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony. Title I, Section 102, requires
federal agencies to incorporate environmental considerations in their planning and decisionmaking through a systematic interdisciplinary approach. Specifically, all federal agencies are to
prepare detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of and alternatives to major
federal actions significantly affecting the environment. These statements are commonly referred
to as environmental impact statements (EISs).
The public has an important role in the NEPA process, particularly during scoping, to provide
input on what issues should be addressed in an EIS and to comment on the findings in an
agency's NEPA documents. The public can participate in the NEPA process by attending
NEPA-related hearings or public meetings and by submitting comments directly to the lead
agency. The lead agency must consider all comments received from the public and other parties
on NEPA documents during the comment period.

National Forest Management Act
The National Forest Management Act (NFMA [16 U.S.C. 1600–1614, as amended]) reorganized,
expanded, and otherwise amended the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act
of 1974, which called for the management of renewable resources on NFS lands. NFMA
requires the Secretary of Agriculture to assess forest lands; develop a management program
based on multiple-use, sustained-yield principles; and implement a resource management plan
for each unit of the NFS. It is the primary statute governing the administration of national
forests. The Forest has implemented a resource management plan: the Nez Perce Forest Plan.
Activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project have been designed to be
consistent with the NFMA and Nez Perce Forest Plan. See Chapter 3, Soil Resources, for more
information.

National Historic Preservation Act
Section 101 of NEPA requires federal agencies to preserve important historic, cultural, and
natural aspects of our national heritage. The legal processes associated with the protection and
preservation of these resources is outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(NHPA [36 CFR 800]) and subsequent amendments. Passed by Congress 2 years before NEPA,
the NHPA sets forth a framework for determining if a project is an “undertaking” that has the
potential to affect cultural resources. The implementing regulations also outline the processes
for identifying, evaluating, assessing effects, and protecting such properties. The coordination or
linkage between the Section 106 process of the NHPA and the mandate to preserve our national
heritage under NEPA is well understood and is formally established in 36 CFR 800.3b and
800.8. The terminology of “…important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national
heritage” found in NEPA includes those resources defined as “historic properties” under the
NHPA [36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)]. It is thus the Section 106 process that agencies utilize to consider,
manage, and protect historic properties during the planning and implementing stages of federal
projects. The Forest meets its responsibilities under NHPA through compliance with the terms
of a Programmatic Agreement (PA) signed among Region 1, the Idaho State Historic
Preservation Office, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. See Chapter 3, Cultural
Resources, for more information.

Appendix B
Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis
Introduction
As the lead agency, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests is proposing the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project to improve fisheries habitat in Crooked River by restoring stream
and floodplain functions, restoring instream fish habitat complexity, and improving water
quality, on the Red River Ranger District. In cooperation with the Nez Perce Tribe, Bonneville
Power Administration, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Forest Service is preparing the
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which will evaluate
different alternatives for meeting the purpose of the project. At the end of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, a Final EIS will be prepared, and the Deciding
Official of the Forest Service will select an alternative for implementation in the Record of
Decision.
As part of this EIS process, the Forest Service will be preparing a Section 404(b)(1)
Practicability Analysis to provide information to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist the
Corps with a permit decision under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The purpose of the
analysis is to ensure that the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA)
is carried forward for detailed study in the Final EIS.
This appendix will be prepared for the Final EIS.

Cumulative Effects
Summary – Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Activities
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions were considered for each resource to
determine the cumulative effects associated with implementing the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project. The spatial extent of the cumulative effects analysis area and the
activities considered vary for each resource analyzed. They are discussed by resource in
Chapter 3. Existing conditions are a result of past and current activities in the analysis area. Past
management activities and their potential effects as well as current practices are briefly described
below. Detailed information and larger-scale maps are in the project record.
A full summary of past and ongoing activities is in the project record. One source of information
that was used to identify activities to be considered in cumulative effects analysis is the
American and Crooked River Final EIS and ROD (USDA Forest Service 2005). This document
provided a detailed summary of past and ongoing activities in the Crooked River and American
River watersheds. Another source is the South Fork Clearwater River Landscape Assessment
(USDA Forest Service 1998). Forest records were queried to determine the amount and location
of historic timber harvest, past wildfires, prescribed burns, pre-commercial thinning, road
construction, and decommissioning in Crooked River.
Figure 1-1 (in Chapter 1) is a vicinity map of the project area. Figures C-1 and C-2 display the
project area, analysis area boundaries, and some ongoing and future, foreseeable actions
considered in cumulative effects analysis.
Table C-1 provides a summary of subwatershed and project area information. Past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable activities that have occurred and may occur in the project area or
cumulative effects areas have been considered by various resources, as presented in Table C-2.
Table C-2 includes a summary of activities, including: road management, trail management,
recreation, access management, timber harvest, pre-commercial thinning, wildfires, prescribed
fires, watershed and fish habitat improvement projects, weed management, mining, and grazing
activities. These projects may contribute to existing and future conditions. Table C-2 is
organized by resource activity, time (past, present, ongoing, and future foreseeable activities),
and area. Resource activities are summarized by two areas: the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation (CRVR) project area and the Crooked River watershed (which is also the
Orogrande Community Protection project area). Depending on the activities and resource area,
effects may be addressed in Chapter 3.
Table C-3 provides a more detailed description of several future foreseeable actions.

road decommissioning; 5.06 miles of
watershed road improvement; 11 miles
of soil restoration; 9.26 acres of soil
restoration; and 3.9 miles of instream
improvement.

Road maintenance activities include
clearing vegetation from road surfaces,
shoulders and ditches; and leveling the
road surface to enhance drivability and
drainage.
Various levels of maintenance of roads in
the project area.
Forest Service roads and trails are
maintained for summer use.
Culvert replacement at Fivemile Creek and
Road 233 to provide aquatic organism
passage is planned for 2014.
Fivemile Pond grate removal is planned
for 2014.

Proposed Crooked River Narrows Road
Improvement project, 2022–2025.
Proposed Action – Alternative B would
re-align and reconstruct about 3.5 miles
of Road 233 to reduce sources of
sediment through the Narrows.
Reconstruct the existing road to provide
turnouts, provide a wider road base where
possible (up to 16 feet), provide a buffer
between the road and the river, gravel the
road surface, and provide a stable road
base. Remove bedrock from the hillside
through blasting and excavation,
riprapping sections of the roadway, install
new cross drains, providing a road ditch,
re-surfacing, and planting vegetation
along disturbed streambanks. Excess
material from reconstruction would be
placed to improve Road 233 subgrade
from the Narrows to Relief Creek.

As part of the South Fork Clearwater
River Habitat Enhancement project,
installation of fish habitat structures was
completed in Crooked River channel in
1980s (see Figure C-3). Dredge piles
were removed from the floodplain, and
grass, sedges, and trees planted. The
tight meanders remain unchanged. The
Native Material Inventory completed in
2012 identified the following type of
structures that were installed and are
still in place: weirs, rock and boulder
weirs, deflectors, random boulders, and
anchored large woody debris structures.
(River Design Group and Geum 2012).
The Forest Service led efforts to
improve aquatic habitat for threatened
and endangered fish species by
reconnecting several dredge ponds with
the river and removing approximately
30,000 cubic yards of cobble tailings
(RDG 2012 – Mining Claim Inventory).
To implement the American River–
Crooked River decision, through the
Crooked River Stewardship contract,
the following activities have been
implemented: 13.28 miles of road
decommissioning; 5.06 miles of
watershed road improvement; 11 miles
of soil restoration; 9.26 acres of soil
restoration; 3.9 miles of instream

Project Name

Project Description
The Red River Ranger District proposes to approve Premium Exploration’s proposal to conduct
exploratory drilling in the Crooked River and Deadwood area of the Red River Ranger District at
a total of 171 drill sites. Each drill site would encompass a surface area of approximately 30 feet
by 50 feet. A maximum of two holes would be drilled at each site. These holes are anticipated to
be 3 inches in diameter but may be up to 6 inches in diameter, depending on equipment
availability, and would be drilled using a self-contained, self-leveling, and track-mounted drill
rig. A sump approximately 3 feet wide, 3 to 4 feet deep, and approximately 20 feet long would
be dug at each site to contain drill fluid and to allow drill cuttings to settle out. Drill fluid is
composed of water and a clay derivative. Water for the drill rig would be brought in from off site
in a truck or trailer-mounted tank. Each site would be reclaimed and each drill hole would be
filled and plugged when work at that site is completed before moving on to the next drill site.

Proposed
Premium
Exploration Drill
Plan

In the Deadwood area, most of the drill sites are adjacent to or on existing roads. Three sites are
adjacent to Forest Road 522 (Deadwood Road), and are located on turnouts, which could be used
as drill pads to minimize surface disturbance and allow the passage of traffic at the same time.
Two sites would require overland travel to access, and up to two sites could require some minor
road reconstruction, with a maximum of approximately ¼ mile of low standard temporary road
construction to access drill sites. These roads would be recontoured, seeded, and mulched after
completion of drilling.
In the Crooked River area, most of the drill sites are adjacent to or on existing roads or old road
templates that would require no work other than clearing of deadfall to access the site. Some
minor widening of the road surface may be required at some of the sites for drill pads, depending
on the orientation of the drill rig. Three sites would require overland travel to access, and one
site would require some minor road reconstruction (approximately ¼ mile).

Project Description
The Red River Ranger District is proposing a fuel reduction project to help protect the
community of Orogrande, Idaho, from wildfire.
This project would create fuel breaks on National Forest System lands adjacent to private
property and emergency evacuation routes using a combination of prescribed burning and
mechanical treatments. Prescribed fire only would be used on about 2,491 acres; and hand and
mechanical treatment on approximately 1,009 acres. Hand and mechanical treatments would
remove dead and live trees in the understory and overstory, and prune residual trees.
Merchantable trees would be removed as products. Mechanical treatments would be followed by
prescribed burns to further reduce fuel loading. Approximately 7 miles of temporary road
construction would be needed to access treatment areas, including construction of approximately
2 miles of temporary road in the West Fork Roadless Area. Also, approximately 1 mile of
existing (drivable) non-system road use would also occur in this roadless area.

We would maintain desired conditions with periodic under burns every 10–20 years (depending
on monitoring results) to remove ladder fuels. For public safety and to facilitate operations, roads
within the project area, including Crooked River Road 233, might be intermittently closed to the
public while we implement the proposed action.

Appendix D
Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments
Amendment Description and Finding of Non-Significant Amendments
Two Forest Plan amendments are proposed under the 2012 Planning Rule (36 CFR 219).
The transition provisions of the rule (219.17) allow for amendments to existing plans to
proceed under the prior planning rule. Plan amendments may be initiated, completed, and
approved under the provisions of the prior planning rule for 3 years after May 9, 2012. Since
these two amendments are proposed as project-specific amendments only for the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project, they are subject to the public notification requirements
of 36 CFR 218.
The Responsible Official has evaluated the following analysis and has concluded that the
proposed amendments described in detail below do not constitute a significant amendment to
the Nez Perce National Forest Plan, also known as the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service
1987a, as amended).
The following is provided to disclose the proposed amendment text and effects analysis of
the proposed Forest Plan amendments. The proposed amendments are project-specific for
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project.
This appendix is organized based on the following proposed amendments:
•

Soil Resources:
o Forestwide Standard #2.

•

Cultural Resources:
o Forestwide Standards #2 and #4.
o Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource Standard #4.

NEZ PERCE NATIONAL FOREST
LAND AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN
AMENDMENT NO. X (PROPOSED)
PROJECT-SPECIFIC AMENDMENT TO SOIL QUALITY STANDARD #2
FOR THE CROOKED RIVER VALLEY REHABILITATION PROJECT AREA
The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Forest Service to implement restoration
activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area that currently
exceed Forest Plan – soil quality standard #2.
The goal of the Nez Perce Forest Plan Standards is to meet the National Forest Management
Act where management actions will not produce substantial or permanent impairment of the
productivity of the land (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i)).
To prevent permanent impairment to productivity, the Nez Perce National Forest soil quality
standards (Forest Plan, page II-22, USDA Forest Service 1987a) control the areal extent of
detrimental soil disturbance impact by management activities. Soil quality standard #2
currently reads as follows:
“A minimum of 80 percent of any activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted,
displaced, or puddled upon completion of activities. This direction does not apply to
permanent recreation facilities and other permanent facilities such as system roads.”
Standard #2 prevents management from further degrading areas with already poor conditions
but does not provide for the restoration and rehabilitation actions of the magnitude needed
for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. The current conditions have mining
tailings that remain in a departed condition across the project area after 70 years for
regrowth.
This project-specific amendment would exempt the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project from Forest Plan Soil quality standard #2 in order to facilitate the restoration of
productivity in the project area.

Appendix D. Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments

D-2

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Analysis of Factors
Soil Standard #2 (Forest Plan, page II-22) would be exempted with a project-specific Forest
Plan Amendment for Alternative 2 of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, in the
project activity area, on the Red River Ranger District. The amendment would allow valley
rehabilitation activities to proceed in areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil
conditions.
Timing: The amendment applies only to the activities proposed in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project, and therefore applies only for the duration of those restoration actions.
The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited.
Location and Size: The proposed Forest Plan amendment would affect implementation of
activities within the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. The project
area and activity area are about 115 acres and located in: T29N, R7E, Sections 25 and 36;
and T28N, R7E, Section 1 (Boise Meridian), 5 miles west of Elk City, Idaho. The project
activity area represents less than 0.01 percent of the total 2,274,146 acres of National Forest
System land in the Nez Perce National Forest. The area affected is therefore limited.
Goals, Objectives, and Outputs: The Forest Plan goal for soils is to maintain soil
productivity and minimize any irreversible impacts to soil resources. The Forest Plan
objective for soils is to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion through the
application of best management practices, careful riparian area management, use of
fish/water quality drainage objectives, and soil and water resource improvement projects.
This amendment is fully consistent with the goals and objectives of the Nez Perce Forest
Plan because the amendment would allow activities to restore areas currently unproductive to
a productive state. These activities would respond directly and indirectly to the Forest Plan
goal and objective for soils. The activities would not inhibit achievement of the Forest Plan
goal/objective.
This is a project-specific amendment to the Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2 for lands in
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. This project-specific
amendment would allow the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project to proceed despite
the fact that the project activity area currently exceeds the 20% compacted, displaced, or
puddled soils standard.
Management Perspective: Amendment of Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2 is specific
and applicable only to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. This
amendment does not apply to activities occurring outside the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project area. The proposed change would occur on less than 0.01 percent of
the Forest; as a result, there would be no measurable change to goods and service produced
in the total forest planning unit (2,274,146 acres, Forest).
For the riverine environment of the Crooked River project, the natural recovery rate was
limited to water’s edge environments after the historic dredge mining. Under natural

circumstances, the deposition of fine soil materials from episodic (100- to 1000-year return
interval) events is needed to approach the reference conditions for this environment prior to
mining. The active restoration advances the recovery timeframe to less than 50 years.
Purpose and Need of Amendment
Purpose
The purpose of this amendment is to allow activities to occur in the project activity area with
greater than 20 percent detrimental soil disturbance.
Need
Past placer mining and harvest activities have altered soils conditions in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. The current Forest Plan standards and the Forest
Service Region 1 soil quality guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. The
proposed amendment would exempt the project from Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2,
allowing for activities to occur on areas with greater than 20% soil detrimental disturbance,
as long as soil improvement activities are implemented.
Based on the current condition, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for
Alternative 2 to allow for restoration and soil restoration activities to occur in the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area.
Direct, indirect, and cumulative impact of amendment
Direct and indirect effects
No Action Alternative

Alternative A would not exempt the project from Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2. Soil
conditions in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area would remain
detrimentally disturbed. No soil improvement activities would occur.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 is evaluated in this analysis, and would exempt the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project from Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2. This alternative would not
adjust the goals, objectives, or outputs as described in the Forest Plan. This amendment
would allow the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project to proceed despite the fact that
the project activity area currently exceeds the 20% compacted, displaced, or puddled soils
standard. The amended standard would be applied to the project activity area.
The amendment would allow restoration, including soil improvement activities, to proceed in
areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil conditions. The amendment takes into
account the amount of existing detrimental soil disturbance, and allows the flexibility to
achieve multiple resource objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions.

Appendix D. Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments

D-4

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Proposed activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include soil
remediation to achieve a net improvement in the project activity area, which has past soil
disturbance. Soil improvement objectives are to increase water infiltration, increase soil
productivity, reduce potential for weed invasion, and stabilize bare slopes. Actions include a
combination of decompacting soils, recontouring to slope, and/or adding organic matter,
including large woody material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend
for soil conditions, advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment.
On the project-specific scale, the proposed activities in Alternative 2, for the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project would move the site from 65% detrimental condition toward
less than 5% in 20 years (see Chapter 3, Soil Resources).
This project-specific amendment applies to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
activity area over approximately 6 years. The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore
limited.
Cumulative effects
In the past, three timber harvest projects on the Nez Perce National Forest amended the
Forest Plan – Soil standard #2:
•
•
•

Amendment 30 – Meadow Face Stewardship Pilot Project (USDA Forest Service
2008). 15 units.
Amendment 33 – Red Pines Project (USDA Forest Service 2006). 10 units. 547 acres.
Amendment 37 – Lodge Point Commercial Thin Project (USDA Forest Service 2011a).
7 or 8 units.

Two future foreseeable projects propose amendments to the Forest Plan – Soil standard #2.
Each proposal is for a project-specific amendment to adopt the Regional Soil quality
standards (15%).
•

•

Clear Creek Restoration project (USDA Forest Service 2013c), which proposes an
amendment for less than 2% of forest to harvest timber on 3 units exceeding 20%
detrimental soil disturbance (19 units exceed 15%).
Eastside Allotment Management Planning project (USDA Forest Service 2009,
proposed action), which proposes an amendment on less than 2% (43,935 acres) of the
forest on two allotments exceeding 20% (3 allotments exceed 15%).

Past amendments have led to a net improvement of productivity on the forest. The results of
this project, and future foreseeable projects, would also lead to a net improvement in
productivity across the Nez Perce Forest, within each activity area. The prior successes
combined with the restorative actions of this project indicate that no adverse cumulative
effects would prevent the Nez Perce National Forest from meeting NFMA.

LAND AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN
AMENDMENT NO. X (PROPOSED)
PROJECT-SPECIFIC AMENDMENT TO:
CULTURAL RESOURCE STANDARDS #2 AND #4 AND
MANAGEMENT AREA 3 – CULTURAL RESOURCE STANDARD #4
FOR THE CROOKED RIVER VALLEY REHABILITATION PROJECT AREA
The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Forest Service to implement restoration
activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area, which contains one
eligible cultural resource site that meets the National Register Criteria for Historic Places.
The goal of the Forest Plan is to identify and protect cultural properties that are considered
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. These properties are considered historic
properties (36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)) and must be protected, avoided, or mitigated, during
federal undertakings.
The Nez Perce National Forest Plan – Cultural resource standards #2 and #4 (Forest Plan,
page II-17) and Management Area 3 standard #4 (Forest Plan, page III-9) apply to lands in
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area (USDA Forest Service 1987a).
Cultural Resource standard #2 currently reads as follows:
“Sites will be evaluated and protected on a site-by-site basis unless larger areas
such as historic or prehistoric districts are involved.”
Cultural Resource standard #4 currently reads as follows:
“Protect and preserve National Register and National Register-eligible cultural
resources.”
Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource standard #4 currently reads as follows:
“Protect National Register or eligible sites from deterioration or destruction.”
Cultural Resource standards #2 and #4 and Management Area 3 – Cultural resource standard
#4 direct the Forest to identify and prevent management from damaging historic or National
Register–eligible cultural resources, but does not provide for the rehabilitation actions of the
magnitude needed for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. The project area
includes one eligible site (SHC-32).
This project-specific amendment would exempt the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project (site SHC-32 in the project area), from Forest Plan – Cultural resource standards #2
and #4, and Management Area 3 – Cultural resource standard #4 in order to facilitate the
rehabilitation of the Crooked River Valley.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Analysis of Factors
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would be exempt from Cultural Resource
standards #2 and #4 (Forest Plan, page II-17) and Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource
standard #4 through this project-specific Forest Plan Amendment. The proposed amendment
would allow rehabilitation activities to proceed on one cultural resource site identified as a
National Register–eligible site. The amendment takes into account the amount and type of
cultural resource sites, and the Forest has consulted with the Idaho State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO). This amendment allows other resources objectives to be met
while still meeting the protection requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) through mitigation.
Timing: The amendment applies only to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project,
and therefore applies only for the duration of those restoration actions (approximately 6
years). The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited. Future projects would
follow the current Forest Plan standard, until the Forest Plan is revised.
Location and Size: The proposed Forest Plan amendment would affect implementation of
activities at one cultural property that meets National Register Criteria in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area (SHC-32; see Chapter 3, Cultural Resources section). The
project area is approximately 115 acres, and is located in: T29N, R7E, Sections 25 and 36;
and T28N, R7E, Section 1 (Boise Meridian), 5 miles west of Elk City, Idaho. The project
area represents less than 0.01 percent of the total 2,274,146 acres of National Forest System
land in the Nez Perce National Forest. The area affected is therefore limited.
Goals, Objectives, and Outputs: Forest Plan Goal 11 is to locate, protect, and interpret
significant prehistoric, historic, and cultural resources. The Forest Plan objective for cultural
resources is to inventory, evaluate, and, where appropriate, protect prior to land-disturbing
activities. And, as appropriate, cultural resources would be interpreted for the public.
The objectives set forth in the Forest Plan for cultural resources would not be altered. The
goal to locate, protect, and interpret significant prehistoric, historic, and cultural resources
would still be met. All cultural resources in the project area have been located.
The Forest Plan objective is for cultural resources to be inventoried, evaluated, and, where
appropriate, protected prior to land-disturbing activities. As appropriate, cultural resources
will be interpreted for the public. All cultural resources in the project area have been
inventoried, several sites would be protected, and interpretation signs would be installed as a
part of this project. The intent of the objective would be met.
The cultural resource inventory found many dredge mining tailings. The tailings resulted
from extensive dredging operations conducted by the H&H Mining Company, which
operated a Yuba manufactured dredge along the lower Crooked River from 1938–1942.
The dredge piles of the lower 2 miles are morphologically distinct. Their U-shaped pattern
reflects the technology employed by bucket-line dredges which pivot around a central

anchor-spud. The resulting architecture of the dredge piles is directly reflective of this
unique mining technology.
Proposed activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include removal of
these dredge piles and reconstruction of the stream, channel, and floodplain using this
material. In order to move the historic dredge piles with the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project, an amendment to Cultural Resource standards #2 and #4; and
Management Area 3 – Standard #4 is needed.
Management Perspective: Amendment of Forest Plan – Cultural Resource standards #2 and
#4 and Management Area 3 – Standard #4 is specific or applicable only to the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area. This amendment does not apply to activities occurring
outside the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area. The proposed change would
occur on less than 0.01 percent of the Forest; as a result, there would be no measurable
change to goods and services produced in the total forest planning unit (2,274,146 acres,
Forest) prior to completion of the Forest Plan revision. This amendment allows other
resources objectives to be met while still meeting the protection requirements of the NHPA,
through the applied design and mitigation measures.
The proposed amendment does not alter the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term
land and resource management. With this amendment, additional projects or activities that
will contribute to achievement of the management prescription would be completed.
The amendment would allow the management area boundaries within the project area to be
altered. The project area currently includes Management Areas 3 and 10. The amount of
Management Area 3 would be reduced by the rehabilitation activities to reconstruct Crooked
River and the floodplain. The amount of Management Area 10 would increase through the
construction of the new floodplain and upland areas. It is a project-specific amendment that
would allow actions that would contribute to the achievement of Management Area10
objectives and meet objectives of Management Area 3 that were expected from these
management areas.
Purpose and Need of Amendment
Purpose
The purpose of this amendment is to allow activities to occur on one site identified as a
National Register–eligible site.
Need
Past placer mining and harvest activities have altered the ground conditions in the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project area. The current Forest Plan standards and Management
Area 3 standards provide direction to identify and protect National Register–eligible sites.
The proposed amendment would not apply Forest Plan Cultural Resource standards #2 and

Appendix D. Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments

D-8

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

#4 or Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource standard #4, allowing for activities to occur
on cultural resource sites.
Based on the current condition, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for
Alternative 2 to allow for restoration and for cultural resource interpretation of cultural sites
to occur in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area.
Direct, indirect, and cumulative impact of amendment
Direct and indirect effects
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would not exempt the project from Forest Plan – Cultural resource standards #2
and #4 or Management Area 3 – Cultural resource standard #4. Known cultural resource
sites in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area would remain unchanged.
Alternative 1 would not amend the Forest Plan.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 is evaluated in this analysis, and would require a Forest Plan amendment for
Cultural Resources standards #2 and #4 and Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource
standard #4. This alternative would not adjust the goals, objectives, or outputs described in
the Forest Plan. This amendment would allow the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project to proceed despite the fact that the project area contains one cultural resource site that
is eligible for the National Register and would be disturbed. The project would be exempt
from applying these standards to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation, in the project area.
This alternative would move toward the goals, objectives, and standards for fish.
The amendment would allow restoration, including retention of representative historic dredge
piles and interpretation of the site, to proceed in areas that possess one National Register–
eligible site (SHC-32). The amendment takes into account the full inventory of cultural
resources that has been completed and allows for other resource objectives to be met, and
implementation of mitigation measures.
Proposed activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include removal and
re-distribution of historic dredge mine tailings. A complete inventory for existing cultural
resources was completed and is documented in the Crooked River Archaeological Survey
(Desert West Environmental 2013a). Mitigation for the proposed adverse effect to cultural
resources includes:
•
•
•

Thoroughly photograph, document, and map historic dredge piles that are proposed for
removal.
Retain a representative sample of dredge piles for public interpretation.
Construct a three-panel interpretive sign related to the history of dredge mining on the
Crooked River.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Record the historic Gnome village.
Perform a social business history related to the economic contribution made by historic
dredge mining operations to the local central Idaho economy.

The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (16 USC 470; as amended) requires
federal agencies to take into account their actions on historic properties. The required
regulatory review of effects resulting from federal undertakings is found in Section 106 of
the Act, and has been codified in 36 CFR 800 Part B. The mitigation proposed for site
SHC-32 meets the intent of the NHPA when the Idaho Historic Preservation Officer concurs
on the proposed mitigation package.
This project-specific amendment applies to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
area. The Forest would be exempt from applying Cultural Resource standards #2 and #4 and
Management Area 3 – Standard #4 at cultural resource site SHC-32. The temporal scope of
the amendment is therefore limited.
Cumulative effects
There have been no past Forest Plan amendments for Forest Plan – Cultural Resource
standards #2 and #4 or Management Area 3 – Standard #4.
There are no cumulative effects with the proposed amendment to the Forest Plan. The
amendment is project specific and limited in time.

Best Management Practices for Mercury Collection from
Restoration Activities in Crooked River
Background
Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the environment that has several forms. Metallic
mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid. Metallic mercury (inorganic mercury and its
compounds) enters the air from mining and manufacturing activities and from burning coal and
waste. It has also been added to the environment from historic gold mining activities. Although
mercury was not used in dredge mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a small
potential to find this element during restoration activities. Soil and water samples have been
collected in the project area by the U.S. Geologic Survey, Idaho Department of Environmental
Quality, and the Nez Perce Tribe over the past 10 years to test for mercury. Thus far, mercury
either has not been detected or levels have been considered non-significant based on Idaho’s
Water Quality Standards.

Collection
During floodplain and stream channel reconstruction, mercury may be found by the contractor.
If this occurs, work in the immediate vicinity will stop and every reasonable effort will be made
to contain the material in such a manner that it will not reach surface or groundwater. The
mercury will be transferred into a vapor-proof, sturdy, unbreakable container by the fish
biologist or qualified personnel to be safely stored and disposed of or recycled. Rubber, nitrile,
or latex gloves will be kept on site and used when handling mercury to prevent adverse health
impacts from mercury exposure to the skin. Depending on the amount collected, the mercury
can either be poured directly into a container or an eye dropper can be used to transfer the
residual mercury beads to the container. A secondary, unbreakable container will be used when
storing and transferring mercury from the project site to an approved disposal site. If clothing or
other items come into contact with mercury, they should be considered contaminated.
Contaminated clothes and shoes brought may release mercury vapors. The recommended
practice is to properly dispose of contaminated clothing and shoes.
The fish biologist or qualified personnel on site will notify Idaho State Communication Center at
(800) 632-8000 or (208) 846-7610 if an amount greater that what is contained in a thermometer is
found. The amount and location of mercury will be documented, even if less than what is
contained in a thermometer, and reported to the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality,
Lewiston Field Office. Any other mercury data collection during implementation of the project
will be documented and shared with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Transportation
Transporting the secondary container of mercury from the field or mining collection site to the
disposal site or temporary storage site should be done in a manner that does not compromise the
containers. It is suggested that the secondary container of mercury be placed in a secure location
in the vehicle so that the container does not tip over. This will minimize shifting or sliding
during sudden stops or turns. Containers should be transported in the back of a pick-up truck or
in a car trunk.

Storage
Mercury and mercury wastes (items contaminated by mercury) should be put in a vapor-proof,
sturdy, unbreakable container and stored in secondary containment, such as a second, larger
unbreakable container. Anything that touched the liquid mercury should be considered
contaminated. Contaminated clothes and shoes may release mercury vapors after touching the
element. The recommended practice is to properly dispose of contaminated clothing and shoes.
The container should be labeled: “DANGER Toxic Mercury – DO NOT OPEN.”

Mercury Waste Management/Recycling
Mercury will be disposed of at one of the following companies. The handing, treatment, and
disposal or recycling practice of the facility will be verified prior to transporting mercury to
the facility.
