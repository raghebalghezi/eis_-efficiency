2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

This Baseline Socioeconomic Technical Report (STR) was prepared in 2008 in support of the Continental
Divide – Creston Natural Gas Development Project (CD-C) Environmental Impact Statement. It provides
1) an inventory and analysis of existing socioeconomic conditions at that time in the geographic area
likely to be affected by development and operations of the Continental Divide – Creston Natural Gas
Development Project, 2) an assessment of potential socioeconomic effects associated with each of the
project alternatives and 3) an assessment of potential cumulative socioeconomic effects associated with
reasonably foreseeable past, present and future actions. The socioeconomic trends and conditions
described in this report have been monitored over time and updated. The updated trends and conditions
are presented in Section 3.15 of the Draft EIS.
The inventory and description of conditions is organized by the following major topics:

1. OVERVIEW
This Baseline STR describes existing social and economic conditions in and near the CD-C project area,
the geographic area that would be most directly affected by the proposed CD-C project and alternatives.
Natural gas development has been ongoing in the project area for over 50 years and currently the region is
in the midst of a major economic expansion fueled by natural gas development and production. The
recent and ongoing development has affected local social and economic conditions, both beneficially and
adversely, and as such constitutes a part of the affected environment. This Baseline STR identifies these
effects where information is available as they provide valuable insights into the potential effects of the
CD-C Proposed Action and Alternatives and the cumulative context in which they would occur.
The recent expansion, which began in 2003 in Sweetwater County and about 2006 in Carbon County,
followed a decade and a half of relatively stable economic conditions and declining population in both
counties. The expansion is characterized by low unemployment, escalating wages, and intense labor
competition. While residents and newcomers alike enjoy abundant employment opportunities and
comparatively high wages and salaries in virtually every sector, employers in every sector have difficulty
recruiting and retaining employees. In some cases the labor shortage fundamentally affects employers’
capacity to do business. Some employers in the retail and service sectors have had to modify hours and
ways of doing business in response to labor shortages.
A critical shortage of housing, particularly affordable housing, contributes to the labor shortage in
communities in and near the study area, discouraging many new workers from establishing local
residency. Many natural gas drilling and service workers travel to Carbon and Sweetwater counties for
their work days and stay in local motels, RV parks, or employer-sponsored temporary-worker quarters,
and return to homes outside the area on their days off. Communities near the project area and elsewhere
in southwestern Wyoming are actively preparing and implementing plans to develop affordable housing
to address this problem.

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

The rapid pace of population growth and presence of a large temporary and transient workforce
complicates efforts by local governments in and near the project area to monitor the effective service area
population and plan for future demands on facilities and services. Because local officials believe that
recent population growth in these communities is not reflected in U.S. Census Bureau or state estimates;
they have developed their own estimates based on utility estimates or housing counts. These estimates are
all substantially higher than federal and state estimates, though even they do not include all of the
temporary and transient portion of the natural gas development workforce.
Population growth, coupled with the many temporary and transient workers, has strained utility
infrastructure and public services in the affected communities. Although some communities have surplus
utility capacity, a legacy from the previous expansion, other communities have completed or are
anticipating efforts to expand water, wastewater and/or solid-waste landfills to accommodate the growthrelated demand.
The natural gas boom places new and increased demand on a variety of public services. Although most
community services are affected by population growth, law enforcement, emergency response, and
medical care facilities in particular have all seen increases in demand and changes in the type of demand
related to the expansion. Hospital emergency room services have increased dramatically, in large part
because many new community members and temporary workers do not have local primary-care
physicians.
The expansion is also affecting community social conditions. Each community near the project area has
undergone previous expansions and is therefore, somewhat conditioned and accustomed to an ongoing
stream of temporary workers associated with oil and gas development, pipeline and ancillary facility
construction, and maintenance and expansion of power plants and soda ash and fertilizer manufacturing
facilities. But the level and duration of population growth and sheer numbers of temporary workers
present in what had been relatively stable social settings (retail, government, recreational, and social) for
the last 15 to 20 years has changed the nature of those settings from those with a certain level of stability
and predictability to those in which many people are likely to be strangers. Some retail, dining, and
recreational settings are felt by long-time residents to be dominated by newcomers.
One of the beneficial aspects of the gas expansion is that local government revenues in Carbon and
Sweetwater counties have increased dramatically. Assessed valuation in Carbon County has tripled since
2000 and in Sweetwater County assessed valuation has doubled during the same period. Although major
increases in assessed valuation have also occurred in Carbon County School District #1 and Sweetwater
County School District #1, the districts do not receive a proportionate increase in revenue because of the
provisions of Wyoming School Foundation Program. Municipalities also do not benefit directly from
natural gas development and production located in the unincorporated areas of the counties. However, the
counties and municipalities have also experienced dramatic increases in sales and use tax revenues
associated with the expansion. These revenues, along with a portion of the severance tax and mineral
royalty revenues collected by the state and distributed back to local governments have helped fund some
infrastructure and service expansions required by the expansion. In some cases these incremental
revenues have not been available in a timely fashion to fund the needed expansions.

2. HUMAN GEOGRAPHY
The CD-C project area is located in western Carbon and eastern Sweetwater Counties in Wyoming (see
Figure 1). U.S. Interstate 80 (I-80) bisects the project area east-to-west. Along I-80, the eastern boundary
of the project area is about 25 miles west of the City of Rawlins, the Carbon County seat. The western
boundary of the project area is about 40 miles east of the City of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County.
The Town of Wamsutter (Sweetwater County) is also located within the project area. The project area is

2

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

sparsely populated; outside of Wamsutter there are very few occupied residences within the project area
although some ranch facilities and rural subdivision lots are occupied on a seasonal basis.
The Carbon County towns of Baggs and Dixon lie about 8 miles and 15 miles southwest of the project
area, respectively, and the Town of Bairoil in Sweetwater County lies about 25 air-miles northwest of the
project area, though it is not directly accessible via an all-weather road across the project area. The City of
Green River, the Sweetwater County seat, lies about 10 miles west of Rock Springs, along I-80 and the
Sweetwater County Town of Superior is about 38 highway miles to the east of the project area.
Oil and gas development has been ongoing in the project area since the 1940s. The project area contains
several active gas fields and had about 2,500 producing natural gas wells in the spring of 2007.
Consequently economic, demographic, fiscal, and social conditions in communities in and near the
project area have been and continue to be shaped in part by oil and gas development.
Carbon County is Wyoming’s third-largest county with a total land area of 5,096,960 acres, 60 percent of
which is in public ownership. Sweetwater County is Wyoming’s largest county with a total of 6,705,792
acres, 73 percent of which is owned by federal, state, and local governments.
The CD-C project area is located within the Great Divide Basin, in a broad intermontane ecoregion
dominated by arid grasslands and shrublands and interrupted by high hills and low mountains (Omernik
1987). Human use of the area includes livestock grazing, outdoor recreation, and oil and gas development
and production. The area is currently in the midst of a prolonged drought, which some observers believe
dates back to the 1970s (Carrico 2007, Hansen 2007).

2.1 HUMAN SETTLEMENT
Sweetwater and Carbon counties share an economic heritage with other areas of the northern Great Plains,
one in which agriculture (ranching) and the westward migration of pioneers played an important role in
the region’s initial post-European settlement and economic expansion. The development of the railroad
across southern Wyoming in the late 1860s, subsequent homesteading and settlement, and construction of
the transcontinental railroad ushered in the era of accelerated European settlement.
Section 3.13 (Cultural and Historical Resources) of the Continental Divide-Creston EIS provides a
discussion of Native American habitation and use of the project area and describes early use of the area
by people of European descent. Initial Euro-American contact in what is now Carbon and Sweetwater
Counties was associated with the fur trade, but the railroad, coal mining, and ranching were the principal
reasons for Euro-American settlement of the two counties.
The Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historic Trails, as well as the
Overland Stage route traverse northern portions of Carbon and Sweetwater Counties, but few travelers on
the trail settled in the area. The operation of the Pony Express and the development of a stage route across
the counties resulted in some settlement at express stations and stage stops, but construction of the Union
Pacific Railroad in the 1860s truly initiated settlement in the area. The construction and operation of the
railroad coupled with development of coal mines, which both fueled locomotives and sent coal to markets
via rail, served to establish viable communities in both counties. The railroads also reduced the time, cost,
and hazards associated with shipment of livestock and wool to markets, which helped cattle and sheep
ranchers who settled in the area to prosper.
Mineral and energy resource development – initially coal, but later oil and gas, trona, electrical power
generation and uranium exploration – also helped shaped the area’s economic history. The mining, oil and
natural gas industries have also been important contributors to the regional economic base through their
fiscal support for local government and education. Coal-fired electric power generation remains an
important segment of the Sweetwater County economy, and wind power generation is increasingly
important for both counties.
Today, the transportation sector in each county still includes the Union Pacific Railroad, but the flow of
commerce and traffic across I-80 is also a major contributor to the economies of the two counties. More
recently, travel and outdoor recreation have become important contributors to the local economies,
spurred by the completion of the Flaming Gorge dam and establishment of the Flaming Gorge National
Recreation area in the 1960s and completion of I-80 across the state in the early 1970s.

2.2 COMMUNITIES OF PLACE
Six communities are currently affected by natural gas development and production in the project area and
will continue to be affected under the Proposed Action or alternatives. These are Rawlins, Baggs, and
Dixon in Carbon County and Wamsutter, Rock Springs, and Green River in Sweetwater County.
Although sharing some economic and social characteristics, each town is unique. Three other
communities near the project area, the Carbon County Town of Sinclair and the Sweetwater County
towns of Bairoil and Superior are not included in this assessment because land ownership and/or the
location of these communities preclude substantial growth and other socioeconomic effects of the CD-C
project.

2.1.3.1 Rawlins
Rawlins is the Carbon County seat and the county’s largest community. Rawlins was established in 1867
and named after General John A. Rawlins who discovered a spring near the present-day townsite while
surveying for the Union Pacific Railroad. Rawlins was established as a railroad town because of the
availability of both water and coal in the area. Coal production was important for Carbon County from the
1880s through most of the 20th century, but most of the coal was produced in eastern Carbon County.
Rawlins was also a major sheep-growing center, serving as a wool-shearing and shipping point for the
thousands of sheep that wintered in the surrounding Red Desert and Great Divide Basin. The Union
Pacific Railroad remains a key employer in Rawlins, employing about 195 people in 2006. Ranching,
grazing, and related hay production remain an important part of the Carbon County economy and culture,
but cattle outnumber sheep in the area around Rawlins today.
The Wyoming Department of Corrections has been a major employer in Rawlins for over a century,
employing about 330 personnel in 2007. The Wyoming State Penitentiary was opened in Rawlins in 1901
and served as the state’s prison until 1981 when a new prison was built just south of Rawlins. The old
Wyoming Frontier Prison has been converted to a heritage tourist attraction.
Located in Sinclair, about six miles east of Rawlins, the Sinclair Oil Refinery was started by the
Producers and Refining Corporation in the 1920s and later purchased by Sinclair Refiners Company. It
has been a major employer in the area for over 70 years, employing 351 personnel in 2007.
Rawlins has been the commercial center for Carbon County’s energy industry. During the 1970s and early
1980s, the population of Rawlins grew as a result of an energy resource boom, which included coal, oil,
and uranium development in the area. Starting in the mid-1980s, Rawlins and much of Wyoming entered
an economic downturn as a result of a precipitous fall in energy prices (Ducker 2007, Moulton 2005,
Worthington, Lenhart and Carpenter, Inc. 1999).
Starting in about 2005, with the construction of new prison facilities and the acceleration of natural gas
development in the areas of western Carbon and eastern Sweetwater counties, the economy and
population of Rawlins began to expand. The location and expansion of natural gas production and service
companies and the expansion of the Sinclair refinery have resulted in another expansion, characterized by
labor and housing shortages. Rawlins and Carbon County have responded with a variety of planning,
infrastructure, and affordable-housing initiatives. Today, Rawlins includes a mix of long-time residents,
newcomers, and transient temporary workers who work in the surrounding natural gas fields and
construction sites and stay temporarily in the town in single status.
2.1.3.2 Little Snake River Valley (Baggs and Dixon)
Settlement in the Little Snake River Valley (LSRV) by people of European descent was associated with
cattle ranching. Cattle were first brought to the area in 1871, and have been associated with the dominant
human land use since that time. There have been several periods of oil development in the surrounding
areas between the 1950s and the early 1980s. More recently natural gas development has resulted in
economic activity and employment for some valley residents. There have been several mining ventures in
areas surrounding the LSRV and extensive coal deposits underlie much of the LSR basin. However,
ranching is the enduring economic activity in the LSRV and ranching-related activities, such as rodeos
and roping competitions, are among the important and enduring social interactions in the valley. Some of
the ranches and grazing operations located in the LSRV have been in the same family for several
generations

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Outdoor recreation (hunting in particular) is an important economic and cultural activity in the LSRV.
Some ranchers lease their land to hunting outfitters, or allow hunting access for a fee. Outfitters, game
processors, motels, cafés, and other businesses count on hunting for a substantial part of their annual
income. Recently, a large landowner has developed a dude ranch south of Savery, which is east of Dixon
near the Wyoming-Colorado state line.
The LSRV is a close-knit community, with many extended families living in the valley. LSRV residents
have health care and commerce linkages to Craig, Colorado as well as to Rawlins. There is some housing
growth in the LSRV and both Baggs and Dixon are embarking on infrastructure development projects.
(Blevins et al. n.d., Corners 2007, Hicks n.d., Medicine Bow National Forest 2003, Stocks 2007).
2.1.3.3 Town of Wamsutter
Wamsutter began life in 1868 as Washakie, a rail station on the Union Pacific line known for its good
artesian well – a necessity for steam engines. The name was changed when the Town incorporated in
1914. Wamsutter became the central wool-shipping center for the entire Red Desert region, where up to
half a million sheep wintered annually (Lauritzen undated). Wamsutter also grew in response to the oil
and natural gas industries and the pipelines and compressor stations that developed in the area to support
these industries. Natural gas development has carried on to the present. Wamsutter hosted companies and
workers for the construction of two major gas pipelines in 2005 and 2006, and BP established a major
operations center on the northern edge of Wamsutter with an associated 250-bed temporary-worker
housing facility. Several large natural gas service companies have established equipment and materials
yards in the town and there are a number of modular dormitory facilities for natural gas workers in the
town’s mobile home parks.
Wamsutter is beginning to develop more highway-oriented businesses to capitalize on its location on I-80.
Although not yet reflected in state or census statistics, recent population growth in Wamsutter has been
substantial. Local officials believe that the town has more than doubled in resident population in the last
several years; including the temporary and transient gas workers, that increase is even greater. The town
has a variety of housing, planning, and infrastructure-development initiatives to accommodate current and
anticipated population growth.
2.1.3.4 City of Rock Springs
As its name implies, Rock Springs was originally settled as a stage station near a spring that bubbled from
rocks on a tributary of Bitter Creek. Because of the water, the stage station was developed as a stockade,
way station, and trading post. The interrelated development of coal mines and the railroad led to
emergence of Rock Springs as a community in the 1860s. Continued growth of the railroad and mines and
a cattle boom in the 1870s helped the town prosper. The Union Pacific railroad attracted and imported
workers from many countries to work in the area’s mines. Today, Rock Springs celebrates its ethnic
diversity with representatives of 56 different nationalities. Workers in the coal mines and railroad also
joined labor unions and established a substantial union presence in the community.
Although substantial oil exploration occurred during the 1920s and 1930s, these efforts met with little
success. Natural gas was discovered during the 1950s and the newly formed Mountain Fuel Supply
Company constructed a pipeline from the area to Salt Lake City and became a major employer in Rock
Springs.
Rock Springs boomed during the 1970s with the construction of the Jim Bridger power plant east of the
city, the development and expansion of trona mines and soda ash-processing facilities west of Green
River, and oil development in the area. Rock Springs’ population essentially doubled between 1970 and

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

7

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

1974, causing housing, infrastructure, and social problems for the city. After the completion of the power
plant and the expansions at the trona mines, Rock Springs began to lose population. Softening of energy
and trona prices further accelerated this population loss in the early 1980s, although construction projects
at the Jim Bridger power plant, Western Wyoming State College, the Chevron phosphate fertilizer plant
and the Exxon La Barge gas plant northwest of town provided a brief surge during 1984 and 1985. After
this period, population continued its decline with some increases in the 1990s due to further expansions
on the trona mines and natural gas development (Rhode 1999).
During the first years of the 21st century, natural gas development in the region generated new investment
in Rock Springs by oil and gas services companies. As of January 2007, Sweetwater County’s ten largest
employers included two oil and gas service companies; four trona/soda ash companies; the Jim Bridger
power plant; and Bridger Coal, owner of the mine that supplies the power plant (Sweetwater Economic
Development [SWEDA] 2007). At the time of this assessment, natural gas development was the primary
force driving growth in the city.
2.1.3.5 City of Green River
Green River was incorporated in 1868 in anticipation of railroad construction. Although the railroad
bypassed Green River at first because it did not own the land in the town, it returned to Green River when
water ran out at its alternate site. Green River later became the division point for the Union Pacific
railroad and the town began to thrive. For many years the Union Pacific Railroad was the major employer
in Green River. The discovery of trona-bearing formations in the late 1940s led to development of the
soda-ash industry west of Green River. During the late 1960s and 70s, the soda-ash industry went through
a major expansion, developing its own housing complexes and increasing the population of Green River
from about 3,000 to over 13,000 (Lauritzen undated). Today, four companies mine and process trona:
FMC Corporation, OCI Wyoming LP, General Chemical Corporation, Solvay Minerals Inc. A fifth,
Church and Dwight Company Inc., processes trona into soda-ash products. These companies are the
major source of employment for the city.

3. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
Economic conditions and trends for the study area were identified based on reviews of data from the
Sonoran Institute’s Economic Profile System, available online at: http://sonoran.org, the U.S. Census
Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and other federal,
state, and local sources as cited in the text.

3.1 EMPLOYMENT
Since 1970, the Sweetwater and Carbon County economies each experienced a period of substantial
growth, followed by economic contraction and adjustment, and a period of relatively protracted stability.
Renewed energy resource development across southwest Wyoming in recent years has prompted
substantial economic expansion, particularly in Sweetwater County, which functions as a regional service
center for the coal and natural gas industries.
The Sweetwater County economy gained more than 16,800 jobs between 1970 and 1980, nearly tripling
the total number of jobs in the county. The concurrent construction of a power plant, major expansions of
trona and coal mining, and natural gas development in the surrounding region all contributed to the rapid
expansion. It was during this period that Rock Springs along with Gillette and other cities in Wyoming
came to define the contemporary use of the term “boomtown.” A peak employment of 27,655 jobs
occurred in 1981. Completion of power-plant construction and transitions in the natural gas and trona

industries from development to production brought about severe economic dislocation as more than 4,000
jobs were lost between 1980 and 1988.
Local economic development and diversification efforts, coupled with expansion in mining, energy
resources, and the local trade and services industries, brought about a period of economic stability
through the 1990s with total employment fluctuating around 24,500 jobs (Figure 2).

In 2002/03, natural gas development again became a driving economic force in Sweetwater County,
prompted by national energy policy, record-high energy prices, and other factors. Nearly 3,700 jobs were
added from 2002 through 2005, with preliminary data suggesting about 2,200 additional jobs added in
2006 (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2007, Wyoming Department of Employment, 2007).
In Carbon County, employment also climbed dramatically in the early 1970s, primarily due to energy
resource development (coal, uranium and oil and gas). The net gain of 6,437 jobs from 1970 to 1980
represented a 90-percent increase in total employment. Like neighboring Sweetwater County, much of the
gain in Carbon County was also transitory, such that nearly 4,200 jobs were lost during the early/mid­
1980s, as both the local coal and uranium industries contracted. Until recently, the local economy
remained relatively stable, at least in terms of employment, fluctuating at around 9,500 jobs. More than
400 new jobs were added between 2002 and 2005, but preliminary data indicate nearly 1,200 new jobs
were added in 2006. (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2007, Wyoming Department of Employment,
2007)
The composition of the local economies during this period, in terms of covered employment, is evident in
Table 1. Mining, construction, and transportation/warehousing are the primary sectors in Sweetwater
County’s economic base. In addition to oil and gas development, the mining industry also includes two
active coal mines and four trona mines. Trade, hospitality services, health care, education, and public
sector employment, are also important economic sectors locally.

Despite the level of recent and ongoing energy resource development, the mining sector plays a more
limited role in the Carbon County economy than that of its western neighbor. Pipeline and wind-energy
facility construction; state government; health care; and the trade, accommodations, and food-service
industries have also been important to the Carbon County economy.

3.2 LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS
Local labor markets have reflected the underlying economic and demographic conditions. From 1990
through 2002, the pool of residents employed or actively seeking work remained relatively steady in
Sweetwater County. Fueled by expanded economic opportunities associated primarily with natural gas
development, migration, and increases in labor-force participation among residents, the local labor force
then expanded by almost 3,700 individuals, or 19 percent in five years.
In Carbon County, the local labor force underwent a slow but protracted decline from 1990 through 2004,
shrinking by nearly 1,200 individuals or 14 percent. This period was also characterized by steady outmigration of former residents. Over the ensuing two years, the expanded labor opportunities associated
with natural gas development attracted more than 350 additional individuals into the work force (Figure
3).

A recent analysis of work-force trends in Wyoming suggests the annual data may not fully reflect the
seasonal expansion of the labor force by commuters and non-residents who work locally for an extended
period but do not establish “residence” locally. As a result, these individuals may not be fully captured by
the statistical procedures used to estimate labor force.
Migration and commuting play significant roles in moderating local unemployment rates. Prior to the
recent resurgence in natural gas development unemployment in the region since 1990 had generally been
between 5.0 and 6.5 percent, on par or slightly above the statewide average (Figure 4).

Labor markets are very tight across the state, particularly in Sweetwater County, due to the high demand
for labor associated with ongoing energy development. Average annual unemployment for 2006 had
Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

11

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

dropped to a record low of 2.5 percent, representing fewer than 600 individuals unable to find work, or
temporarily between positions. Carbon County also had record low unemployment in 2006; fewer than
300 unemployed representing 3.4 percent of the local labor force (U.S. Department of Labor, 2006). It is
in fact likely that the effective unemployment rate is lower as the estimates of the local labor force that
serve as the basis for calculating unemployment rates likely do not capture all non-resident laborers
working in the area for an extended period but living in motels, RV parks, and other temporary housing.
The tight labor market is reflected in acute, across-the-board labor shortages in Carbon and Sweetwater
counties. All economic sectors appear to be affected by the high demand for workers. The labor shortage
has resulted in higher wages, bonuses, and per-diem payments in the natural gas industry. High wages in
the natural gas industry have resulted in job shifts and worker loss in other sectors of the economy,
creating upward pressure on wages for both the private and public sectors. Even with the increase in
wages, local and state government and private businesses are frequently short-staffed and experience high
employee turnover. The shortage of affordable housing in Carbon and Sweetwater counties (discussed in
Section 1.5) impedes recruitment of non-local workers, who frequently have difficulty competing for
housing with higher-paid gas-industry workers. Natural gas service companies have been required to
develop or contract for temporary housing for employees, many of whom are rotated in and out of the
area on a temporary basis.
Employers in other sectors of the economy are in some cases constrained from doing business because of
labor shortages. Some retail and service businesses have had to limit business hours and, in at least one
case, temporarily cease doing business because of their inability to attract or retain employees.

3.3 AGRICULTURE
As shown in Figure 5, farm employment has been more or less on a downward trend in Carbon and
Sweetwater counties since 1970. Carbon County farm employment decreased from 741 in 1970 to 564 in
2000, a 23 percent decrease over the two decades. Sweetwater County farm employment decreased from
552 to 201, a 43 percent decrease in the same period (Headwaters Economics 2007a and 2007 b).

This trend has continued in both counties since 2000, with Carbon County farm employment decreasing
by 16 jobs or about 3 percent between 2001 and 2005 and Sweetwater County losing another four jobs or
2 percent during this period, as shown in Figures 5 and 6.
As with other industries, the federal government conducts an economic census of agriculture every five
years. Results of the 2002 census were the most current available at the time this report was prepared. A
total of 460 operating farms and ranches were recorded in Sweetwater and Carbon County during that
census, as shown in Table 2. These operations involved more than 3.8 million acres, equivalent to
approximately one-third of the combined land area of the two counties. Most of the more-productive
grazing and farmlands are located outside of the project area, in particular in the eastern portions of
Carbon County.

In 2005, local ranches and farms reported total sales of $58.1 million in agricultural products, with
livestock sales the primary source of agricultural revenue in both counties. Gross annual agricultural sales
in Carbon County in 2005 were nearly ten times the level in Sweetwater County. Despite adverse effects
associated with extended drought, agricultural producers in Carbon County recorded a net $11.8 million
in income in 2005, while those in Sweetwater County realized a net income of just $0.2 million and that
only due to livestock sales that reduced overall herd size, which may compromise future recovery.
3.3.1 Grazing within the CD-C Project Area
Agricultural activities within the project area are limited to grazing on both publicly and privately owned
land. According to Section 3.17 of the CD-C EIS, 17 allotments are permitted for grazing use within the
project area. Many of these allotments extend beyond the boundaries of the project area. These allotments
cover just over one million acres and are permitted for a total of 205,430 animal unit months (AUM) of
grazing. Most of the allotments are used for cattle grazing, with a very limited amount used for sheep.
The Socioeconomic Profile prepared for the Draft EIS for the Rawlins Resource Management Plan
estimated the economic value of a cattle AUM at $31.80 and a sheep AUM at $27.44 (USBLM 2003).
Using the higher amount for cattle, the economic value of cattle grazing on the allotments included in the
project area would be over $6.5 million annually.

3.4 MINERALS SECTOR
Current and historical mining-sector activity in the study area includes trona mining in Sweetwater
County, and coal, uranium, oil, and natural gas production in both counties.
As shown in Figures 6 and 7, Both total and mining employment in Carbon and Sweetwater counties
reflect the period of intensive energy and minerals development in the late 1970s and early 1980s and the
ensuing slowdown as world energy prices fell. The decline in employment also reflects the completion of
power plant and mine and processing-facility construction projects.

Assessing recent mining-sector employment in the study area is complicated by the nature of employment
practices in the natural gas industry. Acute labor and housing shortages within the study area, coupled
with the mobile nature of many natural gas service company operations, hampers the reporting and
tracking of natural gas industry employees. Labor shortages have required some natural gas service
companies to recruit and import workers from other parts of the country. These workers often relocate to
the study area on a temporary basis; work at locations in several counties staying in temporary lodging
near the work site and return home for extended periods of time. Consequently their employment may not
be recorded in each county where their employment occurs, or if their employer is located outside the
study area, these workers may not be recorded within the affected counties at all.
Figure 8 displays total and mining-sector employment for Carbon County from 2001 through 2004.
Mining-sector employment continued to fall through 2003 and then began a gradual increase. These
statistics do not reflect employment associated with the surge in natural gas drilling activity in the county
that began in 2006. The BEA has withheld detailed mining-sector employment data for Sweetwater
County during the 2001 through 2004 period due to regulations regarding the publication of data in
instances where an industry’s local presence is concentrated in one or a few firms. Those statistics would
show an increase in mining-sector activity corresponding to increases in regional drilling activity that
began during 2004.

3.4.1 Oil and Gas
Oil and natural gas exploration and production have been important but volatile elements of the Carbon
and Sweetwater County economies for well over 30 years.
As shown in Figure 9, Carbon County natural gas production increased from 75,851 MMCF in 1995 to
110,671MMCF in 2006, or 46 percent. Carbon County oil production in 2006 was 1.9 million barrels or
about 46 percent higher than the 1995 level of 1.3 million barrels. During 2006, there were 1,458 total
producing oil and gas wells in Carbon County, and the county produced 5.5 percent of total gas produced
in Wyoming and 3.6 percent of total oil.

As shown in Figure 10, annual natural gas production in Sweetwater County decreased from 238,000
MMCF in 1995 to 192,000 MMCF in 2000, but returned to the 238,000 MMCF level in 2006.
Sweetwater County production accounted for about 12 percent of all natural gas produced in Wyoming
and about 10 percent of all oil during 2006. The county had 2,898 producing oil and gas wells in 2006
(WOGCC 1995-2006).

The outlook for future oil and gas production is in part reflected in the number of approved applications
for drilling permits (APD) logged each year. The number of approved APDs has increased substantially in
Carbon County in recent years, from 50 in 1995 to 451 in 2006 (Figure 11). This level of approved

permits is nine times that of the mid-1990s (WOGCC 1995-2003). Increased drilling activity generally
leads to increased production in the county if drilling efforts are successful and commodity prices remain
at economic levels.

The Sweetwater County economy is affected by oil and gas activity occurring beyond county boundaries,
however. Over the last decade, Rock Springs has emerged as the natural gas service center for
southwestern Wyoming. A number of oil and gas service companies have established major service
centers the Rock Springs area and these companies provide service throughout the region. Halliburton,
Schlumberger, and B J Services have all established major yards in the Rock Springs area, employing a
total of 1,360 employees in early 2007 (SWEDA 2007).
As shown in Figure 13, drilling activity in the general Rock Springs natural gas service area has increased
from 526 spuds (the beginning of drilling operations) and 465 completions (installing well casing and
wellhead to prepare the well for production) in 1995 to 1,258 spuds and 1,183 completions in 2006, a 139
percent increase in spuds and a 154 percent increase in completions during the period.

Natural Gas Price Differential
In the years preceding this assessment, natural gas sales prices in Wyoming have been substantially
lower than prices received for gas in other markets. This “price differential” is usually expressed as the
difference between average Wyoming sales prices, e.g., prices at the Opal Hub, Cheyenne Hub or some
combination of the two, and those at Louisiana’s Henry Hub. The Henry Hub is one of several reference
pricing points for natural gas. Historically, the price differentials have been a result of constraints on
natural gas transmission capacity to markets outside Wyoming. From January 2000 until the summer of
2007, the sales prices price differential between Wyoming gas and national averages ranged from a few
cents to $5.00 (Wyoming Pipeline Authority 2008). The price differential effect fluctuates substantially
based on such factors as gas supply in Wyoming and weather and other demand factors.
This price differential for Wyoming is important because it affects ad valorem production and severance
tax revenues and royalty income. The price differential also affects gas company development decisions.
Although extension of the Rockies Express Pipeline to Midwestern markets in 2008 and 2009 is forecast
to moderate the price differential substantially (Wyoming Pipeline Authority 2007) in the near term, the
price differential is likely to continue to fluctuate over the long term as additional Wyoming gas supply
comes online and additional transmission capacity to external markets is constructed in response to
increases in supply.
3.4.2 Coal
Coal has played a major role in the settlement and development of Carbon and Sweetwater counties.
Carbon County has had three major producing coal mines in the recent past: the RAG Shoshone #1 mine,
which ceased production in 2000; Arch Coal’s Seminoe #2 mine, which ended production in 2004; and
Arch Coal’s Medicine Bow mine, which suspended production during 2005. Closure of these mines
resulted in substantial economic dislocation in the Medicine Bow/Hanna/Carbon County area during the
period from 2000 through 2005. The Medicine Bow mine resumed production in 2006, producing 28,000
tons with six employees (WMA 2007), and is poised to supply the proposed DKRW coal-to-liquids plant
scheduled to begin construction in 2008.
There are two major producing coal mines in Sweetwater County. The Jim Bridger mine east of Rock
Springs supplies the Jim Bridger power plant, producing 5.4 million tons of coal during 2006 with a
workforce of 230. The Black Butte mine produced 3.4 million tons during 2006 with a workforce of 172.
Employment at both Sweetwater County coal mines has fluctuated over the last ten years. The Jim
Bridger mine has generally been reducing employees, from 390 in 1996 to 230 in 2006, while reducing
annual production from 6.3 million tons to 5.4 million tons. The Black Butte mine increased employment
during the same period, from 109 employees to 172 employees, while increasing production from 1.9
million tons to 3.4 million tons.
3.4.3 Trona
Trona is mined in Sweetwater County by four companies: FMC, General Chemical, OCI, and Solvay
Minerals. Trona is used in the production of soda ash; an estimated 95 percent of all soda ash used in
North America and 25 percent of the world’s total supply comes from trona mined in Sweetwater county.
Annual trona production has fluctuated over the past ten years, with the 17.9 million tons in 2006 being
substantially higher than the ten-year low point of 15.9 million tons in 2002. Employment at the four
Sweetwater County trona mines fell from 3,022 in 1996 to 2,258 in 2006 (WMA 2007b).

3.4.4 Uranium
Although there are substantial uranium deposits in the study area, there are currently no producing
uranium mines in Carbon or Sweetwater counties.

3.5 TOURISM, TRAVEL, AND OUTDOOR RECREATION
Tourism, travel, and outdoor recreation play an important role in the local economy, and outdoor
recreation contributes to the quality of life of residents. Much of the tourism and travel in Carbon and
Sweetwater counties is traffic passing through the region on I-80. However, a substantial level of local
tourism also occurs, primarily outdoor recreation-oriented visits associated with hunting, fishing, boating,
wildlife watching, or sightseeing. Major outdoor recreation attractions include the Flaming Gorge
National Recreation Area; the Green River, Seminole, and Pathfinder reservoirs; the Medicine Bow
National Forest; public lands open to ATV use; and public and private lands open to fishing and big and
small game hunting. Much of the land within the project area is in the latter two categories (recreation
resources and use in the project area are described in the Recreation Section [3.12] of the Continental
Divide-Creston EIS); in contrast to the key destination-type attractions that are all located outside of the
project area. Local events and cultural heritage sites also attract visitors.
An economic analysis of travel in Wyoming in 2005 estimated annual travel spending of $144.3 million
and $113.9 million in Sweetwater and Carbon counties, respectively. That spending supported an
estimated 1,930 jobs in Sweetwater County and 1,370 jobs in Carbon County (Dean Runyan Associates
2006). Analysis of the seasonal variations in employment in the accommodations and food-service
sectors, and the comparative growth in spending in recent years, indicate that a significant portion of
those totals reflect travel in the I-80 corridor and the impacts of energy workers residing temporarily in
the communities, rather than more traditional destination-type tourism.2 For instance, the variation
between peak and low monthly employment in the Sweetwater County accommodations sector, which is
the most sensitive to tourism, was about 15 percent compared to more than 28 percent statewide. And
between 2002 and 2005, a period corresponding to the dramatic increase in natural gas development,
estimated annual traveler spending increased by 44 percent in Sweetwater County and 39 percent in
Carbon County, as compared to 23 percent elsewhere in the state. These indicators point to strong demand
and potential competition between various segments of the travel/tourism markets, which translates into
consistently high nightly room rates and occupancy levels for overnight lodging and strong demand for
food services.
Local observations about the travel, tourism, and recreation economy in Carbon and Sweetwater counties
help illuminate the findings of the Dean Runyon study. As noted above, the visitor economy in Carbon
and Sweetwater counties is based on outdoor recreation and local events such as historic/cultural
celebrations, competitions, conventions, and conferences. Sweetwater and Carbon counties do not have
major tourism attractions such as Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks that attract destination
visitors. Local tourism strategies in both counties include the promotion of outdoor recreation and events
and promotion of natural features, recreation resources, and cultural heritage attractions in order to extend
the stays of outdoor recreationists, event attendees, and I-80 travelers.

2

“Travel” for the purposes of that analysis includes both business and pleasure travel by residents and non-residents that was
more than 50 miles from the traveler’s home. In the study area this would include spending by all travelers on I-80, as well as
that by non-resident workers employed in the area on an extended basis but staying in local motels, hotels and campgrounds.

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

The current natural gas expansion in Carbon and Sweetwater counties has had both beneficial and adverse
effects on tourism and recreation-related businesses. In addition to the general across-the-board increase
in business, the beneficial effects of the gas expansion include increases in customers and occupancy rates
during the traditional winter and spring off-seasons, which increases the year-round profitability of
businesses catering to travelers. High demand has also resulted in an increase in the number of lodging
and dining establishments that increase the lodging and dining base for tourism and recreation visitors.
High occupancy rates for lodging establishments has also resulted in a dramatic increase in lodging tax
revenues; lodging tax revenues in Rawlins increased from $110,000 to $305,000 between FY 2002 and
FY 2007 and from $254,000 to $582,000 in Rock Springs during the same period. Local tourism and
recreation organizations have used these revenues to develop promotional materials and to promote
events that bring visitors to the area and increase the average length of stay.
Adverse effects include the high occupancy rates in lodging establishments, particularly during summer
months, which reduces lodging availability for recreationists, event attendees, and travelers on I-80. Most
returning recreation visitors and event coordinators have adjusted to this situation by reserving blocks of
rooms and notifying attendees of the necessity of advance booking.
Travel and tourism business, like most businesses in the study area have difficulty in recruiting and
retaining employees during periods of energy expansion. Wages in the travel and tourism industry are
typically below those of the natural gas industry, so it is difficult for travel/tourism businesses to compete
for employees. As with most businesses in other sectors, the lower wages make competition for housing
resources difficult, limiting the amount of non-local workers who can relocate to the area to accept
employment in the travel and tourism industries (Radar 2007, Spicer 2008).
There has been recent concern about the effect that energy resource development may have on the
amenity values of public lands and the resultant effects on tourism and recreation. Data on the
contributions of such activity is unavailable on a consistent basis across all counties. Consequently, a
simple proxy for tourism and recreation employment, based on total retail trade employment, combined
with total services employment in 1990 and employment in accommodations and food services in 2005,
was developed for this analysis. As shown in Table 3 below, employment in the designated sectors has
grown more rapidly in Carbon and Sweetwater counties than in the peer group of all rural counties. In
both cases, the demands associated with the energy industry, as well as pass-through travel on I-80 likely
account for much of the change. And while these results do not preclude the potential that energy resource
development has had some adverse impacts on tourism and outdoor recreation, it does suggest that the
local gains in most businesses that serve tourism and recreation visitors exceed those that might have been
expected absent energy resource development.

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

On a statewide basis, there is growing interest among tourism officials and the tourism industry
concerning potential effects of the pace and level of gas development on vital tourism and recreation
resources. These include natural resources such as wildlife, air quality, and viewsheds and the ability of
tourism-related businesses to deliver basic services. Visitation levels at Wyoming’s major tourist
attractions do not appear to have been affected yet; 2007 was a record year for visitors to Yellowstone
National Park (Casper Star Tribune 2008) and third-quarter lodging sales in Teton County, which serves
both Yellowstone and Teton National Parks, grew by 14.7 percent over the previous year (WEAD 2007c).
Tourism officials are nonetheless concerned about the potential long-term adverse effects of the combined
loss of wildlife habitat and encroachment of gas fields on viewsheds near tourist destinations and along
routes to those destinations. They are also concerned about the ability of travelers to major tourism
destinations to find lodging in communities along routes to those destinations (Bryan 2008).

3.6 ENERGY DEVELOPMENT EFFECTS ON RETIREMENT MIGRATION AND NONLOCATION-DEPENDENT BUSINESSES
Recent economic research has highlighted the role of amenity values of public lands in attracting
retirement migration and non-location-dependent businesses for rural communities in the west, and some
rural western communities have adopted attraction of retirement migration and non location-dependent
businesses as a component of their overall economic development strategy. Public comments during the
scoping for this EIS and on other natural-resource development actions in the region have expressed
concern about the effects of energy development on the amenity values of public lands and the resultant
effects on retirement migration, non-location-specific business attraction, and tourism/recreation
visitation.
These topics, as related to the study area, are examined briefly below using an analytical framework
combining comparative cross-sectional and time series analyses. A comparative approach is used because
the primary subjects, e.g., retiree migration, non-location-specific business attraction, and
tourism/recreation visitation are not directly observable or reported in available data. The analyses rely on
county-level economic and population data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S.
Census Bureau for counties in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. The dataset
spans the period 1990 to 2005. There are 249 counties in the six states. Of these, 198 are considered
“rural” for the purposes of this analysis. The 51 counties excluded from the analysis included 43 counties
with a population of 50,000 or more in 2005 and eight winter-resort counties, e.g., Pitkin, Colorado and
Teton, Wyoming, whose economic structure is atypical of others in the region.
3.6.1 Per-Capita Personal Income
A common measure of economic health is per-capita personal income. Per-capita personal incomes have
grown across the west. Between 1990 and 2005, average per-capita personal income across the 198 rural
counties increased by 79 percent. The change in per-capita income in Carbon County over the same
period was just slightly above that for all rural counties, in percentage terms. As a result, the margin in
per-capita personal income for Carbon County residents climbed to a 19 percent margin above the overall
average. Per-capita incomes in Sweetwater County grew by 108 percent during the same period,
increasing the margin from 26 percent to 46 percent above the overall rural average (Table 4).

3.6.2 Contributions of Non-earned Income to Personal Income Growth
Higher wages and salaries were the major contributors to personal income growth during this period.
However, non-earned income in the form of dividends, interest and rent (DIR), and personal current
transfers (PCT), which includes unemployment, income maintenance, and retirement receipts, also
increased rapidly. Such non-earned income, which tends to be positively correlated to retired populations,
has become a topic of increased interest in rural economic development circles as it is seen as a
mechanism to bolster local demand for retail trade and services.
An analysis of the constituents of local personal income across rural western counties reveals some
differences in the absolute and relative contributions of earnings, DIR, and PCT (Figure 15). Across the
rural counties, per-capita total personal income increased by $11,509. Per-capita earnings, DIR, and PCT
accounted for $7,150 (62 percent), $1,627 (14 percent), and $2,732 (24 percent) of the net change,
respectively. In Carbon County, DIR accounted for a larger role in the net change in income of $13,727,
$4,300 (31 percent), compared to net earnings of $6,697 (49 percent) and PCT of $2,730 (20 percent). In
Sweetwater County, earnings were the dominant factor, accounting for $14,603 (74 percent) of the net
increase of $19,689. Although smaller in relative terms, the contributions of higher DIR and PCT were
significant in absolute terms: $2,953 and $2,133, respectively.

The growth trends in per-capita DIR and retirement income are shown in Figures 16 and 17 below. As
shown, the pace of DIR growth in Carbon and Sweetwater counties has exceeded that of the peer group of
rural counties, while the growth in per-capita retirement income has generally paralleled that for all rural
counties. The latter is noteworthy given the high labor force participation in Sweetwater County and the
large non-working population in Carbon County associated with the Wyoming State Penitentiary.

These trends suggest little or no difference in the influence of retirement income or migration within the
region when compared to all rural counties.
Relatively few retirees relocate to Carbon and Sweetwater County from outside these counties. Some
retirees move from smaller communities and ranches to Rawlins, Rock Springs, or Green River, and some
retirees have accompanied family members relocating for employment purposes, but most of the growth
in retirement appears to be associated with the aging of the resident workforce (Ducker 2007, Archer,
2007).
3.6.3 Non-Farm Proprietors and Non-Farm Proprietor Income
A common economic development goal for many rural areas is the attraction of location-independent
professionals and professional service firms. Encouraging local start-ups is another common goal. Many
of the individuals associated with such activities are proprietors, which as a group are important in the
overall economy. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reports the number of farm and non-farm
proprietors by county, using data from income tax records. The data are not reported by major industrial
sector.
As a group, non-farm proprietors account for 22.8 percent of all jobs in the rural areas, up from 18.9
percent in 1990. Non-farm proprietors also accounted for an increasing share of total employment in
Carbon and Sweetwater counties as shown in Table 5, although there are some key differences with
respect to the two counties. Carbon County has experienced a more rapid rate of growth in the number of
non-farm proprietors and such proprietors account for a larger share of employment when compared to
the peer group of all rural counties. Because of the presence of the large trona and coal mines and sodaash and fertilizer manufacturing, Sweetwater County has had relatively fewer proprietors and has seen
lower growth in the number of non-farm proprietors and a substantially lower share of employment
accounted for by such proprietors. The recent growth in energy development employment would
contribute to the latter.

In addition to differences in the share of non-farm proprietors, there are noteworthy differences in non­
farm proprietor earnings (Table 6). As shown, average annual incomes across the rural areas are
substantially lower than in the urban and resort areas. Average annual income for non-farm proprietors in
Carbon County, historically lower than the peer group, is now on par. However, the average income for
non-farm proprietors in Sweetwater County is more than twice the average for all rural counties, and
higher than even the averages for the urban and resort counties. The differences may indicate a higher
tendency for part-time proprietors in rural areas as compared to Sweetwater County, or differences in the
industries and activities in which non-farm proprietors are active in Sweetwater County.

While the non-farm proprietor data reveal differences between Carbon and Sweetwater counties as
compared to the peer group, they are inconclusive with respect to whether or not energy development
stimulates or adversely affects the recruitment or operations of location-independent non-farm
proprietors.

3.7 PERSONAL INCOME AND POVERTY
Residents of Sweetwater County had total personal income of $1,446.2 million in 2005. The total
personal income of Carbon County’s residents was $471.5 million. Wages, salaries, and proprietors’
income accounted for the majority of total income in both counties, although non-labor earnings,
including dividends, interest, and rent, were significant in both counties. Net negative residency
adjustments, paid to workers whose permanent residence is elsewhere, were also registered in both
counties. The net outflow was particularly noteworthy in Sweetwater County where a net outflow of
nearly $111 million occurred in 2005 (Table 7). Personal current transfer receipts are a significant source
of income in the region, accounting for 10 percent of all income in Sweetwater and 15 percent of income
in Carbon County.

The net earnings adjustment for residency is the net inflow/(outflow) of earnings of local residents commuting to
jobs in other counties, less earnings paid by local firms to workers commuting to work from other counties.

Personal current transfer receipts are benefits received for which no current services are performed. Examples
include unemployment, retirement and disability benefits, Medicare, and public medical and income maintenance.
Pensions and annuities for private and government employee retirement plans are not included.

When taken on a per-capita basis, the personal income of Sweetwater County residents led the statewide
average by a modest margin, about $700 in 2005. The difference extends a long-established trend wherein
per-capita personal income in the county has trailed the statewide average only four times since 1969.
Per-capita personal income among Sweetwater County residents in 2005 was also more than 10 percent
higher than the national average of $34,471.
The relationship in Sweetwater contrasts with that in Carbon County where residents had an average
income of $30,961 per capita, about $6,300 below the statewide average. In 1979, Carbon County
residents enjoyed a per-capita income 18 percent above the statewide average. By 1984, local income had
declined to the point of being on par with the statewide average. Local income growth since then has not
kept pace with the statewide average, creating a “gap” that continues to grow.
The income disparities are also apparent in the 1999 median household income, which accounts for
differences in household size: $28,702 in Sweetwater, $30,979 in Carbon, and $33,024 statewide,
compared to $41,994 for the nation as a whole.
3.7.1 Poverty and Median Household Income
The national average for the incidence of poverty in 1999 was 11.9 percent (Table 8). The poverty rate for
Wyoming was slightly lower at 11.2 percent. Relatively fewer people were in poverty in Sweetwater
County (8.3 percent), with the incidence of poverty in Carbon County comparable to the national average.
The comparative economic welfare of individuals and households is mirrored in the estimated median
household incomes, with $36,291 in Carbon County trailing both the statewide and national averages,
while $48,434 in Sweetwater County was 29 percent higher than the statewide average.

The favorable economic times tied to recent energy resource and mineral development in the region and
across the state have boosted median household incomes and lowered local poverty rates slightly, even as
the statewide rates declined by nearly a full percent.

3.8 COST OF LIVING
Per-capita and median household incomes provide one perspective on economic welfare. The cost of
living provides a counterbalancing perspective. The Wyoming Department of Administration and
Information compiles a quarterly Wyoming Cost of Living Index (WCLI) for 28 cities and towns across
the state, at least one of which is located in each county. The index is based on the costs of 140 items and
services, weighted according to their relative role in the typical consumer’s budget. Housing and
transportation are the two largest categories, collectively accounting for over 65 percent of the total index.
The statewide index is assigned a value of 100 and is the basis for computing the index value for the other
locations.
Six communities registered index values of over 100 in the Fourth Quarter 2006 WCLI. Teton
County/Jackson, with an index value of 133, rated the most expensive Wyoming community in which to
live. Sweetwater County, the rating for which reflects a composite of prices in Rock Springs and Green
River, ranked third highest at 107. The high cost of rental housing was a major contributor to that rating
as the costs of food, apparel, and recreation were below the statewide averages. Carbon County, which
reflects prices in Rawlins, ranked sixth highest at 103 with above statewide average costs in every
category (WDAI 2007).
One indication of the effects of natural gas development on the cost of living in the study area is the
recent increase in rental-housing rates, particularly in Carbon County. As shown in Table 9, the changes
in Sweetwater County rental-housing costs exceeded the statewide average in every category between
fourth quarter 2005 and fourth quarter 2006. Carbon County rental housing increases in the same period
were remarkable, ranging from 23.9 percent in rental housing, 14 percentage points higher than the
statewide average, to 125.5 percent in mobile home lot-rental costs, nearly ten times the statewide
average.

4. POPULATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS
Figure 18 displays population statistics for Carbon and Sweetwater counties between 1970 and 2006.
These statistics show the population effects of the mining and energy expansion, which began in the early
1970s, peaked in the early 1980s in both counties, and then began to decline. Carbon County population
increased by 69 percent between 1970 and 1982 and Sweetwater County population increased by 149
percent. Sweetwater County experienced a brief resurgence of the boom in the mid-1980s during
construction of the Exxon La Barge gas-sweetening plant, expansion of the Jim Bridger power plant,
construction of the Chevron Phosphate plant east of Rock Springs, and expansion of Western Wyoming
College.

Sweetwater County population showed modest upward trends in the 1990s resulting from a number of
construction projects and ongoing maintenance of mining and energy facilities. The county’s recent
natural gas-related growth surge began in 2004 (Table 10), though local resident population remained
about 6,000 residents below the peak in 1981-82. Carbon County continued its downward trend for much
of the 1990s, stabilizing between 15,000 and 15,500 during the first half of the decade beginning in 2000.

Sweetwater and Carbon County officials believe that U.S. Census population estimates do not fully
reflect the population growth during the boom years. SWEDA developed population estimates for the
county and its incorporated municipalities, based on residential utility hook-ups and an average personsper-household estimate (2.58) obtained from the Wyoming Department of Research and Planning. As
shown in Figure 19, the 2006 SWEDA estimate is over 11 percent higher than the Census estimate.

The components of population-change statistics shown in Table 11 show net out-migration of population
in both counties between 2000 and 2006. Again these statistics do not capture the large temporary
population in both counties that accompanied the recent surge in natural gas development.

Table 12 displays population statistics for selected communities in Carbon and Sweetwater counties.
Again these statistics do not reflect the increases in temporary population associated with the surge in
natural gas development. In Carbon County, the population loss reflected in the statistics occurred in
Rawlins and Sinclair; other areas of the county remained relatively stable with modest gains. In
Sweetwater County, Rock Springs, Green River, and Wamsutter population statistics show modest gains,
while Superior showed modest losses and Bairoil remained constant during this period. Other areas of the
county had modest gains.

There is substantial local disagreement with recent U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for
communities in Sweetwater County and western Carbon County. Figure 20 below contrasts U.S. Census
Bureau 2006 population estimates with those prepared by SWEDA. SWEDA’s estimates are 15 percent
higher in Rock Springs, 3 percent higher in Green River and 128 percent higher in Wamsutter. Although

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

33

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

they have not prepared their own estimates, Rawlins and Baggs officials also believe that the U.S. Census
Bureau estimates for 2006 substantially underestimate population in their communities, based on
increases in utility hook-ups and building permits (Derragon 2008, Corners 2007).

Sources: Population Division, U.S. Census Bureau March 20, 2007, Compiled by Wyoming Dept. of A & I, Economic
Analysis Division and SWEDA 2007. The Census estimate is for July 2006 and the SWEDA estimate is for December
2006. SWEDA estimates do not contain estimates for unincorporated taxing districts adjacent to the municipalities.

The U.S. Census Bureau also estimates the age and racial characteristics of population in counties (see
Table 13). Based on the estimates for 2006, residents of Carbon County tend to be older than those in
Sweetwater County, the State of Wyoming, and the United States overall. In Carbon County, nearly one
of five residents is 65 years or older, as compared to less than one in eight in the State of Wyoming. The
median age has increased slightly in the past six years.
The largest share of population in both counties are persons aged 18 to 64 years, and this group of
working-age persons has increased more in the last six years than have the other age groups. In Carbon
County, the number of persons aged 18 to 64 increased by 11.9 percent from 2000 to 2006, while the
number of persons under age 17 decreased by 10.5 percent and the number of persons 65 years and older
increased slightly, by 1.2 percent. In Sweetwater County, the number of persons aged 18 to 64 increased
by 21.4 percent from 2000 to 2006, while the number of young persons under age 17 decreased by 4.0
percent and the number of persons 65 years and older increased by 6.4 percent. Increases in the number of
working-age persons in these counties can be correlated to recent increases in jobs, particularly in the
mining sector, which attracts a high portion of working adults. Also consistent with this pattern is the
number of natural gas-related jobs attracting younger male workers who are unmarried or are not
accompanied by school-age children. In addition, the number of mining-sector jobs has increased
significantly in Sweetwater compared to Carbon County, which is also reflected in the significant increase
in working-age adults in Sweetwater County as compared to Carbon County.

The racial and ethnic compositions of the local populations reflect the influences of migration, historical
settlement patterns, and economic factors. From the 2000 Census, Carbon County’s resident population
was 82.4 percent white and not Hispanic or Latino, with 17.6 percent of the population being made up of
persons of other races, multiple races, and/or of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Sweetwater County had a
larger share of the population that is white and not Hispanic or Latino, with 86.9 percent of the population
as non-Hispanic white and 13.1 percent of the population being made up of persons of other races,
multiple races, and/or Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Though the percentage share of racial and ethnic
minorities in these two counties was higher than for the State of Wyoming as a whole, the percentage
share of racial and ethnic minorities in these two counties was much lower than that for the United States.
The largest racial and ethnic minority group in both counties was Hispanic and Latino, making up 13.8
percent of the Carbon County population and 9.4 percent of the Sweetwater County population (Table
14).

The Economic Analysis Division of the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information
prepares population forecasts for Wyoming and its counties and municipalities. The most recent forecasts
(see Figure 21) at the time of this assessment show Carbon County population remaining relatively stable,
between 15,320 and 15,730 over the next 15 years, with modest (less than 3 percent) growth during the
next five years. The forecasts show Sweetwater County population trending upward, increasing from
38,740 in 2006 to 43,990 in 2020–an increase of 5,250 or 14 percent during the 15-year period. Local
officials believe these forecasts do not adequately reflect the level of natural gas development anticipated
to occur during this period.

5. HOUSING
This section provides information about conventional and temporary housing resources in the study area.
For this assessment, conventional housing includes single and multifamily residences and mobile homes.
Temporary housing includes motels, hotels, recreational vehicle parks, and temporary living facilities.
Most housing within the study area is located within communities. Rural subdivisions exist in both
counties, but both counties discourage rural residential subdivisions of substantial size or density.
Housing, particularly affordable housing, is one of the two key issues routinely cited by the local officials,
service administrators, and local residents interviewed for this assessment. In fact, affordable housing or
the lack thereof affects employment recruitment and retention, the second key issue cited by interviewees.
The lack of affordable housing in the area also contributes to the single-status worker phenomenon,
wherein workers relocate to the study area in single status, in part because they cannot find suitable
affordable housing to accommodate their households. The high proportion of single-status gas-field
workers and the resulting scarcity of other household members results in fewer workers to fill secondary
jobs. Potential non-local secondary workers have difficulty relocating to communities in the study area
because their lower earnings place them at a competitive disadvantage with the higher-paid gas-field
workers for available housing. This phenomenon compounds the shortage of workers in the study area, as
discussed in Section 1.2.2.1.

5.1 CARBON COUNTY
The 2000 Census tallied 8,307 housing units in Carbon County, 74 percent of which were occupied and
26 percent of which were vacant. Nearly half of the vacancies were homes held for seasonal use. Some of
the remaining vacancies were homes in substandard condition. Of the occupied units, 71 percent were
owner-occupied and 29 percent were renter-occupied (Table 15). In the intervening years since the 2000
Census, occupancy rates have risen substantially, with communities in the western part of the county
reporting virtually no vacant habitable units at the time of this assessment.

Figure 22 displays annual residential housing-unit building permits for Carbon County from 1980 through
2007. The bulk of permits were issued in the early 1980s with a brief surge in building in the mid- to late
1990s. Since 2000, county building permits averaged 50 per year, although the number of permits issued
has climbed steadily during 2004 - 2006. In 2006, 78 building permits were issued for residential units in
Carbon County. Of those 72 (92 percent) were for single family homes.

In recent years, several large, temporary living facilities have been built for workers near the gas fields in
Carbon County. A temporary living facility developed along WY 789 north of Dad for Devon Energy
currently houses about 80 workers and can be expanded to house a total of 150 workers (Adams 2005). A
second camp has been developed along WY 789 for Nabors Drilling and a third camp has recently been
proposed.
5.1.1 City of Rawlins
Information about housing conditions in Rawlins was obtained from the 2007 Rawlins Housing
Assessment (Kirkham & Associates LLC 2007) and from other primary and secondary sources as cited.
The housing assessment is intended to assist city officials, community leaders, and developers in planning
for infrastructure and housing development in response to current and future growth.
The 2000 Census counted 3,860 housing units in the City of Rawlins, 86 percent of which were occupied
and 14 percent of which were vacant. Eighty percent of the city’s housing stock is at least 30 years old.
Houses vacant for seasonal use total just over one percent of total housing. Some of the remaining
vacancies were homes in substandard condition. Of the occupied units, 68 percent were owner-occupied
and 32 percent were renter-occupied (Table 16).

Figure 23 displays the number of residential building permits and mobile home set-up permits within the
City of Rawlins for 2001 through 2006. Residential building permits increased from two in 2001 to 29 in
2006. Mobile home set-ups increased from seven in 2001 to 70 in 2006. The increase in mobile home
placements is associated with the expansion of two mobile home parks (RDT 2007).

Rawlins has 11 apartment complexes with a total of 439 units. The newest of these is an 85-unit complex
built in 1997, although the Bitter Creek low-income rent-assisted apartments were rehabilitated in 2003.
The Wyoming Housing Database Partnership estimated that rental hosing vacancies were less than 1
percent in December 2006. According to the 2007 Housing Assessment, there have been no apartment
vacancies over the past year and most complexes had waiting lists ranging from five to 75 applicants.
Adjusted for duplicate applicants, it is estimated that there was a total of 131 applicants on waiting lists
during the summer of 2007. Monthly rental rates for apartments ranged from $358 (subsidized) to $1,800.
Estimated average rental rates for apartments in Carbon County were $619 in the second quarter of 2006,
about 13 percent higher than the statewide average. Average rents in the first quarter of 2007 were
estimated at $781. One of the low-income apartment complexes is moving to a market-based rent
structure no longer accepting U.S. housing and Urban Development rent vouchers from low-income
residents. This could displace 52 low-income families. The 2007 Housing Assessment estimates that the
city needs 170 additional multi-family units, of which 100 should be rent-assisted. The Wyoming
Department of Corrections is considering renovating a modular facility at the Wyoming State Penitentiary
Complex for use as short-term dormitories for newly-hired employees.
Rawlins has 19 mobile home parks but had virtually no vacancies during the summer of 2007. In recent
years, three mobile home parks with a total of 146 pads were converted to lot ownership where the mobile
home owner also owns the lot. The 2007 Housing Assessment projects demand for three new mobile
home parks in Rawlins by 2010.
The 2007 Rawlins Housing Assessment defines affordable housing as being priced at $160,000 or below,
although lower-income buyers would need assistance to purchase a house at the higher end of this range.
Average housing construction costs were estimated upwards of $160 per square foot during summer of

2007, which would yield a construction cost as high as $192,000 for a modest 1,100 to 1,200 square-foot
home.
The 2007 Housing Assessment estimated that Rawlins would need an additional 72 homes per year for
the next three years. As of the summer of 2007, no new subdivisions had been approved within the City
of Rawlins since 1998. There were approximately 100 vacant lots in subdivisions during the summer of
2007 (Mika 2007). According to the 2007 Housing Assessment, all available vacant lots have been
purchased by contractors and developers. There are about 30 vacant infill lots in the City and about 50
substandard housing units that are uninhabitable (ibid). The city is exploring the feasibility of
demolishing vacant substandard units and placing affordable modular housing on the lots. The first
project in this initiative involved two city-owned lots. The city also purchased an unimproved 50-acre
tract that it intends to use for affordable housing. Current estimates are that 300 to 400 single-family,
townhouse, and apartment units could be developed on this parcel at a sales-price range of $190,000 or
less. A 100-unit subdivision is proposed north of the Highland Hills neighborhood.
Rawlins has 22 motels with a total of over 1,000 rooms. During winter months, some motels offer weekly
or monthly rates and are typically filled with energy industry workers. Discounted rates are rarely offered
during summer. Although most of the larger motels try to reserve some rooms for travelers, most motels
fill early during summer months.
Rawlins has no housing dedicated for seniors and no housing facilities for the homeless.
5.1.2 Baggs
The 2000 Census counted 197 total housing units in the Town of Baggs, 75 percent of which were
occupied and 25 percent of which were vacant. Houses vacant for seasonal use totaled 4 percent of total
housing. Of the occupied units, 73 percent were owner-occupied and 27 percent were renter-occupied (see
Table 17).

There have been some additions to the housing stock in Baggs since 2000 and additional housing is
planned. A developer is planning six lots within the town and another developer purchased 16 lots
adjacent to the town and has connected the subdivision to the town’s water and wastewater mains. Most
housing in the Baggs area is manufactured housing and mobile homes. There is little available rental
housing and rents have increased dramatically in recent months (Corners 2007).
In the Baggs area, temporary housing resources include two motels with a total of 64 rooms and a 26­
space mobile home park equipped to accommodate RVs and mobile homes. Within the park there are
several mobile homes for rent, but again, these are rarely vacant.

The 2000 Census enumerated 15,921 total housing units in Sweetwater County, 89 percent of which were
occupied and 11 percent were vacant. Houses vacant for seasonal use totaled about 1.5 percent of total
housing. Of the occupied units, 75 percent were owner-occupied and 25 percent were renter-occupied

Figure 24 displays annual building permits for Sweetwater County from 1980 through 2006. In the first
few years of the 1980s Sweetwater County was adding housing to accommodate energy and mining
workers. Sweetwater County entities issued a total of 2,224 building permits from 1980 through 1987.
Housing demand declined sharply during the economic contractions that followed the completion of
construction at the power plant and major capital expansions at the trona mines. Consequently, total
county building permits averaged less than 70 per year for the next 16 years. New residential construction
increased dramatically in 2004, totaling over 200 units annually from 2004 through 2006.

The Wyoming Housing Database Partnership estimated that rental housing vacancy rates in Sweetwater
County were less than 1 percent in December 2006. The tight housing market is reflected in rising rents;
the average apartment rental rate rose from $512 in the second quarter of 2005 to $684 in the second
quarter of 2006, an increase of almost 34 percent in one year. Average rental rates of detached singlefamily homes increased approximately 21 percent during the same period while the average monthly rent
for mobile homes increased almost 13 percent and the average rent for a mobile home lot rose by 11
percent. As elsewhere in southwestern Wyoming, the shortage and high cost of rental housing is a
constraining factor on employee relocation and on the ability of people on low or fixed incomes to
acquire and retain rental housing.
One large temporary living facility has recently been developed just north of the Sweetwater County
community of Wamsutter. ESS Support Services, under contract to BP, has developed a 250-bed facility
with food service, housekeeping, and recreation facilities. The Wamsutter Base Camp is open to BP
employees and contractors. The facility is permitted for 500 beds and will expand as demand emerges.
ESS provides transportation to and from work sites and the Rock Springs airport. The facility also
provides catering services for rig moves and other gas-field events (Van Rensburg 2007).
5.2.1 City of Rock Springs
The 2000 Census counted 8,359 total housing units in Rock Springs, 88 percent of which were occupied
and 12 percent of which were vacant. Houses vacant for seasonal use totaled less than 1 percent of total
housing. Of the occupied units, 72 percent were owner-occupied and 28 percent were renter-occupied
(Table 20).

Rock Springs has seen dramatic changes in housing conditions since the 2000 Census, particularly in the
past three to four years, driven primarily by the increase in demand associated with natural gas
development.
The City of Rock Springs issued a Final Housing Plan (the Housing Plan) in September of 2007 to inform
the community about anticipated housing needs and potential housing development opportunities in the
city (City of Rock Springs Housing and Community Development 2007). The Housing Plan identified
1,560 acres of land used for residential purposes and 8,899 housing units located within the city during
January of 2007 (see Table 21). Table 21 displays the distribution of housing units by type within the city.
Single-family units were the predominant form of housing with 60 percent of all housing being singlefamily detached units.

The number of housing units in Rock Springs grew by about 8 percent, 685 units, between 2004 and
January 2007 according to the Housing Plan. This generally coincides with the period of intensified
natural gas development in the region.
The January 2007 inventory conducted for the Housing Plan identified 705 vacant residential lots, but
noted that these lots were not all available for sale and development. The City approved 33 new
subdivisions between January 2004 and May of 2007. Of those, 25 subdivisions were for residential
development with the potential to create over 2,000 residential lots. If all subdivision applications
submitted to the Rock Springs Planning Department as of June 2007 were approved, an additional 1,385
new residential lots within the City would be available for development.
The average price of an improved residential property (a lot with a house) in Rock Springs during 2006
was $175,500, about 28 percent higher than the 2004 average of $137,500. The average price for
unimproved residential property (a vacant building lot) increased from $48,958 in 2004 to $160,989 in
2006, or 229 percent. According to the Housing Plan, these increases can largely be attributed to a
shortage in available housing inventory and strong housing demands from an incoming workforce.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Although not establishing an affordable housing threshold, the Housing Plan suggests that given the
relatively high per-capita personal incomes in Rock Springs ($38,039 in 2005), many local workers in
Rock Springs could afford an average-priced home, if it were available.3 In addition, given the relatively
large number of two-income households (43 percent in 2000), many households with members earning
below-average incomes could also afford the average-priced home, if it were available.
The Housing Plan forecasts future demand for housing units for purchase based on the plan’s population
projections for the 2007–2017 period, the 2000 average household size of 2.48 persons per household,
and various assumptions concerning housing preferences. The Housing Plan forecasts demand for 1,539
new housing sales units and 1,100 new rental units by 2017. The Housing Plan also forecasts increased
demand for senior housing, housing for persons with disabilities, and low-income households. This
demand is based on a Rock Springs population forecast of 27,113 persons by 2017, contrasted with the
Wyoming Economic Analysis Division forecast of 21,474 persons by 2017.
5.2.2 Green River
The 2000 Census counted 4,426 total housing units in Green River, 94 percent of which were occupied
and 6 percent of which were vacant. Houses vacant for seasonal use totaled less than 1 percent of total
housing. Of the occupied units, 76 percent were owner-occupied and 24 percent were renter-occupied (see
Table 22).

Like all other communities in the CD-C study area, Green River’s housing conditions have changed
substantially since the 2000 Census. A total of 159 housing units were constructed between 2000 and
May of 2007. As of September 2007 there were only 59 available residential lots within the City of Green
River (Wyoming Business Council 2007, Brown 2007). However, a total of 420 housing units are
proposed for the next three years and subdivisions containing 550 to 800 lots are currently in the
conceptual stage of development (Green River Futures 2007).
5.2.3 Wamsutter
The 2000 Census counted 148 total housing units in Sweetwater County, 68 percent of which were
occupied and 32 percent of which were vacant. Houses vacant for seasonal use totaled less than 1 percent
of total housing. Of the occupied units, 67 percent were owner-occupied and 33 percent were renteroccupied (Table 23).

Housing conditions in Wamsutter have also changed dramatically in recent years. A July 2007 count
identified 20 single-family housing units, two multifamily units, 39 modular units, 117 mobile homes, 49
RVs, and 19 four-person dormitory units. Wamsutter had no available rental units during the summer of
2007 (Carnes 2007).
Three new residential subdivisions, with a total of about 60 lots, are planned for Wamsutter. The
developers are also building homes on these lots. The Town is attempting to purchase 40 acres on the
west side of town from the BLM for residential development. Two new motels are also planned. An
existing mobile home park is planned for conversion to commercial lots and an RV park (Carnes 2007).

6. COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES
This section describes the current condition of community infrastructure and services likely to be directly
affected by the Proposed Action and alternatives.

6.1 CARBON COUNTY
Carbon County provides law enforcement and emergency response services to the eastern portion of the
project area and provides services to direct and secondary CDC-related establishments, workers, and their
households who reside in Carbon County. Carbon County services are generally headquartered in
Rawlins, in the Carbon County Court House, the Carbon Building, the County Road and Bridge Shop and
the National Guard Armory. Road and bridge maintenance, one of the county services most affected by
natural gas development and production activities, is discussed in the Transportation section of this
assessment.
6.1.1 Carbon County Sheriff’s Office
The Carbon County Sheriff’s Office provides law enforcement services throughout Carbon County,
including certain services in incorporated municipalities. In and near the project area, the Sheriff’s Office
provides patrol services, civil service, traffic enforcement, response to accidents and emergencies,
criminal investigation, coordination of local search and rescue, and responds to calls for other law
enforcement-related services. The Sheriff’s Office provides dispatch services for most of the county,
including the project area, and operates the Carbon County Jail, which provides detention services for the
entire county. The Sheriff’s Office, jail, and dispatch facilities are located in Rawlins.
As of July 2007, the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office had the following staff:




17 sworn officers including the Sheriff and Under sheriff
23 detention deputies
One court security officer

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT






Two detectives
Seven full-time and 3 part-time dispatch staff
Six support staff
Two victim’s advocates

There are two deputies allocated to the Baggs area south of the project area and deputies are also stationed
in Hanna, McFadden, and Saratoga. New sheriff’s office employees who relocated to the area often have
difficulty finding affordable housing; at the time of this assessment a lack of affordable housing has kept
a new deputy from relocating to Baggs. The combination of law enforcement academy and on-the-job
training required to prepare a new officer for duty generally takes six months.
The recently constructed Carbon County detention facility has 78 beds including some dedicated for
female inmates. Adolescent detainees must be transported to a facility in Casper. The jail has been in
operation for just over two years and recent jail occupancy has been in the mid-50s range. The Sheriff’s
Office believes that the facility may reach capacity sooner than its intended target of 10 to15 years.
The Sheriff’s Office has recently seen an increase in calls to respond to industrial accidents, vehicle
accidents, crime, and traffic infractions in the part of the county that includes the project area and other
natural gas fields. The increase in calls reflects, in large part, the increase in industrial and human activity
in this remote rural area. Carbon County Road 701, known locally as the Wamsutter/Dad Road, lies
entirely within the project area and is the busiest road in the county. The Sheriff’s Office, working in
cooperation with the Carbon County Road and Bridge Department, recently posted a 45 mph speed limit
on CR 701, with a 30 mph limit on certain curves. The road department installed signs and the Sheriff’s
office routinely monitors speed on the road. These actions are intended to reduce accidents and reduce
wear and tear on the road resulting from excessive speed, particularly associated with heavy trucks.
Like many communities, Carbon County has experienced a surge in methamphetamine use in recent
years. The Sheriff’s Department, in cooperation with the Rawlins Police Department and other agencies,
formed a Drug Task Force and engaged the community in a multi-faceted effort to address the problem.
This effort includes education and prevention measures, rigorous prosecution of offenders, and expanded
treatment options. As a result, the Sheriff’s Office believes that methamphetamine use has recently
diminished in Carbon County (Morris 2007).
6.1.2 Emergency Management and Response
Carbon County Emergency Management coordinates emergency response services within the county.
Emergency response services in western Carbon County, including the project area, are provided by fire
departments and ambulance services from Rawlins, Baggs, and Wamsutter. These services are described
in the sections dealing with each community.
The emergency management coordinators for Carbon and Sweetwater Counties are in the process of
establishing cooperative emergency-response staging locations in the Wamsutter area. This would allow
employees working in remote areas to meet emergency responders at predetermined areas to guide them
to remote accident locations.
6.1.3 Family Services
The Wyoming Department of Family Services provides Early Childhood Development Services, Juvenile
Services, Protective Services, Economic Assistance, and Child Support in Carbon County.

The recent increase in natural gas development activity has not had a substantial direct effect on Carbon
County Division of Family Services (DFS) caseloads, in large part because most of the workers relocate
to the County in single status (Johnson 2007, McClaren 2007). Growth from natural gas development has,
however, resulted in increased social stress in the community, which may indirectly affect certain
populations. Chief among these is an increase in housing cost, which particularly affects people in lowand fixed-income categories. Figure 25 displays new cases for four categories of DFS services including
Adult Protection, Child Protection, Probation, and Youth and Family4 services. Except for Child
Protection cases, Carbon County DFS cases have been relatively stable in recent years. The increases in
Child Protection caseloads are in line with statewide trends.

Two factors that affect DFS caseloads in Carbon County and the agency’s ability to serve its clients
include the location of Rawlins on I-80, which results in some cases involving transient travelers, and a
shortage of foster homes in the county. The latter results in some children removed from their homes
being sent outside the county, which complicates the delivery services to those children and their families.
The Carbon County office of DFS has experienced increases in the numbers of cases associated with
methamphetamine use, which frequently results in children being removed from the home. Two factors
have begun to show promising results in dealing with methamphetamine users: the Carbon County

Youth and family cases are those which there is no neglect or abuse but support services are needed to prevent further problems
that could lead to abuse, neglect or some type of court action i.e., counseling, substance abuse treatment etc.

methamphetamine task force emphasis on education and prevention measures, and the rigorous
prosecution of offenders combined with expanded treatment options. Additionally, the Carbon County
Counseling Center has expanded its ability to serve methamphetamine users.
DFS benefits, such as food stamps, Medicare, and day care, have been minimally affected by energy
development. This is again because relatively few relocating gas-field workers have been accompanied by
households. There has been a slight increase in Medicaid recipients recently but food stamps (Figure 26)
and day-care services have not been substantially affected (Schmeling 2007).

6.1.4 Memorial Hospital of Carbon County
Memorial Hospital of Carbon County (MHCC) is a 45-bed acute-care facility, designated as a
Community Trauma Hospital by the state of Wyoming. A Community Trauma Hospital must have a
surgeon on staff. MHCC offers the following services:




48

Emergency room, staffed 24 hours/day, seven days/week with an emergency-care physician, a
registered nurse and emergency medical technicians
A five-bed intensive care unit
Two operating rooms

Two labor/delivery/recovery/post-partum care rooms
A full-service medical laboratory
Medical imaging (MRI, CAT scan, mammograms, conventional X-ray)
Pediatric care
Obstetrics, ambulatory surgery
Long-term care
Home health services
In-home care
Two satellite health clinics (Rawlins and Hanna)
Ambulance services

The emergency room was constructed and the lab and X-Ray facilities were renovated in 1998. The MRI
was installed in 2001. Currently MHCC hopes to build a new intensive care unit, renovate the operating
rooms and other areas of the hospital, conduct an energy savings study and purchase some equipment.
The Carbon Council of Governments has approved these projects for funding from a proposed one-cent
capital facilities sales tax, which requires voter approval.
The hospital provides home health services (an average of 450 visits a month) throughout Carbon County
and community-based, in-home health services to 150 clients. Each client is visited one to three times per
week, depending on need. This latter service is funded by a grant from the State of Wyoming.
MHCC also conducts a Community Health Fair each year and operates a Caring Program, which provides
$350,000 in free care annually to low-income residents of the county.
The Wagon Circle Health Clinic in Rawlins is staffed by a family-practice doctor and an orthopedic
surgeon. The clinic in Hannah is staffed by a physician’s assistant and visited by a physician once a week.
Currently Rawlins has 11 doctors, including:





Five family practitioners
Four emergency room physicians
One orthopedic surgeon
One general surgeon

MHCC is losing the general surgeon and would like to recruit two more family practitioners to adequately
serve the community. Recruiting doctors to Wyoming is complicated by the fact that there are no
monetary caps on damages for malpractice lawsuits. A lack of affordable housing in the community adds
to the difficulty of recruiting physicians and staff, but the hospital owns a 40-room nurse’s dorm where
new employees and contract staff can live for up to six months for free.
MHCC’s Outpatient Clinic is also staffed by 25 visiting specialists who travel to Rawlins once weekly to
once monthly depending on their specialty and need. Visiting specialists include:







Cardiologist
Urologist
Ophthalmologist
Audiologist
Internist
Gastroenterologist

MHCC uses medical staffing agencies to supplement its own medical staff employees.
Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Average occupancy in MHCC’s acute beds is about 34 percent, or just over 15 of the hospital’s 45 beds.
About 80 percent of all patients are seen in the outpatient clinic. Currently the hospital has adequate
staffing to serve 33 percent more patients than it currently sees.
Although some local patients travel to hospitals outside the county for specialized care, MHCC estimates
that is currently capturing about 64 percent of the local healthcare market. Some non-locals seek care at
MHCC, including travelers on I-80 and non-local gas-field workers (Kostic 2007). Until recently, nonlocal surgeons were allowed to perform surgeries at MHCC. Recent changes in federal regulations require
patients to have surgery procedures done at the hospital where the surgeon is on staff.
MHCC had positive net income during the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years. In 2005 MHCC received 33
percent of its revenue from federal Medicare and 14 percent from state-administered Medicaid (Dingus
2006). Currently the hospital has no debt and a 3.3-percent operating margin, which is considered
excellent for a rural hospital.
The current natural gas drilling and field development expansion is having two effects on MHCC. First,
more temporary and non-local workers are seeking care in the emergency room because they do not have
primary-care physicians in the area. Second, the hospital’s uncollected patient fees are increasing,
particularly in the operating room, in part because although the natural gas companies and major service
companies provide health insurance, many of the smaller contractors do not.

6.2 RAWLINS
The City of Rawlins is located about 20 miles east of the eastern border of the project area. Rawlins is the
Carbon County seat and largest community in the county, housing many project area workers and also
companies that provide services to the gas companies, in the project area and elsewhere in the region.
Rawlins is also home to the Wyoming State Penitentiary and a service center for travelers on I-80.
The Wyoming Economic Analysis Division estimated that Rawlins had a 2006 population of 8,621
(WEAD 2007); however, local officials believe that there are substantially more people living in the
community. In addition to residents living in conventional housing, a substantial number of workers are
living temporarily in motels, mobile homes, and RV parks. These temporary residents as well as the more
long-term residents are considered when Rawlins assesses its demand for community facilities and
services.
The City’s municipal staff includes about 130 employees, adding about 40 seasonal workers during the
summer months. During the summer of 2007, the City would have hired additional seasonal workers, had
they been available (Mika 2007).
6.2.1 Rawlins Public Works
In the summer of 2007, the Rawlins Public Works Department employed 52 staff in eight divisions:
central shop (maintenance of city vehicles and rolling stock), facilities maintenance, grounds
maintenance, solid waste, streets, water and wastewater treatment, and utilities (water distribution and
wastewater collection).

6.2.1.1 Rawlins Water System
The Rawlins water system, which also provides treated water for the town of Sinclair, was developed in
the 1970s with a target capacity of about 17,000 residents. The system includes an eight-million-gallon­
per-day (MGD) treatment plant, which registered a 2006 peak daily usage of 4.45 MGD. Consequently
the water treatment plant could accommodate a service population almost double the current population at
current usage rates. Rawlins maintains 85 miles of water distribution lines. There are four storage tanks,
with a combined capacity of 6 million gallons for the City of Rawlins and a 0.8-million-gallon tank for
Sinclair. There is also a raw-water storage reservoir that feeds the treatment plant. Rawlins has ample
water rights in the North Platte River and in springs and wells to serve both current and anticipated future
water needs (Stolns 2007).
6.1.2.2 Rawlins Wastewater System
The wastewater system for Rawlins was also designed for a target population of 17,000. The maximum
capacity of the treatment plant is 342.183 million gallons; current usage is 171.075 million gallons, about
half of maximum capacity. The system has three aerated lagoons, two settling lagoons, and two storage
lagoons. In order to achieve maximum capacity several lagoons would need to be cleaned and
restructured. There are currently 65 miles of wastewater collection lines within the city (Ibid.).
6.1.2.3 Rawlins Solid Waste Disposal
Rawlins operates its own landfill, which has a remaining life of approximately five years under current
fill rates. The City is currently trying to obtain an additional section of land from the BLM to expand the
landfill. Rawlins, along with Casper, Douglas, and other east-central Wyoming communities, is
participating in the Wyoming Integrated Solid Waste Management process as a member of the East
Central Solid Waste Management Area. The objectives of the Integrated Waste Management process are
to:






establish waste management goals and objectives,
identify alternatives that may achieve the goals and objectives,
conduct a detailed analysis and comparison of the alternatives,
select appropriate programs, and
implement the programs selected.

The East Central Solid Waste Management Area planning process is scheduled for completion on July 1,
2009. One option under consideration is the development of a central landfill served by transfer stations
and bailing operations in other communities in the district (Ibid.).
6.1.2.4 Rawlins Streets
Rawlins currently maintains 68 miles of city streets. Of the total, approximately 40 miles are in need of
repair. The Public Works Department performs maintenance services on city streets and contracts with
asphalt companies for street overlays. The rising cost of asphalt and fuel are affecting the amount of
repair and overlay work that the Public Works Department can perform (Ibid.). The Carbon County
Council of governments has tentatively approved $6 million in revenue from a proposed one-cent capital
facilities task, which would require voter approval.

6.2.2 Rawlins Police Department
Law-enforcement services for the City of Rawlins are provided by the Rawlins Police Department.
Current staffing for the department includes:








22 sworn officers, including the chief
Two administrative staff
Two records clerks
Eight dispatchers
Two victim advocates
Two animal-control officers
One code-enforcement officer

The Rawlins Police Department (RPD) operates the Rawlins Dispatch center and is implementing
enhanced 911 services for the southwestern portion of the county. The dispatch center is the public safety
access point for cell phone calls. In 2006, the dispatch center answered 250,000 phone calls and the RPD
made 35,000 individual contacts. Individuals taken into custody by the RPD are booked into the Carbon
County jail.
The Rawlins Police Chief has seen a transition in the most common types of offenses in recent years –
from traffic offenses to fights and domestic violence. Drug abuse has also become a serious issue in the
county. The chief estimates that one-quarter to one-third of all arrests are drug-related. As noted in the
discussion of the Carbon County Sheriff’s office, the RPD participates in the Drug Task Force and has
seen a decrease in methamphetamine-related use in the last year, attributable to the education and
awareness efforts as well as the rigorous prosecution of offenders and expanded treatment options.
RPD facilities are adequate for current needs, but there is a need for improved training facilities for
follow-up and advanced training (Reed 2007).
6.2.3 Rawlins Fire Department
The Rawlins Fire Department (RFD) provides fire suppression and rescue services within the city and
within a 60-mile radius of the city including incidents along I-80 and WY 789. RFD responds to Level A
hazardous material incidents throughout the county. The department has mutual-aid agreements with
other municipalities in the county, and provides training and conducts joint exercises with companies at
some natural gas facilities. RFD personnel conduct semi-annual fire safety inspections and reviews
building plans for all public-access structures within the city. The department offers a variety of fireprevention and public education programs for people of all ages. RFD is also responsible for issuing
building permits and conducting inspections for construction within the city.
RFD currently has 20 volunteers and positions for ten paid staff, including the chief. Currently the
department is trying to recruit staff for two of the paid positions. Staff recruitment and retention has been
difficult lately given the high wages and salaries paid in the gas fields. RFD has lost several staff and has
had fewer applicants for vacant positions. Volunteer recruiting and retention is also becoming more
difficult because many Rawlins residents spend long hours working and traveling to job sites in the gas
fields and correspondingly have less time to spend on community work including volunteering for the fire
department. The remote job sites also increase the response times. Volunteers respond to Station #1 for
fire calls outside of the city; for calls within the city the paid staff takes the equipment to the incident
location and the volunteers respond directly to the incident location in their own vehicles (Hannum 2007).

RFD currently has four pumpers, a wildland response unit, a ladder truck, a fully equipped rescue unit, a
combination utility vehicle/crew transport for extrications/wildland response, an incident command
trailer, a HAZMAT response trailer, and a motor home outfitted as a safety house, which is used for
public education, primarily in schools.
The department has two fire stations in Rawlins, both of which are staffed on an around-the-clock
(24/7/365) basis. Station #1 serves as the headquarters for emergency response and includes the RFD
administrative offices, sleeping quarters, meeting room, and equipment maintenance area. Station #2
serves the southern part of Rawlins and the Wyoming State Penitentiary. It houses a first-response engine,
HAZMAT response equipment, office, sleeping quarters and a training center. Station #2 is also manned
by paid firefighters on a 24/7/365 basis. RFD also operates a training center, which includes a four-story
drill tower, two burn rooms, smoke training, confined space training, and fire apparatus certification
facilities (RFD 2007). The city may need to construct new fire stations to maintain its ISO insurance
ratings, depending on the level and location of new development that occurs.
6.2.4 Rawlins Ambulance
Memorial Hospital of Carbon County provides ambulance and emergency medical services in the
northern and western part of Carbon County, including part of the project area. County and municipal
officials and fire department/emergency response officials in Carbon County are also working to form a
joint powers board to provide ambulance service to south-central Wyoming. MHCC maintains three
ambulance crews and has positions for 20 EMTs. The crews are composed of full-time employees and
per-diem employees who work on an intermittent basis. One crew is always on duty and a second crew is
on call. There are three four-wheel-drive ambulances based at the hospital in Rawlins. The MHCC

emergency room doctor trains EMTs throughout the county (except for the Little Snake River Valley) and
Wamsutter. Recently the ambulance service has averaged 75 runs per month (Carter 2007).
Figure 28 below displays MHCC ambulance runs for 2002 through 2006, which have averaged around
1,000 to 1,100 every year.

6.3 BAGGS
The Town of Baggs is located about seven miles from the southeast border of the project area, on WY
789. According to the Wyoming Economic Analysis Division, Baggs had a 2006 population of 367,
although local officials believe the effective service population to be substantially higher. The Town has
six full-time employees including a Town Clerk, an assistant clerk, two public works employees and two
police officers. The Town hires two temporary employees during summer months (Corners 2007).
6.3.1 Baggs Water System
Baggs recently completed a $2 million upgrade to its water treatment plant designed to meet future
demand. The system can treat 250 to 300 gpm ( up to 0.4 MGD) and is sized for anticipated growth over
the next 20 years at historic growth rates of one to two percent. The town obtains water from wells and
has 300 acre feet of water rights in the recently completed High Savery Reservoir; water from the
reservoir is transported through the Little Snake River to Baggs. The town cannot begin using that water
each year until irrigators call for water from the reservoir. Baggs intends to replace its water transmission
and distribution systems over the next several years, financed by the proceeds from a one-cent capital
improvements sales tax, if approved by voters (O’Neill 2007).

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

6.3.2 Baggs Wastewater System
The Baggs wastewater treatment system includes a four-cell aerated lagoon system, one of which is not
currently in use. The system has capacity to treat about 100,000 gallons per day. The pumps for the
lagoon system are aging and one is scheduled for replacement. The wastewater collection system is
comprised primarily of old vitrified clay piping and experiences problems due to high ground-water
tables. Baggs’ consulting engineers have recommended a capacity study and evaluation of inflow and
infiltration into the sewer lines (O’Neill 2007). Baggs recently received a $2 million capital
improvements grant from the Wyoming State Land Investment Board which is being used to fund both
water and wastewater system improvements, but must provide $600,000 in matching funds to receive the
grant.
6.3.3 Baggs Law Enforcement
As noted above, the Town of Baggs has two police officers. Two Carbon County Sheriff’s Deputies are
assigned to Baggs, although one of the deputies had not been able to found housing in the area during the
summer of 2007. Two Wyoming Highway Patrol officers also live in the town.
6.3.4 Baggs Fire Department
Baggs has an all-volunteer fire department with nine registered firefighters and two fire trucks. The
department responds to fire calls in the county including lands within the project area and on BLM and
National Forest lands, as well as within the town. Some of the fire department volunteers work in the gas
fields, making it difficult to have enough volunteers to respond to emergencies during work days.
6.3.5 Noyes Medical Clinic and Ambulance Service
Medical services in Baggs are provided at the Noyes Clinic, which is currently staffed by a physician’s
assistant (PA), supervised by a doctor in Craig, Colorado. The PA is supported by five full-time and one
part-time staff, most of whom perform both medical and administrative duties. Carbon County currently
funds the clinic directly, but is in the process of creating a rural health-care district to fund the clinic. The
clinic is currently looking for a physician or an additional PA. Patient visits have increased substantially
during recent years, attributed to the expansion in natural gas development. The clinic hopes to expand
the services it offers once the rural health-care district is in place.
Emergency response is provided by ten volunteer EMTs and one first responder who staff two countyowned ambulances, one of which is a four-wheel-drive vehicle. The ambulances respond to accidents in
the southwestern part of the county and about 30 miles north along WY 789 (Jones 2007). Seriously
injured or ill patients are transported to Craig or Rawlins, depending on the location of the patient.
Casper-based Flight-for-Life is also available if needed. The clinic intends to purchase an additional 4WD
ambulance with revenues from the rural health care district.

6.4 DIXON
6.4.1 Dixon Water System
The Dixon water system currently treats 60 gpm and is under an EPA Administrative Order. A pilot test
of a membrane system was just completed and an evaluation of treatment technologies is being

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

55

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

conducted. The new system will be capable of treating 100 gpm which will provide the needed capacity
for 20 years of growth (O’Neil 2007).
6.4.2 Dixon Wastewater System
The Dixon wastewater system is a single-cell lagoon that is permitted for 50,000 GPD and occasionally
exceeds permitted capacity limit. The system has severe inflow and infiltration problems that would
prevent substantial additional development without major improvements (O’Neil 2007).

6.5 SWEETWATER COUNTY
Sweetwater County provides law enforcement and emergency-response services to the western portion of
the project area and provides services to direct and secondary CDC-related companies, workers, and their
households who reside in Sweetwater County. Sweetwater County services are generally headquartered in
Green River although some of the key services such as the Sheriff’s Office and the Road and Bridge
Department are headquartered in Rock Springs.
6.5.1 Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Office
The Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) provides law enforcement, animal control, and dispatch
services to the unincorporated portions of Sweetwater County and detention services for the county and
its municipalities. The Sheriff’s Office has the following staff:








45 sworn officers including the Sheriff and Under sheriff
Ten dispatchers
Two community service officers
Three animal control officers
Two administrative staff
Five records staff
32 detention staff

There is a deputy stationed in Wamsutter and one in Farson, and the Town Marshal in Bairoil is a reserve
deputy. Sweetwater County provides housing for Sheriff’s deputies in Wamsutter and Farson.
During the summer of 2007, the Sheriff’s Office had filled all authorized deputy positions, but had five
vacant detention positions. Current cost to hire, equip, and train (excluding Law Enforcement Academy
costs) a new staff is $108,000 for a deputy, $52,000 for a detention deputy and $49,000 for a dispatcher.
Although the Sheriff’s Office has been able to recruit and retain deputies, the pool of applicants for new
positions has decreased in recent years.
The Sweetwater County Detention Facility has a design capacity of 208 prisoners. It can also house 50
juveniles (32 males and 18 females). Recent occupancy has averaged about 110 prisoners. The county jail
was designed to allow for expansion on the same site while maximizing use of existing administrative
facilities. Arresting officers in municipalities are responsible for transporting prisoners to the county
detention facility in Rock Springs.
Drugs, particularly methamphetamine, are a growing problem in Sweetwater County, as they are in much
of the country. The SCSO estimates that 75 percent of the county detention facility population is involved
with drugs (Jackson 2007, Claman 2007).

6.5.2 Emergency Management and Response
The Sweetwater County Emergency Management Agency (SCEMA) is a division of the Sweetwater
County Sheriff's Office (SCEMA 2007). SCEMA operates under the guidelines of the Department of
Homeland Security, Office of Domestic Preparedness, Federal Emergency Management Agency,
Wyoming Office of Homeland Security, Wyoming Emergency Management Agency, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Communications Commission.
Under the direction of the Sweetwater County Emergency Management Coordinator, SCEMA analyzes
hazards, assesses local emergency response capabilities, plans for potential events including emergency
response, recovery from, and mitigation against the potential emergency/disaster. SCEMA coordinates
with response agencies, industry, elected officials, and volunteer agencies to accomplish their mission of
limiting injuries, loss of life, and damage to property. SCEMA also coordinates the Local Emergency
Management Committee, which brings together emergency-response professionals in the community for
the purpose of information, training, discussions, and education of the public about hazardous substances,
emergency planning, health, and environmental risk.
SCEMA administers the Sweetwater County 911 service, which includes Enhanced and Wireless Phase I
911. Enhanced 911 allows a 911 dispatcher to identify the caller’s telephone number and address from a
land-line telephone. Wireless Phase I 911 allows the dispatcher to identify the telephone number of the
cell phone and the approximate location of the caller. Currently, not all cellular companies route their cell
phone 911 calls through the system, so dispatchers may not receive all telephone numbers or approximate
locations. Within the southern parts of the project area, 911 calls are sometimes received in Craig,
Colorado, which can complicate and delay emergency response.
In addition to the Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Office, the Rock Springs Police Department and the Green
River Police Department also operate dispatch centers. The three entities are conducting a joint needs
assessment regarding the consolidation of dispatch services in the county. One objective is to replace the
current 911 emergency system with one that accommodates Phase II wireless and geographic information
systems to help locate mobile phone callers. SCEMA is participating in the program to establish
emergency response staging areas in the project area (Valentine 2007).
6.5.3 Sweetwater County Solid Waste Disposal District #1
Sweetwater County Solid Waste Disposal District #1 was created to oversee local landfills in Rock
Springs, Reliance, Superior, and Point of Rocks (SCSWDD#1 2007). The Rock Springs landfill has 30
years of remaining life at current fill rates and the district recently purchased an adjacent 320 acres, which
will provide an additional 70 years or a combined 100 years of remaining life at current fill rates (Sugano
2007). SCSWDD #1 also provides funding to the Ray Lovato Recycling Center and to the cities of Rock
Springs and Green River to conduct a Household Hazardous Waste Collection Event that alternates
between the two cities. The District is authorized to assess a maximum 3-mill tax levy to support its
operations. The 2007 levy is 1.58 mills.
SWCSWDD #1 has joined with SCSWDD #2 (Wamsutter/Bairoil) and the City of Green River to
conduct integrated solid waste planning, which may result in the development and operation of transfer
stations in some other municipalities in the county and transportation of solid waste to the Rock Springs
landfill.

Data Request from WYCAPS-ADHOC, provided July 22, 2007.

To date, natural gas development has had limited direct effect on DFS caseloads. But the effects of
natural gas development on housing availability and affordability are stressing low-income families,
resulting in some overcrowding, families living in motels or sub-standard housing, and some low-income
families being priced out of the housing market altogether. It also complicates some DFS neglect cases
where children have been removed from households because mothers cannot gain permanent custody of
their children unless they are able to demonstrate appropriate living conditions, which is difficult for
single-parent families under current conditions (Shineberg 2007).
Figure 30 displays the number of Food Stamp recipients in Sweetwater County from 1997 through 2006.
Food stamp cases have decreased dramatically in recent years, primarily because applicants other than
single-parent households must be actively looking for work to receive food stamps, and Sweetwater
County has a surplus of jobs (Carpenter, Pauline 2007).

MHSC is currently undergoing a $50 million expansion that will add approximately 54,000 square
feet of new construction, renovate 64,000 square feet of existing space, and quadruple the capacity of
the hospital’s emergency room by June 2008 (MHSC 2007). Other improvements will include:



A new Emergency Department with all private exam/treatment rooms
A Women’s Center with three labor and delivery rooms and all private post-partum rooms
A Women’s Imaging Center with mammography, ultrasound, and stereotactic breast biopsy
capabilities
Private same-day surgery rooms
Expansion of the dialysis treatment center
Expansion of out-patient surgical areas to include a large endoscopy suite

The expansion is part of MHSC’s strategy to become the regional health care center for southwestern
Wyoming. The hospital recruited nine new physicians during 2007 and hopes to recruit an additional
seven to eight physicians in 2008. The newly recruited physicians are on the staff of MHSC and are
establishing private practices in the community.
The current gas expansion in southwestern Wyoming has resulted in increased use of MHSC’s emergency
room, and increased uncollected debt attributed to the large number of workers who do not have health
insurance as well as an increase in charity-care cases. The increase in emergency room visits is largely
attributed to non-local workers who do not have primary-care physicians in the area. This has increased
wait times in the ER, particularly for people with more routine health care needs, as the ER staff will
always treat patients with acute or critical needs before those with more routine issues.
Uncollected patient fees have increased to about nine percent of total fees in recent years as compared to
six percent in previous years. The Sweetwater County Commissioners have allocated additional funds –
between $500,000 and $700,000 per year in recent years – to assist with the hospital’s charity care and
uncollected patient fees.

6.6 ROCK SPRINGS
The City of Rock Springs is located about 40 miles west of the project area’s western border. Rock
Springs is Sweetwater County’s largest community and has emerged in recent years as a regional service
center for natural gas development in southwest Wyoming. According to the Wyoming Economic
Analysis Division, Rock Springs had a 2006 population of 19,324 (WEAD 2007). SWEDA estimated
Rock Spring’s December 2006 population at 22,209 based on Pacific Power residential electric accounts
within the city and a household size of 2.58. Based on the same information and assumptions, the
unincorporated area around Rock Springs had an estimated population of 4,773 in December 2006
(SWEDA 2007). The actual number of people residing in Rock Springs, including temporary workers in
motels and RV parks, was substantially higher than these estimates during 2006 and has continued to
grow in 2007.

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

6.6.1 Rock Springs Public Works
6.6.1.1 Rock Springs Water System
Rock Springs obtains treated water from the Green River/Rock Springs/Sweetwater County Joint Powers
Water Board. Water is pumped from Green River to Rock Springs through two water mains, one a 30­
inch and the other a 20-inch line. The city’s water storage and distribution system has eight storage tanks
with a total capacity of 12,000,000 gallons. There are over 120 miles of water lines ranging from four
inches to 30 inches in diameter. There are 6,500 connections with an average daily use of 10.0 MGD in
the summer and 3.0 MGD in the winter. The Water Department has nine employees including two meterreaders (City of Rock Springs 2007a). The water storage and distribution system can accommodate a
population of about 35,000 (30 percent above the current service-area population) although there are
water distribution problems that need to be addressed in certain parts of the service area (Walker 2007).
6.6.1.2 Rock Springs Wastewater System
At the time of this writing, the Rock Springs wastewater treatment plant is undergoing an 18-month,
$12.5-million expansion. When completed, the plant will have capacity to treat 4.2 MGD and meet the
State’s clean water requirements (City of Rock Springs 2007b). Currently, the wastewater treatment plant
processes 2.6 to 2.7 MGD and serves a population of 24,000 to 25,000. The expanded plant has planned
treatment capacity for a population of 35,000 and was designed to accommodate a second plant on the
same site, if required (Gaviotos 2007). The Rock Springs Public Services Department is also completing
major improvements to a wastewater collection main and lift station which serve the Foothills area of
town, the location of much of the new residential development. The department is also conducting a
modeling program to identify other wastewater collection problems in the older part of the city (Walker
2007).
6.6.1.3 Rock Springs Streets
The Rock Springs Street Department maintains street surfaces, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, performs
alley grading, storm-drain cleaning and maintenance, city light maintenance, drainage ditch cleaning,
street-sign installation and repair, street sweeping, and snow and ice removal (Rock Springs 2007c).
Developers are required to provide streets within new subdivisions. The City tries to assist with the
development of arterial and collector streets that provide access to subdivisions, to assist in making
residential construction more affordable. Securing funding for new arterial and collector streets is a
substantial problem for the city (Walker 2007).
6.6.2 Rock Springs Police Department
The Rock Springs Police Department employees the following staff:


Operations Division: 45 sworn officers including the Chief of Police, two commanders, sergeants,
detectives, misdemeanor investigators, and officers assigned to school positions.



Services Division: 22 civilian positions including ten dispatchers, five records technicians, three
animal-control positions, two community-service officers, and two administrative assistants.

Preparing an officer for patrol duty requires about one year of law enforcement academy and on-the-job
training and about $135,000 for salary, vehicle, equipment, and training costs. The Rock Springs PD has
had good retention of officers, in part because the department tries to recruit Wyoming residents.

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Rock Springs operates its own communications and dispatch facility, which also dispatches fire and
ambulance services for the city. Inmates are housed at the Sweetwater County Detention Facility (Lowell
2007).
Rock Springs has seen substantial increases in calls for service over the past four years, increasing from
38,154 in 2002 to 67,022 in 2006, a 76 percent increase (see Figure 31). This is in contrast to the 20
percent growth in Rock Springs population over the same period, using the 2002 census figure and the
2006 SWEDA population estimate.

Much of the increased crime in Rock Springs in recent years has been in categories other than major
crimes. According to the 2005 Rock Springs Police Report, Part I Crimes6 increased by only 9 percent
between 20037 and 2006, while Part II8 crimes increased by 52 percent between 2002 and 2006. The
most dramatic increases in crime in Rock Springs between 2002 and 2006 have been associated with drug
arrests (429 percent), alcohol violations (77 percent), and traffic crashes (56 percent). Also during this
period, arrests have increased by 90 percent, and the number of summons written increased by 130
percent (Rock Springs 2005, Lowell 2007).
6.6.3 Rock Springs Fire Department
Rock Springs Fire Department (RSFD) has three fire stations, all of which are staffed on a round-the­
clock basis. The RSFD has 35 trained firefighters, about two-thirds of whom are also qualified as advance
life-support EMTs. The department responds to an average of 100 calls per month with an average
response time of less than four minutes. RSFD responds to fires, medical emergencies, vehicle crashes,

hazardous materials incidents including the recent issues of terrorism, smoke/odor investigations, fire and
carbon monoxide alarms, confined space rescue, and high-angle rope rescues. In addition to emergency
services the department provides ongoing public safety services including fire-safety inspection and
prevention programs for homes, businesses, and in the schools; child safety-seat inspections; juvenile firesetters intervention, CPR courses, and annual testing of over 800 fire hydrants (City of Rock Springs
2007d).
The RSFD has a site for a fourth fire station on the west side of the city, where much new development is
occurring. The department has funds to build the station but not to equip and operate it. Costs to replace
and equip a pumper truck average about $270,000; replacing and equipping a ladder truck costs about
$400,000. The expected frontline life of each truck in Rock Springs is 15 years with another five to ten
years as a backup/reserve (Sarff 2007). Despite higher salaries in the natural gas industry, the RSFD has
been able to retain staff, losing only one firefighter in recent months. The wage differential does become
evident in recruiting. The department recently conducted an entry-level examination and only had 23
applicants in contrast to the 40 to 60 applicants during previous tests.
As shown in Figure 32, annual incidents (calls for service) increased by 49 percent between 2000 and
2006. In recent times, the department is receiving more calls for medical service from people who may
have other, less-intensive options, because they are new to the community and unfamiliar with those
options.

6.7 CITY OF GREEN RIVER
The City of Green River is located about 50 miles west from the project area’s western border of the
project area. Although few natural gas service companies are located in Green River, the City is
experiencing some growth and housing demand from the natural gas-related development in Sweetwater
County.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

63

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Green River had a 2006 population of 11,933 (WEAD 2007). Green River’s population has been
relatively stable at between 11,000 and 12,000 since 2000, with net growth of slightly over one percent
since 2000. The Sweetwater Economic Development Authority estimates that Green River’s December
2006 population was 12,882, based on residential electric power accounts and statewide household
multipliers (SWEDA 2007).
Green River is currently limited on its ability to expand its boundaries to accommodate growth. The City
is somewhat constrained by topography and land ownership, although housing demand has resulted in a
number of subdivision proposals on land adjacent to the city and the city is in negotiations to acquire
some BLM land west of the current city limits (Hoffman 2007). Several of the proposed subdivisions in
the southern part of the city would require annexation and extension of water and wastewater services and
development of new streets.
6.7.1 Green River Water System
Green River obtains treated water from the Green River/Rock Springs/Sweetwater County Joint Powers
Water Board treatment plant, located in Green River. The City operates its own water-distribution and
storage system. Green River has three water-storage tanks and three water pumps to move the water to
areas of higher elevation within the City. The City is conducting a water-system study and has identified a
need for more water-storage capacity, particularly in the southern part of the City, where water storage is
already at capacity and where new development is proposed. It is anticipated that $14 million in
improvements to the system will be required, which is foreseen as being accomplished in three phases,
subject to the availability of funding (Nelson 2007).
6.7.2 Green River Wastewater System
The Green River wastewater treatment plant has 1.5 MGD treatment capacity and is currently treating
about 1.0 MGD. However, the City is conducting a wastewater master-plan study, which has already
identified a number of problem areas in the wastewater collection system that will need to be addressed to
accommodate new growth and more effectively move wastewater to the treatment plant (Nelson 2007).
6.7.3 Green River Solid Waste Disposal
Green River operates a landfill that has about 20 years of remaining life at current fill rates. The City is
working on a 20-acre expansion that would increase the landfill life to about 50 years. Green River is also
part of the Wyoming Integrated Solid Waste Management process, which is likely to result in
consolidation of landfills in the area (Nelson 2007).
6.7.4 Green River Police Department
The Green River Police Department (GRPD) includes six divisions: patrol, investigations,
communications, nuisance control, animal control, and records. As of September 2007, GRPD had 30
sworn officers and about 45 support personnel (Steffen 2007).
The Green River Police Department Dispatch Center answers calls for service for the Green River Police
Department, Castle Rock Ambulance Service, and Green River Fire Department. The dispatch center is
staffed by four full-time and four part-time Communication Officers (City of Green River 2007).
Detainees are transported to the Sweetwater County Jail in Rock Springs.

64

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Six to eight months of police academy and on-the-job training and an investment of $50,000 are typically
required before a new recruit is fully qualified for patrol duty. In recent years the GRPD has seen the pool
of qualified police officer applicants shrink substantially. The lack of affordable housing in the
community complicates recruiting (Steffen 2007).
The GRPD has experienced an increase in certain crimes including DUI, drugs, larcenies, gas and bill
skips and bad checks in recent years, which the department attributes to the general growth and activity
associated with natural gas development.
6.7.5 Green River Fire Department
The Green River Fire Department (GRFD) provides fire suppression and emergency response service to
an area bounded by the Utah border on the south, I-80 milepost 57 and the Uinta and Lincoln County
borders on the west, the Lincoln and Sublette County borders on the north, and I-80 milepost 96 on the
east. The GRFD responds to more than 330 calls per year, provides fire protection to the Jamestown Fire
District and has a mutual aid agreement with Sweetwater County to assist with fire suppression in the
western half of Sweetwater County (City of Green River 2007). GRFD staff and volunteers respond to all
vehicle accidents with the Castle Rock Ambulance Service, and in turn, the ambulance service responds
to all fire calls with the fire department.
The department operates two fire stations: Station #1 is located at City Hall and Station #2 is located
south of the Green River at the corner of Shoshone and Hitching Post. It is important to maintain
equipment and volunteers on both sides of the river in case access across the bridges was blocked. The
department is typically staffed by 34 to 36 volunteers, two full-time personnel, a part-time administrative
assistant and a part-time maintenance person. GRFD currently has four pumpers, one reserve pumper, one
“parade truck” that is an antique 1946 American LaFrance Fire Engine, one 55-foot ladder truck, one
quick-attack truck, one HAZMAT response trailer and three SUVs, which are used by the Fire Chief,
Assistant Chief, and other personnel. As of September 2007, the department was awaiting delivery of a
new ladder truck to replace the existing one.
If substantial growth continues to occur on the south side of town and the town boundary is extended
beyond several miles, a new fire station might be required in that area to maintain response times and the
town’s ISO insurance rating (Kennedy 2007).

6.8 WAMSUTTER
The Town of Wamsutter is located near the center of the project area. According to the Wyoming
Economic Analysis Division, Wamsutter had a 2006 population of 267 (WEAD 2007). In contrast,
SWEDA estimates that the 2006 population was 650, based on the number of residential electric hook-ups
in the town and the surrounding unincorporated area. Additionally there were between 80 and 90 workers
staying at the ESS Wamsutter Base Camp just north of Wamsutter in June of 2007 (Rensburg 2007).
Other estimates have placed Wamsutter’s population as high as 1,000 (BP 2006, Carnes 2007).
Wamsutter is designing its utility systems to accommodate an anticipated 2011 population of 2,500.
The Town of Wamsutter has five full-time and nine part-time employees and is in the process of
recruiting a full-time public works director. Recently a Community Development Specialist began work
in Wamsutter, the result of a collaborative partnership of the University of Wyoming Cooperative
Extension Service, Sweetwater County, Anadarko Petroleum Company, BP America, Devon Energy
Corp, Hyland Enterprises and Love’s Travel Shop. The Community Development Specialist is charged w/
assisting the Mayor and Town Council on development projects.
Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

65

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Wamsutter has several residential subdivision projects in process and developers have announced plans
for two new motels (see Section 1.5 [Housing]). A number of capital facilities have recently been
constructed and others are in process. These projects have been funded from a variety of sources
including proceeds from Sweetwater County’s capital facilities sales tax. In addition, Wamsutter recently
completed a new children’s day-care facility funded by a $360,000 grant from BP America and a
$160,000 grant from the Wyoming Community Development Block Grant Program.
6.8.1 Wamsutter Water System
During summer 2007, Wamsutter was nearing completion of three improvements to the Town’s water
system; a 400,000-gallon water-storage tank north of town (funded in part by $1,213,000 from capital
facilities sales tax revenues), construction of a water main connecting the industrial park to the Town’s
water system (funded by $954,716 from the capital facilities sales tax), and installation of water meters
(funded by a $538,000 loan from the Wyoming State Revolving Loan Fund). A new well intended to be
the town’s main water source was scheduled to be on line in November of 2007 and the Town bid a water
treatment project in August of 2007. The Town’s water system improvements are designed to
accommodate a target population of 2,500 (Colsen 2007). In December of 2007 the Wyoming Water
Development Commission approved $22,000 to study the siting of a new water source for the town. A bill
before the 2008 session of the Wyoming Legislature includes $800,000 in funding for drilling a new well.
6.8.2 Wamsutter Wastewater System
Wamsutter is completing construction of a wastewater collection main to connect the industrial park and
other system improvements to the wastewater system. The Town is also conducting a capacity analysis of
its wastewater lagoon system to determine short- and long-term needs. The analysis was funded by a
$16,500 grant from BP America. As with the water system, the objective is to develop a wastewater
system to accommodate a population of 2,500. Currently the system serves about 850 people.
6.8.3 Wamsutter Streets
Wamsutter is embarking on a program to pave a number of the streets in the town, funded by a
$2,189,317 grant from the Wyoming State Land and Investment Board and a matching $2,189,317 grant
from BP America.
6.8.4 Wamsutter Law Enforcement
Law-enforcement services in Wamsutter are provided by a combination of municipal, county, and state
law-enforcement agencies. The Town has a police Chief who enforces municipal ordinances, although
town officials have had difficulty keeping the position filled. A Sweetwater County Deputy Sheriff is
located in Wamsutter as are three Wyoming Highway Patrol (WHP) officers. There are no detention
facilities in the town; detainees must be transported to the Sweetwater County Jail in Rock Springs
(Carnes 2007).
Because of the housing shortage in Wamsutter, law enforcement agencies have been required to provide
housing for their officers. BP America donated $46,000 to provide modular housing for the Wamsutter
police officer. Sweetwater County developed housing for its deputy and the Wyoming Department of
Transportation developed five housing units for the WHP officers and other WYDOT employees.

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

6.8.5 Wamsutter Emergency Response
Wamsutter has volunteer fire and ambulance services providing emergency response services to the town
and the surrounding area including natural gas fields. During the summer of 2007, the Wamsutter
Volunteer Fire Department had 14 volunteers, two fire trucks, one water tender, and a wildland fire attack
truck. The Volunteer Ambulance Service had 16 volunteer EMTs and two ambulances and responds to
about 150 calls per year, most of which are related to traffic accidents on I-80.
6.8.6 Sweetwater County Solid Waste District #2
Sweetwater County Solid Waste District #2 serves eastern Sweetwater County from the eastern border of
the County to Point of Rocks, including the towns of Bairoil and Wamsutter. District #2’s landfill fill
rates have more than doubled over the past two years and the district’s landfill, located just south of
Wamsutter, is within several months of its maximum capacity. Consequently, the district is no longer
accepting waste from natural gas rigs and construction crews. District #2 has made application to the
BLM and the Wyoming DEQ for another trench, which would extend the landfill’s life for an additional
year. The district has also applied for permits to develop a new landfill adjacent to the existing landfill on
the remaining 20 acres of the district’s 40-acre site, but those applications have not yet been approved
(Rigano 2008).

7. LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL CONDITIONS
Natural gas development in the project area affects a range of local state and federal government revenues
and expenditures. Affected revenues include ad valorem property tax revenues of Carbon and Sweetwater
Counties, Carbon County School District #1, Sweetwater County SD #1 and certain special districts, sales
and use tax revenues of the State of Wyoming, the two counties, and their municipalities; state severance
taxes; and federal mineral royalties. The two counties and the affected school districts, special districts,
and municipalities also see increases in expenditures to serve development and associated population
growth. This section describes existing fiscal conditions and trends in the local government jurisdictions
that are likely to be affected by the proposed CD-C project.

7.1 COUNTY FISCAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
7.1.1 Property Taxes
Property taxes make up a significant share of the revenue base of Carbon and Sweetwater Counties. In
Wyoming, the assessed valuation of real and personal property, utilities, and mineral production is the
basis for local property taxes. In 2006, the total assessed value in Sweetwater County approached $2.4
billion, more than double the $1.1 billion recorded in fiscal year 2000 (see Figure 33). Assessed valuation
also climbed dramatically in Carbon County, from $337 million in fiscal year 2000 to nearly $900 million
in 2006, including a jump of more than $200 million from 2005 to 2006.

In both counties the valuation on oil and gas have been the most rapidly growing components of the total
assessed value, more than quadrupling between 2000 and 2006 in Carbon County and tripling in
Sweetwater County. However, this has been due more to rising oil and gas prices than increased
production (see Figure 34). From 2003 through 2006, oil production in the two counties combined
increased by 11 percent while the value increased by over 150 percent. In the case of gas, production was
virtually flat over the period while valuation went up nearly 250 percent.

Due to the recent growth in mineral production and prices, the assessed value of minerals has increased
from 64.5 percent to 81.3 percent of the tax base in Carbon County over the past six years and from 63.6
percent to 77.3 percent in Sweetwater County. Tables 24 and 25 show recent trends in the assessed value
of the two counties, by type of property.

7.1.2 Sales and Use Tax Conditions and Trends
Rivaling property taxes in importance to county governments is the sales and use taxes imposed by the
state and, when approved by the local electorate, the counties themselves. The state sales and use tax of
4.0 percent is collected based on the point of sale, but the share returned to counties and incorporated
municipalities (a statutorily established amount, currently 31 percent of the statewide total receipts) is on
a population-based formula, irrespective of where the sales were generated. Counties can elect to impose
a 1.0 percent optional general purpose local tax and a 1.0 percent specific-purpose tax for capital
improvements. Carbon and Sweetwater Counties currently each impose both of these optional 1.0 percent
levies. The state collects these taxes and distributes the local share based on the above-referenced
formula.
Tables 26 and 27 summarize the amount of sales, use, and lodging taxes distributed to the two counties by
the state in recent years. The distributions include both the full distribution of local-option taxes and the
respective county’s proportional share of the state taxes. The tables also show the total amount of sales
and use tax receipts collected from each of the counties for activities occurring within their respective
boundaries, which is a more comprehensive measure of the growth in sales activity over the period.
As shown in Table 26, total sales and use tax revenues nearly tripled in Carbon County over the past five
years, to nearly $6.6 million in fiscal year 2006. The significance of the local-option taxes is readily
apparent, accounting for 84 percent of the total sales and use tax revenues in fiscal year 2006.

The resurgence of natural gas development activity and pipeline construction is evident in the sharp
increase in the total sales and use taxes generated on sales in the county and the receipts from the local
specific-purpose sales tax. Again, note the high share of the sales and use tax directly attributable to the

mining sector, which includes oil and gas and currently accounts for about a quarter of the taxes in both
counties. There is an indication that Carbon County sales and use tax distributions may be somewhat
lower in 2008 as major pipeline construction and refinery expansion projects are completed.
Sweetwater County sales and use tax distributions increased by 62 percent between 2003 and 2004 and
remained at levels between $8.6 and $10.8 million through 2006. The substantially higher level of sales
and use tax attributable to the mining sector in Sweetwater County reflects the trona and coal-mining base
within the county as well as oil and gas development (Table 27).

The information in Tables 26 and 27 also provides some insights as to how the oil and gas development in
these two counties yield fiscal benefits to the entire state through the various redistribution formulas. A
total of $32.6 million in sales and use taxes attributable to the mining sector were generated within the
two counties. Of that total, $15.8 million (48.6 percent) remained local, while $16.8 million flowed to the
state or was distributed to other communities.
7.1.3 County Revenue and Expenditures
Property, sales, and use taxes account for a major share of county revenues. However, counties have
many other revenue sources, ranging from fees for services to federal payment-in-lieu-of-taxes, severance
tax and mineral royalties distributions and grants. In the case of Carbon County (Table 28) there was a
one-time grant of over $12 million from the State Land Investment Board (SLIB).
Table 28 shows total fund revenues and expenditures in several broad categories for Carbon County’s
general fund over the past few years. Total revenue increased from $14.1 million in fiscal year 2004
(FY2004) to $36.5 million budgeted for FY2007. Even without the SLIB grant, total revenue increased by
70 percent, compared to the national Consumer Price Index of 10.4 percent. All categories of
Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

expenditures increased at a rate greater than the CPI, with the greatest increases in the Road and Bridge
category (a 180 percent increase over three years) and operating costs for the jail (up 130 percent).
Increases in the road and bridge budget are in large part attributable to construction and maintenance of
roads that provide access to areas of natural gas development.

Table 29 shows comparable general fund budget data for Sweetwater County. There too, all categories
increased much more rapidly than the rate of inflation, although in most cases not as much as in Carbon
County. The highest departmental growth was the Courthouse, up 110 percent over three years. However,
the aggregate budgeted expenditures of the other departments not specified in the table were up 164
percent. The rapid rise in assessed value and corresponding increases in property taxes, coupled with
increases in other revenues, allowed the county to budget a $13 million increase in reserves for 2007.

7.2 MUNICIPAL FISCAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
7.2.1 Property Taxes
Property taxes are not as substantial a revenue source for municipalities as for counties. However, trends
in assessed value are important indicators of local economic growth. As shown in Table 30, Green River,
Rawlins, and Rock Springs have relatively large ad valorem tax bases, while the three smaller
communities have more modest property tax bases. The most significant change disclosed by these data is
that Wamsutter’s tax base nearly quadrupled over the past three years, primarily due to development
related to nearby natural gas activity. Rock Springs saw a 47.5 percent increase in assessed value between
2003 and 2006 due to its emergence as a regional service center for natural gas development, resulting in
an assessed value nearly four times that of Rawlins and twice that of Green River.

7.2.2 Sales and Use Tax Distributions
Sales and use taxes are typically the single largest sources of general fund revenue for municipalities.
That pattern applies to the affected municipalities in the project area. Table 31 shows the annual sales and
use tax distributions reported by the state for the past five years to each of the six potentially affected
communities. The comparative distributions among the communities generally reflect their relative sizes,
but also differences in the level of economic activity and growth associated with natural gas industry.

7.2.3 Municipal Revenue and Expenditures
Summaries of municipal general fund revenues and expenditures were developed from the budget
documents of each potentially affected city and town. These summary budgets are presented in Tables 32
through 35 below. Although the organization of funds and level of detail provided in the municipal
budgets varies among the communities, the summary budgets attempt to present comparable information
for each municipality by assigning all revenues and expenditures to one of a broadly defined set of
categories. Two conventions should be noted. First, the income category of “taxes” includes sales and use
taxes returned to the municipalities by the state. Several of the source-document budgets listed such
payments as “intergovernmental revenue.” Conversely, some “taxes” such as severance tax and mineral
royalties are included in the summaries as “intergovernmental” even though some local budgets classified
them under the “tax” heading. Second, in preparing the expenditure summaries, multiple departments are
grouped into six categories with descriptive titles that do not necessarily mean only the department with a

76

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

similar name. For example “public works” in the table could include the Public Works department, but
also Streets, Engineering, Shops, Building Maintenance, and other physical facility and plant construction
and maintenance activities.
7.2.3.1 City of Rawlins
Table 32 summarizes general fund budget data (most recent actual plus two years of budgets) for the City
of Rawlins. General Fund revenues and expenses will effectively equalize over the long term, but there
may be variances in any one year due to inter-fund transfers, contributions to or from reserves, and
varying year-end cash balances. In Rawlins, budgeted revenue is anticipated to increase modestly over the
three-year period, with over two-thirds of the total from taxes. On the expenditure side, the largest single
category – both in terms of absolute size and rate of increase over the three-year period – is public safety.

7.2.3.2 City of Rock Springs
The City of Rock Springs has an annual general fund budget more than twice the size of Rawlins, with
taxes again the largest single contributor to revenue (see Table 33). The city’s anticipated general
revenues exhibit substantial year-to-year revenue due to transfers and unexpected increases due to
changes in local economic activity.
The city’s total budgeted general fund expenditures are anticipated to increase by half over the three-year
period. In part the increase is being funded by the increased distributions of sales and use tax revenues,
with reserves being used to fund the remainder. As with Rawlins, public safety is the largest category of
budgeted expenditures for the City of Rock Springs, but its growth is more constrained. The largest yearContinental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

77

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

to-year increase in expenditures was in parks and recreation, due primarily to a $2.0 million budget item
to add nine holes to the municipal golf course. Annual expenditures for public works have also expanded
sharply, from $4.8 million in FY2005 to $9.1 million budgeted for FY2007.

7.2.3.3 City of Green River
As indicated in Table 34, Green River’s General Fund revenues have grown by about 18 percent over the
last three years, with taxes comprising the largest and fastest-growing component. Total fund
expenditures have increased nearly 50 percent. This is possible because the fund had built up in a
balanced way over the years, and over $12 million is budgeted to be transferred to the Capital Projects
fund in FY2008. Regarding day-to-day activities, the parks and recreation category showed the greatest
growth among the selected categories.

7.2.3.4 Baggs, Dixon and Wamsutter
Table 35 shows budget data for Fiscal Year 2007 for the three smaller communities. Information for only
a single budget year is shown as consistent year-to-year information was not readily available. Again, the
categories shown are an attempt to provide data on as comparable a basis as possible. Even so, the Dixon
budget data includes the utilities, which are reported separately as enterprise funds in the other
communities. Compared to the counties and cities, these communities receive smaller portions of their
revenues from taxes and devote a higher share of the expenditures to administration. In part, the latter also
reflects the more narrow range of services provided by these small municipalities.

Three school districts could be affected by the Continental Divide–Creston Project:





Carbon County School District #1 (CCSD #1)
Sweetwater County School District #1 (SCSD #1)
Sweetwater County School District #2 (SCSD #2)

Figure 35 displays 1991–2006 fall enrollment statistics for the three affected school districts. All three
districts had substantial enrollment declines through the 1990s and the first five years of the current
decade. SCSD #1 began to gain enrollment in 2005, as did CCSD #1. SCSD #2 continued to lose
enrollment through 2006.

Financing for school operations and maintenance is governed by the provisions of the Wyoming School
Foundation Program and the Wyoming School Facilities Commission. The provisions of these two
statutes are described under the School District Fiscal Conditions section.

8.1 CARBON COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT #1
CCSD #1 serves Rawlins, Sinclair, and the Little Snake River Valley, including the communities of
Baggs and Dixon. Additionally, the district serves students in the Sweetwater County community of
Bairoil.
8.1.1 Facilities
Currently CCSD #1 operates three elementary schools, a middle school, a high school and a cooperative
high school in Rawlins. Additionally the district operates a fine-arts center, a swimming pool and a sports

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

81

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

complex. It also operates elementary schools in Sinclair and Bairoil and a K–12 comprehensive school in
Baggs that serves the entire Little Snake River Valley.
The three elementary schools in Rawlins are at capacity and the district is currently using three modular
classroom buildings to accommodate elementary students. The district plans to consolidate the elementary
schools in Rawlins; current plans are to build collocated K–2nd and 3rd–5th grade schools. The district will
need additional modular classrooms to accommodate all elementary students until the new schools are
constructed.
The Rawlins middle school can accommodate an additional 75 to 100 students over 2006–2007 schoolyear levels. The Rawlins High School was designed to accommodate 1,100 to 1,200 students and fall
enrollment was 438 students. The under-utilized high school facility results in high maintenance and
utility costs and safety issues for the district. The auditorium and swimming pool associated with the high
school are considered valuable assets for the district and the community, and the district intends to keep
these assets, however the high school is ultimately configured (Sanders 2007).
8.1.2 Enrollment
Until recently, Carbon County School District #1 has had substantial reductions in enrollment, losing 756
students between fall 1991 and fall 2004, a 31 percent reduction in total enrollment. Fall enrollment has
been increasing over the past two years; the district gained 63 students in the fall of 2005 and 26 students
in 2006, for a total five percent increase over the two-year period (Figure 35). There have been substantial
increases in kindergarten and first grades in recent years, which is more of a demographic phenomenon
than a result of migration. The district typically loses students from fall enrollment through the end of the
year.
8.1.3 Other Issues
CCSD #1 has difficulty finding affordable housing for teachers. The district has purchased modular
housing in Baggs to address this problem in the Little Snake River Valley. The district also has difficulty
in recruiting and retaining maintenance and custodial staff given the labor shortage in the area and the
higher wages paid in the energy industry.

8.2 SWEETWATER COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT #1
SCSD #1 serves eastern and central Sweetwater County and the communities of Rock Springs, Farson,
Eden, Superior, and Wamsutter.
8.2.1 Facilities
SCSD #1 has six elementary schools (five K–4th grade buildings and one 5th–6th grade building); one
junior high and two senior high schools (one traditional and one alternative) in Rock Springs; a combined
elementary, middle, and high school in Farson; and a combined elementary and middle school in
Wamsutter (SCSD #1 2007). The district closed eight schools between 1991 and 2003 due to declining
enrollments.
Currently there are no empty classrooms in the Rock Springs K–4th grade buildings or in the 5th–6th grade
building. SCSD #1 reopened a previously closed school to accommodate recent increased enrollments in
the elementary grades. The Wyoming School Facilities Commission (WSFC) has approved construction
82

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

of a new 450-student capacity K–4 building in Rock Springs and the district has applied to the BLM for
land in the western part of town for this facility. The district has a proposal in to the WSFC to build two
5th–6th grade buildings and an addition to the junior high school. One of the new 5th–6th grade schools
would also be located on the property that the district hopes to acquire from the BLM.
In Wamsutter, the 1st and 2nd grades, 3rd and 4th grades and 5th and 6th grades are combined, each twograde class in one classroom.
8.2.2 Enrollment
SCSD#1 lost 1,934 students between the fall of 1991 and the fall of 2003, or 32 percent of total
enrollment. Between the fall of 2003 and fall 2006, the district added 220 students, an increase of about 5
percent over 2003 total fall enrollment (see Figure 35). School enrollment during the 2006–2007 school
year was about 4,400 students. October 2007 total enrollment for SCSD #1 was 4,742.
Although enrollment is increasing, student turnover is high. The district is seeing an increase in students
who enroll for a matter of weeks or even months and then leave the district as their parents are relocated.
In one recent semester, the district enrolled 875 new students but lost 800 students before the semester’s
end (Grube 2007).
The average classroom size in SCSD #1 is increasing. District standards allow for a maximum of 23
students in K–3rd grade classes and 27 students in 4th–12th grade classes, although the Wyoming
Department of Education recommends 16 to 18 students in kindergarten classes. In September of 2007,
there were 792 new students. About 400 of the new students were enrolled in kindergarten and 392 were
enrolled in other grades. In kindergarten and some of the lower grades, the district has a number of
classrooms that are within two or three students of capacity for that classroom. The district was required
to open up three new kindergarten classes at the beginning of the 2007–2008 school year.
8.2.3 Other Issues
Salary levels for teachers in Wyoming are comparatively high, which attracts interest from teachers in
other states and those just entering the profession. However, housing cost and availability is a disincentive
for teachers in the Rock Springs area. SCSD #1 provides teacher housing (teacherages) in Wamsutter;
however, the state does not reimburse districts for the costs of teacher housing.
Serving English language learners (ELL) has become a major effort in SCSD #1. During the 2003–2004
school year, the district provided ELL classes to 26 students. During the 2007 school year the district will
provide ELL services to about 400 students. The State reimburses districts for one ELL teacher for every
100 students. SCSD #1 has an ELL Coordinator, eight full-time ELL teachers and five to six
paraprofessional ELL aides; the district is not reimbursed for a number of these employees.
SCSD #1 must also compete with the higher-paying gas industry and other industries for certain types of
employees. The district has been short 11 custodians for the last two years and has been required to use
mechanics and other administrative and maintenance staff to drive school buses. Principals in outlying
schools must have a commercial driver’s license as a condition of employment. During the 2006–2007
school year, the Principal in Farson drove a bus. The district has also had problems recruiting and
retaining food serve staff and special education aides. Some special-aid students require a 1:1 ratio of
aides to students (Grube 2007).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

8.3 SWEETWATER COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT #2
SCSD #2 serves the western half of Sweetwater County including the communities of Green River,
Granger, and McKinnon.
8.3.1 Facilities
SCSD #2 operates Green River High School (grades 9–12), Expedition Academy Alternative High
School (grades 10–12), Lincoln Middle School (grades 7–8), and Monroe Intermediate School (grades 5–
6). The District also maintains three elementary schools within the city limits and three rural elementary
schools (SCSD #2 2007). The district has closed two elementary schools since 1990 due to declining
enrollment.
It is estimated that the three Green River elementary schools could accommodate a combined total of an
additional 40 to 50 students, as these schools approach their optimum capacity. These schools have
classroom sizes of 19 to 20 students and are running short of classrooms. Reopening a previously closed
elementary school that was mothballed might be possible if elementary enrollments continue to increase.
There is some capacity for growth in both the 5th–6th grade intermediate school and the 7th–8th grade
middle school. The high school has a design capacity of 1,200 to 1,500 students and currently serves
about 780 students (Sorensen 2007).
8.3.2 Enrollment
Between fall of 1991 and fall of 2006, SCSD# 2 lost 1,412 students or 36 percent of total 1991 fall
enrollment (see Figure 35). Total enrollment at the end of the 2006–2007 school year was about 2,600
students.
8.3.5 Other Issues
Similar to the other two affected school districts, SCSD #2 has had difficulty recruiting teachers because
of the cost and availability of housing. Recruiting ELL and special-education teachers and aides has also
been a problem (Sorensen 2007).

8.4 SCHOOL DISTRICT FISCAL CONDITIONS
A statewide school finance system, the Wyoming School Foundation Program (WSFP) [Title 21, Chapter
13, of Wyoming Statutes], regulates operating revenues and expenditures for public education services
delivered at the local level. The WSFP provides a guaranteed level of funding to every school district in
the state, with funding based on numbers of students, classrooms, and other factors such as adjustments
for small schools, transportation, special programs, and the cost of living. The system is structured to
achieve equalization in educational opportunities across the state, irrespective of differences in the local
revenue-generating capacities of individual districts. Carbon, Sweetwater, and other mineral-rich counties
play an important role in funding the school finance system because of their combined energy and
minerals-related tax base. Revenues for school funding come from taxes on minerals production, real
estate and taxable personal property, and various other local, state, and federal program funds and grants.

84

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

The WSFP funding formula uses either a three-year rolling average of enrollment or the previous year’s
enrollment if it is the highest of the three years to compute the following year’s allowable district
operating budget. If a district has a substantial increase in enrollment in any year over the previous year or
the three-year rolling average, the WSFP does not fully fund the additional students during the first year.
There is an exception allowing for supplemental funding if enrollment increases 10 percent or more over
the previous year. For growth of less than 10 percent, the district may need to hire new teachers and fund
higher operating expenditures without a comparable increase in revenue, even if the district’s tax base
also increases.
To fund public education, all districts are statutorily required to levy an ad valorem property tax of 43
mills, 31 mills of which are deemed local resources. The remaining 12 mills represent a statewide levy
used to fund the guaranteed revenue for districts with fewer local resources. If local property tax revenues
fail to meet a district’s guaranteed funding level, the WSFP makes up the difference. If the district’s
revenues exceed the guaranteed level, the excess is transferred to the state to aid in the funding of other
districts under “recapture” provisions of the WSFP.
Like the counties of which they are a part, CCSD #1 and SCSD #1 and #2 have experienced substantial
increases in assessed value in recent years. As illustrated in Figure 36, CCSD #1 had a 175 percent
increase in assessed value over the past decade, topping $800 million for FY2007, while SCSD #1
increased its assessed value by more than 220 percent, exceeding $1.5 billion in FY2007. Increases in
CCSD #2 assessed valuation were more modest, growing by 33 percent over the decade. As described
above, the districts do not experience a corresponding increase in operating revenues associated with the
increase in assessed valuation due to the provisions of the WSFP.

Table 36 through Table 38 show the income derived by the three districts in several separate funds. As
noted most of the revenue comes from local property taxes, but the Special Revenue Fund consists
primarily of state and federal grants. As described above, locally derived property tax revenues in excess
of certain limits are remitted to the WSFP for redistribution to other districts. CCSD #1 made such

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Funding for school facilities functions under the rules, policies, and procedures of the Wyoming School
Facilities Commission (WSFC) [Title 21, Chapter 15, of Wyoming Statutes]. The WSFC was established
during the 2002 Legislative session to oversee all aspects of construction and maintenance of school
facilities and physical plant. Its mission is to provide adequate educational facilities for all children in
Wyoming, mirroring the mission of the WSFP that focuses on operations. Districts are required to
formulate five-year capital plans, which must then be approved by the WSFC. The WSFC is also
responsible for funding the improvements using legislatively appropriated funds, most of which are
derived from taxes imposed on energy and mineral resource production.

9. SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
This section describes relevant social conditions and trends within the CD-C study area. Specific social
conditions associated with other users of the project area (grazing operators and recreationists) are also
examined. Information for this section was obtained from interviews with community officials, local
government staff, businesspersons, and ranchers; from review of scoping comments and newspaper
articles; and from other secondary sources as cited.

9.1 COMMON SOCIAL ELEMENTS AND TRENDS
Over the past decade, the communities in the study area experienced an economic expansion fueled by
energy development in the project area and elsewhere in the bi-county region and in much of southwest
Wyoming. The recent expansion was the latest in a series of regional economic expansion and contraction
cycles dating back to the construction of the transcontinental railroad but more recently associated with
mineral and energy development. The larger communities in the study area have a somewhat
economically diverse population resulting from the influences of the ranching, energy, mining, and
transportation industries and federal and state government offices and facilities. Wamsutter, Baggs, and
the other smaller communities are much less diverse economically. Wamsutter, although formerly a
railroad and wool-shipping center, has recently become dependent on the energy industry and I-80
commerce. Of the communities in the study area, Baggs and the LSRV remain most closely tied to the
ranching and outdoor recreation (principally hunting) industries, although a number of residents of Baggs
and the LSRV are employed by or provide services to the energy industry and Devon Energy operates a
field office in Baggs.
Communities in the study area are familiar with energy industries and with the relatively constant stream
of newcomers to these communities. However, during the recent expansion, which began in 2002/2003 in
Sweetwater County and 2004/2005 in Carbon County, economic and population growth occurred at levels
not seen for more than two decades in these two counties. Local communities are in agreement that
federal and state population statistics did not reflect the magnitude of growth and there were no reliable
estimates of the number of energy workers who stayed in communities on a temporary basis.
As a result of the economic and population growth and the presence of relatively large numbers of
temporary and transient, predominantly male workers in these communities, social conditions in affected
communities were changing at a relatively rapid pace. Many of the “boom-town” phenomena (e.g.
housing shortages and escalating housing costs, workforce shortages, elevated rates of certain types of
crime) reported by researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s once again emerged. Social settings
within the study area such as stores, restaurants, bars, and post offices were increasingly crowded and
from a local resident’s perspective, filled with strangers. Traffic on major streets and thoroughfares in

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Rock Springs and Rawlins was often congested (relative to past years), housing prices increased
substantially, and local retail and service establishments had difficulty obtaining and keeping employees.
There are enthusiastic supporters of the boom and just-as-ardent detractors in all communities. But even
some of the supporters lament the change in social conditions, e.g., “feeling the need to lock their houses
and take the keys out of their cars, entering a supermarket or restaurant and not seeing a familiar face,
having to wait for two stoplight cycles to cross an intersection.” For many, these inconveniences were
offset by the robust economy and the increase in employment and shopping options. Others, including
those who did not benefit from energy development and those on fixed incomes, were less likely to be
enthusiastic about the boom.
Many residents of Carbon and Sweetwater counties value clean air and water, wildlife, wildlife habitat,
and access to and the health of public lands (Blevins et al. 2004, Carbon County Board of Commissioners
and Carbon County Planning Commission 1998, Markert 2008). A key concern for many residents is the
effect of energy development on public lands, particularly lands with high resource values.
Two groups have been directly affected by natural-gas development within the project area:
ranchers/grazing permittees and recreation users of the area.

9.2 RANCHERS/GRAZING PERMITTEES
Information for this section was obtained from individual and group interviews with grazing permittees,
the Rawlins-based UW Cooperative Extension Area Educator for Range Management, and the RFO
Range Resources Specialist assigned to the CD-C EIS. As discussed in Section 3.17 Rangeland
Management of the EIS, 47 allotments are permitted for grazing within the project area. Many of these
allotments extend beyond the boundaries of the project area. The active allotments are permitted for
191,700 animal unit months (AUMs) of grazing per year used mostly by cattle, although sheep are grazed
on two allotments in the northwestern portion of the project area during winter months.
Many of the affected livestock operations in the project area are locally owned, multi-generational family
ranches. A combination of long-term drought, high fuel and feed prices, unfavorable market conditions,
and the high level of existing natural gas development within the allotments has resulted in challenging
times for grazing permittees, causing some to substantially alter their methods of operation and even
consider relinquishing their allotments.
In the most active natural gas fields within the project area, the predominant land use has changed from
grazing/dispersed recreation to industrial. The project area contains roads with some of the highest traffic
volumes in Carbon and Sweetwater counties, including high volumes of heavy-truck traffic. The high
traffic volumes within the project area produce substantial amounts of dust on all but the major roads,
which have been treated with magnesium chloride.
Natural gas development can affect grazing operations in several ways. Effects include livestock
injury/mortality, reduced rates of weight gain in livestock, increased maintenance of range improvements,
and required changes in livestock management practices.
Heavy traffic during drilling and field development often results in conflict with livestock operations.
Vehicle/livestock collisions are not uncommon and, although some natural gas companies compensate
permittees for livestock mortality, accidents are not reported in many cases. Responsibility is difficult to
assign in areas used by multiple gas companies, and some service companies are less willing to
compensate livestock owners. Companies are, in general, unwilling to compensate grazing permittees

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

91

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

unless a driver accepts or is assigned responsibility for the accident. Gas-field traffic is of particular
concern during lambing and calving periods, when animals sometimes use the roads to give birth and
newborn animals are less able to move out of the way of oncoming traffic. In addition to animal losses
from accidents, livestock lose weight if they are frequently startled by traffic. Some permittees have
stopped trailing their herds along WY 789, the Wamsutter–Dad Road, and other major county and BLM
roads within the project area because of the high volumes of industrial traffic, resulting in higher costs to
move livestock by truck from pastures on one side of the road to the other.
High levels of gas-field traffic can increase damages to range improvements such as fences and cattle
guards, resulting in scattering of livestock from pastures and introduction of other livestock and wild
horses into pastures. During severe winters, when natural-gas company contractors clear snow for some
distance on either side of road surfaces to remove heavy snow accumulations, damage to cattle guards and
sections of fence often occurs. As a result, some permittees are unable to use some pastures in the spring,
which has disrupted grazing patterns and resulted in unbudgeted costs to relocate livestock. Although in
most cases gas companies compensate grazing permittees for repairing fences and cattle guards, there are
sometimes disputes over the amount of compensation, the quality of the replacement fences and
structures, and the timeliness of compensation. It is again difficult to assign responsibility for damage in
areas where multiple gas and service companies are active; grazing permittees lose the use of the pastures
while awaiting repairs, which at times requires an extended period to locate and schedule contractors.
Another concern for livestock grazing permittees is that some gas companies do not notify them in
advance of starting new development within a federal grazing allotment. Consequently, affected grazing
permittees do not have advance opportunity to relocate herds to avoid conflict with development.
Although required by regulation, some drilling contractors do not adequately fence drilling facilities such
as reserve pits, resulting in livestock injury or mortality.
New and improved roads are at times beneficial for grazing permittees in that they allow better access to
pastures and livestock. But new and improved roads also facilitate higher travel speeds for gas-field
traffic, increasing the risk of vehicle/livestock accidents. New and improved roads also allow more public
access into grazing allotments, increasing the potential for vandalism and disruption of grazing in
formerly remote areas. Some grazing permittees report reductions in vandalism in areas that are actively
being developed, however, which they attribute to the greater human presence.
An oft-cited effect of high levels of natural-gas development is the reduction in forage associated with
surface disturbance and infestation of noxious and invasive species when reclamation is delayed or
unsuccessful. In areas where development is concentrated, reductions in forage can be substantial.
Although a portion of disturbance for well pads, pipelines, roads, and other ancillary facilities is required
to be reclaimed within a short period of time, a combination of the prolonged drought and ineffective
reclamation methods has resulted in drill pads, pipeline and road corridors, lay-down areas, and pads for
ancillary facilities remaining unreclaimed or in a weed-infested state for years. In addition to the direct
reductions in forage associated with unreclaimed or weed-infested areas, a substantially larger area is
often removed from productive use as a result of wind-blown dust from unreclaimed areas and roads
which accumulates on plants, reducing palatability and accelerating wear on livestock teeth. The location
of well pads, gathering lines, and roads may also alter surface-water flow patterns, resulting in erosion
and loss of vegetative cover and forage.
The combination of high levels of gas development activity, reduced forage, and drought conditions
requires substantially higher levels of livestock management for grazing permittees, as they are required
to more frequently monitor livestock condition and movements, relocate livestock more frequently and
round up livestock that have wandered from pastures when fences and cattle guards are down.
Sheepherders have been required to avoid grazing and trailing their flocks through certain areas and to

92

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

find new trails to avoid halogeton infestations, which can be toxic to sheep. Some grazing permittees who
formerly wintered cattle on allotments within the project area have had to truck their herds to other areas
or other states, in part because of periodic drought years but also in part to avoid natural-gas activity
during winter months when herd management is more difficult.
Higher levels of livestock management result in higher fuel outlays and labor costs. Fuel costs for grazing
permittees in the project area can be substantial given the distance to the allotments from communities
and home ranches. Securing ranch hands in Carbon and Sweetwater counties during the boom years was
complicated by the regional labor shortage and competition for workers. Some grazing permittees had
difficulty competing for workers with the traditionally higher wages paid by the energy industry. More
active management can also reduce livestock weight gain.
All of the above factors result in higher cost, lower production, and reduced profitability for grazing
permittees. And, although their allotments are less productive because of activity, disturbance, weed
infestations and drought, their allotment lease fees are not reduced. The reduced profitability is likely to
change the nature of some CD-C ranching operations and may result in others leaving the ranching
business. Grazing permittees interviewed for this assessment reported reductions in herd size, potential
selling off of herds, and potential relinquishment of BLM leases.
The ranching economy in Carbon and Sweetwater counties is substantially smaller than the energy
economy, but reductions in ranching operations would result in adverse changes in economic diversity in
these two counties. Reductions in ranching operations would also have social and cultural implications for
the study area. Ranching is an important element of the heritage and culture of Carbon and Sweetwater
counties and the State of Wyoming as a whole.

9.3 RECREATION USERS OF THE AREA
Substantial changes in the recreation setting within the project area have already occurred. As noted
elsewhere in this assessment, an average of about 239 wells/year were drilled within the project area
during the 2000-2010 period and there were over 3,738 producing wells in the area at the end of 2010.
As discussed in Section 3.12 Recreation of the EIS, hunting—primarily by locals—is the dominant
recreation use of lands within the project area. Some pleasure driving to view wild horses or the Red
Desert landscape occurs near the specific resources and settings of interest. Recreation use in the project
area is low overall and seasonal, with most occurring in the fall during the big game hunting seasons. The
BLM generally considers the project area to be a recreation resource that attracts some non-residents who
have special interests (e.g., wild horses, historic trails, and the Red Desert) but is visited mainly by
Wyoming residents, especially those living nearby.
A mixture of local residents, other Wyoming residents, and non-locals has historically hunted within the
project area, although as noted above, locals are the dominant users. Adverse effects of existing naturalgas development on hunting have resulted from development activity, traffic, and changes in wildlife
distribution and abundance. Although the current presence of relatively widely spaced wells in some parts
of the project area is not a deterrent for all hunters, safety issues associated with hunting around naturalgas facilities and the change in the recreational setting are believed to be deterrents for many non-local
and out-of-state hunters for whom a natural setting is a part of the overall hunting experience.
Displacement of hunters from the project area results in increasing hunting pressure on other areas. There
is increasing concern among hunting and wildlife advocacy groups that development in wide expanses of
wildlife habitat and migration corridors will have an adverse effect on wildlife populations within the
study area.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS

93

2008 SOCIOECONOMIC TECHNICAL REPORT

Some local and non-local groups and individuals value specific areas within and adjacent to the project
area including a sage-grouse lek complex southeast of Creston, the Red Lakes Dunes Citizens’ Proposed
Wilderness and the Chain Lakes WHMA. At the time of this assessment, one well has been drilled in the
Chain Lakes area and several wells have been drilled near the portion of the project area that contains the
portion of the Red Lake Dunes Citizens’ Proposed Wilderness and near the sage-grouse lek east of
Creston.
A growing concern is the increasing amount of big-game poaching occurring in remote areas now
accessible on roads improved for natural-gas development and an increasing amount of both personal and
industrial litter along highways and county, BLM, and private roads. These effects represent a loss in
environmental amenity values for local residents, recreational users, and non-users alike.

10. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Executive Order (EO) 12898, “Federal Action to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations” was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 7629) on February 11, 1994.
EO 12898 requires federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse human
health or environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and
low-income populations (defined as those living below the poverty level).
The assessment of potential environmental justice impacts is guided by the Council on Environmental
Quality’s Environmental Justice Guidance under the National Environmental Policy Act (CEQ 1997).
Determination of Environmental Justice impacts requires three steps: (1) a description of the geographic
distribution of low-income and minority populations in the affected area; (2) an assessment of whether the
action under consideration would produce impacts that are high and adverse; and (3) if impacts are high
and adverse, a determination as to whether these impacts would disproportionately affect minority and
low-income populations. This section of the assessment describes the distribution of minority and lowincome populations in areas likely to be affected by the CD-C project.

10.1

RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS

Table 39 presents the percentage of minority residents in the project area and surrounding areas at the
time of the 2000 Census. Minorities were 11.0 percent of the population in the Environmental Justice
analysis area that includes the project area, essentially the same as the statewide average of 11.1 percent.
The Hispanic or Latino population is the largest minority group, locally as well as across the state.9 The
analysis area does not exactly match the project area boundaries, but has similar demographic
characteristics to the project area.


The percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the Rawlins area (about 25 miles from the
eastern edge of the project area) was 25.2; this relatively high number is a result of persons
incarcerated in the Wyoming State Penitentiary.

9

The analysis area is made of the census blocks surrounding and fully including the CD-C Project Area with adjustments for
areas in the urban clusters in cities with populations over 5,000 (including the cities of Rawlins, Green River, and Rock Springs).



The percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the Rock Springs area (over 40 miles away) was
13.5, and in Green River area (over 50 miles way) was 12.6, neither of which is meaningfully
higher than the statewide average.



The Town of Wamsutter, located within the project area, had a 2000 Census population of 261,
16.1 percent of whom were classified as racial or ethnic minorities. The Sweetwater County
unincorporated community of Table Rock, located on the western edge of the project area, had a
population of 82 with a 13.4 percent minority population. The percentages of racial and ethnic
minorities in these communities are not meaningfully higher than the statewide average.



The Town of Baggs (Carbon County) had a 2000 population of 348 with a 4.7 percent minority
population. The Town of Dixon had a population 79 with a 5.1 percent minority population. The
Town of Sinclair had a population 423 with a 5.4 percent minority population. All three minority
populations within these communities are substantially lower than the statewide average.



The percentages of minorities in Carbon County and Sweetwater County are higher, but not
meaningfully so, than the statewide average. The higher percentages of minorities is due to the
larger minority population in these counties’ larger cities which are outside of, and distant from,
the project area.

Note 1: Racial minorities include all persons identifying themselves in the census as a non-white race, including "Black or
African American," "American Indian and Alaska Native," "Asian," "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander," "Some other
race alone," and "Two or more races." Ethnic minorities include persons who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino.
Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin can identify themselves as part of any race (including white) and as persons of Hispanic
or Latino origin are an ethnic minority, the racial group of White Alone does not include persons of Hispanic or Latino origin.
Note 2: Rawlins Area includes Rawlins and other areas in the Rawlins urban cluster (Block 4032 of Block Group 4 of Census
Tract 9678, Block 2082 of Block Group 2 of Census Tract 9676, and Blocks 2005 and 2010 of Block Group 2 of Census
Tract 9677). These other areas are considered to be areas that have urban settlement or development characteristics and
not incorporated into any other place. Most of this area's population (468 persons out of 474 persons) live in Block 2082 and
are incarcerated at the state penitentiary.
Note 3: Rock Springs Area includes Rock Springs, Reliance, North Rock Springs, Clear View Acres, Purple Sage, and other
areas in the Rock Springs urban cluster (Blocks 3087, 3088 and 3089 of Block Group 3 of Census Tract 9708, and Blocks
2014 and 2015 of Block Group 2 of Census Tract 9709.03. These other areas in the urban cluster do not have any
population.
Note 4: Green River Area includes Green River and James Town, and note that there are no other areas in this urban
cluster.
Note 5: Places in Carbon County not in the project area, Census Tract 9676, Block Group 2 does not include those areas in
the Rawlins (388 persons) and the Rawlins urban cluster (474 persons) described above, i.e., the Wyoming State
Penitentiary and nearby areas around Rawlins and south of I-80.
Note 6: Places in Sweetwater County and not in the project area, Census Tract 9716, Block Group 2 includes 3 persons in
the Rock Springs Area (living in Block 2355 of Block Group 2 of Census Tract 9716), as these persons are accounted for
above.

PERSONS IN POVERTY

Table 40 presents the percentage of persons in poverty in the project area and surrounding areas. For the
analysis of low-income population, the local area that includes the project area is slightly larger than that
for the analysis of minority populations because the level of aggregation of income data available from
the U.S. Census Bureau is larger than that for racial and ethnic characteristics. The key difference
between these two areas of analysis is the population in the area surrounding the Wyoming State
Penitentiary, which is now included in the analysis area. This change likely exaggerates the proportion of
the population with poverty level incomes in the analysis area.
Persons with incomes below the poverty level represent 10.6 percent of the population in the analysis area
that includes the project area. This is 1.8 percent lower than the 11.4 percent of the population with
incomes below the poverty level for the State of Wyoming.

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Introduction
As described in Section 1.6, Public Participation, the BLM conducted public scoping for both the
Creston/Blue Gap II and the Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development projects. In the fall of
2005, BLM published a Notice of Intent in the Federal Register and invited the public to comment on a
proposal for more extensive development in the Creston/Blue Gap II natural gas field. A public meeting
was held in Rawlins on October 13, 2005. During the scoping period on the Creston/Blue Gap II Project,
the BLM received 29 individual comment letters, faxes, and e-mails.
Very soon after the Creston/Blue Gap scoping process had been completed, BLM RFO received a
proposal from BP America Production Company (BP), representing themselves and other leaseholders, to
further develop lease holdings in the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II natural gas area. The BLM decided
to combine this project with the Creston/Blue Gap project into a single EIS and initiated another scoping
process for the newly named Continental Divide-Creston EIS. The BLM published a Notice of Intent for
this larger Continental Divide-Creston project on March 3, 2006. A public meeting to discuss the project
was held in Rawlins on April 6. In addition to the 29 comments received during the original scoping
period, 21 comment letters, faxes, and e-mails were received for the combined Continental DivideCreston Project. Most of the respondents were the same for both projects.
Section 1.6.2, Key Issues and Concerns, describes those issues raised during the course of scoping for
both phases of the project that are considered central to the analysis of impacts in this EIS- those issues
that have not already been addressed as matters of law or policy, that deal with resources of high value in
the project area, and that would be directly affected by the BLM’s decision on natural-gas development in
the project area. This Appendix includes a more comprehensive listing of the issues that were raised
during the process. The Continental Divide-Creston Public Scoping Notice included a list of scoping
questions representing preliminary issues identified by the BLM with regard to resources and
management issues. These issues, shown below as BLM Scoping Questions, include air quality, cultural
resources, land use, soils and vegetation, hydrology and water rights, wildlife, visual resources, noise,
recreation, transportation, socioeconomic resources, and reclamation.
BLM’s scoping questions and a summary of the public comments received are described below,
categorized by resource and management issue. In some instances, BLM did not identify scoping
questions for a particular issue; thus only comments are listed.
 PHYSICAL RESOURCES
Soils
BLM Scoping Questions:


Are there short-term, direct impacts to the soils in the project area?



Are there long-range, indirect impacts to the soils resources in the project area?



How much surface area will be disturbed and for how long?



What provisions for interim reclamation will be made?



What measures will be taken to minimize erosion and sedimentation once soil and vegetation is
removed from disturbed sites?

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-1

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Scoping Comments:


Consider effects of erosion from wind, and to a lesser degree, water



Consider mitigation measures that can reduce removal of topsoil and vegetation, and other practices
that may have significant short-term impacts to soils.



BLM must protect against soil erosion by identifying and protecting fragile, steep, or highly erosive
soils, including biological soil crusts.

Water Resources
BLM Scoping Questions:


What are the watershed characteristics of the project area?



What existing conditions of stream banks and streambeds might be affected by the proposal?



What is the direction and magnitude of groundwater flows in the project area?



What are the recharge and discharge characteristics of groundwater in the area, including the
relationship between ground and surface waters?



What are the existing qualities of surface and ground water in the project area? How will the project
affect surface and ground water qualities?



How will produced water from coalbed de-watering operations be utilized and/or disposed of?



What measures will be taken to minimize erosion and sedimentation once soil and vegetation is
removed from disturbed sites?

Scoping Comments:


Consider effects to water quality in the Colorado River.



Consider degraded groundwater and surface water.



Draining all the water from the ground lowers the ground level, provides no water for plants.



Disclose whether any stream segments exceed water quality standards and/or are listed in the state’s
Clean Water Act. Determine if any planning and evaluation has been conducted on streams that
have been evaluated as impaired, or if there is doubt as to whether any streams are achieving State
water-quality standards.



BLM must insure that waters in the project area comply with state water quality standards and with
sections 401 and 404 of the CWA.



Maintain a buffer zone and NSO around natural springs to protect water quality. Carefully evaluate
the appropriate width of buffers and discourage all development or alteration of natural springs.



BLM must comply with its obligations under the ESA concerning salt and sediment loads to and
depletions from Colorado River watersheds.



Selenium content of produced water must be 2 μ/L to protect fish, waterfowl, shorebirds, and other
wildlife. Due to “bioaccumulation” in living tissue, the amount of selenium discharged (not the
concentration released) must be monitored and regulated.
o

A-2

Do not discharge produced water with selenium concentrations > 2μ/L into closed containment
pits or ponds for disposal by evaporation.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

o



Estimate selenium and other trace element concentrations in evaporation ponds using an
appropriate model, over a period of years to determine if selenium and other trace elements
could post a risk to migratory birds using the pond.

To prevent migratory bird mortality for species using evaporative ponds:
Using an appropriate model, estimate the sodium concentrations in produced water within the
evaporation pond over a period of years to determine if sodium could pose a risk to migratory
birds landing on the pond. If the model shows that sodium concentrations would exceed 17,000
mg/l, then the pond should be designed with effective wildlife exclusionary devices to prevent
access by migratory birds, or other options should be considered for containment and disposal
of produced water.
o
If the predictive model does not show an increasing trend in sodium concentrations, the pond
should be monitored annually to verify whether levels are increasing over time. If
concentrations exceed 17,0000 mg/L, netting or other effective wildlife exclusionary devices
should be deployed to prevent access, or other options considered for containment and disposal
of produced water.
No surface disposal of produced water should be allowed due to increased salt loading within the
Colorado River basin. In addition, it would alter the chemistry, suspended solids, water temperature
and/or natural hydrograph of the watershed in the Muddy Creek drainage, which could result in
elimination of native fish populations even if the water meets TDS loading set by the Colorado
River Basin Salinity Control Forum in 2002.
o





Evaluate the use of produced water to irrigate croplands in terms of potential land use changes.



Analyze management of produced water through re-injection into underground reservoirs through
National Pollution Discharge Elimination permits.



Inject produced water from coalbed methane underground; no surface disposal.



How are the formations identified for re-injection related to the formations that produce the springs
that create the stream in the Muddy Creek drainage?



Hydrostatic test water released during pipeline construction could alter stream channels, increase
sediment loads, and introduce potentially toxic chemicals or invasive species. Avoid discharging
hydrostatic test waters directly to streams; release them first into a temporary sediment retention
basin if suspended solids concentration is significantly higher than receiving water. Use potable or
freshwater well sources for hydrostatic test water.



At no time should water from a surface source in one basin be discharged into another basin, which
could spread nuisance species.



Regarding pipeline construction and operations:
o
o

o
o

Pipeline crossings of perennial streams should be bored underneath the stream rather than
trenching through it, especially Muddy Creek and its primary tributaries.
Install pipeline crossings through ephemeral streams by trenching, using riprap to stabilize
stream banks. Place riprap from the channel bottom to the top of the high water line on the
bank. Use double-ditching techniques to separate the top one-foot of stream-bottom substrate
from deeper soil layers, and reconstruct by replacing deeper substrate first.
Locate pipelines that parallel drainages outside the100-year floodplain. Construct pipeline
crossings at right angles to all riparian corridors and stream to minimize the area of disturbance.
Use the minimum practical width for rights-of-way where pipelines cross riparian areas and
streams.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-3

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Any new road crossing of Muddy Creek proper is opposed; a bridge should be used to span the
channel and riparian zone, and the structure should not impact or restrict flow in the channel on
the 50-year flood plain.
o
For perennial tributaries in the Muddy Creek drainage, design road crossings to allow fish
passage at all flows. Preferred structures in descending order: bridge spans with abutments on
banks, bridge spans with center support, open-bottom box culverts, and round culverts with the
bottom placed no less than one foot below existing stream grade. Perched culverts block fish
passage and are unacceptable in any stream that supports a fishery.
o
Drilling should not be permitted on slopes exceeding 25%.
o
Design drill pad sites to drain storm water and other fluids into a reserve pit with capacity to
intercept and hold excess precipitation. Line all reserve pits, irrespective of soil types, with an
impermeable barrier to eliminate leaching.
o
Staging, refueling, and storage areas should be located away from riparian zones and flood
plains. Keep all chemicals, solvents, and fuels at least 500 feet from streams and riparian areas.
o
Locate and construct all structures crossing intermittent and perennial streams so they do not
decrease channel stability or increase water velocity.
BLM must protect against degradation of water quality by implementing measures such as lining of
reserve pits or pitless drilling.
o



Climate and Air Quality
BLM Scoping Questions:



What emission sources and values will be generated by the project?
How will air quality impacts be evaluated and resources protected during development and
operations?

Scoping Comments:


General concern: long-range protection of visibility.



The EIS should be consistent with the Rawlins Draft RMP/EIS, which proposed to use a
comparative, emissions-based approach.



BLM must assure full compliance with the Clean Air Act.



Fully explain and interpret projected impacts, summarizing modeled results and the various methods
and assumptions used so that the public can easily understand them for their significance. Include
specific mitigation measures, such as improved diesel engine technology and fugitive dust control.



Estimate potential future changes in emissions. Modeling should address cumulative emissions in
the Rawlins Field Office planning area that affect the same areas as C/BGII. Include information in
the DEIS regarding cumulative impacts from coal production in the vicinity.



Address reasonably foreseeable gas and other development in the area, and possible changes in this
and other proposed projects. For example, the Jonah Infill gas project suggests that improved diesel
engine technology may be necessary for all future gas development projects in Southwestern
Wyoming to protect Class I and other air resources.



Disclose the effects of increases in Nox and other pollutant concentrations, including regional haze,
and clarify control measures.

A-4

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



The fugitive dust analysis should emphasize the Pm10 standard and percentages of emissions that are
fine and coarse particles. Address near-field impacts of fugitive dust, and whether there is potential
to approach NAAQS standards.



Describe potential air impacts of venting and flaring, and whether BLM or the State of Wyoming
are considering flare less flow back or similar technology as mitigation.



Address proposed and needed air monitoring. If BLM intends to add air monitoring stations,
describe the program in sufficient detail to ascertain locations and objectives of the monitoring
effort.



The EIS must analyze the cumulative effect on air quality, including all sensitive receptors
potentially affected, and acknowledging all reasonably foreseeable emission sources. Additionally,
BLM must ensure compliance with all air pollution standards and discuss all mitigation measures
available to prevent air quality violations, increment exceedances and adverse impacts to AQRV,
including visibility impairment in Class I areas.



We request that BLM reject use of the Scheffe model for estimation of ozone pollution and use
instead an up-to-date photochemical model such as CAMx or CAMQ.

 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Vegetation and Riparian/Wetland Communities
BLM Scoping Questions:


Are there short-term, direct impacts to the vegetation resources in the project area?



Are there long-range, indirect impacts to the vegetation resources in the project area?



How much surface area will be disturbed; for how long?



What provisions for interim reclamation will be made?



How will noxious weed populations be monitored/ controlled?



What are the revegetation standards and requirements?



Are there adequate reclamation bonds or other guarantees for reclamation of site disturbance?



Will there be impacts to jurisdictional wetlands or Waters of the U.S.?



How much surface area will be disturbed and for how long?



What provisions for interim reclamation will be made?



What measures will be taken to minimize erosion and sedimentation once soil and vegetation is
removed from disturbed sites?

Scoping Comments:


BLM should conduct surveys to determine the location and characteristics of native plant
communities and rare or special status species and insure compliance with EO 13112 relative to
invasive species.



Outline minimum reclamation standards that emphasize use of native plant species, postreclamation monitoring, and management.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-5

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Riparian and wetland habitat buffer zones should preclude new surface-disturbing activities within
the 100-year floodplain or within a designated buffer. Recommend buffer zones that include NSO
stipulations and clarify if surface occupancy exemption may be granted, including the nature of its
mitigation. Clarify if exemptions may be restricted based on the cumulative effects of similar
actions in any one riparian area.



Take measures to avoid wetland losses in accordance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.



Inventory and fully describe wetlands that may be destroyed or degraded in terms of functions and
values, and outline specific actions to minimize impacts and compensate for unavoidable impacts.



Avoid impacts to riparian areas; minimize and assess functions and values in areas of unavoidable
impacts, and develop and implement measures to compensate unavoidable losses.

Invasive, Non-native species
BLM Scoping Questions:


How much surface area will be disturbed and for how long?



What provisions for interim reclamation will be made?



How will noxious weed populations be monitored, and controlled?

Scoping Comments:


Describe the current trend for weed infestations. Include the location of weed infestations within
and surrounding the project area, the trend in infestations, specific measures for oil and gas leases,
and the annual budget available to affected counties and BLM for invasive species control.



BLM must provide measures to impede the invasion of noxious weeds.

Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife
BLM Scoping Questions:


What are the current conditions and extents of wildlife habitat in the project area?



What are the seasonal patterns of wildlife use and movement in the project area?



Are wildlife populations increasing or decreasing in the project area?

Scoping Comments:


With regard to wildlife habitat fragmentation, analyze the project at a level that reflects full
potential development of the area, rather than on a piecemeal basis to ensure that the consequences
of full-field development are clearly understood before wildlife resources are committed.



Address loss of wildlife habitat and habitat effectiveness, fragmentation, effects to migration
corridors, harassment of wildlife by increased traffic, noise, and illegal activities.



Evaluate where elk will be displaced to, and whether such habitat is suitable and/or herds will be
tolerated by private landowners.



Conduct raptor nest surveys and evaluate impacts to nesting. Establish mitigation such as seasonal
timing restrictions, siting of facilities, and installation of artificial nesting platforms away from
project disturbances and areas where they could impact Sage-grouse.

A-6

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Evaluate expected cumulative impacts to wildlife habitat and individual populations and herds
relative to other energy development occurring in the area, particularly Atlantic Rim.



Analyze impacts to each of three separate pronghorn herds, both direct and cumulative (instead of a
regional or species analysis). Analyze impacts to individual herds of mule deer and elk, as well as
three Sage-grouse management areas that overlay the project area.



Evaluate impacts to mountain plovers.



Use the lowest road densities possible to minimize habitat loss and disturbance by vehicles.



Operators should fund necessary wildlife surveys exceeding those normally conducted annually by
state and federal biologists.



The EIS must address the impacts of oil and gas development on wildlife and wildlife habitat
function, including:
the ecological needs of wildlife on a regional scale;
o impacts on pocket gophers;
o impacts on mountain plovers;
o impacts on prairie dogs.
o the dispersal or recovery of gray wolves in the southern Red Desert;
BLM must ensure full compliance with BLM Manual MS-6840.06.E (Special Status Species
Management), including attention to ferruginous hawks, other raptors and sage-grouse.
o




We urge that BLM protect more than “critical” big game winter ranges.



We ask that the environmental analysis provide for wildlife diversity by protecting riparian areas
and other special habitats, protecting certain species, maintaining connectivity between habitats,
maintaining corridors, and assessing indirect and cumulative impacts.



BLM should adopt the provisions of the WGFD recommendations on sustaining important wildlife
habitats affected by oil and gas development.



The EIS should analyze potential impacts to wildlife habitat, including big-game crucial winter
range, sage-grouse, raptors, predators, and big game in general.



Consider the impact of road building, increased human presence and disturbance, timber harvest,
mineral exploration, grazing, etc. on wildlife.



Protect all species of migratory birds, including Bald eagle.



The project will be detrimental to the ability to sustain area wildlife.



Natural gas development is estimated to span 30-50 years in Desolation Flats and Continental
Divide/Wamsutter II, and this project will last as long if not longer. Where will wildlife go?



The northern portion of the project area supports the only viable assemblage of native bluehead
suckers, roundtail chubs, and flannelmouth suckers known to still exist in Wyoming. This portion of
the stream provides preferred breeding habitat, and movement up or downstream is restricted by the
combination of physical barriers and water temperatures. Any cumulative energy development
activity that negatively affects the integrity of the watershed and overall stream health may
jeopardize their future existence. An NSO restriction is recommended for surface gas development
between the Continental Divide north of Muddy Creek proper and the Muddy Creek/Dry Cow
Creek hydrographic divide located south of Muddy Creek and upstream of the large wetland
complex.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-7

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Special Status Species
BLM Scoping Questions:


How much surface area will be disturbed and for how long?



What provisions for interim reclamation will be made?



Which wildlife species of importance may be impacted by the proposal?



Will any threatened or endangered species be affected by the proposal?

Scoping Comments:


The EIS must address the impacts on BLM sensitive plants.



Assemble regional habitat-use data from published data where available for T&E species and other
key species. Include impacts of road density on local species, distance of road effects to determine
the width of effect zones, and species dispersal distances to evaluate the size of core areas.



The following T&E Species, or species proposed for listing, may be present in the project area:
Bald eagle (threatened; found throughout the state). Restrict activities within 1 mile of nests in open
country year round. Limited disturbance home range buffer zone may extend outward in potential
foraging habitat for 2.5 miles from the nest.
Black-footed ferret (endangered; prairie dog towns). There may be impacts to two white-tailed
prairie dog complexes in the project area where the species is found, and surveys may be
recommended if complexes of greater than 200 acres are affected.
Blowout penstemon (endangered; sand dunes south of Ferris Mtns). Surveys should be conducted in
mid-June to early July when flowering occurs.
Ute ladies’-tresses (threatened; seasonally moist soils & wet meadows below 7,000 feet). Surveys
should be conducted.
Colorado river fish: Bonytail, Colorado pikeminnow, Humpback chub, and Razorback sucker
(endangered; downstream riverine habitat, Yampa, Green and Colorado). Formal consultation is
required for projects that may lead to depletion of the waters including ponds, lakes, reservoirs,
hydrostatic testing of pipelines, wells, dust abatement, diversion structure, and water treatment
facilities.
Include an estimate of the amount and timing of average annual water depletion, both existing and
new; describe estimating methods, location of depletion, if and when water will be returned to the
system, and what the depletion is being used for.
Yellow-billed cuckoo (candidate). Provide status of the species in and near the project area.
Sensitive species, as identified on the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database.
Pygmy Rabbit. Encourage project planning measures that retain large tracts of suitable habitat and
corridors to adjacent habitat.
Greater Sage-grouse (species of concern).
o
o
o

A-8

Closely evaluate any activities that result in loss or degradation of sagebrush habitat.
Contact Wyoming Game & Fish to identify important habitats, and survey/map important
habitats where local information is not available.
Evaluate long-term and cumulative effects on the species, since reclamation may not restore
populations to pre-activity levels.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Unless site-specific information is available, manage habitat following Western Association of
Fish and Wildlife Agencies guidelines.
Mountain plover (species of concern). Develop protective measures with an assurance of
implementation should they be found in the project area.

o



Consider whether potential impacts to listed species on state and private lands will occur as a result
of actions on BLM managed lands, and develop measures to avoid or minimize impacts.



The EIS must address the impacts of oil and gas development on wildlife and wildlife habitat
function, including:
implementation of a conservation community “blueprint” for Sage-grouse and Sage-grouse
habitat throughout the project area;
o
impacts on mountain plovers;
BLM must analyze how ESA and BLM-sensitive species would be affected by failure to conserve
white-tailed prairie dogs, including the impact on black-footed ferret recovery and on BLMSensitive and Colorado River Endangered fish species.
o





Native fish species in the Muddy Creek drainage are considered sensitive (Status I Species) to both
State and Federal agencies. Therefore, habitat function is to be maintained. WGFD’s Strategic
Habitat Plan identifies the Muddy Creek watershed as the #2 habitat priority for both aquatic and
terrestrial wildlife in most of Southwestern Wyoming.



BLM must analyze how other ESA and BLM-sensitive species would be affected by the project,
including BLM-Sensitive and Colorado River Endangered fish species.



Baseline studies on pygmy rabbits and impact on this species should be included in the EIS.



Full-field development will destroy habitat value for sage-grouse leks, hastening their listing under
the Endangered Species Act.



In addition to direct habitat loss for greater Sage-grouse, evaluate secondary disturbance to Sagegrouse in undisturbed habitats adjacent to the project area.



Evaluate expected impacts and habitat avoidance by Sage-grouse due to structures (particularly
powerlines)



Consider development of artificial leks near existing roadside leks to attract grouse to safer areas.



Identify and map all existing disturbances of Sage-grouse habitat near the project and evaluate the
degree of existing habitat fragmentation, as well as how it would be accelerated by this proposal.

Wild Horses & Burros
A cumulative impact analysis is recommended examining regional effects to the area including South
Baggs, Atlantic Rim, Desolation Flats, Pacific Rim, Table Rock, and Vermillion Creek natural gas fields,
and the Black Butte Mine. Include the overpopulation of feral horses and nonstandard fences in the
analysis of effects on wildlife.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-9

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

 HUMAN ENVIRONMENT
Visual Resources
BLM Scoping Questions:


Will there be visual impacts from the project?



Can visual impacts be mitigated to conform with the existing landscape and visual quality
objectives

Scoping Comments:


The project will destroy natural vistas and open spaces. BLM should avoid development in areas
where the impacts of development would be visible for long periods of time or from long distances



BLM must protect visual character and scenic resources, including protection from light pollution
and impacts to the appearance of the night sky..



A sensitive landscape that warrants special protection for its visual quality is a “a small portion of
the Red Lake Dunes Citizens’ Proposed Wilderness” located in the dune field immediately west of
the gravel road leading northward to Hay Reservoir.



Identify and set aside important scenic and undeveloped areas so that the public has a few
unimpaired lands left to visit after this project is underway.



The North Flattop unit is an area of high importance for visual resources that is not protected under
the Great Divide RA RMP, that should be excluded from O&G development. Other such areas are
Red Lake Dunes and Cyclone Rim (Class I).



Protect visual quality in a “5-mile buffer” associated with the Continental Divide Trail (Class I) and
with the Cherokee and Overland trails (Class II).



The EIS should analyze the impacts to scenic quality from effects to visibility and of impacts to the
landscape from drilling.

Recreation
BLM Scoping Questions:


How would the proposal affect recreation in the immediate and general areas?



Are there opportunities to enhance recreational opportunities in and around the project area as a
result of the proposal?

Scoping Comments:


Evaluate whether increased well densities and roads will further impact recreational use (including
hunting). If there is any potential for closing public lands near gas company facilities, address it in
the EIS.



Fragmented/shrinking habitat due to road development could increase grazing competition with
wild herds and also decrease hunting success and/or hunter numbers.



Opposition was expressed to the implied notion of having industry enhance recreational
opportunities.

A-10

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



BLM should explicitly address “unquantified environmental values” such as the value of the project
area and nearby lands for primitive and unconfined recreation and for “simple open space values.”



Map of recreational resources identifies two areas of “Citizens’ Proposed Wilderness” that
potentially affect the project area. These are associated with the Red Lake Dunes WSA and the
Adobe Town WSA.

Cultural and Historical Resources
BLM Scoping Questions:


Will there be impacts on historic and archaeological resources in the project area as a result of
development and operations?



Are there any cultural resources located in the project area that would be eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places?

Scoping Comments:


Conduct thorough archaeological studies and provide mitigation to protect paleontological, historic,
prehistoric, or cultural resources in the project area.



Give specific attention to historic trails in the area.



Give great consideration to the effects of further authorized development on visitors to historic trail
corridors.



Work with recognized experts to prevent damage to historic trail ruts, considering the economic
costs of damage.



Ensure that there is sufficient inventory of cultural resources in order to avoid resource conflicts.



BLM must pursue consultation with Native American tribes and protect native sites, and must meet
its Section 110 and Section 106 obligations and the requirements that it consult with appropriate
Native American groups.

Socioeconomics
BLM Scoping Questions:


How would populations of Sweetwater and Carbon Counties be affected by the project?



How much income to Carbon and Sweetwater Counties and the region would be generated by the
project?



How will the project affect the tax base of local government?



Will there be any impact to local social services, law enforcement, schools or other local community
services as a result of the project?



Will there be an impact on housing costs in Rawlins, Wamsutter, and other Carbon and Sweetwater
County communities as a result of the project?



What will be the impact of the project on the economies of Rawlins, Wamsutter and other
Sweetwater and Carbon County communities?

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-11

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Scoping Comments:


BLM must estimate the amount of gas that is both technically and economically recoverable.



Economically recoverable reserve estimates must include the costs of exploration, development,
production, profit, transportation costs, non-market costs, off-site mitigation costs such as increased
water treatment costs.



Please complete a marginal revenue cost analysis of estimated gas production levels. Please
compare and contrast the marginal revenues with the marginal costs for the full range of drilling
levels.



Socioeconomic impacts to surrounding communities should be assessed including labor
competition, housing demand and government expenditures.



Request that BLM’s socioeconomic assessment should follow the approaches set out in the scoping
briefs “Socioeconomic Framework for Public Land Management Planning: Indicators for the
West’s Economy” and “The Economic and Social Impacts of Oil and Gas Development.”



BLM should utilize a Total Economic Valuation Framework for evaluating proposed oils and gas
development projects.



The scope of the BLM analysis should extend beyond the surrounding areas.



BLM must recognize wilderness characteristics and other natural qualities as valuable resources that
provide multiple uses for the public.



Request that BLM fully consider the indirect role of wild lands in attracting non-recreational
businesses and retirees.



A full accounting of all hidden costs of oil and gas drilling is needed. Hidden costs include:
changes in direct use of lands within and adjacent to the analysis area,
o changes in community conditions such as air water and noise pollution,
o reductions in the value of the area for study of natural ecosystems,
o off-site environmental effects on other uses of the land,
o effects on biodiversity, effects on ecosystem services, effects on passive use.
The BLM should avoid IMPLAN or other input-output models that are grounded in economic base
theory when estimating jobs and income for each alternative. We recommend that BLM use the EPS
model developed by and available free from the Sonoran Institute.
o





The NEPA analysis should be based on reasonable (BLM) budget expectations, which should be
clearly stated and the BLM must include a fiscal analysis of alternative implementation and
mitigation costs.



To provide socioeconomic context, the BLM should examine historic trends in county income and
employment, using the Sonoran Institute Economic Profile System.



Request that the agency identify all applicable federal state and local tax laws including exceptions
and reductions and make realistic and accurate estimates of net tax revenues from oil and gas
production, based on economically recoverable reserves and including the net environmental and
community costs from drilling and production.



Estimate the socioeconomic costs to communities from oil and gas development.



Increased costs to private landowners and residents.



Increased costs to local governments.

A-12

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Economic instability and loss of economic diversity.



Estimate and evaluate the environmental costs of oil and gas development.



Bonding requirements for industry must be estimated and included in the analysis.



BLM must include an analysis of the costs of implementing each alternative, including the cost of
mitigation measures. These costs must then be contrasted with the anticipated budget levels to
assess the probability of mitigation measures being fully implemented. BLM should include a
reasonable budget limitation and evaluate a set of management alternatives that are constrained by
that budget level.



The costs of enforcement of environmental protection and mitigation requirements must be
estimated and included in the NEPA analysis.



The project specific and cumulative effects of increased costs and decreased revenues on affected
grazing operators should be assessed.



Recommend that the EIS include a full and thorough social and economic impact analysis including
impacts to livestock grazing.



The EIS should include an assessment of the potential for loss of environmental, historic and social
values associated with livestock grazing and the importance of such losses to area residents and
visitors.



BLM must address state and federal as well as local benefits associated with royalty payments and
tax revenues derived from natural gas production associated with the CD-C project.



The benefits of increased supplies of natural gas to the consumer must be analyzed and discussed.



The EIS should contain a detailed analysis of the socioeconomic impacts and positive effects of the
proposed action and alternatives for the State of Wyoming and affected counties and communities.



The local economy significance criteria should be discussed.



The EIS should consider potential project effects on local communities including housing, schools,
water and wastewater services, increased road traffic with associated dust and hazardous materials
spill potential and easier human access to wildlife habitat with associated increased potential for
wildlife disturbance. Methods to avoid or mitigate identified impacts should be discussed.



The assessment should consider the effects of reasonably foreseeable development on area
communities.

Transportation
BLM Scoping Questions:


Will motor vehicle traffic be associated with the proposed operation?



How will employees, contractors, supplies reach the site?



Will new roads need to be constructed?



How will infill development affect existing transportation systems including highways, county
roads and project area transportation?



Can transportation planning reduce and mitigate some of the impacts from further development?

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-13

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

Scoping Comments:


Evaluate likely increases in subdivisions, sale of small private tracts, permanent roads, powerlines
and fences resulting from this project, and the major negative impacts to all wildlife species in the
project area.



Generate infrastructure scenarios prior to field development, providing multiple road scenarios for
potential infrastructure. Include both generous and conservative estimates of infrastructure
construction, based on estimates of hydrocarbon resources for the field. Take particular care if
unconventional or continuous-type deposits are involved.



Reduce road density to create blocks of core habitat at a minimum distance from roads (.25 miles
for bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and mule deer). Use the Society’s landscape fragmentation metrics to
guide management decisions regarding transportation routes for other wildlife species, with the
goals of reducing road density and edge effects and increasing core areas to provide greater habitat
security.



Establish priorities and best management practices to close and reclaim roads and other routes.



Create a responsible transportation plan, incorporating detailed guidance from NEPA and FLPMA,
specifically:
Consider the environmental consequences of the proposed action based on accurate scientific
information of high quality [40 CFR 1500.1(b)], and conduct a high-quality analysis of the
information collected.
o
Take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands and
minimize adverse impacts on the natural, environmental, scientific, cultural, and other
resources and values (including fish and wildlife habitat) of the public lands involved.
(FLPMA).
o
Following selection of an alternative, continue to monitor the plan, and make appropriate
revisions to ensure it is meeting its objectives.
Use of existing roads and pipeline corridors should be maximized, and extraordinary steps taken
where new pipelines or roads cross the trails.
o




Use BMPs to locate roads, pipelines, and wells.



Include the amount of aggregate needed to support anticipated road development in the analysis.
The division is concerned about the availability of aggregate from currently permitted operations
and the possible need for new sources.

Noise
BLM Scoping Questions:


How much noise will be associated with the proposed project and what are those noise sources?



Will sound effects be audible for specific distances from certain points.



How will topography affect audibility distances?

Scoping Comments:


A-14

The environmental analysis should address issues related to noise in terms of remoteness and
quietness.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS

 MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT
Lands and Realty
BLM Scoping Questions:


What is the current and planned land use policy for the project area?



What would be the impact on local land use patterns in the project area?



How does the “checkerboard” surface ownership created by the Union Pacific Land Grant affect the
EIS analysis and possible future gas development?

Rangeland Management
BLM Scoping Questions:


How much surface area will be disturbed and for how long?



What provisions for interim reclamation will be made?



How will noxious weed populations be monitored, and controlled?

Scoping Comments:


Consider the feasibility of supplemental feeding of livestock on permitted grazing land in areas
where road construction will decrease available forage.



Fragmented/shrinking habitat due to road development could increase grazing competition with
wild herds. Consider supplemental feeding of livestock or other mitigation measures if necessary to
minimize impacts to rangeland.



The Federation supports water development projects if the water is of high quality. Produced water
could be pumped to stock ponds and reservoirs and new storage reservoirs created.



Consider impacts to rangeland for wildlife as well as domestic animals.



The scoping notice did not identify grazing or rangeland management as significant issues, and this
is a serious and disrespectful omission.



Road traffic in the Rawlins FO area has led to livestock deaths and injuries from collisions.



The introduction and growth of noxious weeds has weakened and killed livestock and crowded out
forage.



The significant increase in road dust has diminished the palatability and nourishment of forage.



Damaged cattle guards, cut fences, and unlocked gates have raised unnecessarily repair costs and
diverted labor to search for lost livestock, some of which were never found.



Loss of water from artesian and flowing wells has weakened livestock health, reduced weight gain
and available forage, induced weeds.



Reclamation has been poor, resulting in further loss of forage.



Potential conflicts should be characterized as “probable,” not “possible” as currently written.



Data from the Fremont County study conducted by the University of Wyoming should be included
in the EIS.



The BLM, grazing permittees, and proponent should work cooperatively throughout the life of the
project to make site-specific, case-by-case decisions.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-15

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Research and monitoring conducted by the operators should include movement of livestock to an
open allotment or pasture, purchase of hay in lieu of allotment use, monitoring of development
impacts, including use of the Wyoming Rangeland Monitoring Guide of August 2001, construction
of water and range improvements on either public or private land, purchase or lease of additional
grazing land to replace lands lost to grazing, and reimbursement to producers for loss of AUMs and
pastures.



Analyze the impacts of the loss of open space, scenic vistas and historic rural landscape as related to
loss of grazing lands.



The impact of this project upon food and habitat for domestic animals deserve the same study and
documentation as for fish and wildlife.



Include the positive effects of livestock grazing on the environment and as a tool to achieve
environmental objectives, and the impacts of the project on limiting the ability of livestock grazing
to achieve positive effects.



Evaluate how development of additional wells would affect distribution of livestock and feral
horses, and effects of changes to grazing on sage-grouse, mountain plover, and big game.



Address worker housing, the necessity to commute, and the resulting heavy deposition of dust on
vegetation and adjacent habitats. Evaluate and mitigate negative effects and loss of AUM’s/wildlife
forage.

Areas of Critical Environmental Concern


Give priority to the designation and protection of ACECs for wildlife.



Designate ACECs in areas of crucial winter range and at pinch points of migration routes, with
management prescriptions that include no creation of new routes or expansion of existing routes, no
new leasing unless designated NSO, no new energy development, no cross-country travel, limitation
of off-road vehicles to designated routes, and closure of unnecessary routes.



Red Lake Dunes and Chain Lakes proposed ACEC should be withdrawn from drilling

Wilderness


Wilderness characteristics and other natural qualities must be recognized as a valuable resource.

General and Administrative Issues


BLM should not approve the project prior to revision of the Rawlins RMP so that the project can be
pursued under the framework of an updated RMP.



The Rawlins Field Office (RFO) is preparing a revision to its RMP that will assess options for
preservation of migration corridors and environmentally sensitive areas, including new technologies
and other impact-reducing measures. A revised scoping notice for Creston/Blue Gap II removed the
requirement that the RMP be complete before a decision is issued for C/BGII; this violates the
NEPA process and will delay implementation of RMP decisions, likely allowing more lenient
mitigation measures for C/BGII.



The proponent is bound by stipulations in the Great Divide Resource Management Plan, and in
future by the Rawlins Resource Management Plan.

A-16

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



The ROD for this EIS will be held up indefinitely because of delays in preparation of the Rawlins
RMP FEIS.



It is unwise to combine the Creston-Blue Gap and Continental Divide projects because one is an
infill project in a largely industrial area and the other includes vast stretches of undeveloped lands.



This proposal is consistent with the Energy Policy Act of 2005.



Comment indicated concerns regarding multiple-well EAs/EISs.



Include PacifiCorp in the process to ensure that their rights to site, construct, operate, and maintain
their facilities are considered and protected.



Work cooperatively with Wyoming Game and Fish, local government, and non-government
organizations



Grant the Alliance for Historic Wyoming “interested party” status for Section 106 procedures for
this EIS.



Hold multiple public hearings.



Judging from the list of issues, concerns, and opportunities issued by BLM to date, we are
destroying what makes Wyoming Wyoming.



Endless pollution from drilling has cost $70 million in cleanup costs to taxpayers



No drilling should be allowed on BLM land unless an insurance policy bond is posted for cleanup
costs



The entire American public is skeptical of our energy policy and secret meetings.



The rate of development in the eastern Red Desert is completely out of control, following on the
heels of Atlantic Rim and soon to be followed by Continental Divide.



Increased gas supplies from this area, as well as Wamsutter, will be necessary within the next two
years to ensure that the Kinder-Morgan/Sempra pipeline to Ohio carries Wyoming gas rather than
from other states.



The writers support the project and development of the EIS.

Scoping and Approach


BLM should define the scope of the environmental analysis to include analysis of the cumulative
effects of actions/projects that have impacts in common with those resulting from natural gas
development.



BLM should consider, analyze, and wherever appropriate, facilitate, international efforts to prevent
environmental decline.



BLM cannot define the purpose and need for the project as just to allow natural gas to be developed;
it must also include strong environmental protections as at least a co-equal purpose and need.



BLM must establish the baseline condition or all resources in the area in order to evaluate
environmental conditions and impacts in an informed manner.



Require incorporation of all NEPA policies and goals



BLM should “infuse” the goals and policies of the National Environmental Policy Act into the
environmental review and decision document.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-17

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Generate landscape metrics for all infrastructure, including density, infrastructure effect zones, and
core areas. Metric parameters and evaluation of results should be relevant to ecological conditions,
species present, and human use of the landscape. Integrate results into management plans,



We urge BLM to require that development activities not cause unnecessary or undue degradation.



Notify all lessees of their responsibility to comply with federal and other applications regardless of
land or mineral ownership.



If BLM, surface owners, and lessees agree, non-BLM lands can be included in section 7
consultation on federal lands.



Specific management actions like the proposed project must be done pursuant to multiple use and
sustained yield principles.



The environmental analysis and decision document should emphasize resource and ecosystem
protection, which will best ensure that future options are retained.



No new project area disturbance should commence prior to completion of formal consultation under
Section 7 of the ESA, preparation of a BA.



Trade approved APDs for a new APD.



Provide access to State mineral leases.



Continue development on fee lands when access across adjoining BLM-administered land has
already been approved.



Permit rights-of-way (pipelines) for previously approved projects.



Suspend operations on undeveloped federal leases.



Permit drainage wells for Federal minerals on a case-by-case basis.



If surface disturbance and other impacts can be shown to be below that analyzed in the EIS,
additional wells may be permitted. If reclamation activities can result in reduced surface impacts to
a point below that analyzed in the EIS, additional wells may be permitted.



Set a schedule for completion of the EIS and adhere to it, identifying and explaining the reason for
any delays to the National Energy Policy Office.



Analysis completed for previous projects in this area will provide opportunities to reduce the time
and cost required to prepared this EIS. Analysis from other documents should not be duplicated.



Analyze the impacts associated with the proposed action only.



Honor the MOU with the Wyoming State Land Office concerning access to state lands and honor
private property rights. Make a statement in the EIS addressing BLM’s right to restrict access to
private lands beyond a customary 30-day right-of-way application period.



Consult with and use BLM’s Reservoir Management Group to assess the requirements to adequately
drain natural resources and prevent waste.



Planned or phased development of the area is not feasible unless one operator controls leases on the
entire area because it could create a taking by BLM through restriction of development of a
leasehold.



Consider cumulative impacts of this and other area projects.



A cumulative impact analysis is recommended examining regional effects to the area including
South Baggs, Atlantic Rim, Desolation Flats, Pacific Rim, Table Rock, and Vermillion Creek
natural gas fields, and the Black Butte Mine.

A-18

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



A landscape-level analysis should consider direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of this larger
combined project.



Consider adhering to multiple use under FLPMA.



Use drilling rigs powered by electricity, natural gas, or biodiesel rather than conventional diesel.



Overall comments focus on harmonious, coordinated resource management that considers the
relative values of resources.



Any development should be slow and should only occur after reclamation of existing disturbances.



Development in Wamsutter makes it that much more important to protect remaining pristine
landscapes like Adobe Town, Jack Morrow Hills, and Wild Cow Creek.



No drilling should be allowed the eastern Red Desert



No coalbed methane development due to as-yet unknown long-term consequences



All support facilities (roads, power lines, pipelines, and well site facilities) should be included in the
APD and Sundry Notice permit process.



New categorical exclusions can only be legally utilized following an analysis of whether
extraordinary circumstances (per NEPA, the ESA, NHPA, etc.) may prevent their application.



The NEPA analysis should be based on reasonable budget expectations to ensure that mitigation
measures and resource protection will be funded, and BLM should include a fiscal analysis of
alternative implementation and mitigation costs.



Given their stewardship responsibilities, governments should encourage or undertake activities that
protect the environment and discourage or prohibit those that do not. It is also appropriate for
government to own and use land and water resources to protect the environment and to support
others in doing the same.



Government should continually seek to improve the efficiency of its environmental and resource
management programs without compromising its responsibilities (a mixture of regulations,
incentives, and public ownership of resources). It should aim to bring about as high a level of
environmental quality for a given expenditure.

Alternatives Development


IM 2005-047 provides guidance for NEPA compliance in oil and gas that supports the Energy
Policy Act of 2005 and may not be valid under existing law. Specific concerns include the
development of alternatives that increase/accelerate development and use of new categorical
exclusions.



We ask that at least one alternative fully explore phased development and directional drilling to the
maximum extent possible.



Consider an alternative that would only allow minimal surface disturbance.



We ask BLM to consider an alternative that would only allow development to occur from existing
oil and gas well pads, with maximum use being made of directional drilling technologies.



Similarly, we ask BLM to consider an alternative that would not allow for any additional road
construction.



APDs that have expired will not be extended so that pending APDs may be permitted.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

A-19

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Alternatives must consider geological, technical, and other issues such as correlative and leasehold
rights.



Any constraints in the alternatives should also evaluate the additional difficulties they may generate.

Directional Drilling


Directionally drill wells from existing well pads



Evaluate the effect of intense development and high-density gas wells on the Department’s
management of Chain Lakes Wildlife Habitat Management Area, including the feasibility of using
directional drilling in wetlands and sensitive areas associated with the lakes and use of artificial
pads or pontoons to access development sites.



Directional drilling is appropriate in some areas but should not be mandated for areas where it is not
appropriate. Because it increases both cost and risk, directional drilling should be considered only at
the site-specific analysis level.



Use directional drilling and cluster up to 32 wells per pad and avoid intrusion into sensitive wildlife
habitats.



At the very least, directional drilling using 32 wells per pad should be required.



Require the industry to cluster wells, up to 64 per pad, to minimize surface impacts.



If directional drilling is to be allowed, why not specify it as the preferred method of extraction? It is
a proven, economical technology that minimizes damage.



If directional drilling is not considered a “reasonable alternative” please be specific as to the
meaning of that phrase in the context of the project and its environmental impacts.



Multiple wells should be drilled at a single location when feasible, and wildlife disturbance
minimized (e.g. by automated pumping facilities).



Include mitigation such as directional drilling and BMPs in all alternatives.



Require directional drilling and cluster development



Address the potential for directional drilling to minimize habitat fragmentation;



Directional drilling should be used to access subsurface gas leases from outside the NSO area.

Mitigation and Monitoring


Mitigation plans should include goals and objectives, methodologies, time frames for
implementation, success criteria, monitoring, and a contingency plan if unsuccessful.



Apply a standard NSO stipulation to all riparian zones and a 500-ft corridor from the outermost
limit of the riparian habitat.



During pipeline construction, avoid stripping riparian canopy or stream bank vegetation if possible.
Crush or shear streamside woody vegetation rather than completely removing it. Revegetate
immediately after stream bank crossings are completed.



BLM must ensure that the impacts of any coalbed methane development are mitigated.



Address the exception process for seasonal wildlife stipulations, which are expected to be numerous
on a project this size. Note that additional data needed to accommodate industry requests should be
funded by industry.

A-20

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



Consider lease and development stipulations to protect critically important wildlife and their
habitats.



Consult with Wyoming Fish and Game and USFWS early in the process to protect critical habitat.



Discuss and evaluate monitoring data from existing gas development before developing habitat
protection strategies and mitigation measures.



Establish zones of habitat protection of areas of high wildlife value and develop habitat
improvement needs in other areas.



With regard to wildlife habitat fragmentation:
Develop a transportation plan to reduce access roads and traffic.
Bury power lines within the right-of-way to avoid impacts to raptors and other bird species.
o Power generators by natural gas to reduce toxic emissions, and fit compressors with highquality mufflers to keep noise to a minimum
o Enforce any commitments agreed to by operators during the APD.
Establish seasonal stipulations on development and production activities in big game habitats, and
treatment or modification of remaining habitat or intervening fences to increase the amount or value
of crucial winter habitat.
o
o





Address mitigation for short-term and long-term impacts to habitat, and exclusion of waivers for
wildlife habitat mitigation.



Develop and implement route closure and reclamation plans to restore and maintain critical biggame habitat and linkages:
o
o

o
o
o

o

Mule deer: increase the amount of core area greater than 1,542 feet from route within crucial
winter range and along migration corridors.
Pronghorn: Increase the amount of core area greater than 3,168 feet from a route and reduce
route densities below one mile per square mile within crucial winter range and along migration
corridors.
Elk: Reduce route densities below one mile per square mile within crucial winter range and
along migration corridors.
Prohibit drilling and surface occupancy in big-game wintering areas between November 5 and
April 30
Implement seasonal traffic restrictions on all roads within 656 feet of Sage-grouse winter
habitat (9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., mid-November through March) within 3 miles of breeding and
nesting areas (9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., March through mid-May), and in brood-rearing areas
(900 a.m. to 5:3 p.m., June through mid-July). Impose a speed limit of 30 miles per hour during
non-restricted hours.
Combine these species-specific recommendations with more general provisions to benefit all
wildlife species in the area such as:
 planning for staged development of energy resources


restricting new roads and energy development, especially within crucial winter range and at
pinch points of migration routes



allowing few exceptions to temporary occupancy restrictions



imposing rigorous standards for ecological restoration of closed routes



for all new roads that are built, following the road construction guidelines of the Wyoming
Game and Fish Department to minimize the effect of routes on wildlife

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX A—SUMMARY OF SCOPING COMMENTS



including clear enforcement mechanisms to minimize impacts to wildlife



continuing to research the effects of the transportation network on wildlife species and
using this knowledge in adaptive management.



Develop a clearly defined management plan to protect the grouse population and monitor the
success of on-site and off-site mitigation.



Recommend NSO designation for Sage-grouse breeding habitat between March 1 and June 30
annually and no project-related disturbance from November 15 through March 14.



Require NSO protections within miles of Sage-grouse breeding leks.



Consider noise mitigation alternatives such as seasonal timing stipulations, or modifying or
enclosing compressors to minimize or eliminate loud, continuous noise during strutting periods
from March 1 through May 20 each year. Avoid noise-generating activities from 6 PM to 9 AM
within 2 miles of strutting grounds.



Average nose mitigation levels should be attained no more than 200 meters from the noise source.



Mitigation should include a 1¼-mile protection buffer and a 2-mile seasonal protection for the
duration of the breeding season.



Identify mitigation to protect nest sites and nesting pairs. Consider construction of artificial nesting
poles.



Include “no fencing” mitigation for roads and facilities that block pronghorn migration. Consider
the possibility that pronghorn will trail along plowed access roads during periods of deep snow, and
consider plowing escape ramps off roadways.



Maintenance personnel should visit wells at midday to reduce harassment when seasonal
stipulations are in effect.



Establish mitigation to prevent exceedance of average noise standards so that courtship season is not
disrupted.



The EIS must address:



the extent and mitigation required for sagebrush habitat;
o the mitigation standards for crucial winter range;
o the use of 1-mile buffers around ferruginous hawk nest sites and burrowing owl nests;
o implementation of a conservation community “blueprint” for Sage-grouse and Sage-grouse
habitat throughout the project area;
Screens should be fitted to burners on production facilities to prevent songbird deaths
o



The overall scale of the project makes serious adverse impacts inevitable for wildlife, fisheries, and
recreational opportunities. The following restrictions are requested on all development in the project
area:
o
o
o
o
o
o

A-22

A minimum of 95-percent flareless completion on all wells

Dust abatement
A minimum 3:1 ratio for off-site mitigation work to compensate for habitat fragmentation
Reclamation with a forb/shrub mixture consisting of native plants and grasses, rather than the
BLM grass mixture.



Monitor and analyze habitats surrounding the project area to reevaluate habitat protections such as
the width of buffer zones, to provide suitable habitat as development proceeds.



Incorporate wildlife monitoring and research projects, funded by the operators.



Apply any stipulations only where least restrictive and absolutely essential, and then only after they
have been peer reviewed.



COAs for directional drilling in sensitive areas should require BMPs in accordance with IMI2005­
247 and IM2004-194, and the Gold Book, including but not limited to:
ACECs
o lands with wilderness characteristics and sensitive or important wildlife habitat
o closed-loop (pitless) drilling to help protect soils and water
o requiring maximum use of existing roads
o drilling multiple wells from a single pad

o noise reduction techniques and designs
o wildlife monitoring
o interim restoration to ensure lands are returned to their natural condition as soon as possible.
o Collect baseline data and fund long-term monitoring.
The Red Lakes Dunes citizen-proposed wilderness and other lands with wilderness characteristics
should be inventoried and protected using VRM Class I or II designation, NSO limitations, and
application of other BMPs.
o





Include an aggressive noxious/invasive species control program (to protect forage).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

INTRODUCTION
The Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) Operators submitted their Plan of Development (POD) for the
CD-C project to the BLM in September 2006. The POD was subsequently revised in late 2007 to reflect a
reduction in plans for coalbed natural gas (CBNG) development within the project area. The original POD
had said that potentially 500 to 900 of the proposed 8,950 wells could be CBNG wells. The 2007 revision
reduced that amount to “up to 500” CBNG wells. The 2007 version of the POD is the one reproduced in
this appendix.
Since the submittal of the revised 2007 POD, other changes and clarifications have been made to the
Operators’ development plans. Although no formal revision of the POD has been made, the changes have
been incorporated into Section 2.2.1 of the CD-C Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), The Proposed
Action. The changes were most often made because of advances in drilling technology since the project
was originally proposed or because the analysis of project impacts necessitated a more detailed definition
of the Operators’ plans to adequately assess the effects. The changes occurred over the five years between
2007 and 2012 and were generally evolutionary in the way they developed, with frequent emails and
phone conversations discussing the changes before a decision was made to alter the development
proposal.
The Operators have agreed that the following descriptions of those changes and clarifications accurately
reflect their intent and the POD is hereby amended as follows:
1. Number of days required to drill a well. The POD said that drilling each gas well “will take about
10 to 20 days” and that completion and testing operations typically will “require approximately 10
to 20 (up to 30) days.” Given the improvements in drilling technology, the drilling time for each gas
well, as described in Section 2.2.1.2 of the EIS, Drilling and Completion, has been reduced to
“about 7 to 10 days.” The description of the time for completion and testing operations has been
changed to “approximately 10 to 20 days.”
2. Number of drill rigs active in the project area. The POD anticipated that the number of rigs
necessary to achieve development objectives “will range from about 34 to 70 rigs at any particular
time.” As described in Section 2.2.1.2, Drilling and Completion, the Operators have reduced that
count to “up to 25 rigs at any particular time,” largely because the time needed to drill a well has
decreased.
3. Compression and gas treatment facilities. The Operators estimated in the POD that “one large
central pipeline compression facility” may be required for the project and that “as many as ten
additional compressor sites” and “ individual well site compression” as needed would be added to the
existing infrastructure. They also said that “Compression requirements and associated horsepower
estimates will be developed in association with the air quality analysis.” In addition, “It is anticipated
that two or more central gas processing/stabilization facilities will be needed.”
After considerable analysis and discussion, rather than trying to estimate the breakdown between
the number, type, and size of compression facilities that would be needed, the Operators
summarized compression needs in a single metric, the total amount of horsepower (hp) that would
be required for future production. Section 2.2.1.5 of the CD-C EIS, Compression, Gas Treatment,
and Ancillary Facilities, now states that an estimated 24,936 hp of additional compression may be
needed as the project is developed for dedicated compressor sites and for additional compression at
well sites.
In addition, the number of new central gas-processing/stabilization facilities has been reduced from
two to one.

4. Sources of water used for project development. The POD describes the use of approximately
20,000 to 30,000 barrels of water per well for drilling operations (Section 4-1 of the POD),
approximately 4,000 to 12,000 barrels of water for completion and testing operations (Section 4-4),
and approximately 2,700 gallons of water to test each mile of four-inch gas pipeline (Section 5-2).
This “water will come from existing and new water supply wells within the project area, as well as
from produced water sources which will conserve fresh water aquifers. . . .Water from reserve pits
may be transferred and used for drilling.” (Section 4-1)
The POD does not mention the use of any surface water and subsequent discussions with the
Operators indicated that it was their intention that the statements in the POD were meant to exclude
the use of any surface water.
5. Use of fresh water. Section 4-1 of the POD states, “Fresh water will used for drilling the first 5,000
to 7,000 feet of each gas well” and then references other uses of fresh water, including in Section 44, Completions and Testing. The Operators have clarified that only fresh water can be used when
drilling surface casing by regulation. However, other processes may not involve the use of fresh
water but rather the re-use/recycling of water depending on the quality of that water and the planned
use and regulatory requirements.
6. Disposal of produced water from CBNG wells. Section 5.4 of the POD describes the process for
disposal of produced water from CBNG wells, water that could be produced in volumes of 500–
1,000 barrels per day per well. The volume of water produced in CBNG development is normally
much greater than the amounts produced with conventional gas production. CBNG-produced water
might “be stored on-site in a lined pit or storage tank, or water-collection lines might be installed to
transport water to a water-treatment facility, evaporation ponds, injection wells, subsurface drip
areas and/or approved discharge points.” The actual volumes produced and the methods by which
the produced water would be managed are greatly dependent on the site-specific development
proposals. For that reason, the BLM decided that although the POD for the CD-C project described
the potential for surface discharge of CBNG-produced water, such disposal for any CBNG
development within the CD-C project would be treated in a separate NEPA analysis. When the
BLM receives site-specific CBNG proposals in the CD-C project area, the proposals, including the
treatment of produced water, will be analyzed in a separate NEPA document at that time.
7. Disposal of produced water from conventional wells. Section 5.4 of the POD also describes the
process for disposal of produced water from conventional wells, water that would be produced
averaging 18 barrels per day per well. This water would be “disposed of via subsurface injection,
surface evaporative pits, or will be used for potential beneficial use (i.e. drilling operations).” The
POD does not mention the surface discharge of water produced from conventional drilling.
Subsequent discussions with the Operators clarified that the statements in the POD were meant to
indicate that the Operators had no plans for the surface discharge of produced water from
conventional wells as a method of disposal.
8. Water used for dust abatement. The POD does not specifically describe the process of dust
abatement, how much water might be used in the process, or where the dust abatement water would
be sourced. Discussions with the Operators clarified that the 20,000 to 30,000 barrels of water per
well for drilling operations described in Section 4-1 would include all water used for dust
abatement. As described in Item 4 above, none of that water would come from surface sources.

1.1

PROJECT OVERVIEW

BP America Production Company and other operators (identified herein as the “Operators”) propose to
develop natural-gas resources within the existing Continental Divide and Creston Blue Gap natural gas
fields, located in Carbon and Sweetwater counties, Wyoming. The project, known as the Continental
Divide-Creston Natural-Gas Development Project, involves approximately 1.1 million acres in an area
with a “checkerboard” pattern of surface ownership. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the State
of Wyoming, and private owners issued the oil and gas leases covering these lands. The Rawlins Field
Office (RFO) manages BLM surface lands and the federal mineral estate in the Project Area, which is
shown on Figure 1.
Oil and gas extraction in the Project Area is guided by relevant programmatic NEPA actions including the
Great Divide Resource Management Plan (1990), and the decisions made in applicable project-specific
BLM NEPA documents, including the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II Natural Gas Project and the
Creston/Blue Gap Natural Gas Project. The BLM operates in accordance with the Federal Land Policy
and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), which mandates that the BLM consider multiple uses for the
lands it administers. FLPMA specifies that the BLM consider the land’s inherent natural resources as well
as its mineral resources when making land management decisions. The BLM’s responsibility extends to
environmental protection, public health, and safety associated with oil and gas operations on public lands.
Mineral leasing decisions made by the BLM result in a contractual commitment from the United States to
allow for exploration, development, and operations by the Operators in accordance with stipulations and
restrictions incorporated within its leases. Lease rights include the right to occupy and use as much of the
surface as is reasonably necessary to explore, develop, operate, and produce the subsurface oil and gas
resources. The Operators understand that the decision that will result from NEPA analysis of this
proposed project will pertain only to those areas in the Project Area where there are federal surface and/or
federal minerals. The Operators recognize that the State of Wyoming and other local governmental
agencies also have authority over various aspects of oil and gas development in all or portions of the
Project Area.
Collectively, the Operators propose to drill approximately 8,950 wells in addition to the wells that
currently exist in the Project Area. Up to 500 of the proposed wells could be coalbed natural gas (CBNG)
wells. The Operators anticipate drilling infill wells at potentially up to 40 acres per downhole well bore.
The Project Area contains several units in addition to non-unitized lands. The total number of wells
drilled will depend largely on factors outside of the Operators’ control that affect the ability to adequately
drain the reservoir, including geologic characteristics and reservoir quality, appropriate engineering
technology, economic factors, commodity prices, availability of commodity markets, and lease
stipulations and restrictions.
Based on current reservoir and well performance information, most gas wells will be completed in the
Almond Formation (Mesa Verde Group); however, secondary reserves may be encountered in other
formations (e.g. Lewis, etc.) for the natural gas wells. The CBNG development will primarily target
formations such as the Fort Union (Big Red Coal) and secondary reserves may be encountered primarily
in the Wasatch, Frontier, and Lance formations.
This proposal assumes that the gas wells may be drilled conventionally, i.e., with a vertical well bore on a
single pad, or with multiple directional well bores from a single pad. The gas resource is primarily
conventional natural gas, however, the project also includes development of CBNG. Directional drilling is
not being proposed by the CBNG operators. All proposed wells are anticipated to be drilled during an
approximate 10 to 15 year period after project approval. Although actual operations are subject to change
as conditions warrant, the Operators’ long-term plan of development is to drill additional wells at the rate of
approximately 600 wells per year or until the resource base is fully developed. The average life of a well is
expected to be 30 to 40 years for both the conventional gas and CBNG development.

The facilities required by the project may include roads, gas, water, and condensate gathering pipelines,
overhead and buried powerlines, production facilities (separation, metering, treating, fluid storage,
compression, artificial lift, etc.), disposal well and/or surface disposal facilities, equipment storage
facilities,and other associated facilities. In general, gas will be transported via subsurface pipeline to
centralized compression and treatment facilities although some well site compression may be included on an
as-needed basis. Produced water will be transported by truck to water disposal wells or evaporation ponds,
or by pipeline to treatment facilities and/or discharge points. CBNG development may require the use of
various water management alternatives, which include but are not limited to; deep injection, evaporation
ponds, water treatment (such as freeze thaw evaporation, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, etc), direct
discharge, and sub-surface drip irrigation.
Project development will result in the use of new roads and roads previously constructed and currently
used in the Project Area. New roads are expected to consist primarily of short access roads. Existing
arterial roads will provide the main access to the Project Area. The project may also include the
development of an overhead electrical system to provide commercial power to portions of the field, as
well as lower voltage, buried power utilities to individual well pads. The overhead system is estimated to
include approximately 36 miles of line. The construction disturbance width would be up to 25 feet. The
overhead system would primarily follow existing road corridors and utility ROWs. The buried power
utility to individual wells would be the responsibility of the Operators, and would be installed in the
utility corridor adjacent to the well pad access road
The Project Area includes approximately 1.1 million acres of mixed federal, state, and private lands. The
BLM manages approximately 626,355 acres (59%), the State of Wyoming owns approximately 21,600
acres (2%), and private landowners own approximately 421,360 acres (39%). The Project Area is
generally located within Townships 14 through 24 North, Ranges 91 through 97 West, 6th Principal
Meridian. The eastern boundary of the Project Area is about 25 air miles west of the city of Rawlins.
Interstate 80 generally crosses through the center of the Project Area.

1.2

SUMMARY OF SURFACE DISTURBANCE

The Operators estimated projected surface disturbance using assumptions based on past experience and
anticipated activities. A summary of the estimated project-related disturbance is shown in Table 1.
Project development will result in disturbance to the federal, state, and private lands upon which the
project wells will be drilled. Disturbance of the land will result from the construction and use of new
roads, the construction of well pads, the installation of subsurface pipelines, and the construction or
expansion of compressor facility sites or other associated facilities. Short-term disturbance refers to initial
disturbance prior to interim reclamation of the reserve pits, unused portions of the location and roads, and
reclamation of the pipeline route. Long-term disturbance refers to disturbance of the surface associated
with the life of a well in addition to the running surface of access roads.
For analysis purposes, the following assumptions were made:


Average access road length will be 0.25 mile.



Road disturbance width will be 55 feet, reclaimed to a running surface of 32 feet. Permanent road
right-of-way is typically 50 feet.



Initial disturbance associated with each well will average approximately 6.3 acres for single well pads,
and 2.45 acres per well bore for multiple well pads. This acreage includes the associated road
disturbance. The actual acreage per well bore on multi-well pads will vary based on the number of wells
bores on the pad.



Long-term disturbance associated with each well pad will be approximately 2.6 acres for single wells
and 1.2 acres per well bore for multiple well pads. This acreage also includes the associated road
disturbance.



Average gas gathering pipeline length will be 0.25 mile.



An average width of 25 feet will be physically impacted by utility construction, including gas, water
pipelines, and power, which will be totally reclaimed after construction. Utility ROWs will be built
adjacent to roads wherever possible and practicable. Operators may utilize a construction corridor of
up to 75’ for utility installation dependent on the specifics of a given location. These corridors will be
addressed in the ROW and/or APD filing procedure.



The overhead electrical system would be approximately 36 miles long, and have a construction
disturbance width of up to 25 feet.

CBNG well pads have a smaller footprint than conventional wells, however, the acres of disturbance
shown in Table 1 was calculated using conventional well pad dimensions due to the relatively small
percentage of CBNG wells, and because the potential number of CBNG wells cannot be well defined at
this stage of project development. CBNG well pads average about 3.8 acres during initial disturbance and
1.25 acres during operations.
Average access road length was estimated by taking into account that the proposed wells will be infill
wells in an area that has an existing road system. Operators will be using the Transportation Plan to
minimize construction of new roads; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that most new access roads will
be constructed as laterals off existing roads. Consequently, the average new access road length was
estimated at 0.25 mile.
The Operators intend to construct and install pipelines adjacent to well access roads, however, it will be
necessary to construct a pipeline route cross-country at some locations. Pipeline routes will be reclaimed
after construction such that all surface disturbances resulting from pipeline construction will be short-term
disturbance. Long-term disturbance associated with pipeline construction is expected to be very minimal
after reclamation is complete.

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

The Operators will continue to limit long-term surface disturbance as much as possible through the
implementation of a road network that minimizes the construction of new access roads and by reclaiming as
much of the short term disturbance associated with roads and locations as is reasonable without limiting the
requirements for ongoing and future production operations.

This table represents the total area estimated to be disturbed at the Continental Divide –
Creston Development Project during its 15-year construction and 30 to 40 year operational life.
The initial disturbance represents the area disturbed as a result of drilling and associated construction of well pad
sites, roads, gas, condensate, and water collection pipelines, compressor stations, and power supply systems.
Following drilling and associated construction, part of the initial disturbance will be reclaimed. The area not
reclaimed will be used for operations. Once the gas resource is extracted, facilities will be removed and the area
reclaimed entirely.
An estimated 8,950 natural gas well bores will be established in the project area.
Initial (Short Term) Disturbance Area: The initial well pad site disturbance for a vertical well will average 6.30 acres
per well pad site which includes 0.9 of an acre for an access road. The initial disturbance for a directional well will
average 2.45 acres per well bore completed including 0.45 acres for an access road (assumed 50% of the
directional wells will need a new access road).
Area of Operations (Long Term Disturbance Area): Following drilling and well installation, reclamation will reduce
the vertical well pad sites to approximately 2.6 acres which includes 0.9 of an acre for a road. Following reclamation,
the long-term disturbance for directional wells is estimated at 1.2 acres per well bore which includes 0.45 acres for
an access road (assumed 50% of the directional wells will need a new road).
Utilities include gas, condensate, and water collection pipelines, as well as buried powerline facilities. Generally,
these utilities will parallel the access roads. An average width of 25 feet will be physically affected by the installation
of utilities. Actual utility corridor construction width will vary by operator and site conditions. Assuming 0.25 miles of
utility installation for a well pad site, an estimated 0.75 acres will be disturbed with utility installation for the well pad
sites. Overhead power includes an estimated 36 miles of line, requiring a 25-foot wide construction corridor.
Water Management Facilities – water will be handled using a combination of evaporation ponds, enhanced
evaporation, water treatment, and injection wells. An estimated 30 injection wells affecting an estimated 5 acre per
well and an estimated 20 produced water handling facilities are planned affecting an estimated 3.5 acres per facility.
An estimated 1-acre will be disturbed per site for access roads.
It is assumed that one central pipeline compression facility, estimated to affect approximately 10 acres, will be
required for the project. It is assumed that 10 additional compressor stations will be required for the project. An
estimated five acres will be physically affected at each compressor station site. Each compression site will require
an access road assuming 32 feet width for ½ mile estimated disturbance of 2 acres per road per site.
It is assumed that two or more central Gas Processing/Stabilization Plants will be needed within the Project Area.
Each is estimated to affect approximately 30 acres. Each site will require a ½ mile access road estimated at 2 acres
disturbance.
This percentage is based on the 1.1 million acres within the EIS analysis area.
Once buried utilities are constructed, the disturbed area will be reclaimed in its entirety. Overhead powerlines will
require a 10-foot wide permanent corridor.

Pre-Construction and Site Layout

Activities associated with the development may include access roads, pipeline and well pad construction,
drilling and well completion, and any other ancillary facilities needed to develop the particular phase.
Prior to the start of any construction activities involving a federal action on BLM managed public land,
Operators will submit a site specific APD/Notice of Staking (NOS)/ROW application to the BLM that
will detail the development proposal. The application will include a map showing the specific location of
the proposed activities and site-specific construction plans. A Plan of Development (POD) may be
submitted for multiple wells within the same area for CBNG.
The proposed development sites will be staked in the field by the applicant and inspected by the BLM to
ensure consistency with the application. The appropriate NEPA documentation will be conducted to
ensure that the proposal will comply with guidelines contained in the BLM’s Rawlins Resource
Management Plan (RMP) 2008, specific requirements contained in the EIS/Record of Decision for the
project, and current BLM policy regarding oil and gas development.
Applications may be revised as necessary per discussions with BLM. The BLM may approve or deny
site-specific proposals, and will attach any terms or conditions of approval to the permit. Upon receipt of
BLM approval, the applicant can commence with proposed activities.

Construction Activities

3.1

ROADS

Since the project is an infill development in an existing well field, new road construction is not expected
to be extensive. The primary access to the project area is Interstate 80. Wyoming State Highway 789,
several Sweetwater and Carbon county roads, and other smaller local roads provide access within the
project area. New road construction will primarily be short sections of road from the existing road
network to the individual new well sites and support facilities. Some existing access roads may need to
have some improvements to accommodate the increase in traffic and heavy construction equipment such
as widening or gravelling.
The exact locations of proposed roads are not known at this time. Specific locations for access roads will
be included in APD and ROW applications, and will be evaluated by the BLM during the onsite
inspections. Road construction will be in accordance with guidelines specified in the BLM Road
Standards Manual, Section 9113, and with construction standards in its Surface Operating Standards for
Oil and Gas Exploration and Development (BLM Gold Book, revised 2006).
The construction width for access roads will typically be 55 feet. Standard cut and fill construction
techniques will be used. Roads are usually crowned and ditched except where an operator or the BLM
determine that the road can safely be constructed using less disruptive techniques. The permanent running
width will not exceed 32 feet. Existing roads that require upgrading will meet standards appropriate to the
anticipated traffic flow and all-weather requirements. Upgrading may include ditching, drainage,
graveling, crowning, and capping the roadbed as necessary to provide a safe roadway. Maintenance
practices may include dust abatement, road surface grading, and maintaining proper drainage. New roads
may be graveled to accommodate year-round use, to allow the transport of heavy loads, and to minimize
dust generation. Two-track roads may be constructed or utilized in some instances for access to smaller
facilities. Access roads are planned to be reclaimed when no longer needed, unless the landowner or the
BLM requests otherwise.
3.2

WELL PADS

The project will include the construction of 8,950 well bores from both single well pads and well pads
with multiple directional well bores. Construction of a typical single well pad will require approximately
6.3 acres which includes 0.9 acres for an access road. A typical multiple well pad will disturb
approximately 2.45 acres per well bore, which includes 0.45 acres for an access road. Figures 2 through 6
show examples of typical single and multiple well pads. Well pad layouts will vary between operators,
but all will be constructed within the approved disturbance area.
Operators will determine the location of a proposed well by the location of the subsurface reservoir, the
topography of the area, and WOGCC spacing rules. Dimensions of a drill pad will depend on topography
and specific well needs. Well pads will be constructed using the native sand/soil/rock materials present.
Mineral materials will not be required. Topsoil and native vegetation will be removed and stockpiled for
use in the reclamation process. Balancing cut and fill areas will level locations. Construction practices may
include ripping to achieve a level pad. Cut-and-fill slopes will be designed to allow for retention of the
topsoil during reclamation and subsequent re-establishment of vegetation.

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

Typically a well pad will include a six to eight-foot wide cellar to allow access to casing heads, mouse
and rat holes adjacent to the well bore to accommodate drilling operations, a flare or completion pit, and a
reserve pit. A fenced reserve pit, approximately 10 to 12 feet deep, will be excavated within the pad to
temporarily store drilling fluids and cuttings. The dimensions of the pit vary according to well depth and
size and shape of location. In non-environmentally sensitive areas and when a fresh water-based drilling
mud is used, the reserve pit may be unlined pending evaluation of the distance to surface water, depth to
useable ground water, soil type and permeability, and anticipated types of fluids that will be contained in the
pit. A reserve pit will be lined if so specified in the APD after the onsite evaluation. It will also be
constructed in a way that minimizes the accumulation of surface runoff into the pit through the use of
strategically placed subsoil/topsoil storage areas and/or the construction of berms and diversion ditches.
Both the access road and well pad are typically constructed within three to seven days, depending on terrain
and site limitations. Depending on availability of equipment and specific well construction requirements,
from two to eight individuals may be present on location during construction activities at any given time.
Personnel will access the location using an average of 3 to 5 light trucks each day during construction of the
access and well pad. Construction equipment varies but can include bulldozers, motor graders, scrapers,
backhoes, and trenchers.
During operations, interim reclamation will reduce the size of the well pads to approximately 2.6 acres for
a single well pad and to 1.2 acres per well bore for multiple well pads.

Drilling and Completions

4.1

DRILLING

Drilling operations will be conducted in compliance with all Federal Oil and Gas Onshore Orders, all
WOGCC rules and regulations, and all applicable local rules and regulations. The Operators anticipate
that the drilling rig count within the Project Area will range from about 34 to 70 rigs at any particular time
in order to achieve development objectives.
Following construction of the access road and well pad, a drilling rig will be transported to the well site
and erected on the well pad. Wells will be drilled utilizing a conventional, mechanically powered mobile
drilling rig. The rig will be erected at the drill site after the conductor pipe has been set. Drilling
operations will consist of drilling surface hole, running and cementing surface casing, drilling production
hole, and running and cementing production casing. The rig may then be dismantled and demobilized
from the location.
Fresh water will used for drilling the first 5,000 to 7,000 feet of each gas well (500 to 1000 feet for each
CBNG well), and water-based muds being used for the remainder of the drilling operation. Water will
come from existing and new water supply wells within the project area, as well as from produced water
sources which will conserve fresh-water aquifers. Operators will obtain all necessary permits for any
water well drilling. Water from reserve pits may be transferred and used for drilling.
Drilling fluids will primarily consist of a fresh water/gel mixture with water being the main constituent.
Reserve pits will be constructed so as minimize the potential to leak, break, or allow discharge and in
accordance with APD Conditions of Approval (COAs). The reserve pit will be fenced on three sides
during drilling operations and on the fourth side when the rig moves off the location. Fences will be
constructed according to BLM requirements on Federal surface and/or Federal minerals.
During drilling operations, a blow out preventor (BOP) will be installed on the surface casing to provide
protection against uncontrolled surface blowouts should reservoir pressures exceed the hydrostatic
pressure of the well bore fluid. In addition, a flow control manifold consisting of manual and
hydraulically operated valves will be installed below the rig floor.
Prior to setting production casing, open hole logs may be run to evaluate production potential. If deemed
economically justified, steel production casing will be run and cemented in place in accordance with the
well design and as specified in the APD and COAs. Evaluation logs may be run subsequent to setting and
cementing production casing in some cases.
The types of casing used and the depths to which they are set will depend upon the physical
characteristics of the formations that are drilled and the pressure requirements anticipated during
completion and production operations. All casing will be new or inspected.
Operators propose to drill year-round within the CD-C project area, subject to environmental
considerations. Well development will include single wells and directional wells. Drilling each gas well
will take about 10 to 20 days, with additional time likely for directional wells, and wells deeper than
10,000 feet. CBNG wells typically take 6 to 14 days to drill. Drilling operations require approximately 8
to 10 personnel and six vehicles on location at any given time each day during normal operations. An
additional 10 to 15 personnel and six vehicles will be required on location during the running and
cementing of production casing. Approximately 20,000 to 30,000 barrels of water are needed to perform
drilling operations for both gas and CBNG wells. Operators propose to utilize produced water as
appropriate as a conservation tool.

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

4.2

MATERIALS MANAGEMENT

Potentially hazardous substances used in the development or operation of wells will be kept in limited
quantities on well sites and at the production facilities as needed for operations. Materials will not be
stockpiled at well locations. The transport, use, storage and handling of hazardous materials will follow
the procedures specified by the Occupational Safety and Health Act and by the Department of
Transportation (DOT) under 49 CFR, Parts 171–180. DOT regulations pertain to the packing, container
handling, labeling, vehicle placards, and other safety aspects.
None of the chemicals that will be used meet the criteria for being an acutely hazardous
material/substance or meet the quantities criteria per BLM Instruction Memorandum No. 93-344.
Chemicals subject to reporting under Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act in
quantities of 10,000 pounds or more will not be used, produced, stored, transported, or disposed of
annually during the drilling, completion, or operation of any well in the Project Area. In addition, no
extremely hazardous substance, as defined in 40 CFR 355, in threshold planning quantities, will be used,
produced, stored, transported, or disposed of while producing any well.
4.3

SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTE

Most wastes that will be generated at project locations are exempt from regulation by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act under the oil and gas exploration and production exemption and are
considered to be solid wastes. These wastes include those wastes generated at the wellhead and through
the production stream and gas plant. Exempt wastes include produced water, drilling mud, well
completion/workover fluids, and soils affected by these exempt wastes.
Spills and releases can result in soils that are contaminated by produced water, petroleum products, or
chemicals. The Operators will develop and maintain Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans
for each well in the Project Area.
4.4

COMPLETIONS AND TESTING

A typical cased well bore in the Project Area consists of conductor pipe, surface casing, and production
casing. The surface and production casing/cementing programs will be designed to isolate and protect
shallower formations and aquifers from the production stream and to minimize the potential for migration
of fluids and pressure communication between formations.

A cementing plan is submitted with the drilling plan as part of the APD. This plan is reviewed by
the BLM and/or the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. The BLM can request
additional information or apply COAs relating to the cementing plan if necessary.
Once production casing has been cemented in place, the drilling rig may be released and completion
operations will commence utilizing a well servicing rig or coiled tubing unit. In some cases completions
can be performed by the drilling rig. Initial completion operations may also be conducted “rigless,”
utilizing cased hole wireline equipment rather than a well servicing unit or coiled tubing unit, until such
time that production tubing is installed in the well or other operational requirements dictate the use of a
well servicing rig. In general, the completion of the well will consist of perforating the production casing,
productivity and/or formation pressure testing if deemed necessary, stimulation of the formation(s)
utilizing hydraulic fracturing technology, flow back of fracturing fluids, flow testing to determine post
fracture productivity, and installation of production equipment to facilitate hydrocarbon sales.
Hydrocarbons and water production rates are typically quantified and flared during testing operations,
which are conducted on an as-needed basis. Flareless or reduced flaring technology may be utilized for
well completions if appropriate. Hydraulic fracture stimulation is required on the majority of wells in the
Project Area in order to enhance productivity. Numerous combinations of fluids and proppants have been
Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

B-17

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

used historically in the Project Area in the effort to optimize stimulation results. Currently, the most
common stimulation technique utilizes gelled fresh water (with CO2 and/or N2 frequently added for
reservoir protection and enhanced flow back) and fracture proppants to provide the bridging and increased
permeability necessary for productivity improvement. Sand, resin-coated sand, ceramics, or bauxite can
be used as proppants in the stimulation process, depending on the design criteria of individual treatments.
Gels and other chemical additives are utilized to provide the fluid viscosity necessary to ensure successful
stimulation. The fracturing fluid is pumped down the well bore through the perforations in the casing, and
into the formation. Sufficient rate and pressure are reached to induce a fracture in the target formation.
The proppant carried in the fluid serves as a bridge to keep the created fracture open and to provide a flow
path that allows reservoir fluids to move more readily into the well bore. Water used for stimulation
purposes generally comes from water supply wells. Stimulation fluids recovered during flow back and
subsequent production operations are temporarily contained in the completion, flare, or reserve pit.
Post stimulation flow tests allow for recovery of stimulation fluids and evaluation of well productivity.
Duration of the tests will vary depending on individual well performance but typically are conducted only
long enough for fluid rates to drop to a level that permanent production equipment can safely process. Gas
is commonly flared during the flow back process and is measured using choke nipple calculations or
through a temporary flow test separator and metering facility. Flaring takes place at the end of a
horizontal flow line placed at a temporary pit designed for that specific purpose or at a vertical flare stack.
Flaring occurs at a distance from the wellhead that ensures equipment and structure protection and
personnel safety. Following the initial flow period, the well may be shut in until facilities are in place to
allow the well to be placed on sales. In some cases, production facilities will be installed prior to
completion in order to provide the capability of turning the well to sales immediately following testing.
Alternatively, if flareless or reduced flaring completions technology is utilized, production facilities and
flowlines will be installed prior to well completion. Special separation equipment is then needed to
process the flowback to remove sand and fluids thereby allowing the gas to be turned to pipeline for sales
rather than sent to flare. Fluids, primarily water, recovered during flow back operations are contained in
the completion pit until they are disposed of at evaporation ponds, disposal wells, or evaporated on
location.
Current technology allows for CBNG wells to be stimulated with high-pressure water and frac sands.
After the well is completed, the well is either vented temporarily to atmosphere or directly tied into the
gathering system. The water and CBNG will be separated downhole.
Completion and testing operations typically require approximately 10 to 20 (up to 30) days to perform, 2
to 30 personnel, and 1 to 20 vehicles on location. Approximately 4,000 to 12,000 barrels of water per well
will be needed for completion and testing operations.
In the event a well proves to be uneconomic, the Operator will plug and abandon the well in accordance
with federal and state regulations.
4.5

INTERIM RECLAMATION

On producing wells, the reserve pit will be reclaimed per the requirements specified in the approved APD.
Reserve pits may be re-used for multiple wells being drilled from a single pad. Plastic liners, if used, will
be buried onsite. The reserve pit, that portion of the location and access road not needed for production
operations, and pipeline corridors will be reclaimed according to the requirements specified in the
approved APD and COAs. Locations and roads will be reclaimed and reseeded back to the minimum size
required as soon as possible after the well is put into production. CBNG well pads will also be reclaimed
to a smaller size after the initial drilling phase, but roads typically stay at the construction dimension due
to their initial minimum construction footprint. Each Operator may have a slightly different restored
configuration based on original disturbance and the number of wells drilled on location. Figure 7 shows
an example of a well pad layout after interim reclamation.

Production and Maintenance

5.1

WELL PRODUCTION FACILITIES

Well production facilities will be installed as shown on the approved APD, with secondary containment
structures built to conform to BLM, state, and federal requirements. Facilities on the well pad will
typically include wellhead valves and piping, separation, dehydration, metering equipment, oil and water
production tanks, a methanol storage tank and pump, and telemetry equipment. Production equipment
will be fueled by natural gas or electricity. Telemetry equipment is currently used or planned for use by
most Operators to improve well evaluation, operational efficiency, and to minimize well visits.
Production pits will not be used. Well site compression may be utilized on an as-needed basis.
CBNG wellhead equipment may be run on diesel generators until an adequate flow of gas is present to
run a gas-fired engine. Electricity may be provided to some CBNG sites in the future.
Artificial lift is equipment that is installed when production volumes drop to a level that prevents efficient
removal of liquids from the well bore using reservoir energy alone. Artificial lift is presently limited to the
use of plunger lift equipment , which is a passive hydraulic means of removing liquids from the well bore
and does not require any increase in the disturbed surface area. Gas lift, downhole pumps, or other
technology may also be employed.
All constructed or installed permanent structures (on site six months or longer) will be painted a flat, nonreflective earth-tone color as specified by the BLM. All new project facilities requiring painting will be
painted within six months of installation.
5.2

PIPELINES

The Operators will continue to utilize the existing natural gas transmission lines that serve the Project Area.
Operators are not responsible for the construction or operation of gas transmission lines, and new
transmission lines are not included as a component of the Operators proposed project.
Gathering lines will be installed below the surface to transport the produced gas from the new wells to the
gas gathering pipeline system. The gas production lines will be located adjacent and parallel to well access
roads where possible to minimize surface disturbance. The exact location of a gathering line will be
determined at the time of the onsite with the appropriate surface management agency. The new pipelines
are expected to cross federal, state, and private surfaces in a route developed to minimize both resource
conflicts and development costs within the Project Area. Approximately 45 miles of high-pressure gas
lines may be installed to service multiple CBNG wells in the northwest portion of the project area. This
pipeline will generally run in a north-south alignment from Wamsutter north to the Hay Reservoir area.
Pipeline construction consists of trenching, pipe stringing, bending, welding, coating, lowering pipeline
sections into the trench, and backfilling. Construction operations will be confined to the ROW corridor
approved in the ROW application which is variable between operators. In general, construction widths
will be 50 to 75 feet when not adjacent to a road and 25 to 50 feet when adjacent to an existing or new
road. Pipes installed adjacent to road ROWs are constructed outside of the borrow ditch to minimize
safety concerns. The pipeline trench will be mechanically excavated with a backhoe or trencher to a
minimum depth of 48 inches. The trench will be approximately 18 to 20 inches wide. Newly constructed
pipelines will be hydrostatically tested to ensure structural integrity. As an example of water
requirements, approximately 2,700 gallons of water will be required to test one mile of four-inch pipeline.
Hydrostatic test water will be disposed of as approved by the BLM and/or the State. Pipeline corridors
will be reclaimed as specified in the COA authorization. Pipelines installation will result in short term
disturbance until reclamation is considered complete.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

5.3

COMPRESSION, GAS TREATMENT, AND ANCILLARY FACILITIES

The existing compression infrastructure, however, will be unable to provide sufficient capacity to compress
the additional gas volumes anticipated from the proposed wells. Additional compression will also be
required if the Operators conclude that a reduction in gas gathering system pressure is needed at some point
during the life of the project. Additional compression will be added to existing compression infrastructure
where appropriate. Additionally, the Operators estimate that one large central pipeline compression facility,
affecting approximately 10 acres, may be required for the project. Peak production is expected to occur in
the 11th year after project approval. As many as ten additional compressor sites at 5 acres per site could be
required to accommodate the maximum anticipated compression growth. Compression requirements and
associated horsepower estimates will be developed in association with the air quality analysis.
Well site compression is utilized infrequently in the Project Area; however, individual well site compression
could be needed on a limited basis. Well site compression will be installed on the existing well pad resulting
in no additional disturbance. Well site compression typically uses 125 to 200 hp two-stage compressors. Gas
fueled compression equivalent to 2500 HP per pilot will be required during the pilot phase for some of the
CBNG development. Pilot testing will last for three years. Eight pilots can be expected within the EIS
boundary area.
It is anticipated that two or more central gas processing/stabilization facilities will be needed within the
Project Area. It is estimated that each of these facilities could affect 30 acres.
The Operators will utilize the existing facility infrastructure within the Project Area to the extent possible,
including power lines and gas gathering and transmission pipelines.
5.4

PRODUCED WATER DISPOSAL

Produced water from conventional production may be stored in tanks at the well site prior to transport by
water hauling trucks or transported in flowlines to collection facilities for disposal. Produced water will be
disposed of via subsurface injection, surface evaporative pits, or will be used for potential beneficial use (i.e.
drilling operations). Conventional wells average 18 bbls/day or produced water. Produced water, condensate
and gas will be separated at the well site or at central facilities. The proposed development includes a
percentage of CBNG wells. CBNG wells can produce from 500 to 1000 bbls/day of produced water.
Produced water and gas will be separated at the well site. Water may be stored on-site in a lined pit or
storage tank, or water collection lines may be installed to transport water to a water treatment facility,
evaporation ponds, injection wells, subsurface drip areas and/or approved discharge points. Water gathering
lines of various sizes will be installed adjacent to roads/gas pipelines. Any surface discharge of produced
water from CBNG wells is regulated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit issued by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ). Produced water quality will
be monitored in accordance with State and Federal regulations.
5.5

MAINTENANCE

New wells will typically be visited daily but possibly less frequently after well performance has stabilized
and telemetry equipment is installed.
Road travel will be restricted to the width of the running surface of the road. Maintenance on project roads
during drilling and construction will be the responsibility of the Operators and will be consistent with the
Transportation Plan, annual road plan, well-specific project plan, and BLM specifications. During the
duration of the proposed project, the Operators will monitor the project roads and perform appropriate
repairs. Repairs may be necessary to correct excessive soil movement, rutting, braiding around problem
areas, and/or damage to cattle guards or gates.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

B-21

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

5.6

WORKOVERS

Periodically, a workover on a well may be required. A well servicing rig is generally utilized during
workover operations to perform various tasks such as well bore or surface equipment repairs, reservoir
evaluation, or stimulation treatments to restore or enhance well performance. Workover operations are
typically performed during daylight hours and are of short duration; however, depending on the scope of
the work to be performed, workover operations can sometimes take from several days to several weeks to
be completed. Unless fracture stimulation is necessary, workover operations typically require from five to
10 workers on location at any given time. During fracture treatments, an additional 10 to 20 individuals
could be present on location. Additional surface disturbance is rarely necessary to conduct workover
operations. Approval from the BLM Authorized Officer (AO) will be requested should the need for new
surface disturbance arise.
5.7

GEOPHYSICAL OPERATIONS

Seismic surveys have been conducted on some portions of the CD-C Project Area in the past. Additional
seismic surveys are currently being planned and are needed to further define the subsurface to facilitate
the extraction of leased oil and gas resources. Proposed seismic surveys are currently under analysis in a
separate BLM NEPA review, and are not included in this proposal.

B-22

6.

Reclamation and Abandonment

Abandonment of the well and its facilities will be performed in compliance with applicable federal and
state regulations as well as the COAs to the APDs. Seed mixtures applied during rehabilitation operations
will comply with the specifications of the appropriate surface management agency. The Operators will cut
off the casing at the base of the cellar or three feet below the final graded ground level, whichever is
deeper, and cap the casing with a minimum of 0.25 inch thick metal plate. The cap will be welded in
place with the well name and location engraved on the top. The cap will be constructed with a weep hole.
All surface equipment will be removed from the site. The surface will be recontoured to its original
appearance, to the extent possible. Topsoil will be distributed above the former location to blend the site
in with its natural surroundings. All surface disturbance will then be planted with a seed mixture as
specified by the appropriate surface management agency. Reclaimed sites will be monitored to ensure
erosion is prevented and the desired plant species are being re-established. Monitoring will continue until
the reclamation is deemed successful, which will be defined in the project reclamation plan.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX B—PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT

7.

Operator-Committed Practices

The Operators will adhere to all lease and APD conditions in addition to all federal and state laws,
regulations, and policies implemented through statute and/or resource management planning decisions
implemented through NEPA. According to BLM IM No. 2004-194, best management practices to be
considered in nearly all circumstances include the following:


Interim reclamation of well locations and access roads soon after the well is put into production;



Painting of all new facilities a color which best allows the facility to blend with the background,
typically a vegetated background;



Design and construction of all new roads to a safe and appropriate standard, “no higher than
necessary” to accommodate their intended use; and



Final reclamation recontouring of all disturbed areas, including access roads, to the original
contour or a contour that blends with the surrounding topography.

The Operators commit to performing these environmental protection measures during the implementation
of their proposed project.

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
BLM describes best management practices (BMPs) as “state-of-the-art mitigation measures applied to oil
and natural gas drilling and production to help ensure that energy development is conducted in an
environmentally responsible manner.” The aim of BMPs is to protect wildlife, air quality, landscapes, and
other natural resources as energy resources are developed. BMPs tend to be general principles for
resource protection and are not in themselves regulatory in nature.
BLM’s policy is that all “Field Offices consider BMPs in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
documents to mitigate anticipated impacts to surface and subsurface resources, and also to encourage
Operators to actively consider BMPs during the application process.” (Instruction Memorandum No.
2004-194; June 22, 2004) Substantial information on BMPs can be found on BLM’s national website at:
http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/best_management_practices.html.
Another important source of information on BMPs is the publication Surface Operating Standards and
Guidelines for Oil and Gas Exploration and Development (commonly referred to as The Gold Book),
which was developed to assist Operators on the requirements for obtaining permit approval and
conducting environmentally responsible oil and gas operations on Federal lands. It is available online at:
http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/best_management_practices/gold_book.html

BMPs are often expressed in natural gas leaseholders’ plans of development, in reclamation plans, or,
attached to approved Applications for Permit to Drill, as Conditions of Approval, which are described
below.

APD CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL
In the process of acquiring permission to drill to a federal oil and gas lease, leaseholders submit an
Application for Permit to Drill (APD) to the BLM Field Office that manages the public lands where their
lease is located. Included with the APD are:



a drilling plan that contains a description of the leaseholder’s drilling program, geologic
data, expected hazards and proposed mitigation measures to address such hazards;
a surface use plan of operations that describes the locations of the drillpad and the access
road, details of pad construction, and methods for containment and disposal of waste
material; and



a reclamation plan, which includes a weed management plan.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

C-1

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

When the BLM has completed the necessary environmental and technical review of the proposal
contained in the APD, the BLM may approve the APD (or right-of-way application) as submitted or,
more typically, approve the APD subject to Conditions of Approval (COAs) (or terms and conditions in
the case of a right-of-way grant).
COAs are attached to an approved APD to ensure environmental protection, safety, and/or conservation
of the mineral resource. They arise from a variety of controlling authorities such as the Federal Land
Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered
Species Act (ESA) and the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The COAs attached to an APD
can be general in nature or site-specific, and thus will vary from one BLM Field Office to another.
Typically, a Field Office develops COAs over a number of years of active management of oil and gas
development. Often the Field Office RMP provides either a listing of potential COAs or the BMPs that
might guide development of site-specific COAs in that area. They can address topics as wide-ranging as
protection of wildlife habitat or archeological and paleontological sites, noise reduction, wildfire
suppression, or management of invasive species. A BLM study of a number of Field Offices that manage
oil and gas development identified 175 different types of COAs that are used to mitigate surfacedisturbing activities. (BLM 2006c) Following is a master list of COAs that are used in the Rawlins Field
Office when considering APDs. The list is adapted as needed for site-specific use. Many of the items
listed will not be used on a specific APD if not warranted. If, on the other hand, conditions call for
requirements that are not on the list, BLM specialists can add new COAs. The list is presented in the
standard format used for attachment to an approved APD.

A COMPLETE COPY OF THE APPLICATION FOR PERMIT TO DRILL, THE CONDITIONS OF
APPROVAL, and APPLICABLE MAPS MUST BE FURNISHED TO YOUR FIELD REPRESENTATIVE
AND BE AVAILABLE ON SITE DURING CONSTRUCTION AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES.
Rev. 2007-05-01

GENERAL
1. Approval of this Application for Permit to Drill (APD) does not warrant that any party holds
equitable or legal title.
2. All lease exploration, development, construction, production, operations, and reclamation activity
shall be conducted in a manner which conforms to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and
regulations.
3. All lease operations are subject to the terms of the lease and its stipulations, the regulations of 43 CFR
Part 3 100, Onshore Oil and Gas Orders, Notices to Lessees (NTL's), the approved APD, and any
written instructions or Orders of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Authorized Officer (AO).
4. The approval of this APD does not grant authority to use off-lease federal lands. Facilities approved
by this APD and/or Sundry Notices that are no longer included within the lease, due to a change in
the lease or unit boundary, will be authorized with a right-of-way. Similarly, should unit or lease
boundaries change during the life of the project, the Operator will be responsible for acquiring
necessary rights-of-way for affected facilities. Failure to do so may cause the operation to be shut-in.
5. This permit is valid for a period of two years from the date of APD approval or until lease expiration
or termination, whichever is sooner. APD extensions may be requested and granted for up to two
additional years, but not to exceed a total sum of four years from the initial APD approval date.
Should a permit extension be requested, it must be submitted prior to the permit expiration date via a
Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5) to the AO for approval. If the permit terminates, any surface
disturbance created under the application shall be reclaimed in accordance with the approved
reclamation plan found herein.
6. The Operator shall submit a Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5) to the AO for approval prior to beginning
any new surface-disturbing activities or operations that are not specifically addressed and approved
by this APD.
7. The Operator may submit to the AO's Representative written requests (including documentation,
supporting analysis and an acceptable plan for mitigation of anticipated impacts) for exception,
waiver, or modification to this approved APD, associated Conditions of Approval (COA), or other
requirements. Such written approval shall be obtained prior to commencement of operations that
cause any deviation from the approved APD and associated limitations. Emergency approval may be
obtained orally, but such approval does not waive the written reporting requirement.

OPERATIONS
1. Upon request, Operator must be prepared to provide copies of applications for, and approved copies
of, federal, state, and local operating permits.
2. All survey monuments found in the area of operations shall be protected. Survey monuments include,
but are not limited to: General Land Office and BLM Cadastral Survey Comers, reference corners,
witness points, U.S. Coastal and Geodetic benchmarks and triangulation stations, military control
monuments, and recognizable civil (both public and private) survey monuments. In the event of
obliteration or disturbance of any of the above, the Operator shall immediately report the incident, in
writing, to the AO and the respective installing authority if known. Where General Land Office or
BLM Right-of-way monuments or references are obliterated during operations, the Operator shall
secure the services of a registered land surveyor or a BLM cadastral surveyor to restore the disturbed
monuments and references using surveying procedures found in the "Manual of Surveying
Instructions for the Survey of the Public Lands in the United States," latest edition. The Operator shall
record such survey in the appropriate county and send a copy to the AO. If the Bureau cadastral
surveyors or other federal surveyors are used to restore the disturbed survey monument, the Operator
shall be responsible for the survey cost.
3. If any cultural values (sites, artifacts, human remains) are observed during operation of this
lease/permit/right-of-way, they will be left intact and the AO notified. The AO will conduct an
evaluation of the cultural values to establish appropriate mitigation, salvage or treatment. The
Operator is responsible for informing all persons in the area who are associated with this project that
they will be subject to prosecution for knowingly disturbing historic or archaeological sites, or for
collecting artifacts. If historic or archaeological materials are uncovered during construction, the
Operator is to immediately stop work that might further disturb such materials, and contact the AO.
Within seven (7) days after the Operator contacted the BLM, the AO will inform the Operator as to:
whether the materials appear eligible for the National Register of Historic Places; the mitigation
measures the Operator will likely have to undertake before the site can be used (assuming in situ
preservation is not necessary); and, a time-frame for the AO to complete an expedited review under
36 CFR 800.11 to confirm, through the State Historic Preservation Officer, that the findings of the
AO are correct and that mitigation is appropriate. The AO will provide technical and procedural
guidelines for the conduct of mitigation. Upon verification from the AO that the required mitigation
has been completed, the Operator will then be allowed to resume construction.
4. The Operator will be responsible for the cost of any mitigation required by the AO. The AO will
provide technical and procedural guidelines for the conduct of mitigation. Upon verification from the
AO that the required mitigation has been completed, the Operator will be allowed to resume
operations.
5. If paleontological resources, either large or conspicuous, and/or of a significant scientific value are
discovered during construction, the find will be reported to the AO immediately. Construction will be
suspended within 250 feet of said find. An evaluation of the paleontological discovery will be made
by a BLM-approved professional paleontologist within five (5) working days, weather permitting, to
determine the appropriate action(s) to prevent the potential loss of any significant paleontological
values. Operations within 250 feet of such a discovery will not be resumed until written authorization
to proceed is issued by the AO. The Operator will bear the cost of any required paleontological
appraisals, surface collection of fossils, or salvage of any large conspicuous fossils of significant
scientific interest discovered during the operation.
6. The Operator will be responsible for informing all persons associated with this project that they will
be subject to prosecution for damaging, altering, excavating or removing any archaeological,
historical, or vertebrate fossil objects or site. If archaeological, historical, or vertebrate fossil materials
are discovered, the Operator shall suspend all operations that further disturb such materials and

C-6

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

immediately contact the AO. Operations shall not resume until written authorization to proceed is
issued by the AO.
7. Within five (5) working days, the AO will evaluate the discovery and inform the Operator of actions
that will be necessary to prevent loss of significant cultural or scientific values.
8. The Operator shall be responsible for the cost of any mitigation required by the AO. The AO will
provide technical and procedural guidelines for the conduct of mitigation. Upon verification from the
AO that the required mitigation has been completed, the Operator shall be allowed to resume
operations.
9. If any dead or injured threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate animal species is located during
construction or operation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Wyoming Field Office (307-772­
2374), its law enforcement office (307-261 -6365), and the BLM Rawlins Field Office (307-328­
4200) shall be notified within 24 hours. If any dead or injured sensitive species is located during
construction or operation, the Rawlins Field Office shall also be notified within 24 hours.
10. If dead or injured raptors, big game, migratory birds, or unusual wildlife are observed on the project
area, Operator personnel will contact the appropriate BLM and WGFD offices. Under no
circumstances will dead or injured wildlife be approached or handled by Operator personnel.
11. Operators shall notify the BLM immediately if raptors are found nesting on or within 1,200 feet of
project facilities and assist the BLM as necessary in erecting artificial nesting structures (ANSs) as
appropriate. The use of ANSs will be considered as a last resort for raptor protection. If nest
manipulation or a situation requiring a "taking" of a raptor nest becomes necessary, a special permit
will be obtained from the Denver USDI-FWS Office, Permit Section and will be initiated with
sufficient lead time to allow for development of mitigation. Required corresponding permits will be
obtained from the WGFD in Cheyenne. Consultation and coordination with the USDI-FWS and
WGFD will be conducted for all protection activities relating to raptors.
12. Operator and Operator’s sub-contracted personnel shall not intentionally harm or harass wild horses,
other wildlife, or domestic livestock.
13. ROW, mineral lease, mining claim, and permit holders shall monitor and control noxious and
invasive weeds, according to an approved weed management plan, on project-disturbed areas and
native areas infested as a direct result of the project. The control methods shall be in accordance with
guidelines established by the EPA, BLM, state and local authorities. Prior to the use of pesticides, the
Operator will obtain written approval from the AO - meaning an approved Pesticide Use Proposal
form - showing the type and quantity of material(s) to be used, pest(s) to be controlled, method of
application, etc.
14. Pesticide Use Proposals shall be submitted to and approved by the BLM AO—Weed Coordinator,
prior to any application of any herbicide on the BLM lands. Pesticide Use Proposals will be tiered to
the approved Reclamation Plan/Weed Management Plan.
15. Copies of daily Pesticide Application Records (required by the State of Wyoming) and Summary
Herbicide Use Reports are due monthly to the BLM AO—Weed Coordinator.
16. The Operator shall be responsible for the prevention and suppression of fires on public lands caused
by its employees, contractors, or its subcontractors. During conditions of extreme fire danger, surface
use operations may be either limited or suspended in specific areas, or additional measures may be
required by the AO. Should a fire occur, it shall be immediately reported to this office by calling 307­
328-4200 and notifying the Fluid Minerals staff.
17. Emissions of particulate matter from well pad, road, and other facility construction, operation, and
reclamation activities will be minimized by application of water or other dust suppressants. Dust
inhibitors (surfacing materials, dust suppressants, and water) will be used as necessary on locations

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

C-7

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

that present a fugitive dust problem. The use of chemical dust suppressants on public surface will
require prior approval from the AO.
18. If groundwater or permeable/porous subsoil or bedrock is encountered upon construction of the pad
or pits, or upon drilling and completing shallow holes for surface conductor, rat/mouse holes, or water
supply well, the Operator must immediately notify the AO’s Representative before proceeding.
19. The Operator shall comply with the Hazardous Materials Management Plan/Summary in the RMP
ROD (Appendix 32) and/or the appropriate EIS ROD, including requirements to transport, store,
utilize, and dispose of hazardous substances. The Operator shall maintain a hazardous substances
release contingency plan that shall include, among other things, provision to notify the AO in the
event of any release of hazardous substances associated with project operations. Treatment chemicals
may require additional storage and containment measures and facilities depending on chemical
classification and hazard.
20. If a portable sewage treatment facility is moved onto location, the well/lease Operator shall provide
the BLM AO a copy of the facility Operator's notification letter to the Wyoming Department of
Environmental Quality. Facility operations shall comply with BLM requirements, including
unauthorized discharge notification and reclamation of disturbed surfaces.
21. Only those hazardous wastes that qualify as exempt, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA), Oil and Gas Exemption, may be disposed of in the reserve pit. Generally, oil or gas
wastes are exempt if they:

a) have been sent down hole and then returned to the surface during oil/gas operations
involving exploration, development, or production, or
b) have been generated during the removal of produced water or other contaminants from the
oil/gas production stream. The term hazardous waste, as referred to above, is defined as a
listed (40 CFR 261 -31 -33) or characteristic (40 CFR 261.20-24) hazardous waste under
RCRA.
22. Any spilled or leaked oil, produced water or treatment chemicals must be reported in accordance with
NTL- 3A and immediately cleaned up in accordance with BLM requirements. This includes clean-up
and proper disposition of soils contaminated as a result of such spills/leaks. The Operator shall
segregate, treat, and/or bio-remediate contaminated soil materials as authorized via Sundry Notice
(Form 3 160-5) or dispose of contaminated soils at a permitted waste facility. Treatment chemicals
may require additional storage and containment measures and facilities depending on chemical
classification and hazard.
23. The Operator shall install an identification sign consistent with the requirements of 43 CFR 3 162.6
immediately upon completion of the well pad/location construction operations.
24. The Operator shall contain and remove all debris, unused equipment, and other waste materials not
needed for production. Waste materials shall be disposed of at an approved disposal facility.
25. Upon APD expiration, it is the responsibility of the Applicant/Operator to see that all stakes, flagging,
posts or other materials placed on the locations and/or access roads, pipelines and associated rightsof-way are removed. Operator must immediately cease all operations associated with preparing to
drill the well and begin final reclamation activities of all APD related disturbance, pursuant to the
approved APD Conditions of Approval and to be completed within 6 months of the APD expiration
date.
26. Employee and contractor education will be conducted regarding wildlife laws. If violations are
discovered on the project area, Operators will immediately notify the appropriate agency. Operators

C-8

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

will implement policies designed to control off-site activities of personnel, that may result in littering
or resource damage.
27. Company and contractor employees operating motorized equipment will undergo training describing
the types of wildlife in the area, the circumstances under which collisions are likely to occur and the
measures that can be employed to minimize collisions.

CONSTRUCTION
1. All facilities on location that have the potential to leak/spill oil, glycol, methanol, produced water,
condensate, or other fluids which may constitute a hazard to the environment, public health or safety
(including, but not limited to, drain sumps, sludge holdings, and chemical containers), shall be within
secondary containment, impervious to those fluids, exclusive of wildlife and livestock, with
animal/bird escape capability, and able to contain a minimum of 110% of the volume of the largest
storage vessel, respective to content, or 100% with at least one foot of freeboard, whichever is
greater, so that any spill or leakage would not drain, infiltrate, or otherwise escape to ground water,
surface water, or navigable waters before cleanup can be completed (within 72 hours).
2. Construction over and/or immediately adjacent to existing pipelines shall be coordinated, and in
accordance with, the relevant pipeline companies' policy.
3. Fencing shall be installed around produced water, oil, and condensate tank batteries in order to help
maintain the integrity of the surrounding containment structure and to prevent livestock and wildlife
from entering the area in case of a leak or spill.
4. All open vent stack equipment shall be designed and constructed to prevent entry by birds and bats
and to discourage perching.
5. The immediate repair/replacement (to BLM standards) of any range infrastructure breached, altered,
or damaged by construction, drilling, or operation activities related to this APD shall be the
responsibility of the Operator. All fence relocations will be in accordance with BLM approval.
6. Construction, maintenance, and reclamation operations with frozen material or during periods when
the soil material is saturated is expressly prohibited. If equipment, including licensed highway
vehicles, creates ruts in excess of four (4) inches deep, the soil shall be deemed too wet to adequately
support maintenance and/or heavy equipment.
7. Accumulated snow present on the ground at the outset of construction, maintenance, or reclamation
activities shall be removed before the soil is disturbed and piled downhill and/or downwind from the
disturbed area. Equipment used for any non-construction snow removal operations will be equipped
with 6" shoes to ensure blades do not remove topsoil or vegetation. Written approval must be
obtained before snow removal related to a federal action but outside of designated disturbance areas is
undertaken.
8. When blading/removing snow, drifts/berms shall be constructed with a gap of 35 yards every 1/4
mile, to allow unobstructed movement of wildlife, livestock and human activities.
9. If right-of-way fencing is required, it will be kept to a minimum and the fences will meet the
BLM/WGFD approval for facilitating wildlife movement. Wildlife-proof fencing will be used only to
enclose areas that are potentially hazardous to wildlife species or reclaimed areas where it is
determined that wildlife species are impeding successful vegetation establishment.
10. Snow fences, if used, will be limited to segments of one-quarter mile or less. In addition, escape
openings will be provided along roads in big game crucial winter ranges, as designated by the BLM,
to facilitate exit of big game animals from snowplowed roads.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

C-9

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

11. Clearly remove, segregate, and delineate from all other spoils, all available topsoil from constructed
locations and surface disturbances including areas of cut and fill. Stockpile and clearly identify
topsoils at the site for use in reclamation on all areas of surface disturbance (well pads/locations,
roads, pipelines, etc.).
12. Plugs or embankments providing wildlife with access out of and across open pipeline trenches shall
be installed, at minimum, every 1,320 linear feet along open pipeline trenches.
13. No construction and/or reclamation shall block or change the natural course of any drainage, nor shall
topsoil, waste, or fill material be deposited below high water lines in riparian areas, flood plains, or in
natural drainage ways. The lower edge of soil or other material stockpiles will be located outside
active floodplains. All spoils will be placed where they can be retrieved without creating additional
surface disturbance and where they do not impede and/or contribute sediment to watershed and
drainage flows. The Operator shall also reconstruct and stabilize stream channels, drainages, and
ephemeral draws to exhibit similar hydrologic characteristics that were found in stable, naturally
occurring and functioning systems.
14. Drainage and run-on/runoff shall be diverted away from all new construction naturally or through the
use of diversion ditches/berms and/or soil berms or stockpiles. All drainage structures shall
approximate topographic contour lines, have a grade no greater than 0.5 – 1 percent, and shall release
water onto natural undisturbed ground without causing additional and/or accelerated erosion.
Drainage structures shall not discharge directly into/onto natural drainages/channels, and/or use riprap
or other armoring to protect from erosion (BLM Manual 9113). Water-bars, waddles, hay bales,
and/or silt fences shall be used as needed to reduce surface runoff velocity and promote upland
sediment deposition, thus reducing drainage/channel sedimentation and erosion.
15. Silt fences, if needed, would be installed after topsoil removal and before pad leveling begins and
must remain in place until interim reclamation is complete and there is adequate vegetation present to
stabilize the soil. Silt fences would be constructed in locations where surface erosion is evident or
potential for surface erosion exists such as areas of steep slopes or highly erosive soils. Fences would
be installed at the inside edge of disturbance.
16. Silt fences would be constructed using metal posts that are at least 5 feet long with at least 2 feet in
the ground (3 feet above ground) with 8 feet spacing if a wire re-enforcement backing is used or 6
feet spacing if no wire backing is used. The fabric is to be toed into the ground at the base of the fence
a minimum of 8 inches deep and an 18 inch overlap is required when splicing two fences together.
The fabric is to be installed on the uphill side of the metal posts and attached to the posts at least
every 6 inches along the length of the post. Silt fences are to be inspected at least once a month or 48
hours after a rain storm event. If holes in the fence or undercutting of the fence are found, repair is
required within 48 hours of discovery. When silt accumulates to a height equal to two-thirds the
height of the fabric, the silt is to be cleaned out and deposited on the excess spoils pile.
17. Sediment fences, straw wattles, erosion mats and/or hay bales should be used to minimize erosion and
sediment transport on disturbance area.
18. If temporary surface pipelines, as authorized by the AO, are used to transport water, they shall be
placed/removed when the ground surface is dry. Surface blading prior to line placement is prohibited.
The pipelines must be removed within 30 days after well completion (or determination of inactivity).
19. Construction control stakes shall be placed as necessary to ensure construction of the well pad, topsoil
stockpile, spoil pile, and outer limits of the area to be disturbed in accordance with the specifications
outlined in the APD. The Operator shall assume full responsibility for protecting all stakes and
offsetting any additional stakes or grades which may be necessary.

C-10

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

20. All production facilities including but not limited to tanks, separators, dehydrators, meters, etc. would
be co-located on nearby producing well locations, in accordance with an approved Sundry Notice of
Intent for construction. All wells, above-ground structures, production equipment, tanks, transformers
and insulators not subject to coloring requirements for safety would be painted the color of “non
reflective Shale Green”.
21. To protect the identified ferruginous hawk nests, Greater Sage-grouse leks and wintering big game
habitat, the project proponent will install housing and/or muffler(s) around equipment that exceeds 55
dBA (ES-7, 4-69, 4-157 AR EIS)
22. Cathodic protection wells would be drilled on the existing well pad, placed so as not to interfere with
re-contouring of cut and fill slopes during interim reclamation, designed and constructed to prevent
commingling and contamination of water aquifers. The AO would be notified of any water flows at
surface and the problem would be resolved promptly.
23. All stacks, exhauster, or vent pipes shall have anti perch cones and vent covers to prevent bat or small
bird entry and entrapment.

ROADS
1. All access roads and drainage control structures, whether existing or newly constructed, shall be both
constructed to resource road standards and regularly maintained in a safe and usable condition as
outlined in BLM Manual, Section 9113. A regular maintenance program may include, but is not
limited to, blading, ditching, culvert installation, dust control, and gravel surfacing or other activities
as specified by the AO. The Lessee and/or Operator shall enter into a maintenance agreement with all
other "authorized users" of the common access road(s) to the well site. The costs of road maintenance
in dollars, equipment, materials, labor, and other related expenses shall be shared proportionally
among the "authorized users." Upon request, the AO shall be provided copies of any maintenance
agreement or agreements.
2. Access roads would be constructed to the BLM Road Standards in such manner as to minimize cuts
and fills and minimize erosion and sedimentation and maximize reclamation, as determined during
the onsite.
3. Engineered Roads and/or culverts shall be designed in accordance with the Engineered Road
Requirements, with four copies of the following information submitted to the BLM project NRS for
approval, prior to construction.
a. Plan, profile and typical cross section.
b. Centerline stakes shall be placed in the field, with culvert locations marked on the centerline, for
the BLM review before final design approval. In addition, slope stakes shall be placed at the top
of the cut and the bottom of the fill for those portions of the road that are engineered. All
roadways cuts and fills shall be designed to balance from earthwork within the ROW, or an
approved borrow source.
c. Perform a “hydrologic analysis” to design culverts sized to pass a 25-year precipitation event with
no head developed at the culvert inlet.
d. The submitted plans must be signed/certified by a professional engineer and will include any
special notes for construction and cut/fill balance notes.
4. All Operators and Operator's representative vehicles are restricted to authorized travel routes only and
shall not use any other access route, e.g.; two-track roads, trails, and pipeline rights-of-way to access
the drill/ell pad and any ancillary facilities.
5. Two-track roads shall not be cut-off as a direct result of construction, maintenance, or reclamation of
the well access road or associated well facilities, unless authorized by the BLM.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

C-11

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

6. Prior to construction, road(s) shall be surveyed and staked with construction control stakes set
continuously along the centerline at maximum 100-foot intervals (less where needed to be intervisible) and at all tangent and curve control points, fence or utility crossings, and culverts. In addition
to centerline stakes, slope stakes shall be placed at the top of the cut and the bottom of the fill for
those portions of the road that are engineered.
7. Before proposed road construction activities begin, the topsoil must be bladed to the side of the road
and stockpiled. The topsoil stockpile shall be contoured so as to prevent water ponding or flow
concentration. Once the borrow ditch and the cut slopes are constructed, cleared vegetative material
and topsoil that is windrowed shall be spread back onto the cut/fill slopes of the road, removing any
windrows or berms remaining at the edge of the road.
8. The minimum travel-way width of the immediate access road will be 14 feet with turnouts at least 10
feet in width. No structure will be allowed to narrow the road top. The inside slope will be 4: 1. The
bottom of the ditch will be a smooth V with no vertical cut in the bottom. The outside slope will be
2:1 or flatter. After the road is crowned and ditched with a .03-.05 ft/ft crown, the topsoil and
windrowed vegetative material shall be pulled back down on the cut slope so there is no berm left at
the top of the cut slope. Turnouts will be spaced at a maximum distance of 1000 feet and will be
intervisible. If the access road crosses a floodplain, the ditch shall be flat-bottomed so as to provide
material to raise the road, unless otherwise approved by the AO.
9. If soils along the access road route are dry during road construction, use, and/or maintenance, fresh
water shall be applied to the road surface to facilitate soil compaction and minimize soil loss as a
result of wind erosion.
10. Construction and surfacing of the new access road shall be complete prior to moving drilling
equipment onto the well pad and the presence of heavy vehicular traffic. Compact the top foot of subgrade in even six (6) to eight (8) inch lifts to established standards, adding water as needed for
compaction. Surface with an appropriate grade of gravel to a minimum depth of four (compacted)
inches.
11. All cattle guards shall be designed and maintained consistent with BLM standards and shall be a
minimum of 16 feet wide and 8 feet long; set on either timber, pre-cast concrete, or cast-in-place
concrete bases at right angles to the roadway. They shall have drop-down wings and an adjacent 16
foot wide tubular bypass gate; not narrow the road surface; and have fence and end panels on either
side constructed using 3 posts with “H” braces.
12. All culverts shall be a minimum of 18 inches in diameter. Culverts shall have a minimum of 12" of
fill or 1/2 the pipe diameter, whichever is greater, placed on top of the culvert, and shall be of length
sufficient to allow at least 12" of culvert to extend beyond the toe of any slope. The inlet and outlet
shall be set on grade. No rocks shall be used in the bed material and no rocks greater than 2" in
diameter will be immediately adjacent to the culvert. The entire length of pipe shall be bedded on
native material before backfilling, which shall be completed using unfrozen material and rocks no
larger than two inches in diameter; compact the backfill evenly in 6" lifts on both sides of the culvert.
A permanent marker shall be installed at both ends of the culvert to help prevent traffic from
damaging the culvert. Additional culverts will be placed in the new access road as the need arises or
as directed by the AO.
13. Wing-ditches shall be staked and constructed at a slope of .5 to 1.0 percent down slope unless
otherwise approved by the AO. All wing/drainage ditches and culverts shall be kept clear and free
flowing, and shall also be maintained in accordance with the original construction standards.
Drainage structures shall not discharge directly into/onto natural drainages/channels, and/or use riprap
or other armoring to protect from erosion (BLM Manual 9113).

C-12

14. Low water crossings shall be constructed perpendicular to the channel and at original channel
elevation in a manner that will not block or restrict existing channel flow. Excavated material shall be
stockpiled for use in reclamation of the crossings.

PITS
1. All oil and gas pits that could contain fracture/stimulation fluids, recycled pit fluids, or produced
water, except those only containing fresh-water based constituents, are required to be lined with an
impermeable (12 mil minimum with a permeability less than or equal to 1 X 10-7 cm/sec) liner. The
liners shall be physically and chemically compatible with all substances which it may contact and
shall be of sufficient strength and thickness to withstand normal installation and use, and installed so
that it will not leak. The liner shall be installed over a smooth sub-grade, matting, or fill materials
(e.g. sifted dirt, sand, or bentonite) free of pockets, loose rocks, and other objects that could damage
the liner.
2. The only fluids/waste materials which are authorized to go into reserve pits are RCRA-exempt
exploration and production wastes. Any evidence of RCRA non-exempt wastes being put into the
reserve pit may result in the BLM AO requiring specific testing and closure requirements.
3. All pits are required to maintain a minimum of 2 feet of freeboard between the liquid level and the top
of the liner. If operations cause fluid levels in pits to rise above the required freeboard, immediate
notification shall be provided to the AO with concurrent steps taken to cease the introduction of
additional fluids, until alternative containment methods can be approved.
4. Flaring of gas into the reserve or completion pits will not be allowed without prior approval from the
AO. Flaring into lined pits is prohibited.
5. All pits shall be kept free of trash, debris, solid wastes, and other unauthorized waste materials
including oil and liquid hydrocarbons.
6. For the protection of livestock and wildlife, all pits and open cellars shall be fenced on all sides, with
corner bracing, immediately upon construction. Reserve, flare, completion, and production pits shall
be adequately fenced during and after drilling operations until pits are reclaimed so as to effectively
keep out wildlife and livestock. Operator shall, within ten (10) days of discovery, remove any floating
hydrocarbons from pit surface. Approved netting (mesh diameter no larger than one inch) is required
over any pit that contains or is identified as containing hydrocarbons or hazardous substances (per
RCRA 40 CFR Part 26 1 or CERCLA Section 10l (14) (E)).
7. Pits shall be dried, backfilled, and closed within six (6) months from well completion (total depth) or
well plugging. Pits must be void of all free fluids prior to backfilling. Pit trenching or squeezing is
prohibited. Pits may be dewatered/dried in the following manner: natural evaporation, mechanical
aeration, chemical and mechanical solidification (e.g. with fly ash, cement kiln dust, etc.) and/or
hauled to an approved DEQ disposal site. The installation/operation of any sprinklers, misters,
aerators, pumps, hoses, and related equipment shall ensure that water spray or mist does not drift
outside of the pit. All other dewatering/drying, removal or disposal methods not listed in the APD and
or COAs shall have prior written approval from the AO.
8. Pits, once dry, shall be backfilled and compacted with a minimum cover of five (5) feet of soil, void
of any topsoil, vegetation, large stones, rocks or foreign objects. The pit area shall be mounded to
allow for settling and to promote positive surface drainage away from the pit. Before backfilling
synthetically lined reserve pits, those liner portions remaining above the "mud line" shall be cut off as
close to the top of the mud surface as possible and disposed of at an approved solid waste disposal
facility. The pit bottom and remaining liner shall not be trenched, cut, punctured, or perforated.

plan is submitted, complete and approved by the BLM Authorized Officer.
2. The Reclamation Plan shall include:

C-14

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

a. Prior to any surface disturbing activities, vegetation inventories shall be conducted on each
ecological site and they shall be mapped. At a minimum, vegetation inventories shall be
conducted for basal cover and vegetative life form type and frequency (including individual
invasive and noxious weed species) and include at least one photograph of each transect. An
inventory of 100 to 400 points (depending on the amount and type of vegetative cover) using
transects is highly recommended. The inventory method shall be included within the Reclamation
Plan for approval.
b. Prior to the completion of interim and final reclamation, the Operator shall sample and test soils
for suitable surface and subsurface physical and chemical properties. At a minimum the soil shall
be tested for texture, electrical conductivity, reactivity, pH and photographed. At least one
photograph at each soil pit is required which also shows the vegetation community. These tests
are to be used by the Operator to evaluate the suitability of the soils or seedbed for seed
germination and potential for vegetative success under the approved reclamation plan.
c. Prior to the completion of interim and final reclamation and seeding, the Operator shall submit to
the BLM AO, via Sundry Subsequent Report (Form 3160-5), the results of all vegetative and soils
surveys and tests. Should pre-disturbance and interim/final reclamation test results differ to the
extent that the soil requires amendment(s) or the proposed seed mix requires modification to
achieve the desired ecological and plant community, the Operator shall submit a revised
reclamation plan via Sundry Notice of Intent (NOI) (Form 3160-5). The Sundry NOI shall outline
any proposed soil amendments, treatments, additives or modifications, seed mix changes and
other necessary revisions to the reclamation plan.
d. Provisions to meet Standards and Guidelines for Healthy Rangelands (43 CFR 4180.1) and
obtaining desired plant communities:
http://www.blm.gov/wy/st/en/field_offices/Rawlins/range.html
e. Mitigation for direct, indirect and cumulative livestock forage losses and impacts to livestock
grazing (including impacts to livestock operations and production performance). This could
include reclamation that would replace forage losses from surface disturbing activities, avoiding
trailing routes and livestock gathering areas and seasonal restrictions (such as during lambing and
calving in specific areas).
3. The annual monitoring report shall be submitted by March 1 of each year. This report shall include
reclamation and restoration efforts, including seeding/re-vegetation, invasive plant treatment/control,
and soil stabilization and erosion prevention. The report shall be in accordance and consistent with
the BLM and/or RFO Reclamation Policy, RMP (ROD) and Appendix 36, and the field/project level
EA/EIS, as applicable. The yearly Operator report would include surface disturbance and reclamation
data for the previous calendar year, utilizing the BLM RFO Disturbance (As-Built) Reclamation
Database. The RFO surface disturbance and reclamation database, as well as information on the
database and submission of the data, will be available at:
http://www.blm.gov/wy/st/en/field_offices/Rawlins/oil_and_gas.html, or by contacting the RFO,
Minerals and Lands, Supervisory Natural Resource Specialist/Physical Scientist at 307-328-4200 for
further information.

a. Backfilling pits,
b. Re-contouring and stabilizing the well site, access road, cut/fill slopes, drainage channels, utility

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

C-15

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

and pipeline corridors and all other disturbed areas, to approximately the original contour, shape,
function and configuration that existed before construction (any compacted backfilling activities
would ensure proper spoils placement, settling and stabilization,
c. Surface ripping, prior to topsoil placement, to a depth of 18-24 inches deep on 18-24 inch
centers to reduce compaction,
d. Final grading and replacement of topsoil,
e. Surface-roughening and other techniques such as snow fencing to increase soil moisture
retention and reduce compaction. Surface soil material can be pitted or roughened (not
exceeding the applied topsoil depth) such that the entire reclamation area shall be uniformly
covered with depressions constructed perpendicular to the natural flow of water and/or
prevailing wind, and
f. Seeding.
6. Interim or final reclamation of all surface disturbed areas shall commence and be

completed within one year of initial disturbance unless needed for well production
operations, or otherwise approved by the AO. Interim reclamation for those areas not
needed for production operations, including unnecessary access roads and pipeline
right(s)-of-way, shall commence and be completed within six months of well completion.
Stockpiled soils shall be distributed on disturbed areas and the production pad shall be as
small as possible to allow for safe and prudent production operations. Some topsoil may
be reserved for final reclamation.
7. Any topsoil to be stockpiled for longer than one year shall be spread in layers not to exceed two
feet maximum thickness, including topsoil underneath the pile and appropriately identified/signed
as topsoil. These soil stockpiles shall be seeded with a prescribed seed mixture or sterile cover
crop (included within the approved reclamation plan) and covered with mulch to reduce erosion
and discourage weed invasion.
8. Temporary fencing of the reclaimed well/facilities locations for the first two growing seasons after
either interim or final seeding may be required to exclude livestock and wildlife and to help ensure
better re-vegetation success.
9. Any subsequent re-disturbance of reclamation shall be reclaimed within six months by the same
means described in the approved reclamation plan.
10. A Notice of Intent to Abandon (Form 3160-5) must be submitted and approved prior to any well
abandonment activities. A joint inspection of the disturbed areas may be required and attended by
the BLM and the Operator (or Operator's Designee), the primary purpose of which is to review and
agree to the existing (or a new) abandonment and/or final reclamation plan. Earthwork must
commence and be completed within six months from the date of plugging and abandonment and
seeding no later than the next immediate growing season upon the completion of earthwork. All
reclamation should be accomplished as soon as possible after the disturbance occurs, with efforts
continuing until a satisfactory revegetation cover is established and the site is stabilized (three to
five years) (RMP ROD Appendix 13-8).
11. The Operator shall submit a Final Abandonment Notice (FAN), using Form 3160-5, to the AO
when adequate reclamation of surface-disturbed areas has been completed. This FAN indicates
that the Operator believes the location is considered ready for final inspection, with adequate
vegetation cover and species diversity. Upon receipt of the FAN, the BLM will conduct a field
inspection prior to releasing the bond liability for this location.
12. Re-vegetation shall consist of species occurring in the surrounding natural vegetation and/or
included in the approved seed mix as deemed desirable by the BLM or private surface owner in

C-16

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

review and approval of the reclamation plan. Inter-seeding, secondary seeding, or staggered
seeding may be required to accomplish re-vegetation objectives. The seed mixture(s) shall be
planted in the amounts specified in pounds of pure live seed (PLS)/acre. There shall be no primary
or secondary noxious weed seed in the seed mixture. Seed should be tested and the viability testing
of seed would be done in accordance with State law(s) and within nine months prior to purchase.
Commercial seed would be either certified or registered seed. The seed mixture container would be
tagged in accordance with State law(s) and available for inspection by the AO. Since seeds are of
different sizes and require different planting depths, the Operator would use the appropriate
equipment to ensure that the seed mixture is correctly and uniformly planted over the disturbed
area. Seed would be broadcast if drilling is not possible. When broadcasting the seed, the pounds
per acre are to be doubled. The seeding would be repeated until a satisfactory stand is established
as determined by the AO
13. All practicable measures would be utilized to minimize erosion and stabilize disturbed soils on or
adjacent to the disturbed and reclaimed area. There would be no evidence of mass-wasting, headcutting, large rills, gullies, down cutting or overall slope instability. Should the use or storage of
hay, straw, or mulch be necessary, the Operator is required to use certified weed-free hay, straw
and mulch on the BLM lands.
14. Evaluation of growth and success shall be conducted as per RMP ROD (Appendix 36). If the
treatment area is found, through Operator site-specific monitoring data, to be successfully
reclaimed, Operator monitoring to confirm reclamation success shall continue for at least five
growing seasons. The site shall also comply with additional management needs, including control
of weed infestations. Success criteria as defined by the RMP is: criteria based on pre-disturbance
surveys or surveys of adjacent undisturbed natural ground cover and species composition (which
the Operator will do prior to disturbance) or eighty percent of pre-disturbance ground cover, ninety
percent dominant species, no noxious weeds, and erosion features equal to or less than surrounding
area.

DRILLING
No production from the wells drilled on this well pad location should start production UNTIL
Sundry Notices granting variances from Onshore Orders 4 and 5 as related to commingling and
allocations are approved.
The drilling operations for this well shall be conducted in accordance with the Onshore Oil and Gas Order
No. 2 as provided for in 43 CFR 3164.1. This includes the well control equipment and its testing, the mud
system and associated equipment, and the casing and cementing. Any deviation from this approved drill
plan pursuant to these conditions of approval requires prior approval of the petroleum engineer of the
Rawlins Field Office.

BOPE
1. All BOPE shall meet or exceed the requirements of a 5M system as set forth in Onshore Oil and Gas
Order No. 2.
2. All choke lines from the drilling spool forward, shall be straight steel lines flanged at both ends,

10. Well Abandonment: In the event abandonment of the hole is desired, oral approval may be granted
by the AO (Petroleum Engineer), but must be followed within 5 days with a Form 3160-5 (Sundry
Notice of Intent to Abandon) which will give the complete plan of operation that will be utilized in
the plugging. Unless the plugging is to take place immediately upon receipt of the oral approval, the
AO (Petroleum Engineer) must be notified at least 24 hours in advance of the plugging of the well in
order that this office can witness the plugging operation. Failure to obtain approval prior to
commencement of abandonment operations shall result in immediate assessment under 43 CFR
3163.1 (b)(3). The following will occur if the well is abandoned:
a. In order to reduce the visual impact of the reclaimed well site, the casing shall be cut-off at the
base of the cellar or 3 feet below the final restored ground level (whichever is deeper). The well
bore shall then be covered with a metal plate at least 1/4 inch thick and welded in place. On the

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

c. A temporary steel fence post with an attached placard indicating the well name/number and
location shall be placed adjacent to the well bore until final well site reclamation has been
performed and the Final Abandonment Notice (FAN) is approved.
d. Within 30 days following completion of the well abandonment, you shall file with this
office,subsequent Report of Abandonment (Form 3 160-5). To be included with this report is
where the plugs were placed, volumes of cement used, well bore schematic as plugged, along
with copies of all service company job log and service tickets.
The Operator shall promptly plug and abandon each newly completed, re-completed or producing
well which is not capable of producing in paying quantities. No well may be temporarily abandoned
for more than 30 days without prior approval of the AO. When justified by the Operator, the AO may
authorize additional delays, no one of which may exceed an additional 12 months. Upon removal of
drilling or producing equipment from the site of a well which is to be permanently abandoned, the surface
of the lands disturbed shall be reclaimed in accordance with a plan first approved or prescribed by the AO
or per the reclamation conditions of approval stated herein.

SITE SPECIFIC
Additional COAs are usually included with the above to reflect requirements that apply to local
conditions, such as seasonal wildlife restrictions, special surveys, specific constraints on road or well pad
location or construction, and/or additional reclamation requirements.

RIGHT-OF-WAY TERMS AND CONDITIONS
In the process of acquiring permission to obtain a right-of-way, users submit a Form SF-299 to the BLM
Field Office that manages the public lands where their proposed project is located. Included with the
Form SF-299 are:




a Plan of Development that contains a description of the proposed project (map, location, details of
construction, and methods for containment and disposal of waste material), geologic data, expected
hazards, and proposed mitigation measures to address such hazards; and
a reclamation plan, which includes a weed management plan.

When the BLM has completed the necessary environmental and technical review of the proposal, the
BLM may approve the right-of-way as submitted or, more typically, approve the right-of-way subject to
terms and conditions (T&C) on a grant.
T&C are attached to an approved grant to ensure environmental protection, safety, and/or conservation of
the mineral resource. They arise from a variety of controlling authorities such as Title V of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (FLPMA), Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act
of 1920 (MLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The T&C attached to a grant can be general in nature or
site-specific, and thus will vary from one BLM Field Office to another. Often the Field Office RMP
provides either a listing of potential T&C or the BMPs that might guide development of site-specific
T&C in that area. They can address topics as wide-ranging as protection of wildlife habitat or
archeological and paleontological sites, noise reduction, wildfire suppression, or management of invasive
species. Following is a master list of T&C that are used in the Rawlins Field Office when considering a
right-of-way. The list is adapted as needed for site-specific use. Many of the items listed will not be used
on a specific grant if not warranted. If, on the other hand, conditions call for requirements that are not on
the list, BLM specialists can add new T&C. The list is presented in the standard format used for
attachment to an approved grant.

(including, but not limited to, drain sumps, sludge holdings, and chemical containers), shall be within
secondary containment, impervious to those fluids, exclusive of wildlife and livestock, with animal/bird
escape capability, and able to contain a minimum of 110% of the volume of the largest storage vessel,
respective to content, or 100% with at least one foot of freeboard, whichever is greater, so that any spill or
leakage would not drain, infiltrate, or otherwise escape to ground water, surface water, or navigable waters
before cleanup can be completed (within 72 hours).

d.

The holder shall comply with the construction practices and mitigating measures established by 33 CFR
323.4, which sets forth the parameters of the "nationwide permit" required by Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act. If the proposed action exceeds the parameters of the nationwide permit, the holder shall obtain
an individual permit from the appropriate office of the Army Corps of Engineers and provide the AO with
a copy of same. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be cause for suspension or termination of
this right-of-way grant.

maintain the integrity of the surrounding containment structure and to prevent livestock and wildlife from
entering the area in case of a leak or spill.

f.

All open vent stack equipment shall be designed and constructed to prevent entry by birds and bats and to
discourage perching.

g.

The holder is prohibited from discharging oil or other pollutants into or upon the navigable waters of the
United States, adjoining shorelines, or the waters of the contiguous zone in violation of Section 311 of the
Clean Water Act as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1321, and the regulations issued there under, or applicable laws of
the State(s) of Wyoming and regulations issued there under. Holder shall give immediate notice of any
such discharge to the AO and such other Federal and State officials as are required by law to be given such
notice.

h.

All above-ground structures not subject to safety requirements shall be painted by the holder to blend with
the natural color of the landscape. The paint used shall be a color which simulates "Standard
Environmental Colors" designated by the Rocky Mountain Five-State Interagency Committee. The color
selected for this pipeline is Shale Green (5Y 4/2).

i.

All roads and parking areas shall be constructed to provide drainage and minimize erosion. Culverts shall
be installed if necessary to maintain drainage. All areas to be used for roads and parking shall be surfaced
with gravel (before the drilling rig or other drilling equipment moves onto the pad).

j.

Emissions of particulate matter from well pad, road, and other facility construction, operation, and
reclamation activities will be minimized by application of water or other dust suppressants. Dust inhibitors
(surfacing materials, dust suppressants, and water) will be used as necessary on locations that present a
fugitive dust problem. The use of chemical dust suppressants on public surface will require prior approval
from the BLM Authorized Officer.

k.

If groundwater or permeable/porous subsoil or bedrock is encountered upon construction of the pad or pits,
or upon drilling and completing shallow holes for surface conductor, rat/mouse holes, or water supply
well, the holder must immediately notify the BLM Authorized Officer (AO) before proceeding.

l.

The holder shall comply with the Hazardous Materials Management Plan/Summary in the EIS, including
requirements to transport, store, utilize, and dispose of hazardous substances. The holder shall maintain a
hazardous substances release contingency plan that shall include, among other things, provision to notify
the BLM Authorized Officer in the event of any release of hazardous substances associated with project
operations.

m.

Interim reclamation of all disturbed areas not needed for production operations, including unnecessary
access roads and pipeline right(s)-of-way, shall commence and be completed within six (6) months from
date of reaching total depth or determination of inactivity. All fill and stockpiled soils shall be distributed
on disturbed areas and the production pad shall be as small as possible to allow for safe and prudent
production operations.

n.

Temporary fencing of the reclaimed well/facilities locations for the first two growing seasons after either
interim or final seeding may be required to exclude livestock and wildlife and to help ensure better revegetation success. Similarly, off-road vehicle prevention measures shall be employed on reclaimed
locations.

o.

Any topsoil to be stockpiled for longer than six (6) months shall be spread in layers of 2 feet maximum
thickness, signed, and stabilized with a suitable cover crop (immediately post-construction and until
successful) as approved of by the AO.

p.

Cathodic protection wells shall be drilled on the existing well pad, placed so as not to interfere with recontouring of cut and fill slopes during interim reclamation, designed and constructed to prevent
commingling and contamination of water aquifers. The AO shall be notified of any water flows at surface
and the problem will be resolved promptly.
Pits:

a.

All oil and gas pits containing fracture/stimulation fluids are required to be lined with an impermeable (12

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

C-31

APPENDIX C—BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL

mil minimum with a permeability less than or equal to 1 X 10-7 cm/sec) liner. The liner shall be physically
and chemically-compatible with all substances which it may contact and shall be of sufficient strength and
thickness to withstand normal installation and use, and installed so that it will not leak. The liner shall be
installed over a smooth sub-grade, matting, or fill materials (e.g. sifted dirt, sand, or bentonite) free of
pockets, loose rocks, and other objects that could damage the liner.
b.

The only fluids/waste materials which are authorized to go into reserve pits are RCRA-exempt exploration
and production wastes.

c.

Any evidence of RCRA non-exempt wastes being put into the reserve pit may result in the BLM
Authorized Officer requiring specific testing and closure requirements.

d.

Flaring of gas into the reserve or completion pits will not be allowed without prior approval from the AO.

e.

Pits are to be dried within six (6) months from the date that total depth was reached and prior to any
backfilling. Trenching or squeezing is prohibited. Pits, once dry, shall be backfilled and compacted with a
minimum cover of five (5) feet of soil, void of any topsoil, vegetation, large stones, rocks or foreign
objects. The pit area shall be mounded to allow for settling and to promote positive surface drainage away
from the pit. Before backfilling synthetically lined reserve pits, those liner portions remaining above the
"mud line" shall be cut off as close to the top of the mud surface as possible and disposed of at an
approved solid waste disposal facility. The pit bottom and remaining liner shall not be trenched, cut,
punctured, or perforated. Installation and operation of any sprinklers, pumps, and related equipment shall
ensure that water spray or mist does not drift outside of pit boundaries.

f.

All pits are required to maintain 2 feet of freeboard. If operations cause fluid levels in pits to rise above
the required freeboard, immediate notification shall be provided to the AO with concurrent steps taken to
cease the introduction of additional fluids, until alternative containment methods can be approved.

g.

For the protection of livestock and wildlife, all pits and open cellars shall be fenced on all sides, with
corner bracing, immediately upon construction. Reserve, flare, completion, and production pits will be
adequately fenced during and after drilling operations until pits are reclaimed so as to effectively keep out
wildlife and livestock. Approved netting (mesh diameter no larger than one inch) is required over any pit
that contains or is identified as containing hydrocarbons or hazardous substances (per RCRA 40 CFR Part
261 or CERCLA Section 101(14) (E)).

h.

Only those hazardous wastes that qualify as exempt, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA), Oil and Gas Exemption, may be disposed of in the reserve pit. Generally, oil or gas wastes are
exempt if they 1) have been sent down hole and then returned to the surface during oil/gas operations
involving exploration, development, or production, or 2) have been generated during the removal of
produced water or other contaminants from the oil/gas production stream. The term hazardous waste, as
referred to above, is defined as a listed (40 CFR 261.31-33) or characteristic (40 CFR 261.20-24)
hazardous waste under RCRA.
Water:

a.

If temporary surface lines are used to transport drilling water, lines shall be placed/removed when the
ground surface is dry; no surface blading is allowed. The surface pipelines must be removed within 30
days after completion (or determination of inactivity) of the well.

b.

All disposal and management of produced water must be in accordance with Onshore Oil and Gas Order
No. 7.

c.

Any changes to water sources/supplies, fate of drilling/completion fluids, routes and means of fluid
transportation, and location or method of produced water disposal must first have written approval from
the AO.

d.

Within 90 days of initial production start-up the holder shall submit to the BLM authorized officer an
analysis of the produced water.

Subject:

Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) System for Paleontological Resources on
Public Lands

Program Areas: Paleontological Resources Management, Resource Management Planning, Lands and
Realty Management, Minerals Management, Range
Purpose: This Instruction Memorandum (IM) transmits the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
classification system for paleontological resources on public lands. The classification system is based on
the potential for the occurrence of significant paleontological resources in a geologic unit, and the
associated risk for impacts to the resource based on Federal management actions. Copies of the
classification system and implementation guidance are attached.
Policy/Action: The Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) system will be used to classify
paleontological resource potential on public lands in order to assess possible resource impacts and
mitigation needs for Federal actions involving surface disturbance, land tenure adjustments, and land-use
planning. Implementation of the PFYC system will not mandate changes to existing land use plans,
project plans, or other completed efforts. Integration into plans presently being developed is
discretionary. All efforts subsequent to issuance of this IM should incorporate the PFYC system. This
system will replace the current Condition Classification in the Handbook (H-8270-1) for Paleontological
Resource Management.
Timeframe: This guidance is effective immediately for all BLM offices.
Background: This classification system for paleontological resources is intended to provide a more
uniform tool to assess potential occurrences of paleontological resources and evaluate possible impacts. It
uses geologic units as base data, which is more readily available to all users. It is intended to be applied in
broad approach for planning efforts, and as an intermediate step in evaluating specific projects. This is
part of a larger effort to update the Handbook H-8270-1 (General Procedural Guidance for
Paleontological Resource Management) Chapter III (Assessment & Mitigation) and Chapter II.A.2 and
will be incorporated into that Handbook update.
Impact on Budget: Costs for the initial classification of geologic units for those States that have not
already determined the classification will be borne by each Office. Implementation of the PFYC system
will have no additional costs.

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Manual/Handbook Affected: Supersedes H-8270-1 (General Procedural Guidance for Paleontological
Resource Management) Chapter II.A.2.
Coordination: The classification system is the product of the BLM’s regional paleontologists, other
BLM employees, and outside reviewers. This system is very similar to the Forest Service’s Fossil Yield
Potential Classification and will enable closer coordination of paleontological resource management
between the agencies.

Attachment 1.
Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) System
Occurrences of paleontological resources are closely tied to the geologic units (i.e., formations, members,
or beds) that contain them. The probability for finding paleontological resources can be broadly predicted
from the geologic units present at or near the surface. Therefore, geologic mapping can be used for
assessing the potential for the occurrence of paleontological resources.
Using the Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) system, geologic units are classified based on the
relative abundance of vertebrate fossils or scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils and their
sensitivity to adverse impacts, with a higher class number indicating a higher potential. This classification
is applied to the geologic formation, member, or other distinguishable unit, preferably at the most detailed
mappable level. It is not intended to be applied to specific paleontological localities or small areas within
units. Although significant localities may occasionally occur in a geologic unit, a few widely scattered
important fossils or localities do not necessarily indicate a higher class; instead, the relative abundance of
significant localities is intended to be the major determinant for the class assignment.
The PFYC system is meant to provide baseline guidance for predicting, assessing, and mitigating
paleontological resources. The classification should be considered at an intermediate point in the analysis,
and should be used to assist in determining the need for further mitigation assessment or actions.
The descriptions for the classes below are written to serve as guidelines rather than as strict definitions.
Knowledge of the geology and the paleontological potential for individual units or preservational
conditions should be considered when determining the appropriate class assignment. Assignments are
best made by collaboration between land managers and knowledgeable researchers.
Class 1 – Very Low. Geologic units that are not likely to contain recognizable fossil remains.



Units that are igneous or metamorphic, excluding reworked volcanic ash units.
Units that are Precambrian in age or older.

(1) Management concern for paleontological resources in Class 1 units is usually negligible or not
applicable.
(2) Assessment or mitigation is usually unnecessary except in very rare or isolated circumstances.
The probability for impacting any fossils is negligible. Assessment or mitigation of paleontological
resources is usually unnecessary. The occurrence of significant fossils is non-existent or extremely rare.
Class 2 – Low. Sedimentary geologic units that are not likely to contain vertebrate fossils or scientifically
significant nonvertebrate fossils.





Vertebrate or significant invertebrate or plant fossils not present or very rare.
Units that are generally younger than 10,000 years before present.
Recent aeolian deposits.
Sediments that exhibit significant physical and chemical changes (i.e., diagenetic alteration).

(1) Management concern for paleontological resources is generally low.
(2) Assessment or mitigation is usually unnecessary except in rare or isolated circumstances.
The probability for impacting vertebrate fossils or scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils is
low. Assessment or mitigation of paleontological resources is not likely to be necessary. Localities
containing important resources may exist, but would be rare and would not influence the classification.
These important localities would be managed on a case-by-case basis.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

D-3

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Class 3 – Moderate or Unknown. Fossiliferous sedimentary geologic units where fossil content varies in
significance, abundance, and predictable occurrence; or sedimentary units of unknown fossil potential.



Often marine in origin with sporadic known occurrences of vertebrate fossils.
Vertebrate fossils and scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils known to occur
intermittently; predictability known to be low.



Poorly studied and/or poorly documented. Potential yield cannot be assigned without ground
reconnaissance.

(or)

Class 3a – Moderate Potential. Units are known to contain vertebrate fossils or scientifically
significant nonvertebrate fossils, but these occurrences are widely scattered. Common
invertebrate or plant fossils may be found in the area, and opportunities may exist for hobby
collecting. The potential for a project to be sited on or impact a significant fossil locality is low,
but is somewhat higher for common fossils.
Class 3b – Unknown Potential. Units exhibit geologic features and preservational conditions
that suggest significant fossils could be present, but little information about the paleontological
resources of the unit or the area is known. This may indicate the unit or area is poorly studied,
and field surveys may uncover significant finds. The units in this Class may eventually be placed
in another Class when sufficient survey and research is performed. The unknown potential of the
units in this Class should be carefully considered when developing any mitigation or management
actions.
(1) Management concern for paleontological resources is moderate; or cannot be determined from
existing data.
(2) Surface-disturbing activities may require field assessment to determine appropriate course of
action.
This classification includes a broad range of paleontological potential. It includes geologic units of
unknown potential, as well as units of moderate or infrequent occurrence of significant fossils.
Management considerations cover a broad range of options as well, and could include pre-disturbance
surveys, monitoring, or avoidance. Surface-disturbing activities will require sufficient assessment to
determine whether significant paleontological resources occur in the area of a proposed action, and
whether the action could affect the paleontological resources. These units may contain areas that would be
appropriate to designate as hobby collection areas due to the higher occurrence of common fossils and a
lower concern about affecting significant paleontological resources.
Class 4 – High. Geologic units containing a high occurrence of significant fossils. Vertebrate fossils or
scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils are known to occur and have been documented, but
may vary in occurrence and predictability. Surface disturbing activities may adversely affect
paleontological resources in many cases.
Class 4a – Unit is exposed with little or no soil or vegetative cover. Outcrop areas are extensive
with exposed bedrock areas often larger than two acres. Paleontological resources may be
susceptible to adverse impacts from surface disturbing actions. Illegal collecting activities may
impact some areas.
Class 4b – These are areas underlain by geologic units with high potential but have lowered risks
of human-caused adverse impacts and/or lowered risk of natural degradation due to moderating
circumstances. The bedrock unit has high potential, but a protective layer of soil, thin alluvial
material, or other conditions may lessen or prevent potential impacts to the bedrock resulting
from the activity.

D-4

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE






Extensive soil or vegetative cover; bedrock exposures are limited or not expected to be
impacted.
Areas of exposed outcrop are smaller than two contiguous acres.
Outcrops form cliffs of sufficient height and slope so that impacts are minimized by
topographic conditions.
Other characteristics are present that lower the vulnerability of both known and unidentified
paleontological resources.

(1) Management concern for paleontological resources in Class 4 is moderate to high, depending on
the proposed action.
(2) A field survey by a qualified paleontologist is often needed to assess local conditions.
(3) Management prescriptions for resource preservation and conservation through controlled access
or special management designation should be considered.
(4) Class 4 and Class 5 units may be combined as Class 5 for broad applications, such as planning
efforts or preliminary assessments, when geologic mapping at an appropriate scale is not
available. Resource assessment, mitigation, and other management considerations are similar at
this level of analysis, and impacts and alternatives can be addressed at a level appropriate to the
application.
The probability for impacting significant paleontological resources is moderate to high, and is dependent
on the proposed action. Mitigation considerations must include assessment of the disturbance, such as
removal or penetration of protective surface alluvium or soils, potential for future accelerated erosion, or
increased ease of access resulting in greater looting potential. If impacts to significant fossils can be
anticipated, on-the-ground surveys prior to authorizing the surface disturbing action will usually be
necessary. On-site monitoring or spot-checking may be necessary during construction activities.
Class 5 – Very High. Highly fossiliferous geologic units that consistently and predictably produce
vertebrate fossils or scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils, and that are at risk of humancaused adverse impacts or natural degradation.
Class 5a – Unit is exposed with little or no soil or vegetative cover. Outcrop areas are extensive
with exposed bedrock areas often larger than two contiguous acres. Paleontological resources are
highly susceptible to adverse impacts from surface disturbing actions. Unit is frequently the focus
of illegal collecting activities.
Class 5b – These are areas underlain by geologic units with very high potential but have lowered
risks of human-caused adverse impacts and/or lowered risk of natural degradation due to
moderating circumstances. The bedrock unit has very high potential, but a protective layer of soil,
thin alluvial material, or other conditions may lessen or prevent potential impacts to the bedrock
resulting from the activity.





Extensive soil or vegetative cover; bedrock exposures are limited or not expected to be
impacted.
Areas of exposed outcrop are smaller than two contiguous acres.
Outcrops form cliffs of sufficient height and slope so that impacts are minimized by
topographic conditions.
Other characteristics are present that lower the vulnerability of both known and unidentified
paleontological resources.

(1) Management concern for paleontological resources in Class 5 areas is high to very high.

(2) A field survey by a qualified paleontologist is usually necessary prior to surface disturbing
activities or land tenure adjustments. Mitigation will often be necessary before and/or during
these actions.
(3) Official designation of areas of avoidance, special interest, and concern may be appropriate.
The probability for impacting significant fossils is high. Vertebrate fossils or scientifically significant
invertebrate fossils are known or can reasonably be expected to occur in the impacted area. On-the­
ground surveys prior to authorizing any surface-disturbing activities will usually be necessary. Onsite
monitoring may be necessary during construction activities.

Attachment 2.
Guidance for Implementing the Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) System

Introduction
The Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) system will aid in assessing the potential for discovery
of significant paleontological resources or the impact of surface disturbing activities to these resources.
It is intended to assist in determining proper mitigation approaches for surface disturbing activities,
disposal or acquisition actions, recreation possibilities or limitations, and other BLM-approved activities.
It will provide consistent information for input and analysis during planning efforts. The PFYC system
can also highlight the areas most likely to be a focus of paleontological research efforts or illegal
collecting. It is hoped that this system will allow BLM to direct management efforts toward potentially
significant areas and reduce efforts in areas of lower potential.
This classification system was originally developed by the Forest Service’s Paleontology Center of
Excellence and the Region 2 (FS) Paleontology Initiative in 1996. Modifications were made by the
BLM’s Paleontological Resources staff in subsequent years.
Paleontological resources are closely associated with the geologic rock units containing them; that is,
fossils are found more frequently in some rock units than others. The management of paleontological
resources can thus be tied to the geologic units present at or near the ground surface, with greater
management emphasis aimed at higher potential geologic units.

Uses
This PFYC system is utilized for land use planning efforts and for the preliminary assessment of potential
impacts and proper mitigation needs for specific projects. It is intended to provide a tool to assess
potential occurrences of significant paleontological resources. It is meant to be applied in broad approach
for planning efforts, and as an intermediate step in evaluating specific projects.
There are five Classes with Class 1 being Very Low Potential and Class 5 being Very High Potential.
Although granite, lava beds, and other igneous or metamorphic rock types are usually considered to be
void of any fossils, outcrops of these rocks may have fissure fillings, cave-like structures, sinkholes, and
other features that may preserve significant paleontological resources or information, so the potential is
not zero; therefore Class 1 is applied to these rock types usually considered not to contain fossil resources.
It is intended that this system replace the current Condition Classification in the Handbook (H-8270-1),
for Paleontological Resource Management. In general, the following is a comparison of the Condition
Classification rankings to the new PFYC Classes:
Classes: Condition (from H-8270-1)

PFYC Class (this Instruction Memorandum)

Condition 1 – Areas known to contain vertebrate fossils
or noteworthy occurrences of invertebrate or plant
fossils. (Note: this refers to known localities or groups
of localities)

PFYC Class 4 (High) or Class 5 (Very High), based on
geologic unit.

Condition 2 – Areas with exposures of geological units
or settings that have high potential to contain
vertebrate fossils or noteworthy occurrences of
invertebrate or plant fossils.

PFYC Class 3 (Moderate), Class 4 (High), or Class 5
(Very High), based on geologic unit.

Condition 3 – Areas that are very unlikely to produce
vertebrate fossils or noteworthy occurrences of
invertebrate or plant fossils.

PFYC Class 1 (Very Low) or Class 2 (Low).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Assignment of Classes
A separate class ranking is assigned to each recognized geologic formation or member present at the
surface. Deposits of young alluvium (post-Pleistocene) or thick soils can often be ignored. However,
geologic mapping may not separate the older Pleistocene alluvium which, may contain significant
vertebrate fossils, and thus these units need to be carefully considered. Available geologic mapping,
depending on map scale, may combine multiple formations or units. In these cases, the assigned
classification should use the highest class of those included units. For ease of application, the
classifications should be integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) based geologic map.
The classification is initially determined by the Regional Paleontologist; the State Office Paleontology
Lead in collaboration with the Regional Paleontologist; or by knowledgeable individuals from a
paleontology museum, university paleontology department, or consulting firm working under a formal
agreement. Several States have already completed an initial classification and are incorporating the
system into new planning and mitigation efforts.
To maintain consistency in planning efforts, mitigation requirements, and other management approaches,
the classification should be applied to each formation on a state-wide basis, and even across State
boundaries. But in some situations, geologic characteristics within formations may change across the
State or region and may alter the potential for fossil occurrence. These differences may be a characteristic
of the formation, be variable in occurrence, and unmappable at a workable scale; or may indicate a
regional gradient, where a formation is highly fossiliferous in one portion of the State, but has lowered
potential in another area. A variable occurrence in potential may be included in the general information
about the formation. A regional gradient can be addressed by assigning a different class for separate areas.
Multiple class assignments for an individual formation should be applied in consultation with the State
Office to maintain consistency across Field Office boundaries.
Over time, additional information may be acquired or developed that may suggest that a change in the
class assignment is appropriate, especially from the Unknown Class (3b) to a higher or lower class. The
classification should reflect the most current information, and recent research or discoveries may indicate
a change is warranted. However, any changes should be measured against existing applications or use of
the current classification, such as usage in Resource Management Plans (RMPs) or other planning or
management documents.

Application
In planning documents and other general applications, these classes allow for uniform discussion of the
paleontologic resource, potential adverse impacts, and management approaches. Assessment of general
conditions, such as acres or percentages of each class, or spatial identification of important areas can be
determined and presented in simple manner. Identification of areas of potential concern with other
resources can be identified using GIS mapping or explained in the text body in simple fashion.
The PFYC classes may also be utilized to assess the possibility of adverse or beneficial impacts from land
tenure adjustment (disposal or acquisition) proposals prior to on-the-ground surveys.
A primary purpose of the PFYC is to assess the possible impacts from surface disturbing activities and
help determine the need for pre-disturbance surveys and monitoring during construction. This assessment
should be an intermediate step in the analysis process; and local conditions such as amount of exposed
bedrock should be considered when final mitigation needs are determined. The determination should also
be supplemented by occurrences of known fossil localities and local geologic and topographic knowledge.

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Mitigation Needs Assessment
Impacts of most surface-disturbing activities, and the need for mitigation efforts, are addressed by the
local Field Office. Some larger actions, such as major pipeline projects, may be handled by the State
Office, or even as multi-State projects. In all these cases, the assessment of impacts to paleontological
resources and need for mitigation can be addressed in similar fashion through a progression of steps. The
following outlines the general steps used to apply the PFYC system to this mitigation process.
1. Identify the Proposed Action and affected area. Consider the area directly impacted by the action,
as well as areas that may be impacted by vehicle drive ways, equipment parking, storage areas, and
increased access. Also consider the depth of disturbance to determine possible subsurface impacts.
2. Identify the potential impacts to paleontological resources. Determine the geologic units that may
be impacted and the associated PFYC classes, and consult other sources of information about known
localities or paleontological research that may have been done previously.
Based on the PFYC class and any additional resource information, determine the probability of
impacting significant paleontological resources. If known localities are in the area of possible impact,
determine if those localities can be avoided by altering the proposed action, such as repositioning a
well pad location or rerouting a pipeline around a locality.
3. Determine the need for field survey or other mitigation efforts. On-the-ground field surveys, onsite monitoring, spot-checking at key times during construction, or locality avoidance are all possible
mitigation approaches to lessen adverse impacts.

If the PFYC class for the impacted area is Class 1 or 2, and there are no known localities within
the area, no further assessment is typically needed.
If a Class 3a (Moderate Potential) unit underlies the area, the local geologic conditions should be
considered, as well as any known localities in the region. It may be necessary to consult with the
Regional Paleontologist or other qualified paleontologist to assess the local conditions.
If a Class 3b (Unknown Potential) unit underlies the area, it may be appropriate to require an onsite preliminary assessment by a qualified paleontologist.
If the area is a Class 4b (buried bedrock with High Potential) or Class 5b (buried bedrock with
Very High Potential), an assessment of the possible impacts to bedrock units must be made. If the
proposed action will not penetrate the protective soil or alluvial layer, a pre-work survey or
monitoring during the activity may not be necessary. If the potential exists to remove the
protective layer and impact the bedrock unit below, it may be prudent to require a pre-work field
survey and/or on-site monitoring during disturbance or spot-checks at key times. Because the
bedrock unit is typically buried for much of the area in question, a pre-work survey may not
always be necessary, as the fossil material may not be visible. However, it may then be more
important to have an on-site monitor during disturbance or spot-checks at key times.
If it is a Class 4a (exposed bedrock with High Potential) or Class 5a (exposed bedrock with Very
High Potential) area, it will be necessary in most (Class 4a) or almost all (Class 5a) situations to
require a pre-activity field survey of the areas directly and indirectly impacted.
Larger projects may impact multiple geologic units with differing PFYC Classes. In those cases,
field survey and monitoring may be applied at differing levels. For example, surveys may be
appropriate only on the Class 4 and 5 formations and not the Class 2 formations along a pipeline
project. Careful mapping and detailed field notes should reflect the differing survey/monitoring
intensities, and should be included in the consultant’s report to BLM.

4. Conduct Pre-work Field Survey. Field surveys are almost always needed for Class 4 and 5 units,
especially exposed bedrock areas (Class 4a and 5a). Class 3 units may or may not require a survey.

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Local conditions, such as vegetated areas or pockets of bedrock exposure, may affect the need and
intensity of field surveys.
The consultant is required to submit a report of findings after completion of the field survey. In
addition to standard reporting information, the report should contain the consultants’
recommendations for further mitigation, and this recommendation should be considered when
determining the need for and type of on-site monitoring or locality avoidance.
5. Monitor during disturbance activities. Those areas that have been determined to have a Very High
potential (Class 5) for adverse impacts should typically be monitored at all times when surfacedisturbing activities are occurring. If the area has a High potential (Class 4), it may be appropriate to
examine the exposed unit, including the spoil or storage piles, only at key times. These times are
dependent on the activity, but typically are: when bedrock is initially exposed, occasionally during
active excavation, and when the maximum exposure is reached and before backfilling has begun. This
monitoring and spot-checking must be performed by a permitted paleontologist or their BLMapproved representative. The monitor has the authority to briefly pause any activity to inspect a
possible find. These pauses are intended to allow for identification of possible fossil resources and
should only last a few minutes to a couple hours.
6. Evaluate significant finds. If significant paleontological resources are discovered during surface
disturbing actions or at any other time, the proponent or any of his agents must: (a) stop work
immediately at that site; (b) contact the appropriate BLM representative, typically the project
inspector or Authorized Officer, as soon as possible; and (c) make every effort to protect the site from
further impacts, including looting, erosion, or other human or natural damage. The BLM or
designated paleontologist will evaluate the discovery and take action to protect or remove the
resource within 10 working days. Work may not resume at that location until approved by the official
BLM representative. In some cases, such as recovery of a dinosaur, further activity at that site may be
delayed until the discovered fossils are recovered, or until the project is modified to avoid impacting
the find. Because of the potential for lengthy delays, the BLM should assure that the project
proponent understands this possibility prior to approval to begin work.
These steps are included here to provide general guidance, and it may be appropriate to modify or skip
them for various situations. However, a brief discussion of the background and reason for modification
should be placed in the project file.

For all surface-disturbing activities occurring within Class 3 or higher units, a stipulation should be
included in the permitting document.

Further Information
Detailed information on the geologic units and paleontological resources within a State can often be
obtained from State geological surveys, geological or paleontological museums, geology departments at
universities or colleges, paleontological permittees or other researchers or within the BLM from Regional
Paleontologists or knowledgeable Geologists.
Scientific publications, such as professional journals or State geological survey reports, often contain
general and detailed information about paleontological and geological resources relevant to fossil
potential and occurrences for specific areas. Current and past paleontological permittee reports usually
include precise locality data and maps, and often contain discussions of findings and their significance.

Assessment and Mitigation of Potential Impacts to Paleontological Resources

Program Areas: Paleontological Resources Management, Environmental Assessment
Purpose: This Instruction Memorandum (IM) provides guidelines for assessing potential impacts to
paleontological resources in order to determine mitigation steps for federal actions on public lands under
the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA). These guidelines also apply where a federal action impacts split-estate lands. In addition, this
IM provides field survey and monitoring procedures to help minimize impacts to paleontological
resources from federal actions in the case where it is determined that significant paleontological resources
will be adversely affected by a federal action.
Policy/Action: It is the policy of the BLM that potential impacts from federal actions on public lands,
including land tenure adjustments, be identified and assessed, and proper mitigation actions be
implemented when necessary to protect scientifically significant paleontological resources. This policy
also applies to federal actions impacting split-estate lands and is subject to the right of landowners to
preclude evaluation and mitigation of paleontological resources on their land. Paleontological resources
removed from public lands require a Paleontological Resources Use permit for collection. Significant
paleontological resources collected from public lands are federal property and must be deposited in an
approved repository. Paleontological resources collected from split-estate lands are the property of the
surface-estate owner, and their disposition will be in accordance with the surface agreement between the
landowner and the permittee.
Timeframe: This guidance is effective immediately for all BLM offices.
Background: Surface disturbing activities may cause direct adverse impacts to paleontological resources
through the damage or destruction of fossils; or loss of valuable scientific information by the disturbance
of the stratigraphic context in which fossils are found. Indirect adverse impacts may be created by
increased accessibility to important paleontological resources leading to looting or vandalism. Land
tenure adjustments may result in the loss of significant paleontological resources to the public if
paleontological resources pass from public ownership. Generally, the project proponent is responsible for
the cost of implementing mitigation measures including the costs of investigation, salvage and curation of
paleontological resources.
This IM together with the Potential Fossil Yield Classification system (PFYC; see IM 2008-009) will
provide guidance for the assessment of potential impacts to paleontological resources, field survey and

monitoring procedures, and recommended mitigation measures that will better protect paleontological
resources impacted by federal actions. This guidance expands and clarifies the guidance in the Handbook
H-8270-1 (General Procedural Guidance for Paleontological Resource Management) Chapter III
(Assessment & Mitigation) and will be incorporated into the next Handbook revision.
Impact on Budget: Costs are minimal for implementation of this guidance since mitigation of
paleontological resources is already part of any approval of surface-disturbing actions on public lands.

Paleontological Resource Management) Chapter III.B.

Attachment 1.
Guidelines for Assessment and Mitigation of
Potential Impacts to Paleontological Resources

Introduction
Surface disturbing federal actions on public and split-estate lands may cause direct adverse impacts
to paleontological resources through the damage or destruction of fossils or the disturbance of the
stratigraphic context in which they are located. Indirect adverse impacts may be created from
increased accessibility to fossils leading to looting or vandalism activities. Land tenure adjustments
may result in the loss of significant paleontological resources to the public if fossils pass from public
ownership.
Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), federal actions and land tenure adjustments that may impact or result in a loss of
paleontological resources on public or split-estate lands are evaluated, and necessary mitigation is
identified.

Assessment of Potential Impacts to Paleontological Resources
The following sections outline general steps designed to assist in the analysis and assessment of
possible impacts to paleontological resources from proposed actions. These sections are sequential in
order and provide for termination of the assessment at various stages if the analysis indicates no
impacts are likely to occur.
A. Scoping. Field Offices must assess all proposed federal actions to identify possible effects to
significant paleontological resources (see Appendix A for definition) that are potentially
recoverable and are likely to be within the zone of expected surface disturbance or relatively
close to the surface. The direct effects of all surface activities and the indirect effects of
increased public access and land tenure adjustments must be considered in any paleontological
assessment. The assessment will determine whether further analysis will be necessary. The
Paleontology Program Coordinator (Paleontology Coordinator – see Appendix A for definition)
has primary responsibility for the scoping process for projects within the Field Office area, but
the Paleontology Program Lead (Paleontology Lead – see Appendix A for definition) may be
responsible for projects that span multiple Field or District Offices, and can support the
Paleontology Coordinator as requested.
1. Surface only activities – If the proposed project will not disturb potentially fossil-yielding
bedrock or alluvium, no additional work is necessary. The project file should be documented
as appropriate. Examples of such projects include weed spraying, mechanical brush
treatment, geophysical exploration, or surface disturbing activities such as road construction
when the fossil resource is expected to be buried well below project compression or
excavation depth or when surface fossil resources would be left undamaged.
2. Land Tenure Adjustments – If parcels are identified to pass from public ownership in a
proposed land tenure adjustment action but contain no potential for recoverable, significant
paleontological resources, no additional work is necessary. The project file should be
documented as appropriate, and conclusions addressed in the environmental document. This
situation may arise, for example, in areas consisting only of granitic bedrock where
paleontological resources would not normally occur.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

D-13

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

3. Young alluvial deposits or deep soils may cover and obscure sedimentary bedrock, and any
fossils that may occur in that bedrock would be unidentifiable or irretrievable prior to
disturbance actions. In most of these cases, the fossil resources cannot be quantified, but the
potential for impacting paleontological resources should be mentioned in the evaluation of
the proposal, i.e., the planned disturbance will pass through the soil layer and impact a
bedrock unit which is known to contain significant fossils elsewhere.
If the initial scoping identifies the possibility for adversely affecting significant
paleontological resources, further analysis is necessary. If there will be no impact or potential
impact based on the action or the fossil resource may be impacted, but is too deep to be
recovered, e.g., deep well bore passing through a fossil formation, the project file must be
documented, and no additional assessment is necessary.
B. Analysis of Existing Data. If scoping suggests the possibility of disturbing fossil-yielding
bedrock or alluvium that is near to the surface and that may contain significant paleontological
resources that are potentially recoverable, more in-depth analysis is necessary. Geologic mapping
reflecting the Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) should be consulted, along with any other
easily accessible information, such as GIS-based locality data, other known paleontological locality
information, and existing paleontological reports for the area, aerial photos, or soils maps.
1. Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) – This is a system for categorizing the
probability of geologic units to contain scientifically significant paleontological resources or
noteworthy fossil occurrences. It has five levels or Classes, with Class 1 applied to geologic
units that are not likely to contain significant fossils through Class 5 for geologic formations
that have a high potential to yield scientifically significant fossils on a regular basis (see IM
No. 2008-009). This classification does not reflect rare or isolated occurrences of significant
fossils or individual localities, only the relative occurrence on a formation- or member-wide
basis. Any rare occurrences may require additional assessment and mitigation if they fall
within the area of anticipated impacts.
2. If the results of the preliminary analysis determine that the proposed project will only affect
geologic units not likely to contain significant fossils or that have a very low or low potential
for significant fossils (PFYC Class 1or 2), and no scientifically important localities are
known to occur in the area, the project file should be documented, and no additional
paleontology assessment is necessary.
3. The results of an analysis of a proposed project may indicate the potential to disturb PFYC
Class 3, 4, or 5 formations or potentially fossil-bearing alluvium, or known significant
localities, which may then suggest the need for field surveys and/or other mitigation
measures. The results may also identify areas where little or nothing is known of the fossil
record so that additional attention may be given to these areas during field survey. The
analysis should consider the likely impacts on the known or potential fossil resource and
should be the basis for determining the need for or level of additional assessments.
C. Determining the Need for Field Surveys and Mitigation. The previously discussed procedures
may result in the determination that the project may encounter bedrock or an alluvial zone that has a
moderate or high potential to contain significant paleontological resources. However, it does not
determine the appropriate action, such as a field survey, on-site monitoring, special stipulations,
avoidance, or other mitigation.
1. If the need for further work is not clearly evident after the analysis, the Authorized Officer
and/or Project Leader should be consulted for a final decision. The Paleontology Lead or
Regional Paleontologist may also be consulted. A brief written report of findings should be

D-14

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

prepared, including the rationale for supporting the decision not to require a field survey or
additional monitoring. The report should be signed by the Authorized Officer and placed in
the project file. For example, a seismic survey using vibroseis trucks may be proposed on
areas of deep soils, or a temporary recreational event may be planned in an area of low fossil
potential. These types of projects are not likely to have a reasonable potential to adversely
affect important paleontological resources. The file should be documented and a standard
discovery stipulation attached to the permit proposal.
2. If the analysis in Sec. I.B indicates a reasonably high expectation of not just encountering a
potential fossil-bearing zone and also causing adverse impacts to significant paleontological
resources, the determination must be made as to (1) whether adverse effects cannot be
avoided; (2) whether the adverse impacts can be avoided by altering the location or scope of
the project; (3) whether the impacts can be mitigated through development of special
stipulations such as requiring on-site monitoring; or (4) whether field surveys will be
necessary to determine the presence or absence of significant paleontological resources.
3. In the case where it is known that significant paleontological resources will be adversely
impacted, the preferred course of action is avoidance of the impact by moving or rerouting
the site of construction, or eliminating or reducing the need for surface disturbance.
4. Application of specific stipulations may reduce or eliminate adverse impacts in many cases.
A standard discovery stipulation should be included in any permit approval that is likely to
affect significant paleontological resources. The stipulation should mandate an immediate
work stoppage in the area of discovery, notification to the Authorized Officer, and protection
of the material and geological context. Other stipulations may be appropriate on a case-by­
case basis.
(a) A suggested standard discovery stipulation for a discretionary federal action is:
The permittee shall immediately notify the BLM Authorized Officer of any paleontological
resources discovered as a result of operations under this authorization. The permittee shall
suspend all activities in the vicinity of such discovery until notified to proceed by the
Authorized Officer and shall protect the discovery from damage or looting. The permittee
may not be required to suspend all operations if activities can be adjusted to avoid further
impacts to a discovered locality or be continued elsewhere. The Authorized Officer will
evaluate, or will have evaluated, such discoveries as soon as possible, but not later than 10
working days after being notified. Appropriate measures to mitigate adverse effects to
significant paleontological resources will be determined by the Authorized Officer after
consulting with the operator. Within 10 days, the operator will be allowed to continue
construction through the site, or will be given the choice of either (1) following the
Authorized Officer’s instructions for stabilizing the fossil resource in place and avoiding
further disturbance to the fossil resource, or (2) following the Authorized Officer’s
instructions for mitigating impacts to the fossil resource prior to continuing construction
through the project area.
Note: C.1 and C.2 above would be conducted at the permittee's expense. By regulation, after
a 3809 plan of operations is approved or where there is no plan, the BLM is responsible for
the cost of any investigation and recovery of fossil materials.
(b) Other stipulations may be developed to reduce potential impacts, preferably in
consultation with the project proponent. These may include (1) techniques to reduce surface
disturbance, (2) briefings for all personnel about the potential for discovery, (3) requiring all
finds be reported, and (3) using a "light touch" in sensitive areas. These should be made a

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

formal part of the authorization for the project and discussed at a preconstruction meeting or
an on-site meeting in the case of oil and gas operations.
(c) All proponents should be directed to share the current rules and regulations regarding
fossil theft and the limitations to free use collecting of invertebrate and plant fossils on BLMadministered lands with all employees and subcontractors under their direction. Unlawful
removal, damage, or vandalism of paleontological resources will be prosecuted by federal
law enforcement. Theft or damage to government property by a proponent, a proponent’s
employee, or a subcontractor that is under a proponent’s direction may lead to legal actions
against the proponent.
5. If avoidance actions or stipulating measures are insufficient to protect known paleontological
resources, a written assessment must be completed to determine the need for field survey or
monitoring. This assessment must include the anticipated direct or indirect impacts associated
with the project, the inadequacies of avoidance or special stipulations to protect the resource,
existing paleontological information and known localities, relevant geologic information, and
the potential for additional discoveries. The assessment must be completed by the
Paleontology Coordinator.
(a) In some cases, bedrock will not be visible at the surface in the project area (for example,
where thin soils or alluvium obscure all outcrops), but the proposed excavation will likely
penetrate into bedrock with known significant paleontological resources. Because fossil
material will not be visible at the ground surface in these cases, it may be appropriate to
forego a field survey prior to excavation, but require on-site monitoring or spot-checks when
bedrock is finally encountered. If construction monitoring is proposed, the written assessment
must include a thorough justification for the recommendation.
(b) The State Office may require the Paleontology Coordinator to notify the Paleontology
Lead that a field survey or monitoring is deemed appropriate prior to the final decision to
require the survey or monitoring. The notification should minimally include the name of the
project, the legal description of the location or other locational information, a brief summary
of the proposed action, reason(s) for the decision to require a survey or monitoring, and any
other relevant information. Concurrence of the Paleontology Lead or Regional Paleontologist
may be required prior to the final decision for requiring a survey or monitoring.
(c) A standardized assessment document may be developed that can be applied to projects
that are similar in nature, relatively small, and repetitive in approach for use within a Field
Office or District. This written assessment is intended to simplify the documentation process
for those projects that are likely to have minimal impacts, and may be structured as a
programmatic assessment, a form, a checklist, or other document with standard items. This
assessment must include the name of the project, the legal description of the location or other
locational reference, a brief summary of the proposed action, reason(s) for the decision, and
any other relevant information. The parameters in the assessment should be designed to
identify the need for a field survey. For example, the parameters may indicate a field survey
may be required for road and well pad construction activities occurring on Class 4 or 5
formations where the formation is likely to be encountered during surface disturbing
activities. The Field Manager, in consultation with the Paleontology Lead, must approve the
use of a programmatic assessment prior to initial implementation.
6. The decision to require a field survey or monitoring must be made by the Authorized Officer
and documented in the project file. If required, a copy of the decision must be furnished to
the Paleontology Lead.

II.

Procedures for Conducting a Paleontological Field Survey

If the assessment of existing data indicates: (a) the presence or high probability of occurrence of
vertebrate fossils or uncommon nonvertebrate fossils (PFYC Class 4 or 5), or that the probability is
unknown (Class 3), in the area of a proposed federal action or transfer of title, and (b) a reasonable
probability that those resources will be adversely affected by the proposed action, a paleontological
field survey should be conducted.
A. Definition of Field Surveys. Field Surveys are pedestrian surveys to be performed in areas where
significant fossils can be expected to occur within the boundary and immediate vicinity of the
anticipated disturbance, or where the probability of encountering significant fossils is unknown.
1. Field surveys are performed prior to any surface disturbing activities. Before conducting field
surveys, the project location should be as final as possible and any staking of the location
should be complete.
2. Surveys are conducted by a BLM Regional Paleontologist, Paleontology Lead, Paleontology
Coordinator, appropriately trained and supervised BLM staff, or by a BLM-permitted
consulting paleontologist hired by the project proponent.
(a) At the Field Manager’s discretion, other qualified BLM staff may conduct surveys on
small projects. Performance of surveys by BLM staff must also be approved by the Regional
Paleontologist, Paleontology Lead, or Paleontology Coordinator.
(b) Surveys that are complex in nature, constrained by construction schedules, or otherwise
cannot be performed by BLM staff should be performed by a consulting paleontologist
holding a valid BLM Paleontological Resources Use Permit. Submission of reports may be
done directly by the paleontologist to the BLM. The project proponent is also responsible for
all costs associated with the survey, including the consulting paleontologist’s fees and
charges, all survey costs, fossil preparation to the basic identification stage, analyses, reports,
and curation costs directly related to mitigation of the project’s anticipated impacts. Any
required monitoring and mitigation costs are also the responsibility of the project proponent.
These costs are to be negotiated between the project proponent and the consulting
paleontologist prior to beginning any data gathering, analysis, or field work, and these
negotiations do not require BLM involvement or approval. Any new, additional, or modified
curation agreements between the paleontologist and the official repository must be in place
prior to starting field work.
(c) Authorization for an activity to proceed cannot be given by a consulting paleontologist.
Performance of the survey, either by a consulting paleontologist or BLM staff, or submission
of the report DOES NOT constitute approval for the activity to proceed. The BLM must
review the report, including adequacy of the field methods and findings. The Authorized
Officer must approve the findings and determine the need for monitoring prior to approval to
proceed.
B. Conducting Field Surveys. Field surveys must be performed by the Principal Investigator or an
approved Field Agent or Field Monitor (see section IV.C., Types of Field Personnel for descriptions
of these individuals) as authorized under a Paleontological Resource Use Permit, or by a BLM
Regional Paleontologist or qualified BLM designee. Field surveys and collections performed as a
mitigation measure are not intended to be scientific research studies, but are meant to identify, avoid,
or recover paleontological resources to prevent damage or destruction from project activities.
However, proper scientific techniques and procedures must be utilized during all mitigation efforts.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

D-17

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Safety should be an important consideration; therefore, surveys should not be attempted on cliff
faces, in open, non-reinforced trenches deeper than five feet, or other unsafe areas.
1. The scope of the survey is dependent upon the scale of the project. Small projects are defined
as less than 10 acres, or, if linear, less than five miles; large projects exceed those
dimensions.
2. At the start of field work, the consulting paleontologist (paleontologist) must contact the
Paleontology Coordinator in each affected Field Office who may require a visit to that office.
After an initial visit each year, the paleontologist may contact the Field Office by telephone
or email prior to subsequent field trips, at the discretion of the Field Office. Information
about the survey schedule, additional personnel, emergency field contact information, and
any other pertinent data should be provided to the Paleontology Coordinator. The Field
Office will inform the paleontologist of any conditions that may impact the survey, such as
fire danger or restrictions, drought restrictions, wildlife timing restrictions, management
restrictions, road restrictions or construction, and any other relevant information.
3. During the field survey, the paleontologist surveys, locates, and documents all
paleontological resources within 200 feet of the proposed project location or corridor, or less
distance upon approval.
(a) Where significant paleontological resources are at risk, data collection alone does not
constitute mitigation of damage. All significant fossils that may be damaged or destroyed
during project activities must be collected, along with all relevant contextual and locational
data. Specimens must be collected during the survey or prior to commencement of any
surface-disturbing activities.
(b) In many cases, isolated gar scales, chelonid (turtle) carapace or plastron fragments,
crocodile and fish teeth, and unidentifiable bone fragments do not need to be collected. The
location must be recorded and a description of the fossil material noted in the field notes and
on a BLM Locality Form as part of the report. The context of these types of fossils should be
considered, as they may represent rare occurrences or unusual faunal associations, and thus
may be scientifically important and must be documented and voucher specimens collected
where appropriate.
(c) Occurrences of plant or invertebrate fossils should be recorded and representative
examples or voucher specimens collected where appropriate. Additional mitigation measures
may be appropriate in some cases for these types of localities.
(d) If a large specimen or a concentration of significant fossils is located during the field
survey, the available time and/or personnel may not allow for full recovery during the survey.
The specimen(s) and locality(ies) should be stabilized as needed, and a determination made
as to whether avoidance is necessary or whether full recovery of the specimen is required at a
later time prior to disturbance activities. The Authorized Officer and project proponent must
be notified, the mitigation alternatives discussed including funding for recovery, and a
decision reached as soon as possible. If avoidance or later recovery is selected for mitigation,
the find should be stabilized, buried if needed to protect the fossils and context, and
appropriate measures implemented to reduce adverse effects from natural or human causes.
4. During the survey, locations or areas that exhibit a lithology suggesting a high probability of
subsurface fossil material must be recorded, and a recommendation for the need for on-site
monitoring, spot-checking, or testing should be made in the report. This may include areas
where no fossil material was found on the surface during the survey. The recommendation

D-18

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

should consider the size and type of planned disturbance, such as the depth of a trenching
operation or the acreage of surface disturbance.
5. Surveys must be performed only during times when the ground is visible and not frozen. This
will often preclude surveys during winter months in many areas. Biological timing
restrictions, such as critical nesting or birthing times, may confine or delay field activities.
Project proponents should be informed of BLM’s requirement for performing any field
surveys as soon as possible and should be advised of the possibilities for delays in survey
completion based on seasonal weather conditions or other management restrictions to allow
for adequate scheduling of available time.
C. Report of Survey Findings. After completion of the field survey, the paleontologist must file a
written report with the BLM and the designated repository. If required, a copy should also be filed
with the project proponent. This report must summarize the results of the survey as well as
appropriate geological and paleontological background information as described below. It should
also include any recommendations for on-site monitoring or other mitigation. For small projects (less
than 10 acres), the report must be filed within 30 days after completion of the survey unless specific
approval for a different time frame has been received from the BLM. The time frame for submission
of the report for large projects should be negotiated during project scoping. On a case-by-case basis,
approval to begin project activities may be granted for those portions of the project area noted to be
less paleontologically sensitive prior to final approval of the report.
1. Reports of the general findings and the background information must be submitted to the
BLM project manager or Authorized Officer (if appropriate), the Paleontology Lead or
Regional Paleontologist, and each affected Field Office. Reports must include the following
details, as applicable. Items (a) and (b) should appear at the beginning of the report and may
be presented as a title page in multi-page reports. Some of these categories may be combined.
(a) Name, affiliation, address, date of report, and permit number (if consultant) of
paleontologist doing the survey.
(b) Project name and number (if used), name of proponent, and general location of project.
(c) Date(s) of survey and names of any personnel assisting with the survey.
(d) Brief description of the proposed project, emphasizing potential impacts to
paleontological resources.
(e) Description of background research conducted. (Include overview of known
paleontological information, institutions consulted, previous surveys in the area, previous
projects of similar nature in the area, and general description of survey techniques
employed).
(f) Summary of regional and local geology. May reference earlier projects for relevant
information.
(g) Summary of regional and local paleontology. May reference earlier projects for relevant
information.
(h) Summary of the survey results.
(i) Significance of findings.
(j) Potential impacts to paleontological resources resulting from the project.
(k) Detailed mitigation recommendations that may lessen potential adverse impacts.
(l) Potential fossiliferous areas to allow for future assessment of sites if applicable.
(m) Cited and other pertinent references.

(n) Map of project area, indicating areas surveyed, known localities, and new discoveries.
(o) Relevant photos, diagrams, tables to aid in explaining, clarifying, or understanding the
findings.
(p) Listing of collected material, including field numbers, field identifications, and elements,
cross-referenced to locality field numbers. This list may be submitted in electronic format,
preferably in spreadsheet format.
(q) BLM locality form (8270-3) or equivalent for each new locality (including localities
where fossils were observed but not collected) with a 1:24000 scale map showing the
localities (not reduced in scale during photocopying) (see items 2 and 3 below).
2. Exact locations of fossil localities contained in these reports are considered sensitive and
must not be included in any public document. The BLM locality form (8270-3) or equivalent,
1:24000 scale map showing the localities, and any other information containing specific
fossil locations may be bound separately or placed in a separate section to allow for
preservation of confidential locality data. A copy of this confidential section must be
submitted to the Paleontology Lead (in some cases, two copies may be required). A copy for
each affected Field Office may be required. Another copy must be submitted to the official
repository with the collected materials.
3. BLM GPS recording and data standards must be used to report paleontological locality data.
Existing USGS topographic maps are often based on the NAD27 standard, so locality data
calculated from a map base must be converted before submission. Data must be recorded and
reported with a mean error of +/- 12.5 meters or less, at a 95 percent confidence level. For
small localities, data should be reported as point data. Larger polygonal localities should be
reported using coordinates of a centroid and a description of the approximate size, or the key
coordinate points of a bounding polygon. Linear features, such as roads or surveyed project
boundaries, must be reported as line data. The 1:24000 scale map(s) accompanying the
locality forms should graphically illustrate the locality, either as a point or an outline of the
locality as appropriate, and be clearly labeled with the locality or field number.
D. Report Approval. The Authorized Officer will analyze the Survey Report for adequacy within 10
working days of receipt. Notification accepting the report, or explaining any identified deficiencies,
will be sent to the consulting paleontologist and the project proponent with a copy placed in the
project file. Any deficiencies must be corrected as soon as possible, usually initiated within five
working days, and the report must be resubmitted for approval. Any resubmissions must be prompt,
but consideration will be made for the amount of time needed for major corrections. Deficiencies
directly affecting the survey, such as inadequate survey procedures or incomplete data, must be
corrected before granting approval for the project to proceed. Deficiencies not directly affecting the
survey, such as curation issues, will not prevent approval of the project, but must be corrected as
soon as possible.

III.

Determination of Further Mitigation Requirements

The need for additional mitigation to protect paleontological resources will be determined on a caseby-case basis. The Authorized Officer, in consultation with Regional Paleontologist or the
Paleontology Lead, will analyze the Survey Report for survey findings and any mitigation
recommendations. If no further mitigation is needed, the Authorized Officer will promptly notify the
project proponent that there are no additional paleontological surveys or mitigation measures
required, and the project may proceed pending any other approvals. The project file must be
documented indicating acceptance of the survey report and identifying any additional mitigation

D-20

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

requirements. If it is determined that additional mitigation efforts are needed to protect or preserve
the paleontological resources, the project proponent will be notified as soon as possible. The
Authorized Officer and/or the Paleontology Lead usually develop and approve the mitigation
procedures or recommend a project be redesigned in consultation with the project proponent. Factors
such as locality or specimen significance, economics, safety, and project urgency will be considered
when developing mitigation measures. Additional mitigation measures will be developed and
implemented as timely as possible so as not to delay project actions.
A. Relocation. The preferred mitigation technique is to change the project location based on the
results of the field survey. Relocation, however, may necessitate a field survey of the new area, as
well as resurveys by other resource specialists. Anticipation of this contingency prior to or during the
original survey may allow for survey of an expanded area at the same time. If relocation will
eliminate impacts and is acceptable to all parties, then a report to the file, including a map showing
the original and revised locations, must be completed documenting the change. Approval for the
project to proceed in the revised location may then be granted by the Authorized Officer to the
project proponent. When avoidance is not possible, appropriate mitigation may include excavation or
collection (data recovery), stabilization, monitoring, protective barriers and signs, or other physical
and administrative protection measures.
B. Deferred Fossil Collection. In some cases, fossil material may have been identified, but not
completely collected during the initial field survey, such as a partial dinosaur or other large fossil
assemblage. It may be possible to complete the recovery of this material and all related data prior to
beginning construction activities, and thus mitigate the adverse impact. This may require a shift in
the project schedule and must be coordinated with the project proponent. Approval by the Authorized
Officer for the project to proceed will only be granted when recovery of the fossil material and field
data is completed. A report to the file and the project proponent documenting the recovery and
indicating that no further mitigation is required must be completed, and the report signed by the
Authorized Officer. If the discovery cannot be fully collected within the available time frame, it may
have to be avoided by relocating or redesigning the project.

IV.

Procedures for Field Monitoring

The purpose of on-site monitoring is to assess and collect any previously unknown fossil material
uncovered during the project activities or soon after surface-disturbing actions. Based on the initial
scoping, the field survey and recommendations, and the plan of operations, it may be necessary to
require monitoring of surface-disturbing activities. Monitoring may be required as part of an overall
mitigation for a project which was developed during the NEPA process, or upon the discovery of
paleontological resources during project activities.
A. Monitoring Plan. A monitoring plan can be developed by a BLM paleontologist or a qualified
paleontologist hired by the proponent. The plan must be appropriately scaled to the size and
complexity of the anticipated monitoring. If developed by a third party, the appropriate Paleontology
Lead or Regional Paleontologist shall review the plan for sufficiency prior to acceptance. Monitoring
of the project may proceed when the monitoring plan is approved by the Authorized Officer. A
monitoring plan indicates the treatments recommended for the area of the proposed disturbance and
must minimally address the following:
1. The recommended approach to additional specimen collection, such as total or partial
recovery or sampling; and
2. The specific locations and intensity of monitoring or sampling recommended for each
geologic unit, stratigraphic layer, or area impacted.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

D-21

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

3. Monitoring intensity is determined based on the analysis of existing data and/or field surveys
and any previous monitoring efforts.
B. Types of Monitoring. There are two types of monitoring: 1) on-site, performed during ongoing
operations, and 2) spot-checks, performed during or after disturbance, or at key times during the
progress of the project.
1. On-site monitoring – In areas with a high probability for buried fossils, the presence of a
monitor at the site of disturbance at all times that disturbance is occurring may be warranted.
The need for a full-time monitor is based on the findings of the survey, the local geology, and
the proposed actions. Efforts will be made to complete fossil recovery with minimal work
stoppage. However, in some cases, an extended period of work stoppage may be required, so
coordination with the project proponent or representative is important (see D below). Prior to
beginning the monitoring work, the monitor, company supervisor, and machinery operators
should agree on procedures for brief work stoppages to allow for examination of finds. It is
critical that safety be of utmost concern because of the presence of heavy machinery and
open trenches.
1. The monitor must assess any finds, collect loose fossil material and related data, and take
appropriate steps to mitigate any current or potential damage. Consideration of the size of the
expected fossils must also be considered; for example, microfossils may not be visible during
excavation activities. It may be appropriate to collect samples of matrix for later recovery of
microvertebrate fossils or other analyses. Activities planned to occur during night time
should be assessed relative to the potential to uncover significant fossils. Fossils may not be
visible at night in trenching or grading operations, so construction activities may need to be
suspended during night time in sensitive areas.
2. Spot-checking – In areas with a moderate to high probability for unknown fossil material, it
may be more appropriate to check only at key times rather than maintain continuous
monitoring of operations. Key times for scheduling spot-checking are when the fossil-bearing
bedrock is exposed to view or prior to placing spoil material back into the excavation.
Examples of these key times may be when a pipeline trenching operation is complete but
before pipe is placed and the trench backfilled or prior to redistribution of topsoil. Spotchecking requires close coordination with the project proponent and the paleontologist, and
usually requires the paleontologist to be available on short notice. In some instances, it may
be advantageous to allow rain and/or wind to erode away loose matrix and concentrate fossil
material to increase visibility. The paleontologist will coordinate with the project proponent
to allow sufficient time for this action to occur, as appropriate to conditions, expected fossil
material, and construction schedules.
3. The paleontologist should report potentially fossiliferous areas in the final report to allow for
future assessment of sites, even if no fossils were located during the project monitoring.
C. Types of Field Personnel. Depending on the complexity of the project, it may be necessary to
employ a number of paleontology field personnel simultaneously. There may be a lack of fully
qualified paleontologists to perform all the necessary monitoring during the scheduled times of
construction. Use of additional personnel for field work is permissible, but Field Agents and Field
Monitors (described below) must be requested by the Permittee and authorized by the BLM prior to
field work.
1. Principal Investigator – The person listed as Permittee (Permit item 1a) on the
Paleontological Resources Use Permit is the Principal Investigator (PI) and is responsible for
all actions under the permit, for meeting all permit terms and conditions, and for the

D-22

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

performance of all other personnel. This person is also the contact person for the project
proponent and the BLM.
2. Field Agent – Other qualified paleontologists may perform field work independently of the
PI under the conditions of this permit. Résumés must be submitted to BLM and must
demonstrate qualifications equivalent to those of Permittees. Field Agents must be listed on
the permit under “Name(s) of individual(s) responsible for planning, supervising, and
carrying out fieldwork” (Permit item 8) or authorized in a separate letter from BLM. They
must follow all the permit terms and conditions applicable to field work and must carry a
copy of the permit, included terms and conditions, and separate authorizing letter (if used)
while in the field. Field work results must be reported to the PI, who will then submit
required reports.
3. Field Monitor – Field Monitors may be utilized for supplemental on-site monitoring of
surface-disturbing activities when the PI or a Field Agent is performing field work elsewhere.
Field Monitors must have sufficient field experience to demonstrate acceptable knowledge of
fossil identification, collection methods, and paleontological techniques. The PI must supply
a summary of each person’s experience to the BLM prior to field work. Field Monitors must
be approved by the BLM prior to performing field work and must carry a copy of the permit
while in the field. The PI or Field Agent must be in communication with the Field Monitor
using a portable communication device, such as a cell phone or two-way radio, and are
required to be near enough to the Field Monitor to allow for prompt examination of all fossil
discoveries (no more than two hours away) by the PI or Field Agent.
4. Field Assistant – Additional personnel not meeting the previously cited experience or
knowledge levels may be utilized during field work, but must be under direct, on-site
supervision of either the PI or a Field Agent as part of a supervised crew. Field assistants
must have at least four to eight hours of training or experience received from a qualified
paleontologist in identifying paleontological resources prior to performing field work or
when first utilized in this capacity. A listing of all Field Assistants (including contact
information) must be supplied prior to any field work. All discoveries made by a Field
Assistant must be immediately reported to the PI or Field Agent on site. To ensure proper
supervision, an appropriate ratio of Field Assistants per PI or Field Agent must be
maintained. The complexity of the project, the area to be covered, and the experience of the
assistants are some of the factors that should be considered in determining the proper ratio,
but commonly five to seven assistants is the maximum number that can be supervised by one
PI or Field Agent.
D. Work Stoppage. If significant fossil material is discovered during construction activities, the PI,
Field Agents, and Field Monitors have the authority to temporarily halt surface disturbing actions
until an assessment of the find is completed and appropriate protection measures taken. Efforts will
be made to complete fossil recovery with minimal work stoppage. However, in some cases, an
extended period of work stoppage may be required. If the paleontological resource can be avoided,
mitigated, or collected within approximately two hours, work may resume after approval from the PI
or Field Agent, and the Authorized Officer must be notified as soon as possible of the discovery and
any mitigation efforts that were undertaken. If the find cannot be mitigated within a reasonable time
(two hours), the concurrence of the Authorized Officer or official representative for a longer work
stoppage must be obtained. Work may not resume until approval is granted from both the PI or Agent
and the Authorized Officer.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

V.

Final Project Report

Upon completion of all field work, including survey and monitoring, the PI must submit within 30
days, a written final report to the Authorized Officer, Paleontology Lead, and the designated
repository. A copy of the report may be provided to the project proponent if required, but without the
BLM Locality forms. Reports must include the following details. Items 1 and 2 should appear at the
beginning of the report, and may be presented as a title page in multi-page reports.
1. Name, affiliation, address, date of report, and permit number (if consultant) of the
paleontologist doing the survey.
2. Project name and number (if used), name of proponent, and general location of project.
3. Date(s) of the survey and names of any personnel assisting with the survey.
4. Brief description of project and expected impacts to paleontological resources.
5. A summary of mitigation performed.
6. A summary of findings, including important discoveries.
7. A description of potentially fossiliferous areas to allow for future assessment of sites, even if
no fossils were located during the project monitoring.
8. A completed BLM locality form 8270-3 or equivalent for each new locality using Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) NAD 83 coordinates, and 1:24000 scale maps with new
localities plotted using points or polygons as appropriate. Locality forms, maps, and any
other information containing specific fossil locations should be bound separately or
assembled as a separate section to allow for preservation of confidential locality data.
9. List of specimen field numbers and field identifications of collected material, crossreferenced to the locality field number. This list may be submitted in electronic format,
preferably in a spreadsheet format.
If the survey was performed by BLM, a report similar in contents must be written and filed in the
project file, and the project proponent notified as soon as possible upon completion.

VI.

Completion of Mitigation Responsibility

When the final report with the specimen inventory and the signed receipt of confirmation of museum
deposition are accepted by the BLM, mitigation for paleontological resources related to the project
will be considered completed. The project proponent will be notified in writing as soon as possible
by the Authorized Officer after consulting with the Paleontology Lead or Regional Paleontologist
and a copy of the notification placed in the project file.
The responsibility of the project proponent ends when appropriate mitigation related directly to the
project is completed and final approval is received from the Authorized Officer. Any additional field
collection, quarrying, final specimen preparation, etc. will be considered to be research, and will be
the responsibility of the consulting paleontologist or another approved party. The project proponent
will not be held responsible for completion of any research project. However, the project proponent
can choose to sponsor further research. A separate research permit will be required for additional
research activities.

VII. Collections Resulting from Assessment and Mitigation
Fossil specimens and related data collected from public lands during field surveys and mitigation
remain the property of the Federal government. They must be placed in the approved repository(s)

D-24

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

identified on the Paleontological Resource Use Permit held by the consulting paleontologist as soon
as practical and receipt(s) of collections submitted to the BLM, but no later than 60 days after all
field work is completed. Written approval from the Paleontology Lead or Regional Paleontologist is
required if additional time is needed for transfer of all specimens and field data.

VIII. Resource Management Updates
Based on findings resulting from any of the above steps, the project file, locality and specimen
information, and other BLM data should be updated to reflect any new or modified information.
Paleontology permit files should be checked and updated, as well as any other administrative information.
The PFYC Class assignments can be assessed based on the analysis, survey, and monitoring results. New
information may indicate a change in the PFYC Class is appropriate for one or several geologic units.
Other applications of the PFYC system should be considered, such as the use for impact analyses in
planning documents or for survey and mitigation determinations for other projects. Any changes in
classification must be made in consultation with the Paleontology Lead or Regional Paleontologist to
maintain consistency across Field Office boundaries.

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

Appendix A to Attachment 1 – Definitions
(As applicable to BLM management of paleontological resources)
Alluvium – A general term for clay, silt, sand, gravel, or similar unconsolidated detrital material
[fragments of rock or mineral material derived from older rocks] deposited during relatively
recent geologic time by a stream or other body of running water as a sorted or semi-sorted
sediment in the bed of the stream or its flood plain or delta, or as a cone or fan at the base of a
mountain slope; especially, such a deposit of fine-grained texture (silt or silty clay) deposited
during a time of flood (from American Geological Institute (AGI), Glossary of Geology,
1972 ed.)
Alluvium may contain paleontological resources in older alluvial deposits. The location on
the landscape often will provide clues to the potential for paleontological resources within
alluvial deposits. As an example, alluvium developed near major river courses or lake
margins has a much higher potential to contain significant paleontological resources than
alluvium (colluvium) formed from slope wash.
Approved Repository – Meets the Department of the Interior 411 Departmental Manual (DM)
provisions for museum property, including capability for providing adequate long-term
curatorial services, such as a physically secure environment, and maintaining professional
staff qualified to catalog, care for, preserve, retrieve, and loan, where appropriate, these
materials and associated records.
Bedrock – A general term for the rock, usually solid, that underlies soil or other unconsolidated,
surficial material (from American Geological Institute (AGI), Glossary of Geology, 1972 ed.)
For paleontological purposes, bedrock generally excludes alluvium, colluvium, sand dunes,
and loess (fine-grained blanket deposit of marl or loam). In certain situations, bedrock may
contain recent soils/sediments with fossils.
Colluvium – A general term applied to any loose, heterogeneous, and incoherent mass of soil
material or rock fragments deposited chiefly by mass-wasting, usually at the base of a steep
slope or cliff; e.g., talus, cliff debris, and avalanche material. Also, alluvium deposited by
unconcentrated surface run-off or sheet erosion, usually at the base of a slope (from
American Geological Institute (AGI), Glossary of Geology, 1972 ed.)
Field Agent – Other qualified paleontologists may perform field work independently of the PI under
the conditions of this permit. Résumés must be submitted to BLM and must demonstrate
qualifications equivalent to those of Permittees. Field Agents must be listed on the permit
under “Name(s) of individual(s) responsible for planning, supervising, and carrying out
fieldwork” (Permit item 8) or authorized in a separate letter from BLM. They must follow all
the permit terms and conditions applicable to field work and must carry a copy of the permit,
included terms and conditions, and separate authorizing letter (if used) while in the field.
Field work results must be reported to the PI, who will then submit required reports.
Field Assistant – Additional personnel not meeting the previously cited experience or knowledge
levels may be utilized during field work, but must be under direct, on-site supervision of
either the PI or a Field Agent as part of a supervised crew. Field assistants must have at least
4 to 8 hours of training or experience received from a qualified paleontologist in identifying
paleontological resources prior to performing field work or when first utilized in this
capacity. A listing of all Field Assistants (including contact information) must be supplied
prior to any field work. All discoveries made by a Field Assistant must be immediately

D-26

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

reported to the PI or Field Agent on site. To ensure proper supervision, an appropriate ratio of
Field Assistants per PI or Field Agent must be maintained. The complexity of the project, the
area to be covered, and the experience of the assistants are some of the factors that should be
considered in determining the proper ratio, but commonly five to seven assistants is the
maximum number that can be supervised by one PI or Field Agent.
Field Monitor – Field Monitors may be utilized for supplemental on-site monitoring of surfacedisturbing activities when the PI or a Field Agent is performing field work elsewhere. Field
Monitors must have sufficient field experience to demonstrate acceptable knowledge of fossil
identification, collection methods, and paleontological techniques. The PI must supply a
summary of each person’s experience to the BLM prior to field work. Field Monitors must be
approved by BLM prior to performing field work and must carry a copy of the permit while
in the field. The PI or Field Agent must be in communication with the Field Monitor using a
portable communication device, such as a cell phone or two-way radio, and are required to be
near enough to the Field Monitor to allow for prompt examination of all fossil discoveries
(no more than two hours) by the PI or Field Agent.
Field Survey – Pedestrian (walking) surveys performed in areas where significant fossils are
expected to occur within the boundary or immediate vicinity of an anticipated disturbance.
Surveys are performed by a qualified paleontologist or BLM Regional Paleontologist or other
officially appointed BLM employee prior to any surface disturbing activities. Survey
activities also include concurrent collection of significant fossils.
Land Tenure Adjustments/Change in Title – Changes in ownership or administration of surface or
mineral estates, typically exchanges or sales, which may result in a change in ownership or
control of paleontological resources.
Monitoring – a) On-site observation during all surface disturbing activities to assess and collect any
previously-unknown fossil material uncovered by the project activities. b) Examination of
excavation or spoil piles at key times during project activities. Monitoring must be performed
by a permitted paleontologist, field agent, or field monitor (see section IV.C.), Regional
Paleontologist, or other officially appointed BLM employee, and occurs during or soon after
surface disturbing actions.
Paleontological Locality (Locality) – A geographic point or area where a fossil or associated fossils
are found in a related geological context. A paleontological locality is confined to a discrete
stratigraphic layer, structural feature, or physiographic area.
Paleontology Program Coordinator (Paleontology Coordinator) – The employee designated by
the local BLM Office Manager to manage paleontological resource issues, including
planning, mitigation, budget, and other administrative duties. The local point of contact for
paleontological resource use permittees, the State Office Paleontology Program Lead, and the
Regional Paleontologist. The employee is usually a geologist or archaeologist.
(a) In some offices, additional employees may be designated by the supervisor to determine
the need for field surveys and monitoring for some projects, or other duties in support of
the paleontology program. The scope of duties for these additional employees must be
approved by the Paleontology Program Lead and closely coordinated with the
Paleontology Coordinator.
(b) A few current BLM employees may meet the same professional qualifications that are
required for a BLM Paleontological Resources Use Permit applicant. BLM-approved
training and field experience may also allow employees to gain sufficient background to

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

D-27

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

achieve competency in the field. With the approval of the Regional Paleontologist and the
Office Manager or Deputy State Director, these employees may be designated as
qualified to perform field surveys or monitoring. The current availability of these
employees must also be approved by the unit manager or Deputy State Director, typically
on a project-by-project basis or within a defined time period. Depending on official
duties, local roles and responsibilities, and management preferences, these employees
may or may not be the Paleontology Coordinator.
Paleontology Program Lead (Paleontology Lead) – Any one of the following: the Regional
Paleontologist in the states with an identified position; the paleontologist at Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monument; or the State Office Archeologist in the states without a
Regional Paleontologist.
Principal Investigator – The person listed as Permittee (Permit item 1a) on the Paleontological
Resources Use Permit is the Principal Investigator (PI) and is responsible for all actions
under the permit, for meeting all permit terms and conditions, and for the performance of all
other personnel. This person is also the contact person for the project proponent and the
BLM.
Regional Paleontologist – The BLM paleontologist that provides professional expertise in
paleontology, and is responsible for interpreting relevant laws, authorities, and policy for the
administration of the BLM paleontology program for all States in his/her respective region,
and as the program interface between Field and/or District Offices, State Offices, and the
Washington Office. In some cases, the Regional Paleontologist also serves as the State Office
Paleontologist.
Significant Paleontological Resource (syn. Significant Fossil Resource) – Any paleontological
resource that is considered to be of scientific interest, including most vertebrate fossil
remains and traces, and certain rare or unusual invertebrate and plant fossils. A significant
paleontological resource is considered to be scientifically important because it is a rare or
previously unknown species, it is of high quality and well-preserved, it preserves a
previously unknown anatomical or other characteristic, provides new information about the
history of life on earth, or has identified educational or recreational value. Paleontological
resources that may be considered to not have paleontological significance include those that
lack provenience or context, lack physical integrity because of decay or natural erosion, or
that are overly redundant or are otherwise not useful for research. Vertebrate fossil remains
and traces include bone, scales, scutes, skin impressions, burrows, tracks, tail drag marks,
vertebrate coprolites (feces), gastroliths (stomach stones), or other physical evidence of past
vertebrate life or activities.
Soil – The natural medium for growth of land plants (from American Geological Institute (AGI),
Glossary of Geology, 1972 ed.) Generally, well-developed soils do not contain
paleontological resources. However, the C horizon (the substratum above bedrock that is
little affected by soil forming processes) may occasionally contain Pleistocene-aged fossils.
Stipulations – Written conditions that may restrict or impose limits on approved activities, or require
that certain procedures be followed. The general usage herein encompasses several formal
terms specific to other use authorizations such as Mitigation, Terms and Conditions,
Conditions of Approval, and Standard Stipulations.
Surface disturbance – Disruption of the ground surface and subsurface. Disruption may damage or
destroy significant paleontological resources and their geological context.

D-28

APPENDIX D—PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES PROGRAM GUIDANCE

– Generally excludes: fire (but not fire activities, see below), vegetation mowing, weed
spraying, grazing, natural erosion, fence building
– Some activities that may impact the ground surface and must be assessed on a case-by-case
basis are:
• Mechanized vegetative treatments – chaining, sagebrush chopping, etc
• Seismic activities – vibroseis techniques, cross-country travel
• Fire management activities – line building, brush removal and thinning using
mechanized equipment
• Recreational activities – OHV, rock collecting, mountain biking, public events
Voucher Specimen – A representative sample that verifies the kind of fossil material found during a
field survey, and is collected and curated in an approved repository along with its associated
field data.

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

INTRODUCTION
This appendix was developed to provide a comprehensive source for the pertinent guidance and
requirements of the BLM for the reclamation of surface disturbance in the CD-C project area. The
documents in this appendix can be used by CD-C Operators to develop reclamation plans for their
proposed development that would meet the requirements of the BLM and lead to restoration of disturbed
sites on public lands.
The documents in this appendix include:






Appendix 36 to the Rawlins RMP. This document lays out the basic requirements for reclamation
of surface disturbance in the RFO. The RMP was published in December 2008 and Appendix 36 has
been in use since that time. It provides information needed to develop a reclamation plan and to
prepare monitoring reports and explains the criteria for final reclamation success, including:
establishment of eighty percent of pre-disturbance ground cover; 90 percent dominant species; no
noxious weeds; and erosion features equal to or less than surrounding area.
High Desert District Policy for Reclamation of Disturbed Lands. The district policy formally
adopts and implements the Wyoming BLM State Reclamation Policy (IM WY-2012-032).
Additionally, it underlines the importance of on-the-ground reclamation success and cautions
against requiring more reclamation planning information than is necessary.
Wyoming BLM State Reclamation Policy, IM WY-2012-032 and attachments. This document
identifies ten requirements that must be addressed when developing reclamation proposals for all
surface-disturbing activities on public lands in Wyoming. They are:
1. Manage all waste materials.
2. Ensure subsurface integrity, and eliminate sources of ground and surface water
contamination.
3. Re-establish slope stability, surface stability, and desired topographic diversity.
4. Reconstruct and stabilize water courses and drainage features.
5. Maintain the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of the topsoil and subsoil.
6. Prepare site for revegetation.
7. Establish desired self-perpetuating native plant community.
8. Reestablish a complementary visual composition.
9. Manage invasive plants.
10. Develop and implement a reclamation monitoring and reporting strategy.

Proposed Interim Rollover Objective for the Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Project
Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision (February 25, 2011). This document
was developed by the CD-C Reclamation Work Group, an ad hoc group focused on improving
reclamation in the CD-C project area. The document was intended to provide flexibility for industry,
while maintaining healthy, desirable vegetation within the project area. The group, including
representatives of industry, state agencies, the University of Wyoming, local governments, and the
BLM, worked for two years to develop the document. The document provided the framework in
which the BLM Rollover Criteria, Continental Divide–Creston Draft EIS (description follows) was
developed.
BLM Rollover Criteria, Continental Divide–Creston Draft EIS. The criteria described in this
document are formally incorporated as an element of Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap—High
and Low Density Development Areas. For the purposes of the CD-C EIS, the standards and guidance
contained in the Rawlins RMP Appendix 36 and the Wyoming State Reclamation Policy, IM-WY2012-032, apply to the Proposed Action and the other action alternatives. However, a specific

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

exception is made with regard to rollover credits involved with Alternative C. Rollover credits exist in
the context of a cap on the amount of surface disturbance generated by natural gas development. They
refer to the process by which acreage that counted against a surface disturbance cap when natural gas
facilities were initially constructed could be successfully reclaimed and rolled over, meaning counted
again as undisturbed acreage. When a natural gas well pad and its associated road and pipeline are
constructed, the initial disturbance is much larger than what is needed for the long term. After the
well has been completed, the area that was initially disturbed but is no longer needed, perhaps 60
percent of the total, undergoes interim reclamation.1 With a surface disturbance cap in place, this
portion of the initial disturbance acreage can be rolled over when the BLM determines that it has been
successfully reclaimed.
In some cases, for example in the neighboring Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Project, the success criteria
applied for rollover credits are the same as the final reclamation standard, in other words, the RMP
Appendix 36 performance criteria: establishment of 80 percent of pre-disturbance ground cover; 90
percent dominant species; no noxious weeds; and erosion features equal to or less than surrounding
area. For the CD-C Alternative C, however, the RFO has defined Reclamation Rollover Criteria as
follows:
o The area is re-vegetated with a stable, approved plant community;
o Vegetative cover is sufficient to maintain a healthy, biologically active topsoil;
o Erosion is controlled;
o Habitat, visual and forage loss is minimized; and
o No noxious weeds are present.
There is no requirement that pre-disturbance ground cover or the dominant species match a specified
percentage. Once these criteria have been satisfied in the judgment of the RFO, the affected acreage
would be rolled over and the cap would increased by that amount.

As defined in IM WYD- 03-2011-02, “interim reclamation is used to restore vegetation, and scenic and habitat
resources while a well continues to produce energy. With interim reclamation, all areas not needed for the
production of oil and gas are reclaimed, that is, reshaped, covered with topsoil, and reseeded with native plants.
Interim reclamation also refers to the stabilization of soil by revegetation on sites that will likely be further disturbed
in the future. This includes sites where recontouring is needed where periodic disturbance may occur due to
operation and maintenance activities.” Interim reclamation can be contrasted with final reclamation, which is
“reclamation of an area that is not planned for further disturbance including recontouring, stabilization of soil by revegetation and restoring the ecosystem function originally found at the site.” It normally occurs after a well is
plugged and abandoned.

Appendix 36, Rawlins RMP
Reclamation of public land will be required for any surface-disturbing activity. A reclamation plan
appropriate in detail and complexity, and tailored to a specific surface-disturbing activity, will be required
and made a condition of approval of any action. This appendix details the elements that need to be
considered during pre-disturbance authorization of any surface disturbance and the post-disturbance steps
required to assure timely and proper recovery of the site.
The reclamation plan will provide a framework to develop project-specific and site-specific reclamation
actions and guide land management efforts toward a planned future condition for any surface disturbance.
Early coordination between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and project proponents is necessary
to produce a comprehensive plan. The reclamation plan will serve as a binding agreement between project
proponents and BLM for the expected reclamation condition of the disturbed lands and must be
periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The reclamation plan will include sufficient monitoring
requirements, reports, and components to ensure the reclamation plan is current.
Although the proponent will usually develop the reclamation plan, appropriate BLM involvement in
preplanning, data inventory, and approval is essential to develop the optimum reclamation proposal. Most
determinations regarding what is expected should be made before the reclamation plan is approved and
implemented. However, any plan can be modified to adjust to changing conditions or to correct for an
oversight. An approved reclamation plan and reporting obligations will be required prior to any surfacedisturbing activity. A reclamation plan should provide the following:






A logical sequence of steps for completing the reclamation process
The specifics of how reclamation standards will be achieved
An estimate of specific costs of reclamation
Sufficient information for the development of a basis of inspection and enforcement of
reclamation and criteria to be used to evaluate reclamation success and reclamation bond release
Sufficient information to determine whether the reclamation plan is in conformance with the
applicable BLM land-use and activity plans, as appropriate. Further guidance for reclamation can
be found in the BLM/Forest Service Surface Operating Standards and Guidelines for Oil and Gas
Exploration and Development (Gold Book), fourth edition, 2006, at http://www.blm.gov/bmp/
gold percent20book/FinalGoldBook percent20-percent202006 percent20Edition.pdf.

In preparing and reviewing reclamation plans, BLM and the project proponent must set reasonable,
achievable, and measurable reclamation goals that are not inconsistent with the established land-use
plans. Achievable goals will ensure reclamation and encourage operators to conduct research on different
aspects of reclamation for different environments. These goals should be based on available information
and techniques, should offer incentives to both parties, and should, as a result, generate useful information
for future use.
The purposes of the reclamation plan are as follows:






Reclamation plans provide detailed guidelines for the reclamation process and fulfill federal,
state, county, and other local agencies requirements. They can be used by regulatory agencies in
their oversight roles to ensure that the reclamation measures are implemented, are appropriate for
the site, and are environmentally sound.
Reclamation plans will be used by the project proponent throughout the operational period of the
project and subsequent to cessation of surface-disturbing activities. In turn, responsible agencies,
including BLM, will use the reclamation plan as a basis to review and evaluate the success of the
reclamation program.
Reclamation plans should provide direction and standards to assist in monitoring and compliance
evaluations.

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

BLM reclamation goals emphasize eventual ecosystem reconstruction that returns the land to a condition
approximate to or better than that which existed before it was disturbed, by re-creating the successional
pathway that restores the plant cover and species composition of the site to its pre-disturbance direction
and boundaries.
Interim reclamation is an intentional activity to initiate or accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem with
respect to its health, integrity, and sustainability, including quickly stabilizing disturbed areas to protect
both disturbed and adjacent undisturbed areas from unnecessary degradation.
Interim reclamation measures are used to achieve this short-term goal while setting the stage for final
recovery. For example, on a well pad where drilling is completed, interim reclamation would include
drying and back-filling reserve pits, initial recontouring and redistribution of saved top soil, installing a
rocked driveway, installing fencing as needed, and revegetating the area. Interim reclamation guidelines
will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate.
Final reclamation measures are used to achieve the recovery goal. A disturbed area has recovered—and is
restored—when it contains sufficient biotic and abiotic resources to continue its development and
interactions without further assistance or subsidy. It will demonstrate resilience to normal ranges of
environmental stress and disturbance.
Planning efforts that consider the processes necessary for successful reclamation are important. Predisturbance surveys, site stabilization, weed control, and maintenance and health of soils are significant
considerations. All forms of revegetation must consider vegetative succession patterns and processes.
Annual monitoring and reporting is the best way to track success and implement adaptive management
strategies that treat problems.
The ideal starting point for reclamation is to ensure that reclamation planning starts before disturbance
and is an integral part of the operational plan. All attempts should be made to develop and implement new
ideas and technologies that limit or greatly reduce the amount of land surface disturbance.
Pre-disturbance surveys provide data that allow for proper planning and timely implementation of
planned activities. For instance, pre-disturbance site surveys give the operator the information to know
what plant communities, composition, structure, and successional pathway to restore to and can influence
the amount and type of seed that is ordered and how and where the seed is planted and handled. Predisturbance inventories define baseline conditions and should be followed up with annual monitoring.
Among items to be emphasized in achieving these goals are:

Stabilization of disturbed soils
Soil stabilization through establishment of a vegetative ground cover on disturbed sites during the
first growing season following disturbance
Restoration of the same native vegetation disturbed or removed or restoration of an alternate

Minimal disturbance of the existing environment and avoidance of riparian areas
Annual monitoring, detection, and control of invasive and noxious weeds beginning the first
season of disturbance
Monitoring and management of reclamation sites to evaluate weed populations, reclamation
success, and to plan and report on the program annually
Positive efforts to resist the spread of weeds, including power washing of machinery and
equipment between work sites consistent with the Rawlins Weed Prevention Plan (USDI, BLM
1999b).

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

SOIL
Topsoil is the building block of successful reclamation. Soil consists of living organisms that must be
properly cared for. Many plants rely on these organisms to facilitate the uptake of nutrients and water,
especially in times of stress. To preserve and care for topsoil organisms, there are several strategies that
can be employed—stockpiled soil can be immediately planted with a mix of native plant species,
inoculated after being respread and planted with early successional species, or stored for short periods of
time.
Topsoil should be handled separately from subsoil materials. At all construction sites, if topsoil must be
stripped, project proponents must provide for sufficient quantities to be respread to a depth of at least 4 to
6 inches over the disturbed areas during reclamation. In areas where deep soils exist (such as floodplains
and drainage channel terraces), at least 12 inches of topsoil should be salvaged. Where soils are shallow
or where subsoil is stony, as much topsoil should be salvaged as possible. Care should also be taken to
avoid mixing productive soil types with less productive soil types where two or more soil types may
occur on a single site.
The salvaged soil can either be stockpiled for later use or used immediately over regraded surfaces that
are ready for reclamation. The latter option, sometimes called direct or live haul, is preferable to
stockpiling because the soil microbes, bacteria, viable seeds, and plants that can take root are at their most
abundant, leading to better revegetation. Stockpiling soil for long periods results in the loss or elimination
of these beneficial characteristics, especially when soils are stockpiled more than several feet high
diminishing biological activity as a result of lack of oxygen.
Topsoil will be stockpiled separately from subsoil materials to preclude contamination or mixing, and
topsoil stockpiles should be signed. When topsoil will be stored for more than 1 year, stockpiles should
not exceed 2 feet in depth. They should be seeded with a prescribed seed mixture and covered with mulch
to reduce erosion and discourage weed invasion. Runoff should be diverted around topsoil stockpiles to
minimize erosion of topsoil materials. In most cases, disturbances will be reclaimed within 1 year.
Therefore, it is unlikely that topsoil will be required to be stockpiled for more than 1 year. Salvaged
topsoil from roads and project sites will be respread over cut-and-fill surfaces not actively used during the
project life.
In some cases, there may be insufficient quantities of topsoil available for salvage to adequately cover the
surfaces upon final reclamation and revegetation. In these cases, there is the need to find sui replacement
or substitute growth media; this may include using subsoils or strata deeper within the overburden with
suitable characteristics for plant growth. Deficiencies in the replacement or substitute soil could be made
up by using soil amendments. See http://www.nps.gov/plants/restore/pubs/intronatplant/planning.htm for
a good overview on the restoration process and soil needs.
SITE PREPARATION
It is important to consider diversity in seedbed preparation to account for various seed sizes and
establishment strategies of different species. Consideration should be given for seed-safe sites, water
infiltration and collection, shade, and frost protection.
RECONTOURING
Trees, shrubs, and ground cover adjacent to disturbance areas but not cleared from rights-of-way (ROW)
require protection from construction damage. Recontouring to preconstruction condition as well as
restoration of normal surface drainage are required.

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

ROAD RECLAMATION GUIDELINES
Road reclamation guidelines are as follows:







Determine the desired level of obliteration and reclamation. Determine whether there are
alternative short- or long-term uses for roads.
Determine short- and long-term reclamation objectives and goals. Identify the monitoring
methods to determine reclamation success or failure and possible mitigation.
Reclaim the road; the effort may include ripping and scarifying the surface, removing culverts
and other flow structures, recontouring cut-and-fill slopes to provide for complete removal of the
road, and total recontouring to the original topographic profile.
Reclaim vegetation to standards outlined in the section on “criteria for reclamation.”
Establish mitigation measures to remedy problems identified by monitoring.

WEEDS
One of BLM’s highest priorities is to promote ecosystem health, and one of the larger obstacles to
achieving this goal is the rapid expansion of weeds across public lands. Invasive plants can dominate sites
and often cause long-term changes to native plant communities. If not eradicated or controlled, noxious
weeds will jeopardize the success of reclamation. Invasive weeds can slow reclamation success or halt it
altogether. ROW, mineral lease, mining claim, and permit holders are required to monitor and control
noxious and invasive weeds on public land as stipulated within their permits and authorizations. Some
recommended best management practices (BMP) for weed control are located in Appendix 31, Rawlins
Field Office Noxious Weed Prevention Plan (see Proposed RMP/Final EIS).
SEED
On all areas to be reclaimed, seed mixtures are required to be weed free and site-specific, composed of the
same native species as were disturbed, or early successional species consisting of pioneer species,
including seasonal or annual species (that may only be evident at certain times of the year), that will lead
to a similar climax community as that disturbed. Site preparation and species choices must ensure soil
stability.
A pre-disturbance species composition list must be developed for each site to ensure proper community
composition, function, and structure. This will ensure that the type of vegetative community replaced is
compatible with climate and soil types and should make it easier for the project proponent to successfully
restore and stabilize specific sites.
Livestock palatability and wildlife habitat needs must be given consideration in seed mix formulation
during reclamation within areas of important wildlife habitat (crucial winter range, sage-grouse nesting
habitat, etc.); provision shall be made for the replacement of native browse and forb species. BLM
guidance for native seed use is the BLM Manual 1745 and Executive Order (E.O.) 13112 (Invasive
Species, 64 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 6183).
It is helpful to become familiar with the following terms when ordering seed to assist in making informed
decisions.
Certified Seed (Blue Tag)
This certification only applies to seed produced through cultivation, not seed collected in the wild. The
seed certification system promotes the production and purchase of seed of known genetic identity. Only
cultivated, named varieties can be certified. A certification agency inspects field conditions and regulates
how the seed is produced, harvested, and cleaned. The seed is subject to a variety of laboratory tests. This

E-8

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

certification process guarantees the seed has the same genetic potential to perform in the field as the
original seed did when it was released for production.
Source Identified Seed (Yellow Tag)
The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA) has an approved seed certification class
for native seed collection called the “Source Identified Class.” The tag confirms to the purchaser that the
location of seed harvest was verified by the certifying agency.
Pure Live Seed
Pure live seed (PLS) is a measure describing the percentage of a quantity of seed that will germinate. It is
a way to standardize quality so the purchaser can compare the quality and value of different lots of seed.
One lot may be cheaper but may not have as high a PLS as another lot, and therefore may not be a better
buy because fewer seeds would actually germinate.
PLS = percent purity * percent germination rate/100
Example: 90 percent purity * 50 percent germination rate/100 = 45 percent PLS
Seed Testing and Labeling
Seed Operators should include a clear label on each bag of seed that shows the results of purity and
germination tests and the scientific name of the species. The Association of Official Seed Analysts
oversees these tests. Purity of the seed is the percentage of the labeled species by weight. The percentages
of other crop, weed, inert material, and the percentage of dormant or hard seed should also be included.
The label should also show the percentage of the seed count that will germinate
Site Adapted Custom Seed Collection
Some seed Operators also may offer collection services that involve harvesting seed from sites that the
customer specifies. This is a preferred method for many who want to ensure that their seed is from local
sources.
Seed Suppliers
Many of the considerations for choosing plant material suppliers also apply to choosing seed suppliers.
Seed suppliers should operate in the same geographic ecoregion as the restoration site because that
supplier is most likely to have native seed suitable for that area. Companies specialize in native seed
collection, processing, and growing, and can have a wealth of knowledge about native plants and seeds.
Do not rely on a single supplier for all seed needs.
Standard Seed Mixtures—Rawlins Field Office
Care and planning must be taken to choose mixes and amounts that will benefit under site-specific
conditions. Planning and thought must also go into selecting successful planting and site-preparation
techniques. All sites must be planted with a diverse mix of grasses, forbs, and shrubs to be considered
successful. The project proponent is ultimately responsible for successful restoration of disturbed sites.
Alternate seed mixes can be submitted by the project proponent to BLM for review and approval prior to
use. The final goal is to restore disturbed sites so that they closely resemble pre-disturbance native plant
communities. Some standard seed mixes are available for the Rawlins Field Office and contain only
native species. If the use of a non-native species is desired, documentation of the need is required by
BLM policy. Non-native species may be considered for erosion and weed control. Seed mixtures
consisting of sterile annual cover crops, such as tricale hybrid, can be used. The use of a non-sterile plant
species such as wheat as a cover crop is not recommended because of its ability to reseed itself. Follow-

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

up seeding or corrective erosion control measures will be required on areas of surface disturbance that fail
to meet reclamation success standards within a reasonable time.
Mulch
Use of mulch during reclamation may enhance chances for successful vegetation reestablishment.
Mulches can help control wind and water erosion, retain and collect seed, increase and prolong soil water
capacity, and add organic compounds to the soil. Mulches are best applied after seeding to ensure proper
seed contact with soil. Mulch may include hay, small-grain straw, wood fiber, live mulch, cotton, jute, or
synthetic netting. Straw mulch should contain fibers long enough to facilitate crimping and provide the
greatest cover. Take care that mulch is not more than 1 inch deep; if too deep a layer is applied, it can
retard vegetation establishment.
Any mulch used must be certified free from mold, fungi, or noxious or invasive weed seeds.
LIVE PLANTINGS
Live plants can be planted on disturbed sites and, with proper site preparation, can greatly enhance
restoration efforts and shorten time frames. Operators can buy bare root and container stock directly from
vendors or can contract seed collection and growth from local growers. Another strategy is to use an
excavator to collect clumps of plants from the site and plant them either on reserved topsoil piles and/or
on restoration sites during recontouring. These clumps can provide native seed and soil flora as well as
collect precipitation and provide shade for newly emerging plants.
Seeding and Planting Methods
There are many types and configurations of rangeland seeders, interseeders, and transplanters. Be sure to
use the right tool for the job. The equipment should be set up to segregate seed by size and planting depth.
The contractor should know when, where, and under what conditions to plant the appropriate species.
Many forbs, shrubs, and some grasses do not compete well as young plants and should be planted with
compatible species. Less aggressive, slower growing species should be planted separately from faster
growing more aggressive species. Some species require companion species; there are many variables, so
care must be taken in seed selection and planting technique.
Most conventional grain drills are inadequate for rangeland seeding. Their seed boxes are generally not
individually suspended, and their depth regulators are usually inadequate for native species and generally
plant too deep. Adequate equipment and knowledge of site-specific reclamation practices is paramount to
the success of seeding objectives. Look for contractors using proven rangeland equipment and methods.
For example, they should have a rangeland drill, Truax drill, land imprinter, Amazon no-till drill,
broadcast seeder, Brillion-seeder, seeder-scalper, interseeders, surface seeder, hydro-seeder, scarifier,
dozer, or other appropriate equipment.
Depending on site-specifics such as soil types and soil moisture, there are a number of ways to properly
prepare seedbeds. It is best to prepare the seedbed early in the fall and then plant in late fall or early
winter. However, when proper conditions exist, planting can occur through the winter into early spring.
Planting at other times of the year will have higher chances for failure. Care should be taken not to work
soils that are too wet because compaction and soil crusting can occur.
Seedbed preparation and seeding often occur simultaneously. Therefore, it is critical to choose the proper
methods and timing. A good strategy for seed mixes is to leave seedbeds in a rough surface condition,
then broadcast seed, followed by light chaining or harrowing. Deep furrow drilling should not be used in
dry soils or in loose soils because it tends to slough and leave seeds at uneven depths and often too deep
for germination. Deep furrow drilling in tighter soils may be appropriate because it can reduce soil
moisture loss and shade new seedlings. Cultipacker seeders, punch drills, pitting, and some compact drills

E-10

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

may also be a good strategy for loose soil types, particularly if they are able to segregate seed and plant at
varying depths.
Planting container or bare-root stock requires specific strategies that have been proven successful. Some
methods that can be used include random hand-planting, trenching, inter-seeding, and deep-furrow
planting.
It is essential to consider several options for seedbed preparation to account for soil types, pH, structure,
variable seed size, planting depths, competition, and the establishment of strategies for different species.
Consideration should be given for seed-safe sites, water infiltration and collection, shade, and frost
protection.
Planning and Monitoring
For each discrete site where ground disturbing activities are planned, a site-specific reclamation plan shall
be prepared, submitted, and approved by BLM before the project proponent disturbs the environment.
Guidance and requirements for this plan can be found in program-specific direction (USDI, BLM 1983).
A project-wide reclamation plan may be considered if it addresses the individual site disturbances
specifically.
With the exception of active work areas, disturbed areas anticipated to be left bare and exposed will be
stabilized with at least a 50-percent cover of mulch to prevent soil erosion. Variation of the cover
percentage and the use of other stabilizing materials can be proposed and used with BLM approval
consistent with the relevant project-specific reclamation plan. For areas anticipated for further disturbance
in the near future, use of the seed mixtures detailed in Temporary Seed Mixtures may be acceptable in the
interim.
First Growing Season
Reclamation actions will be implemented before the first growing season following disturbance with the
goal of returning the land to a condition approximate to or more productive than that which existed before
disturbance or to a stable and productive condition compatible with that described in the land use plan
Consistent with the reclamation plan, the operator will ensure the following during the first growing
season.
Prior to the beginning of the growing season—


Stabilize disturbed site soils until they are revegetated with no obstacles to germination and
growth of seed
 Properly prepare the site by—
o Recontouring for permanent reclamation
o Completing soil preparation activities, such as ripping, straw crimping/seedbed preparation
for planting, including drilling and broadcast methods
o Planting the approved seedling/seed mixtures using site-specific methods for successful
revegetation using regionally, and/or site-adapted genotypes
o Ensuring that weed treatments are compatible with seed mixtures.
During the first growing season—





Monitor germination and growth of plants in the area being reclaimed
Detect and control weeds in all areas―not just reclaimed areas
Use adaptive management to correct establishment and growth problems
Put up temporary fencing to avoid adverse effects to reclamation

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

E-11

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE



Build snow fencing, if requested, to increase effective precipitation and regenerate vegetation.

Following each growing season—



Review and complete a site-specific vegetation monitoring report for areas being reclaimed
(Table A36-1)
Prepare a written, site-specific prescription for actions to be implemented, including—
o Reseeding of areas not attaining reclamation success
o Soil stabilization
o Weed control needs
o Mulching/fertilization or other cultural practices prescribed for the following season.

If the treatment area is found, through site-specific monitoring data, to be successfully reclaimed,
monitoring to confirm reclamation success will continue for at least five seasons. The site will also
comply with additional management needs, including control of weed infestations.
If the reclamation area is not successfully reclaimed or otherwise requires further management activities
to establish vegetation, the actions prescribed will be implemented as planned and further monitoring will
occur as detailed beginning with the first action listed above.
PROJECT PROPONENT RECLAMATION MONITORING REPORTS
The project proponent will provide BLM with an annual report before December 1 for all sites disturbed.
The report will include—





Copies of the completed individual site review forms or a BLM-approved electronic report
A summary of monitoring data and results, including—
o
Individual site reclamation monitoring reporting data (Table A36-1)
o
Identification of sites successfully reclaimed by reclamation years (starting with the first
growing season)
o
Identification of sites needing additional work or more reclamation activities by reclamation
year
o

High Desert District Policy for Reclamation of Disturbed Lands

Program Area: All Surface Disturbing Activities.
Purpose: To affirm and adopt the Wyoming Reclamation Policy as codified in Instruction
Memorandum WY-2012-032, dated March 27, 2012.
Policy/Action: In order to ensure a consistent and science-based approach to reclamation, the
High Desert District (HDD) is adopting and implementing Instruction Memorandum (IM) WY2012-032 with its ten reclamation requirements as the minimum standards that must be
addressed when developing reclamation proposals for all surface disturbing activities occurring
within the HDD. Addressing these ten requirements will help achieve both short and long-term
reclamation success for site stabilization and eventual ecosystem reconstruction, as well as
promoting reclamation planning and implementation consistency within and across the Field
Office boundaries.
IM WY-2012-032 is supported with more detailed guidance such as a statewide monitoring and
reporting strategy, and sample templates, and other technical guidance posted on the Wyoming
Reclamation web site (http://www.blm.gov/wy/st/eniprograms/reclamation.html).
Timeframe: This IM is effective immediately.
Budget Impact: None
Background: Successful reclamation efforts are critical in maintaining an effective multiple use
land management program. Nearly all authorizations for surface disturbing actions are based
upon the assumption that an area can and ultimately will be successfully reclaimed. Those
seeking approval to conduct surface disturbing activities on Public Lands must include

reclamation planning as part of their permit process and the BLM must make this requirement
clear early in the permitting process. This IM applies to all BLM authorized surface disturbing
actions occurring within the High Desert District including those initiated by the BLM.
While development of a reclamation plan is a crucial component to achieving a successful
reclamation project, it can also become an overwhelming and overly-burdensome process for
operators, lessees, permit holders, and grant holders, as well as for BLM. It is imperative for us
to remember that the overriding objective is to achieve successful restoration/reclamation of
the disturbed area. It is far more desirable to have our external customers (lessees, operators, and
grant holders, etc.), as well as BLM concentrate the bulk of their and our reclamation dollars on
the physical on-the-ground reclamation components of the project, rather than on the
development of the plan. To that end it is imperative that we require the reclamation plans to
include no more than the minimum level of predisturbance site data and project component
description than is essential to assure the plan will meet the reclamation objective for the site. In
reiteration, do not require operators, lessees, and/or grant holders to gather and provide
more information than is necessary to verify that their reclamation plan will accomplish
BLM's interim and final reclamation objectives for the site. Remember that all BLM
initiated surface disturbance activities occurring within the District are also fully bound by this
policy; therefore our internal reclamation plans and pre-disturbance data gathering requirements
must be every bit as detailed as those we are requiring from our external customers.
A "hand-in-hand" component with reclamation planning is post-reclamation monitoring.
Without effective monitoring we cannot document whether the reclamation project is successful
or not, whether it meets the planned objective or not, nor will be we have a starting point from
which to initiate corrective measures. Effective monitoring will involve both the operators and
BLM. Refer to Section 10 of the Wyoming Reclamation Policy.
Existing field office reclamation policies must be reviewed and modified as necessary to insure
that they comply with requirements of this 1M and with the BLM Wyoming Reclamation Policy
WY-2012-032).

To:

District Managers and Deputy State Directors

From:

Associate State Director

Subject:

Wyoming Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Reclamation Policy

Program Areas:

All Surface Disturbing Activities.

Purpose:

Implement the Wyoming Reclamation Policy

Policy/Action: In order to ensure a consistent and science-based approach to reclamation, this
Instruction Memorandum (IM) identifies ten reclamation requirements (see Attachments) that must
be addressed when developing reclamation proposals for all surface disturbing activities. Addressing
these ten requirements will help achieve both short and long-term reclamation success for site
stabilization and eventual ecosystem reconstruction. The Wyoming Reclamation Policy was
previously issued under IM No. WY-2009-022 which expired on September 30, 2010. This IM
replaces IM No. WY-2009-022.
Background: Successful reclamation efforts are critical in maintaining an effective multiple-use land
management program. Nearly all authorizations for surface disturbing actions are based upon the
assumption that an area can and ultimately will be successfully reclaimed. Those seeking approval to
conduct surface disturbing activities on Public Lands must include reclamation planning as part of
their permit process and the BLM must make this requirement clear early in the permitting process.
This IM applies to all BLM authorized actions including those initiated by the BLM.
Timeframe: Effective immediately.
Budget Impact: Savings to Project funds in the long-term.
Manual/Handbook Sections Affected: This IM will be supported with more detailed guidance
including new reclamation bond standards and a statewide monitoring and reporting strategy.

Wyoming Reclamation Policy
The Wyoming Reclamation Policy is guidance for the modification, preparation and/or review of all
reclamation plans. It applies to all Federal actions authorized, conducted, or funded by the BLM that
disturb vegetation and/or the mineral/soil resources. This policy is intended to be support all BLM
program objectives.
A reclamation plan shall be developed for all surface disturbing activities and will become part of the
proposed action in the NEPA document. The level of detail for the reclamation plan shall reflect: the
complexity of the project, the environmental concerns, the reclamation potential for the site, and the revegetation strategy. These plans shall also incorporate any program or regulatory specific requirements
for reclamation. The reclamation plan shall address short term stabilization to facilitate long term
reclamation. The reclamation plan is considered complete when all the reclamation requirements
described below have been addressed, the techniques to meet the reclamation requirements are described
in detail, and the BLM concurs with the reclamation plan.
Many landscapes can be reclaimed using established conventional reclamation methods. However, some
areas have unique characteristics that make achieving all the reclamation requirements described in this
policy unrealistic. Innovative techniques beyond conventional practices must be considered and applied to
reclaim these more challenging areas. Areas posing the most extreme reclamation challenges will be
identified as having Limited Reclamation Potential (LRP). These areas are often characterized by highly
sensitive and/or erosive soils, highly sensitive vegetation types, soils with severe physical or chemical
limitations, extremely steep slopes, etc. These LRP areas may require site-specific reclamation measures
not specifically addressed in the Wyoming Reclamation Policy. Each Field Office shall develop a unique
set of reclamation success requirements for those areas within the framework of the attached Policy. The
additional difficulty of reclaiming these LRP areas should be considered in the Resource Management
Plan and evaluated when planning surface-disturbing activities. During the NEPA process, alternatives to
approving development activities in LRP areas should be carefully analyzed. Alternatives considered
should include: avoidance and/or unconventional site specific reclamation requirements. Resource
development activities approved in these areas may require additional bonding.
A. RECLAMATION GOALS
1. Short term goal: immediately stabilize disturbed areas and provide conditions necessary to
achieve the long term goal.
2. Long term goal: facilitate eventual native plant community and ecosystem reconstruction to
maintain a safe and stable landscape and meet the desired outcomes of the land use plan.
B. RECLAMATION REQUIREMENTS
The following Reclamation Requirements apply to all surface disturbing activities, including BLM
initiated activities, and must be addressed in each reclamation plan. These requirements also must be met
prior to release of the bond and/or the reclamation liability. Where these Reclamation Requirements
differ from other applicable Federal laws, rules, and regulations, those requirements supersede this
policy. State and/or local statutes or regulations may also apply.
1. Manage all waste materials:
a. Segregate, treat, and/or bio-remediate contaminated soil material.
b. Bury only authorized waste materials on site. Buried material must be covered with a minimum
of three feet of suitable material or meet other program standards.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

E-19

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

c. Ensure all waste materials moved off-site are transported to an authorized disposal facility.
2. Ensure subsurface integrity, and eliminate sources of ground and surface water contamination.
a. Properly plug all drill holes and other subsurface openings (mine shafts, adits etc.).
b. Stabilize, properly back fill, cap, and/or restrict from entry all open shafts, underground workings,
and other openings.
c. Control sources of contamination and implement best management practices to protect surface
and ground water quality.
3. Re-establish slope stability, surface stability, and desired topographic diversity.
a. Reconstruct the landscape to the approximate original contour or consistent with the land use
plan.
b. Maximize geomorphic stability and topographic diversity of the reclaimed topography.
c. Eliminate highwalls, cut slopes, and/or topographic depressions on site, unless otherwise
approved.
d. Minimize sheet and rill erosion on/or adjacent to the reclaimed area. There shall be no evidence
of mass wasting, head cutting, large rills or gullies, down cutting in drainages, or overall slope
instability on/or adjacent to the reclaimed area.

4. Reconstruct and stabilize water courses and drainage features.
a. Reconstruct drainage basins and reclaim impoundments to maintain the drainage pattern, profile,
and dimension to approximate the natural features found in nearby naturally functioning basins.
b. Reconstruct and stabilize stream channels, drainages, and impoundments to exhibit similar
hydrologic characteristics found in stable naturally functioning systems.

5. Maintain the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of the topsoil and subsoil (where
appropriate).
a. Identify, delineate, and segregate all salvaged topsoil and subsoil based on a site specific soil
evaluation, including depth, chemical, and physical characteristics.
b. Protect all stored soil material from erosion, degradation, and contamination.
c. Incorporate stored soil material into the disturbed landscape.
d. Soil storage piles to be stored beyond one growing season, should be seeded with appropriate
vegetation (native or sterile non-native species).
e. Identify stockpiles with appropriate signage.

6. Prepare site for revegetation.
a. Redistribute soil materials in a manner similar to the original vertical profile.
b. Reduce compaction to an appropriate depth (generally below the root zone) prior to redistribution
of topsoil, to accommodate desired plant species.
c. Provide suitable surface and subsurface physical, chemical, and biological properties to support
the long term establishment and viability of the desired plant community.

E-20

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

d. Protect seed and seedling establishment (e.g. erosion control matting, mulching, hydro-seeding,
surface roughening, fencing, etc.)

7. Establish desired self-perpetuating native plant community.
a. Establish species composition, diversity, structure, and total ground cover appropriate for the
desired plant community.
b. Enhance critical resource values (e.g. wildlife, range, recreation, biodiversity, etc.), where
appropriate, by augmenting or accelerating restoration of plant community composition,
diversity, and/or structure.
c. Select genetically appropriate and locally adapted native plant materials (e.g. locally sourced or
cultivars recommended for seed zone) based on the site characteristics and ecological setting.
d. Use locally sourced and/or collected seeds to the extent possible (local collection and logistics
should be included in the Reclamation Plan).
e. Select non-native plants only as an approved short term and non-persistent (i.e. sterile) alternative
to native plant materials. Ensure the non-natives will not hybridize, displace, or offer long-term
competition to the endemic plants, and are designed to aid in the re-establishment of native plant
communities.
8. Reestablish a complementary visual composition
a. Ensure the reclaimed landscape features blend into the adjacent area and conform to the land use
plan decisions.
b. Ensure the reclaimed landscape does not result in a long term change to the scenic quality of the
area.
9. Manage Invasive Plants
a. Assess for invasive plants before initiating surface disturbing activities.
b. Develop an invasive plant management plan.
c. Control invasive plants utilizing an integrated pest management approach.
d. Monitor invasive plant treatments.
10. Develop and implement a reclamation monitoring and reporting strategy.
a. Conduct compliance and effectiveness monitoring in accordance with a BLM (or other surface
management agency) approved monitoring protocol.
b. Evaluate monitoring data for compliance with the reclamation plan.
c. Document and report monitoring data and recommend revised reclamation strategies.
d. Implement revised reclamation strategies as needed.
e. Repeat the process of monitoring, evaluating, documenting/reporting, and implementing,
until reclamation goals are achieved.

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

PROPOSED INTERIM ROLLOVER OBJECTIVE FOR THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDECRESTON NATURAL GAS PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT AND
RECORD OF DECISION
There were numerous industry/state agency conversations concerning some type of phased or
consolidated development for the Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS). Unfortunately the complexity of the lease pattern and the number of leases made this effort
extremely challenging. Conversations led to trying to create language for authorizations, waivers,
modifications and exceptions to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Rawlins Resource Management
Plan (RMP) to provide rollover criteria that would contain more flexibility for industry, while maintaining
healthy, desirable vegetation within the field.
An ad hoc group came together to see if such an opportunity for additional rollover criteria might exist.
The following outlines the framework for the discussion:
1. Provide a scientifically sound framework to minimize initial disturbance and return disturbed
areas as quickly and effectively as possible to an ecologically stable or to pre-disturbance
condition(s).
2. Identify important interim reclamation practices that are required to ensure initial and continuing
interim rollover objectives (IRO).
The group is recommending that the rollover criteria as outlined below be considered as an alternative to
the current RMP rollover criteria, provided that all the pre and post disturbance activities as outlined in
Sections A through D are implemented.
Proposed IRO reclamation rollover criteria
The current Rawlins RMP Criteria for Reclamation Success are based in part on pre-disturbance surveys
or surveys of adjacent undisturbed natural ground cover and species composition or eighty percent of predisturbance ground cover and ninety percent dominant species.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the RMP, it is our recommendation to provide an alternative to the
above language and have revegetation cover be 70 percent of reference area cover to meet interim
reclamation criteria. All of this 70 percent must be desirable perennial species as represented by the seed
mix or background species. Items A, B, C, and D would also need to be completed as part of the interim
reclamation criteria.
The group understands that the BLM will require a comprehensive reclamation and weed management
plan within the CD-C project boundary as well as site-specific reclamation plans. It is understood that
many of the items we are recommending may appear duplicative to the existing Wyoming BLM
Reclamation Instructional Memorandum or other Field Office reclamation policy. As part of the more
flexible rollover criteria outlined below, we recommend that many of these duplicative practices should
be required as part of the rollover criteria and not be optional.
A.

PRE-PLANNING AND INVENTORY

Pre-disturbance inventories are used for two main purposes. The first purpose is to use site-specific
information (soil inventory and species identification) to develop a site-specific reclamation plan. The
second purpose is to identify any issues, such as saline soils, steep topography, or invasive species that
will impact successful interim and/or final reclamation. Below are the elements that should be required
for a more flexible rollover criteria.
1.

Identify significant landscape features and climate issues
a.

E-26

Climate and physical characteristics of the site are important factors to consider in
development of a reclamation plan, particularly in identifying possible problems. For

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

example, a site on a south-facing slope may indicate that more drought tolerant plants
should be selected than if the site is on a north-facing slope. Topography (slope and
aspect), climate (including postulated microclimate), and parent materials (geological
substrates) are additional considerations in site selection and reclamation plan
development.

2.

b.

Steep topography: Steep slopes greater than 25 percent would often result in site
instability and should be avoided.

c.

Poor or erodible parent materials, or a rocky surface, or marine shales, clay/siltstone, or
selenium-bearing geological substrates at the surface may result in difficult reclamation
conditions. Identification of these areas might indicate the need for additional site
planning.

Conduct a suitable soil inventory
a.

Soil characteristics strongly influence reclamation efforts. Fundamental characterization
of soils ahead of disturbance can identify potential problems, so they can be addressed
during disturbance, soil stockpiling and reclamation.

b.

The phrase “suitable soil” is used herein mainly because of confusion over the definition
of topsoil. Soil depth, pH, electrical conductivity, texture, surface features (e.g. barren,
rocky, crusty, plant litter), and organic matter content are characteristics that may be used
to determine if a soil is suitable. Other information may be needed. See “Successful
restoration of severely disturbed lands: Overview of critical components,” B-1202, (and
available for free at http://ces.uwyo.edu/PUBS/B1202.pdf).

c.

Soil characteristics that may signal reclamation problems include: pH, electrical
conductivity, soil texture, surface/subsurface features, sodium adsorption ratio, and soil
compaction. These are detailed below and will be addressed by the Operator in the sitespecific reclamation plan in the APD (application to drill) approved by the BLM:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

Soils with pH 8.4 and higher.
Depth: No suitable soil available or very shallow, less than 75 mm (3 inches).
Soil solutions with an electrical conductivity greater than eight (8) dS/m.
Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of 13 or higher when pH is greater than 8.4 and EC
is greater than 4.0ds/m.
Soils having textures of clay, sand or loamy sand.
Surface and subsurface soil in and through the root zone dominated by coarse
material greater than 2 mm in diameter and greater than 40 percent in the soil
profile.

3. Conduct a vegetation inventory
a.

Gathering vegetation data before a site has been cleared for drilling documents predisturbance site conditions and in turn guides reclamation decisions.
Seed mixes should be based on desired vegetation that has historically grown on-site and
return of cover should be gauged by comparison with actual pre-disturbance site
conditions and/or reference areas.
b. The following vegetation characteristics can signal a high probability of reclamation
problems:
i.

The presence of Halophytes: e.g. Saltbush

ii. The presence of Alkali Halophytes: e.g. Greasewood, Halogeton

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

E-27

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

iii. The presence of noxious or invasive species: e.g. Cheatgrass, Russian thistle,
Russian knapweed, Alyssum, Canadian thistle.
c. The methodologies to be used to determine the information for the vegetation inventory
are as follows:
BLM guidelines for vegetation sampling: Sampling Vegetation Attributes, Interagency
Technical Reference (1996) Revised in 1997 and 1999. BLM/RS/ST-96/002+1730. 171
pages. URL for Sampling Vegetation Attributes:
http://www.blm.gov/nstc/library/pdf/samplveg.pdf. All BLM technical references:
http://www.blm.gov/nstc/library/techref.htm.
4. Select a reference site
a. A reference site is a land unit which is representative, in terms of physiography, soils,
vegetation and land use history, of an area to be disturbed. Reclaimed sites are compared
to reference sites to determine successful interim and final reclamation.
b. In Wyoming, a site may be composed of multiple ecological communities (e.g. dunes,
alkali flats, and sagebrush). Ecological variation at a given site can make it difficult to
evaluate which adjacent area should serve as a reference. A reference site should be
chosen based upon the pre-disturbance assessment and the identified dominant
community on the site. This measure ensures that initial efforts to establish vegetation
are consistent with species that naturally occur at that location. A reference site located
adjacent to the site to be disturbed, with similar soils, vegetation, and aspect of the site
to be disturbed should be chosen.
B.

DEVELOP A SITE-SPECIFIC INVASIVE/NOXIOUS (INVASIVE) PLANT MANAGEMENT
PLAN FOR CONSTRUCTION AND RECLAMATION ACTIVITIES:

Disturbed sites can provide ideal opportunities for invasive plant species to propagate. An integrated sitespecific invasive plant management plan should be developed. The plan should include:
1. Assessment activities for invasive plant species before initiating surface disturbing activities
(pre-disturbance), during disturbance (annual monitoring), during interim and final reclamation,
and after reclamation is completed.
2. Describe treatments to control invasive plants.
3. Monitor invasive plant species at least annually to evaluate success of invasive plant control
treatments and determine if continued invasive plant control is necessary.
C.

DEVELOP A SITE-SPECIFIC RECLAMATION PLAN:

Reclamation planning provides a detailed strategy for returning a disturbed site back to a functioning predisturbance condition. The site-specific reclamation plan will be made part of the APD by the Operator
and BLM and includes the following:
1.

Identify and address any vegetation, climate, landscape or soil issues found in the predisturbance inventory.

2.

Site preparation, storm water, surface stability, and soil management for interim
reclamation.
Site preparation activities ready a site for revegetation activities and in general include
replacement of stockpiled suitable and unsuitable soils, reestablishing a stable subsurface
environment, recontouring (reconstruction of landscape), incorporation of soil amendments

E-28

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

and primary tillage/ripping to relieve soil compaction prior to spreading suitable soil and
secondary tillage.
a. Proper soil management prevents loss from erosion and preserves its ability to support a
productive plant community, the soil biota and their habitat as well as its physical and
chemical properties.
b. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) as required by Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) should be followed.
c. Surface Stability: The following describes considerations for how the Operator could
achieve surface stability:

3.

i.

Redistribute soil materials in a manner to optimize revegetation potential.

ii.

Relieve compaction of the redistributed soil (suitable and unsuitable) to an
appropriate depth just prior to seeding to accommodate desired plant species
germination and sustained growth.

iii.

Preparation of the seedbed includes but not limited to:
a.

Seedbed preparation methods should establish surface conditions to enhance
development of diverse, stable, and self-generating vegetation. The methods
selected should optimize surface stability and surface roughness using
techniques such as furrowing on the contour or surface pitting.

b.

Re-establish slope stability and surface stability.

c.

Reconstruct the landscape to the approximate original contour or a contour
consistent with the land use plan.

d.

Maximize geomorphic stability and topographic diversity of the reclaimed
topography.

e.

Eliminate high walls, cut slopes, and/or topographic depressions on site, unless
otherwise approved.

f.

Reconstruct drainage basins and reclaim impoundments to maintain the
drainage pattern, profile, and dimension to approximate the natural features
found in nearby naturally functioning basins.

g.

Reconstruct and stabilize stream channels, drainages, and impoundments to
exhibit similar hydrologic characteristics found in stable naturally functioning
systems.

h.

Minimize wind, sheet and rill erosion on/or adjacent to the reclaimed area.

i.

There should be no evidence of mass wasting, head cutting, large rills or
gullies, down cutting in drainages, or overall slope instability on/or adjacent to
the reclaimed area. Site selection is the favorable method to avoid these issues.

j.

Protect seed and seedling establishment (e.g. erosion control matting,
mulching, hydro-seeding, surface roughening, fencing, etc.)

Describe soil amendments
a. Soil amendment(s) may be used in reclamation if the soil is lacking the necessary
chemical, biological, physical and /or organic materials to support sustaining growth of
suitable plant materials.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

E-29

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

b. The Operator should state what applying soil amendments is intended to accomplish. Soil
amendment plans should be provided, including what amendments will be applied,
method of application, and timing relative to other reclamation activities (i.e. stockpiling,
seeding, ripping).
c. Soil amendments should be selected based on the undisturbed and/or existing soil
characteristics (see A. 2. c. iii) and scientific recommendations so as to provide the most
cost efficient and best assurances for successful reclamation.
d. Soil amendments include but are not limited to the following: Certified weed free grass,
hay, wood chips or other certified weed free cellulosic materials, gypsum, elemental
sulfur, and fertilizers.
4. Describe seeding methods
a.

Different plant species may require different conditions (e.g. seeding depth, seed
scarification, mixing, and timing) for optimal germination success. Seeding methods
should match germination characteristics of species in the seed mix and consider timing
of planting to maximize germination and establishment of all reclamation species.

b. The Operator will describe when seeding will occur and specify the methods they will
use for seeding, including differential handling for different species (e.g. broadcast,
drilling, imprinting), and seeding depth in the site-specific reclamation plan of the APD.
Reseeding may need to occur if invasive and/or noxious weeds prevent establishment of
the species in the seed mix. See Appendix A for references.
5. Seed mixes
a. Providing multifunctional and sustainable seed mixes for interim and final reclamation is
driven by a desire to increase potential for successful and timely revegetation and site
stability. Plant diversity and habitat functionality are directly impacted by the seed
choices applied to an area slated to be reclaimed or restored. To maintain as much
stability and ecological function, this section makes recommendations to specifically aid
an operator’s selection process. Please see Appendix A for references.
i.

Select appropriate native plant materials based on the pre-disturbance plant
community composition, site characteristics, and/or ecological site description.
Seeds may be obtained from commercial sources of certified weed free seed mixes.
Alternatively, local collections may be used provided they are collected in an area
without invasive species. Reclamation should succeed using native species if soils
are properly managed, precipitation is near average for the region, seed mixes are
carefully selected and seeded areas protected from grazing.

ii. Perennial naturalized species may be used when attempts to reclaim using native
plants have not succeeded for a minimum of two full growing seasons.
iii. Based upon site-specific conditions, a decision may be made to use naturalized
species sooner than identified above and will be used in only unique conditions
defined in the site-specific reclamation plan in the APD.
6. Describe if and how irrigation techniques will be used in the reclamation plan.
a. Revegetation success is highly dependent on timing and amounts of precipitation.
However, variable weather in Wyoming can limit or delay successful germination and
establishment of plants. Irrigation can supplement natural precipitation to insure success of
newly seeded sites during the initial growth period of the plant. Irrigation practices should

E-30

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

be used carefully and conservatively. Irrigation can be cost prohibitive and should not be a
requirement for reclamation but used as a tool to enhance vegetation establishment.
b. Both soil and water samples should be tested before application and water source should
meet appropriate limits for SAR and EC. Special consideration of soil chemistry and
amendments will be a determining factor for the use of the source water.
c. Water must be utilized from permitted sources (State Engineer’s Office) and from sources
permitted for irrigation. Produced water, (e.g. coal bed natural gas wells) must adhere to
discharge permit requirements.
7. Describe best management practices
a. Best Management Practices (BMPs) are techniques that can be applied to surface
disturbance and reclamation actions to aid in reclamation success. Identify the appropriate
BMPs during planning and they can guide the surface disturbance and reclamation
process. Additionally, documenting BMPs provides opportunities to evaluate success, so
BMPs can be modified for future use in similar conditions. Please see Appendix A for
recommended BLM and other Best Management Practices.
8. Description of monitoring and reporting protocols for interim reclamation objective.
The purpose of the Interim Reclamation Objective (IRO) is to reconstruct and revegetate the
portion of the disturbed land unused for long term production and establish the vegetation
cover sufficient to maintain a healthy, biologically active topsoil; control erosion; and
minimize habitat, visual and forage loss during the life of the well and/or facilities.
The long-term Final Reclamation Objective (FRO) is to return the land to a condition that
which existed prior to disturbance with allowances for an improved and/or stable ecological
condition, if possible.
a. Site monitoring is conducted to observe and keep track of environmental conditions on the
reclaimed site. Specifically, monitoring is done to document development of the reseeded
plant community, identification of problem species, soil stability and assess ecosystem
function. Continued characterization after disturbance and during interim reclamation is
appropriate for monitoring site maturation and stability, particularly when problematic soil
conditions or invasive weeds are identified.
b. Vegetation monitoring and disturbed site evaluation for any component of the reclamation
plan applicable to the APD takes place at intervals agreed to by the BLM and the
Operator. Generally the intervals for monitoring and reporting will be set annually unless
otherwise agreed to as a condition to the reclamation plan. Achievement of the IRO by the
Operator may reduce the time of mandatory monitoring and reporting. These changes to
monitoring and reporting will be added to the reclamation plan by the BLM. Once the
disturbed site achieves the approved IRO, the site will still be subject to all applicable
requirements of the reclamation plan until the FRO is achieved by the Operator and
approved by the BLM.
c. Monitoring should be designed and implemented by the Operator to document continuing
successful reclamation rollover using methodologies approved by BLM.
i.

Once the IRO is achieved and reclamation rollover granted by BLM, the Operator
will continue to monitor the condition of the reclamation, document that the
revegetation continues to meet IRO.
ii. During monitoring, the Operator will identify potential problems and recommend
appropriate mitigation measures that can be implemented through BLM’s adaptive
management process.

d. The required elements of monitoring to assess IRO and FRO will be identified and
addressed by the Operator in the site-specific reclamation plan. Please see Appendix A for
additional information.

7.

Beginning Monitoring. Monitoring should begin in the first growing season. Rollover
evaluation is possible after a minimum of two full growing seasons.
Irrigation and monitoring. If irrigation is used initially, then the reclamation may be
evaluated for interim reclamation success two (2) full growing seasons (or the third growing
season) after irrigation ceases to assure that the vegetation can survive without supplemental
water.
Monitoring results must be from a standardized cover/species protocol approved by
BLM.
Invasive Plants. No invasive weeds will be allowed. Invasive species cover no greater than
adjacent invasive species cover will be allowed. All other undesirable perennial or annual
plants as defined in the site-specific APD should be controlled or eradicated on the disturbed
area.
Undesirable/annual plants. For purposes of successful IRO achievement, the amount
of invasive plant species should comply with the site-specific reclamation plan.
Vegetation trend. If the vegetation trend towards the IRO achievement is not positive within 3
full growing seasons without irrigation or 2 years after irrigation (third growing season) ceases,
the BLM and Operator will determine the needs for the disturbed site.
Erosion. Erosion indicators should be equal to or less than the adjacent reference area.

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

APPENDIX A
This appendix is designed to provide a very general description of stockpiling suitable soil, irrigation of
reclamation sites and monitoring vegetation and soils after reclamation. These are not hard and fast
prescriptions but rather they are best management practices that might best be considered as an outline of
issues to be considered during reclamation efforts.
A. Suggestions on Stockpiling Suitable and Unsuitable Soils to Maintain Soil Quality
Stockpiled suitable soil should not be piled too deeply or too shallowly. Areas of the site to be covered by
stockpiles of unsuitable soils will be stripped of suitable soil prior to their use. The taller or deeper the
piles, the more soil is subjected to increasing pressure resulting in compaction. Soil buried deep in the pile
also has little exposure to oxygen resulting in anaerobiosis; deeply buried soil also has no organic matter
input. Both of these reduce soil quality.
Shallow or small suitable soil stockpiles have large footprints on the land surface with the disadvantage of
covering greater areas of undisturbed soil which will, in turn, require revegetation, resulting in a greater
overall amount of disturbed soil. Smaller or shallow stockpiles also have a greater surface area per
volume of soil stored. This increases exposure of the stockpiled soil to wind and water erosion. The
surface of soil stockpiles should always be vegetated to minimize erosion losses.
1.
2.
3.

4.
5.

6.

Salvaged stockpiles of suitable soil should normally be no deeper than 4 meters (13 ft) and
should be less where possible.
Stockpile slopes should not exceed 3:1 angles (20 percent slopes) to allow for seeding and to
minimize erosion.
Suitable soil stockpiles should be located in areas well enough protected to prevent their
disturbance and contamination by well pad activities. They should not be placed in streambeds
or ephemeral drainages where they may be washed away. They should be protected from wind
erosion. Suitable soil should be put on areas that were not skinned. Unsuitable soil should be
put on areas that were ‘skinned’.
Consider a perimeter ditch/berm/fencing or other techniques around the stockpile for topsoil
conservation and sediment control.
All suitable soil stockpiles should be seeded with appropriate vegetation (native locally sourced
is preferred) to provide cover and protect them from water and wind erosion. Before seeding,
the stockpile may be scarified along contours to minimize wind and water erosion.
If soil horizons or layers are to be stratified during soil salvage (stripping) operations, soil maps
should be made of the well pad area to identify depths of soil horizons and surface slope. The
pad area to be cleared of soils should then be divided into strips the size of the blades or
equipment being used for soil removal. The depth of soil removal from each swath should be
clearly marked so that equipment operators are removing a uniform layer from each strip. After
the suitable soil is removed from the area in this manner, the subsoil can then be removed in the
same fashion, strip by strip, each strip at a uniform depth.

B. Suggestions on Supplemental Irrigation
Supplemental irrigation should be scientifically calculated and applied in the initial four to six week
period of growth of the seedling plants and then ended. Such determination could be the application of an
amount of irrigation water equivalent to the average or average plus 25 percent of the precipitation
expected during a given interval.

Suggestions on Vegetation and Soil Monitoring

Examples of monitoring components are listed below:
1. Reference: http://agriculture.wy.gov/images/stories/pdf/forms/natres/rangelandmonitoring.pdf
2. Operators should use the same locations and methods used at baseline for repeat photography.
Additional locations may be selected to document progress of reclaimed area to demonstrate
interim and final reclamation success, and to monitor any identified problems such as erosion.
The site should be photographed once every year normally during the same time period, from
the same locations and direction so that photographs are repeated through time. Photographs
should be taken during the growing season.
3. Weed assessment: Disturbed and reclaimed areas should be evaluated for noxious and invasive
plants at least annually. Weed control should be promptly implemented by the Operator once
weed species and infestations are identified. Weed control applied at planned chemical rates at
times the weed is emerging can have positive impacts in minimizing weed growth through-out
the year as well as promoting the growth of grass species. The timing of the control should be
determined by the growth habits of the weed species and when they are most effectively
assessed. If weeds persist, reseeding the site could be considered as well as the species of grass,
forb or shrub.
4. Erosion control/soil stability: The reclaimed area should be evaluated for any signs of erosion
problems annually and when the site is subject to erosional events. Identified erosion features
should be monitored using repeat photography. Absence of erosion features is a positive
indication that the soil is stabilizing.
5. Cover and composition data should be used to document that the plant community continues to
trend toward the requirements to achieve interim and final reclamation targets. The data should
be used to evaluate if species composition and cover are increasing. These factors should be
considered relative to the number of species in the seed mix, the selected reference area, and
offsite responses to seasonal growing conditions.
6. Plant community cover and composition measurements: The Operator should start collecting
cover and composition data beginning in the first (1st) growing season after disturbance. Data
should be collected using repeatable methods approved by the appropriate regulatory authority
(BLM) and should be the same methods that were used to describe vegetation for baseline (or
reference areas. The same methods should be used each time the vegetation is monitored.
7. Soils should be monitored if reclamation problems suggest that soils might be the problem.
Such problems include but are not limited to salt crusts, clay crusts, wind and/or water erosion
and rapid changes in pH (up or down). Recommended soil monitoring would include sampling
soils and analysis of soil characteristics as described in the main body of Part A, 2 ii. Suitable
soil inventory.

BLM Rollover Criteria
Continental Divide-Creston Environmental Impact Statement
INTRODUCTION
It is reasonable to anticipate that successful reclamation activities within the Continental Divide-Creston
project area will be difficult. This can be observed by reviewing Map 3.3-5 which shows an estimated 75
percent of the area with “poor” reclamation potential. Reclamation potential of soils in the CD-C project
area is limited by saline/sodic soil conditions and either clayey or sandy soil textures (Table 3.3-1). In
addition to these soil limitations, low annual precipitation of 6 – 10 inches in conjunction with erosion by
wind and water will make successful reclamation difficult to attain quickly. Periodic droughts and
extreme climatic conditions further complicate successful reclamation.
RECLAMATION PERFORMANCE MONITORING
Monitoring should include both qualitative data collection techniques and quantitative data collection.
Qualitative evaluation of the interim reclamation can include the evaluation of soil movement (rills, sheet
flow, petal-stilling, etc.), vegetative components (presence/absence of species, estimation of population
and the population’s condition) as well as visual contrast. The quantitative data collection should include
both aerial and basal cover. The data should note the species during the evaluation. It is important to use
the same methods for qualitative and quantitative data collection during each site evaluation to show a
trend and display that the Interim Rollover Objective (IRO) has been met.
DISTINCTION BETWEEN INTERIM AND FINAL RECLAMATION
Two types of reclamation will occur within the CD-C area. Final reclamation occurs when all facilities
are removed (e.g. plugged and abandoned, the site is re-contoured back to its original topography, and
adequate native vegetation communities similar to those originally disturbed are established including, in
part, weed control and stable soils). When completed and accepted the company’s bond is released and
the site returns to BLM control. High desert sites, such as those found at CD-C, are slow to return to their
original vegetative states, often requiring decades of time even with successful reclamation.
Interim reclamation occurs within the next growing season on any disturbance not needing to be
continuously disturbed by ongoing operational activities. The existing pipelines, roadsides, and portions
of well pads not needed for operations are examples of short-term disturbance which requires interim
reclamation. Areas with interim reclamation may be disturbed again by new construction or operational
activities that may occur. Those areas will be reclaimed after any disturbance to maintain interim
reclamation. Areas of a well pad might also remain undisturbed until final reclamation is achieved.
Circumstances will vary site by site over the course of the project.
PURPOSE OF A DISTURBANCE CAP
A disturbance cap is a limit on the extent of surface disturbance that can occur within a given area. A
disturbance cap that has potential to limit development activities within an area creates a direct incentive
for developers to conduct successful reclamation on disturbed lands. Once the disturbance cap is reached
further development is constrained until the disturbance acreage is reduced as a result of attaining the
IRO.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

E-43

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

ROLLOVER CONCEPT
Surface disturbance that has been reclaimed to the IRO standard will be classified as successful interim
reclamation and this acreage can then be deducted from the number of acres counted as surface
disturbance (or rolled over) for the area, and further disturbance could occur under the disturbance cap.
The conditions under which interim reclamation can be considered acceptable for “rollover” are crucial
for managing disturbance and the effects thereof on the natural resources BLM manages.
OBJECTIVES FOR INTERIM RECLAMATION
Work conducted in part by the State of Wyoming, local Conservation Districts, the University of
Wyoming, participating leaseholders, oil and gas developers, and the BLM led to the development of
several objectives for interim reclamation. It was agreed that the purpose of the IRO is to identify when
reconstruction and re-vegetation activities on disturbed lands is adequate for rollover credit for the
companies. Rollover credit could not be applied to the portion of the disturbed surface used for long-term
production and continuous disturbance.
The IRO is to establish vegetation cover sufficient to maintain a healthy, biologically active topsoil;
control erosion; and minimize habitat, visual, and forage loss during the life of the disturbed area. In
addition, it was determined that the elimination of noxious weeds and the control of invasive non-native
weeds must have occurred for successful attainment of IRO.
RECLAMATION ROLLOVER CRITERIA
The reclamation success standards listed below are the measures that would be used to evaluate whether
the interim reclamation is successful:






The area is revegetated with a stable, approved plant community.
Vegetative cover is sufficient to maintain a healthy, biologically active topsoil.
Erosion is controlled.
Habitat, visual, and forage loss is minimized.
No noxious weeds are present.

ACCOUNTING FOR DISTURBANCE TRACKING
Once a proposal for surface disturbance is approved and constructed the company will record the as-built
disturbance using a GPS system compatible with the BLM’s system. The extent of all disturbance from
the approved proposal will be determined. The company will maintain a record of the extent of
disturbance, generally by aliquot section, Township and Range, or by lease as applicable.
When further disturbance within an area is proposed the company will submit its existing disturbance
records for the area in question to the BLM along with the rest of its plan of development. The BLM will
review the existing extent of disturbance.
If the disturbance extent meets or exceeds the applicable disturbance extent cap then the BLM will
request from the Company why further disturbance should be approved. Based on the response from the
company the BLM will consider the proposal in the site-specific NEPA document for the proposal tiered
to the CD-C Record of Decision (ROD).
If the new disturbance extent proposed does not meet or exceed the disturbance cap for the area in
question the BLM will evaluate the proposal with a site-specific NEPA document and determine what, if
any, disturbance will be approved. Once construction activities are completed the company will supply

APPENDIX E—RECLAMATION GUIDANCE

the BLM with the new as-built surface disturbance extent as provided above. The new disturbance
information will be added to the existing data to determine the current disturbance figure.
Reclamation of the disturbed surface by the companies will be monitored by the companies at least
annually as provided in the reclamation monitoring provisions of the Reclamation Plan. When the
company feels disturbed sites have attained the IRO described above, the company may propose to the
BLM to withdraw the acreage meeting the IRO from the surface disturbance acreage estimate. The BLM
will reduce the disturbance figure when it is determined by the BLM that the IRO has been met, from data
supplied by the company. The BLM may consult with cooperating agencies in its assessment of the data
but the BLM is the final decision-maker on whether the IRO has been attained.
In the event areas meeting the IRO that have been removed from the disturbance are in turn re-disturbed,
the acreage re-disturbed will be added back into the surface disturbance acreage estimate.

Preface
Energy by Design presents a method for determining the potential for mitigation of impacts to wildlife
that may be utilized as a result of the Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) natural gas project. BP America
Production Company (BP), one of the principal operators in the CD-C project area, invited The Nature
Conservancy to design a structured framework that would evaluate the potential for conflict mitigation
between natural gas development and wildlife and wildlife habitat. First, the framework would identify
areas that are considered to have high wildlife values within the regional landscape and should provide
the most effective mitigation opportunities. Second, opportunities for mitigating unavoidable impacts
between natural gas development and identified wildlife values would be evaluated.
The framework and potential mitigation opportunities described in Energy by Design do not have a direct
association with the Proposed Action or any of the alternatives. This appendix and associated mitigation
opportunities have been included in the Draft CD-C EIS for informational purposes only. This
information may be utilized if the BLM’s final decisions on the CD-C EIS were to include the use of offsite mitigation for impacts on wildlife and wildlife habitat.

APPENDIX G—COOPERATIVE MITIGATION PLANNING

Introduction and Background
In many cases the environmental mitigation process for development projects is ad hoc, opaque, and
insufficient, failing to deliver effective outcomes for biodiversity conservation (McKenney and Kiesecker
2009). Mitigation planning too often reflects a reactive, piecemeal approach, focused on site-level impacts
of the next proposed project. Here we seek to balance the needs of planned developments with those of
biodiversity conservation. The aim is to bring greater efficiencies to development planning and impact
mitigation, and more effective conservation outcomes. We seek to improve implementation of the
“mitigation hierarchy” at each stage—avoid, minimize/restore, and offset—in a way that is transparent
and transferable to industry and regulators, and complementary to the environmental assessment
(Kiesecker et al. 2010a). By evaluating threats and impacts at regional and site levels, in a proactive
fashion, mitigation planning can steer development projects away from conservation priorities and ensure
mitigation provides a higher return for conservation. We generate this up-front planning information by
harnessing decades of conservation planning experience, extensive ecological data, and advanced
computer-modeling tools, and applying them to assess onsite conservation values as well as to locate
compensatory mitigation opportunities.
Mitigation frameworks often ask developers if they have followed the mitigation hierarchy (Council on
Environmental Quality 2000) of seeking to avoid, minimize, and restore biodiversity onsite before
considering an offset for the residual impacts. However, no quantitative guidelines exist to guide this
decision-making process. Landscape-level planning and associated tools provide a framework to address
this problem. Identifying wildlife values at a landscape scale and understanding the landscape value of
local occurrences can guide decisions regarding when impacts should be avoided or when they can be
offset. Placing mitigation design within a landscape-level planning framework can ensure that
development actions are consistent with conservation goals.
Here we describe an analysis for the Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) natural gas field that can be used
to inform avoidance of important resources onsite within the field, as well as compensatory mitigation
opportunities. BP America Production Company (BP), one of the principal operators on the field,
expressed the need for a structured framework to complement the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
that could be used to avoid potential conflicts between development and onsite wildlife values and
identify opportunities to balance onsite impacts with additional conservation options to offset these
impacts. BP invited The Nature Conservancy to design such a plan. First, we identified areas within the
field that have high value for wildlife or other resources from a regional landscape perspective and should
be given special consideration for avoiding impacts from development. Second, we identified
opportunities to utilize offsets to mitigate for unavoidable impacts associated with gas development on the
field. We sought to design an offset framework where the offsets are ecologically equivalent to the
impacts. All methods are adapted from a previous mitigation framework in Wyoming (Kiesecker et al.
2009, Kiesecker et al. 2010b).

Methods
The analysis for the CD-C development included six steps, each of which is described in more detail
below: (1) assemble a working group, (2) identify representative biological targets, (3) gather spatial data
for biological targets, (4) examine potential onsite development, (5) set impact goals for each biological
target associated with the development, and (6) use the Marxan algorithm at increasing spatial extents to
identify potential offset sites both on and off the project area.
Study area. Our study area was the 1.1-million acre CD-C natural gas field in Southern Wyoming where
BP proposed a project that included drilling up to 8,950 new gas wells. The CD-C natural gas field is a
high-desert xeric shrubland ecosystem that provides critical habitat for ungulates (pronghorn, mule deer
and moose), songbirds, and raptors, in the desert shrublands west of the Sierra Madre mountain range.
Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations within the field are also a concern, a

species recently considered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for the endangered species
list and issued a “warranted, but precluded” listing.
Assemble a working group
A mitigation-design science working group was formed to provide guidance on selection of representative
biological targets, designing offsets, and integrating spatial data into the site selection process. These
participants (see Table G-1) had expertise and involvement with the biological systems that may be
impacted by the CD-C development and included representatives from the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department (WGFD), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), USFWS, University of Wyoming (UW),
biological consulting firms, and the local agricultural production community. The working group helped
to provide the most current spatial data for the biological targets, assessed the predictive models being
developed, and offered insights into the process being developed. We sought to apply rigorous, objective
measures of conservation value whenever possible, recognizing that a quantitative assessment would need
to be supplemented by expert opinion. Several meetings were held with members of the working group in
2008 and 2009.
Compile a list of representative biological targets
Biological diversity cannot easily be completely and directly measured. Thus practitioners are forced to
select a set of components of biological diversity that can be measured effectively given existing
resources, that adequately represent the range of biological phenomena in the project area, and that
contribute the most to overall biological diversity of a project area. We addressed the selection of focal
targets that would represent wildlife values on the CD-C field with sufficient breadth and depth by
starting with the BLM sensitive species list for the Rawlins Field Office (http://swccd.us/images/M_WyoBLM_Sensitivespecies.pdf). We also consulted the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s
Species of Greatest Conservation Concern (http://gf.state.wy.us/wildlife/CompConvStrategy/SectionI.pdf) and The Nature Conservancy’s Wyoming Basins Ecoregional Assessment
(Freilich et al. 2001). All biological targets from these lists with data demonstrating occurrence within the
bounds of the CD-C field area were selected as a biological targets to be included in the mitigation
planning.
This process resulted in 14 species and 10 systems being selected (Table G-2). The targets included three
rare plant species—Nelson’s milkvetch (Astragalus nelsonianus), Gibben’s beardtongue (Penstemon
gibbensii) and Persistent sepal yellowcress (Rorippa calycina)—all of which have the majority of their
known occurrences within the study area (Fertig and Thurston 2003). All ecological systems occurring in
the CD-C development area were included as targets and are listed in Table G-2. The eleven selected
wildlife species included two amphibians: the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) and Great Basin
spadefoot (Spea intermontana). Amphibian breeding habitat is quite rare in the Wyoming basins
Ecoregion (Frelitch et al. 2000), meaning that occurrences of these habitats within the development area
are particularly important. Crucial winter range and migration corridors were included for mule deer
(Odocoileus hemionus) and pronghorn antelope (Antilocarpa americana). Adversely affecting these
critical components of their habitat could lead to population loss—declines have been recently recorded
for mule deer populations in the Upper Green River Basin and mule deer have been shown to avoid oil
and gas development (Sawyer et al. 2009). The other wildlife species included were the black-footed
ferret (Mustela nigripes), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis),
mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), and Wyoming pocket
gopher (Spermophilus elegans).
Wyoming pocket gophers are known only from a small area in south-central Wyoming, and the field may
represent a significant portion of their range (Keinath and Beauvais 2006). In general, range-wide it is
believed that pygmy rabbit abundance is declining in most known populations (Dobler and Dixon 1990).

G-2

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX G—COOPERATIVE MITIGATION PLANNING

Information suggests that pygmy rabbit populations can decline rapidly in areas where suitable habitat is
altered (Weiss and Vert 1984, Gahr 1993), necessitating additional consideration. Burrowing owls are a
neotropical migrant that receives protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Convention of
International Trade in Endangered Species, and BLM has surface occupancy stipulations for the species
(OMBM 1995). While the FWS recognizes the ferruginous hawk as a species of concern (USFWS 1996),
it does not give the species any special status under the Endangered Species Act. However, the
ferruginous hawk is considered to be declining in several areas, but there is little data available on
magnitude of declines (Bechard 1981, Houston and Bechard 1984, Woffinden and Murphy 1989, Ure et
al. 1991). Aquatic habitats are of critical importance for wildlife in arid environments and thus all aquatic
ecological systems have been identified (playas and riparian wet meadows). Greater sage-grouse
(Centrocercus urophasianus), previously widespread, have been extirpated from nearly half of their
original range in western North America (Schroeder et al. 2004) with a range-wide population decline of
45 – 80 percent and local declines of 17 – 92 percent (Connelly and Braun 1997, Braun 1998, Connelly et
al. 2004). Energy development has emerged as a key issue in sage-grouse conservation, as sage-grouse
populations appear sensitive to oil and gas development (Holloran 2005, Aldridge and Boyce 2007,
Walker et al. 2007).
Spatial data for biological targets
Spatial data were used to identify biological targets occurring within the CD-C field, as well as
occurrence of those targets beyond the field boundary where offsets might be applied. The spatial datasets
used to represent each target onsite and offsite are detailed in Table G-2 and include point survey data,
vegetation cover estimates, and predictive model estimates.
In cases where survey data were sufficient for estimating occurrence patterns, we relied on these data. For
example, for pronghorn, we utilized pronghorn migration routes from the WGFD (2006). In cases where
survey data were insufficient to estimate occurrence patterns across the study area, we used predicted
habitat models based on species occurrence, observation, and survey data from the Wyoming Natural
Diversity Database (WYNDD), Hayden-Wing Associates (HWA), WGFD, and the BLM. We created
predictive habitat models for three species (Great Basin spadefoot, northern leopard frog, and sage-grouse
winter habitat) for which existing models were not available, using methods from Kiesecker et al. (2009).
Offset goals for biological targets
Our intention with this analysis was not to reinvent the EIS process, as there is an extensive literature on
this subject (Canter 1996, Sadar et al. 1995); rather we intended to provide an approach that could
complement the ongoing EIS. Thus, for this assessment we used a simple approach to quantify field-level
impacts and divided the field into four separate units based on the current well-spacing designations (160acre spacing, 80-acre spacing, 60-acre spacing and 40-acre spacing) approved by the Wyoming Oil and
Gas Commission (http://wogcc.state.wy.us/). Since companies must actively petition to decrease well
spacing below 160-acre spacing, we assumed that these areas have a higher probability of development.
We set mitigation goals on and off the project field area differently. We intersected the spatial data for
each of the biological targets with the well-spacing category and calculated the acres (for polygons) and
number of occurrences (for points) of each target (Map G-2, Table G-2) that would need to be mitigated
within these areas.
We examined two possible mitigation scenarios:
1. Where development and associated impacts would be concentrated with the areas designated as 40and 60-acre well spacing, and set goals based on impacts to those areas. Also, we confined the areas
that could serve as potential offset sites within the CD-C project area (Map G-2).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

G-3

APPENDIX G—COOPERATIVE MITIGATION PLANNING

2. Development and associated impacts in the area designated as 80-acre spacing, and set goals based
on impacts to those areas. Also, the analysis for potential offset sites was expanded to outside the
CD-C project area (Maps F-2 and F-3).
Selecting potential mitigation sites with Marxan
We used the Marxan (version 1.8.2) site-selection algorithm (Ball and Possingham 2000) to select
appropriate locations for potential offset sites within the onsite and offsite project areas. We developed
criteria to ensure offsets would mitigate onsite impacts, and ran analyses based on the potential impacts
associated with the two scenarios (40- to 60-acre spacing and 80-acre spacing).
Marxan is a siting tool for landscape conservation analysis that explicitly incorporates spatial design
criteria into the site-selection process. Marxan operates as a stand-alone program and utilizes an algorithm
called “simulated annealing with iterative improvement” as a heuristic method for efficiently selecting
regionally representative sets of areas for biodiversity conservation (Possingham et al. 2000). Marxan
allows inputs of target occurrences represented as points or polygons in a GIS environment and allows for
conservation goals to be stated in a variety of ways, such as percent area or numbers of point occurrences.
The program also allows for the integration of spatial data sets representing land use pattern and
conservation status, and enables rapid evaluation of alternative configurations or scenarios. The ultimate
objective is to minimize the cost of the sites selected (i.e. cost = landscape integrity, conservation cost in
dollars, size of the reserve) while still meeting objectives.
The working group selected 100-hectare (approximately 250-acre) hexagons as the unit of analysis for
running Marxan, because this was of sufficient spatial resolution to represent biological targets and also
large enough to permit efficient analyses across broad landscape scales. The effectiveness of a contiguous
set of hexagon units for defining natural variability, especially among spatially heterogeneous data sets, is
well documented (White et al. 1992). Each hexagon was populated by summing the area of suitable
habitat for the targeted community or species. In addition to the biological information used to select
potential offset sites, we incorporated a series of additional rules. First we guided site selection to areas of
high biological integrity (as per Copeland et al. 2007). This is equivalent to the “cost” function utilized by
Marxan (Ball and Possingham 2000).

Results and Discussion
These results complement the planning and analysis work conducted as part of the CD-C EIS, provides an
assessment of biological values that are important at a regional scale, and identifies areas where
conservation projects targeted at impacted species may provide a way to offset impacts associated with
development.
Mapping Sensitive Features
Our maps and data of sensitive features (Map G-1) could be used in a variety of ways to both avoid
potential conflicts between development and key wildlife resources on the field and minimize impacts
associated with development. For example, impacts to known rare plant occurrences (Nelson milkvetch,
Gibbens’ penstemon and persistent sepal yellowcress) should be avoided given their limited distributions
and occurrence patterns. Furthermore, predictive habitat species models could be used to guide surveys
prior to development. Impacts to rare and/or sensitive animal species (Wyoming pocket gopher,
ferruginous hawk, pygmy rabbit, sage-grouse and burrowing owl) should be avoided whenever possible.
For sage-grouse this should include both breeding (= leks) and wintering habitat. Aquatic targets (playas,
wet meadows, and amphibians, including northern leopard frog and Great Basin spadefoot toad) should
also be given special consideration and impacts to any riparian or wetland habitats should be avoided.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX G—COOPERATIVE MITIGATION PLANNING

Onsite and Offsite Mitigation Areas
Mitigation sites could be used in a number of ways to compensate for impacts associated with
development. A simple approach may be for BLM to establish a surface disturbance (or activity)
threshold on a section-by-section basis (or some other spatial unit) and if development exceeds these
disturbance caps it would trigger the need to offset the wildlife values within that section. Alternatively,
monitoring plots both within development areas and outside development areas could be established for
key wildlife targets. Monitoring that reveals departures (declining trends in populations or habitat quality
indices) between development and non-development areas could trigger the need for offsets and could be
directed at declining species. For this reason we have included an assessment of offset sites and the
species/systems they may benefit.
It is important to note that our site-selection exercise did not account for future oil and gas development
potential. Prior to establishing these sites for actual mitigation offsets, the development potential should
be carefully evaluated and incorporated into the decision-making process.
If offsets are used, a number of criteria will need to be addressed to ensure offsets provide the needed
benefit. Critical to their usage will be the demonstration of additional conservations benefits (Kiesecker et
al. 2009a) that accrue to impacted wildlife species and systems. Areas selected will only be valuable as
offsets if opportunities exist to either restore (i.e. improve conditions for target species) habitat or abate
future threats (i.e. prevent invasive weed establishment, conservation easements) to habitat in a manner
that improves the condition for target species. Reaching no net loss from impacts associated with
development will come from onsite actions that minimize impacts or restore habitat, combined with
offsite actions that provide additional benefits. As on-the ground projects are considered, a finer currency
that incorporates the size of the impact and offset, as well as values associated with ecological function,
quality, and integrity will need to be established (Kiesecker et al. 2009a). For the sagebrush ecosystem,
several site assessment tools are available for use (i.e., USFWS 1980, habitat evaluation procedures;
USNRCS 1997, ecological site descriptions; Parkes et al. 2003, habitat hectares approach).

1.

INTRODUCTION

This wildlife inventory, monitoring, and protection plan was prepared in conjunction with the Continental
Divide-Creston Environmental Impact Statement (CD-C EIS) for the CD-C project area. The BLM is
responsible to manage for the biological integrity and habitat function of both terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems within the CD-C project area to sustain and optimize the distribution and abundance of all
native, desirable non-native, and Special Status Species (Approved Rawlins Resource Management Plan
and Record of Decision [Rawlins RMP] 2008a). The goal of the plan is to avoid and/or minimize adverse
impacts to wildlife present on project-affected areas by:




monitoring wildlife population trends within and adjacent to the CD-C project area during the
course of project development and operations,
developing appropriate mitigation actions, and
analyzing the effectiveness of the mitigation measures.

Implementation of the plan will provide opportunities for land managers and project personnel to achieve
and maintain desired levels of wildlife productivity and populations within and adjacent to the CD-C
project area (e.g., at pre-project levels) by minimizing and/or avoiding potential adverse impacts to
wildlife species. In addition, the implementation of this plan will facilitate the maintenance of a diverse
assemblage of wildlife populations within and adjacent to the CD-C project area simultaneously with
development of natural gas reserves.
Proposed inventory, monitoring, protection measures, cause and effect, and adaptive management
mitigation will be implemented under the preferred alternative selected for the EIS. Implementation of the
plan will begin upon the signing of the Record of Decision (ROD), and is estimated to continue for the
life of the EIS. The plan will receive a review for effectiveness by the BLM annually.

2.

IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL

This Wildlife and Plant Inventory/Monitoring, Protection/Adaptive Management, and Analysis
Implementation Plan (Plan) contains four (4) basic steps that are required to determine if impacts are
occurring to a species, how these impacts are occurring, what mitigation practices are required to reduce
and/or remove these impacts, and an analysis to determine if the mitigation practices are effective in
removing or reducing these impacts. The basis of the plan follows these four steps:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Inventory/monitor species and their associated habitats;
Monitor these species to determine changes in population numbers (cause and effect);
Identify and implement protection measures if the population shows negative changes; and
Analyze the effectiveness of the protection measures, making adjustments if required.

This section provides preliminary information pertaining to the protocols for each of the four steps. The
wildlife species/categories for which specific inventory, monitoring, protection, and analysis procedures
will be applied were developed based on management agency (Bureau of Land Management [BLM], U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS], Wyoming Game and Fish Department [WGFD]) and individual
concerns identified during the preparation of the EIS and through discussion at the Monitoring without
Borders meetings. Through annual meetings, this Plan identifies methods required to accomplish steps 1­
4 for identified species and their associated habitat types based on need, funding, and personnel
availability for each upcoming field season and year.
Considerable efforts will be required by agency and Operator personnel for Plan implementation each
year. Many of the proposed annual agency data collection activities are consistent with current agency
requirements. Additionally, during annual planning (Section 2.1.2 below) and throughout project
implementation, all efforts will be made to accommodate agency personnel schedules and responsibilities.

In addition, further agency cost-sharing methodologies will be considered such that public demands and
statutory directives are achieved.
2.1

Annual Reports and Meetings

2.1.1 Reports
Operators will provide the following information, in report format and following the requirements
identified in Table I-1, to the BLM by November 15 of each calendar year:
1. During project development, Operators will provide an updated inventory/monitoring report and
description of all existing project developments (i.e., well pad location, size, roads, and associated
level of human activity at each feature), as well as those tentatively proposed for development
during the next 12 months in a format that is Geographic Information System (GIS) compatible; and
2. Annual reports will:
a. summarize annual wildlife inventory/monitoring
b. summarize monitoring results,
c. protection measures implemented, and effectiveness of protection measures,
d. note any trends across years
e. identify and assess protection measures implemented during past years,
f. specify monitoring and protection measures proposed for the upcoming year,
g. recommend modifications to the existing wildlife monitoring/protection plan based on the
successes and/or failures of past years, and
h. identify additional species/categories to be monitored.
Where possible, the data presented in reports will be used to identify potential correlations between
development and wildlife productivity and/or abundance, as well as sources of potential disturbance to
wildlife. GIS will be used for information storage, retrieval, and planning, and annual GIS data updates
will be conducted. Raw data collected each year will also be provided to other management agencies, at
the request of the agencies. Annual reports will be prepared by the Operators’ third-party contractor with
BLM oversight.
The BLM will submit a final annual report to all potentially affected individuals and groups by early
February of each year. Additional reports may be prepared in any year, as necessary, to comply with other
relevant wildlife laws, rules, and regulations.
2.1.2 Meetings
A one-day meeting will be organized by the BLM and held in December (or as determined by the BLM)
of each year to discuss and modify, as necessary, proposed wildlife inventory, monitoring, protection
protocol, and analysis of protection measures for the subsequent year. Decisions regarding annual
Operator-specific financing and personnel requirements will be made at these meetings. A protocol for
accommodating previously unidentified development sites will also be determined during the annual
meeting. Final decisions will be made by the BLM based on the input of all affected parties. Additional
meetings may be required as necessary.
Additional meetings may be held in any given year as necessary to inform and update cooperators on the
findings of additional reports.

2.2 ANNUAL INVENTORY AND MONITORING
Inventory/monitoring is the process of gathering field data on wildlife distribution, numbers, and/or
composition. This includes traditional wildlife range determination and habitat association inventories. It
also encompasses population monitoring which is the process of detecting a demographic (e.g., growth
rate, recruitment and mortality rates) or distributional change in a population over the course of repeated
inventories and relating these changes to either natural processes (e.g., winter severity, predation) or
human-related activities (e.g., animal harvesting, mining, forestry, urban development, etc.). Population
monitoring may include the development and use of population models that integrate existing
demographic information (including harvest) on a species. Inventory/monitoring also includes the process
of compiling general (overview) information on the historical and current abundance and distribution of a
species, its habitat requirements, rate of population change, and limiting factors (species statistics).
Species statistics enable prioritization of animal inventories and population monitoring. All of these
activities are included under the term inventory/monitoring (Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks,
November 1998).
Monitoring studies are more site- and problem-specific than inventories. Longer-term monitoring studies
better estimate fluctuations in wildlife uses of habitat. Conducting longer-term monitoring of wildlife
species is more efficient and accurate for determining how certain land use practices affect wildlife and
habitats. Inventories and monitoring procedures are grouped together here because usually the monitoring
studies will result from the implementation of the CD-C project and will be based on a combination of
these inventory and monitoring results. Monitoring studies involve collecting wildlife and habitat
information over time to determine: (1) wildlife use of habitat components; (2) effects of certain land uses
(e.g. well pads, roads, human activity in the field) on certain wildlife and habitats; (3) species or habitat
changes caused by project implementation, as well as certain natural environmental conditions (e.g.,
drought); (4) accuracy of predictive models; (5) improvement in the accuracy of predictive models; (6)
additional mitigation to protect wildlife and habitat in an area (i.e., from new data, new stipulations may
be recommended or required to protect a species and its habitat); and (7) additional habitat improvement
to benefit a species or habitat of concern. These actions can determine if the management objectives in the
CD-C EIS are being met, can improve a biologist’s predictive models (Cooperrider et. al., 1986), and are
basically the fundamentals of adaptive management.
The most critical stage of implementing and completing an inventory/monitoring study is not data
collection, presentation, or interpretation, but rather design. Years of data can be useless if a study is
poorly designed. The use of this Plan, along with the BLM RFO Monitoring without Borders Program,
can allow the BLM wildlife biologists to establish a flexible, systematic, and logical approach toward
solving wildlife habitat management problems (Cooperrider et. al., 1986) within and adjacent to the CD-C
project area. The inventory and monitoring protocols will be as identified below for each wildlife
species/category. These protocols will be unchanged, except as authorized by the BLM or specified in this
Plan. Additional wildlife species/categories and associated inventories and monitoring protocols may be
added or may be omitted in future years, pending species status changes, as well as results presented in
the coordinated review of annual reports. Opportunistic wildlife observations may be made throughout the
year by agency and Operator personnel present in the project area.
The frequency of inventory and monitoring requirements will be dependent upon the level of
development in the project area. In general, frequency will increase with increased levels of development.
Monitoring results may lead to further, currently unidentified, scientific studies specifically designed to
determine cause and effect. The BLM will identify the level of effort required by this Plan subject to these
categories:

Although site- and species-specific surveys will be conducted in association with Application for Permit
to drill (APD) and right-of-way application field reviews, additional large-scale field work may be
required based on need.
2.2.1 Special Status Species and Associated Habitat: Inventory and Monitoring
Protocols
The BLM is required to conduct Section 7(a) consultation (or conferencing for proposed species) under
the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) with the USFWS if there is the potential for a proposed
project to impact any listed species (directly or indirectly) within the CD-C project area. Listed species or
proposed species discovered incidentally may require further investigation and consultation (BLM 2011).
The level of inventory and monitoring required for Special Status Species will be commensurate with
established protocols for the potentially affected species. Inventory and monitoring surveys for Special
Status Species will be conducted by the BLM or a BLM-approved Operator-financed biologist in areas of
potential habitat within the CD-C project area and all surveys will be conducted in coordination with the
BLM. Methodologies and results of these surveys will be included in annual reports as required in Table
I-1. A preliminary list of Special Status Species proposed for management and that are known to occur, or
have the potential to occur, in the vicinity of the project area is shown in Table 3.9-3, Chapter 3 of the
EIS. As Special Status Species are added to or withdrawn from the USFWS, BLM, and/or WGFD lists,
appropriate modifications reflecting these changes will be incorporated into this Plan and specified in
annual reports.
Surveys for species or associated habitats will be implemented for the APD and/or right-of-way
application processes. If any Special Status Species or habitats are observed, the observations will be
noted on appropriate data forms (Table I-2a) and efforts will be made to determine species activities
(e.g., breeding, nesting, foraging, hunting, etc.). If any management agency identifies a potential for
concern regarding any of these species, additional inventory and monitoring and mitigation may be
implemented as specified in annual reports.
Special Status Species data collected during surveys and described below will be provided only as
necessary to those requiring the data for specific management and/or project development needs. Siteand species-specific Special Status Species surveys will be conducted as necessary in association with all
APD and right-of-way application field reviews. It should be noted that the following species or their
associated habitats are not known to occur in the CD-C project area; therefore, inventories for these
species will not be required at this time: Preble’s meadow jumping mouse, yellow-billed cuckoo,
Wyoming toad, blowout penstemon plant, and the Colorado butterfly plant. The project is located outside
of the North Platte River watershed; therefore there will be no downstream impacts from activities
associated with the proposed CD-C project.
Black-footed Ferret (Endangered). The USFWS, in coordination with the WGFD, has developed a list
of habitat blocks that are not likely to be inhabited by black-footed ferrets (block cleared). In these areas,
take of individual ferrets and effects to a wild population are not an issue and surveys for ferrets are no
longer recommended. Although ferret surveys are not required in these areas, the area may still maintain
value for the survival and recovery of the species in the future. The CD-C project area is located within
three Black-footed Ferret Non-Block Cleared Areas (Complexes) which include: (1) the Continental
Divide Complex, (2) the Desolation Flats Complex, and (3) the Dad Complex. Individual projects that are
located within potential black-footed ferret habitat will require consultation with the BLM and WGFD

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

and may require ferret surveys in areas that would likely result in a “take” of a black-footed ferret during
project implementation.
BLM biologists will determine the presence/absence of prairie dog colonies at each proposed
development site during the APD and right-of-way application field reviews and determine if these
colonies meet the requirements for potential black-footed ferret habitat. In the event that a proposed
project cannot be relocated, surveys will be conducted as deemed necessary, during consultation with the
BLM, WGFD and USFWS. The prairie dog colonies in the project area will be mapped and burrow
densities determined, if required, by a BLM-approved Operator-financed biologist in association with the
proposed development plan. Colonies that meet USFWS criteria as potential black-footed ferret habitat
(USFWS 1989), in non-block cleared areas, will be surveyed for black-footed ferrets by a USFWScertified Operator-financed surveyor prior to BLM authorizing disturbance of these colonies. Blackfooted ferret surveys will be conducted in accordance with USFWS guidelines and approved by BLM and
USFWS (Table I-2a).
Greater Sage-Grouse (Candidate). Greater sage-grouse depend on extensive areas of sagebrush for food
and cover and their strutting grounds (leks) are located in open patches with sagebrush habitat. Grouse
exhibit site fidelity to leks, winter and summer areas. Greater sage-grouse breeding grounds (leks)
inventories will be conducted by the BLM and WGFD within and adjacent to the project area to
determine lek locations as deemed appropriate by the BLM. These surveys will use the WGFD protocol
(Table I-2a). Surveys may be conducted aerially, with Operator-provided financial assistance for aircraft
rental, based on funding availability, or on the ground, in order to determine lek locations and will follow
the protocols identified in Table I-2a.
Selected leks, identified by the BLM, will be monitored annually to determine lek attendance by the BLM
or a BLM-approved Operator-financed biologist, in coordination with the WGFD and using the WGFD
protocol (Table I-2a). Monitoring will occur between March 1 and May 15, such that all leks within the
CD-C project area are monitored at least once every 3 years. Population trend analysis may also be
required and will be completed with a suitable nearby reference area. The BLM will direct lek monitoring
efforts such that efforts are made to have the same individuals monitor the same leks within and across
years. Data collected during these surveys will be provided on a standardized form (Table I-2a).
Helicopter surveys for wintering areas will occur when weather conditions provide the best opportunity
for these types of surveys and will be scheduled between December 15 and February 30. These winter
surveys should be flown at about 25 – 50 meters above ground at ¼-mile intervals. These surveys are
designed to visually identify sage-grouse and/or their tracks (BLM 2011).
Ute Ladies’-Tresses Plant (Threatened). The Ute ladies’-tresses plant is located in riparian and wetland
habitats between 4,300-7,000 feet in elevation. This species is not known to occur within the project area
and the likelihood of occurrence is low; however, there is the potential of occurrence according to the
USFWS. Locations of potential Ute ladies’-tresses plants within the CD-C project area will be mapped
using the latest available aerial imagery, land use/land cover data (GAP and Landsat), and ground­
truthing. This habitat information will be digitized into a GIS format and may be used to guide surveys
for this threatened plant at the appropriate time of year (Table I-2a).
Colorado River Species (Endangered). The BLM is required to conduct Section 7(a) consultation with
the USFWS for water depletions from the Colorado River Basin. It has been determined that upstream
water depletions from this system may have a detrimental impact on four listed fish species and their
Critical Habitat downstream. Depletions represent an annual reduction in the volume of stream flow that
would have reached the Critical Habitat of the four endangered fish species residing in the Colorado River
Basin. The water depletion determination form is located in Table I-2a.

2.2.2 BLM Wyoming State Sensitive Species (Plants/Animals) and Associated Habitats,
Inventory and Monitoring Protocols
BLM Sensitive Species are species designated internally in accordance with BLM Manual 6840 (BLM
2008b). The document states: “Actions authorized by the BLM shall further the conservation/recovery of
federally listed species and conservation of Bureau sensitive species. Bureau sensitive species will be
managed consistent with species and habitat management objectives in land use plans…to promote their
conservation and to minimize the likelihood and need for listing under the ESA.”
Surveys to inventory and monitor BLM Wyoming State Sensitive Species (BLM Sensitive Species) will
be conducted by the BLM or a BLM-approved Operator-financed biologist in areas of potential habitat
within the CD-C project area. Information on the habitats and use of the project area is required and
sources of this information include the BLM, Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD), the
WGFD, and the USFWS. In addition, surveys for site-specific species or associated habitats will be
implemented at the APD and/or right-of-way application processes. If any BLM Sensitive Species or
habitats are observed, the observations will be noted on appropriate data forms (Table I-2a) and efforts
will be made to determine their activities (e.g., breeding, nesting, foraging, hunting, etc.). If any
management agency identifies a potential for concern regarding any of these species, additional
inventory, monitoring, and mitigation may be implemented as specified in annual reports.
2.2.2.1 BLM Sensitive Small Mammals and Associated Habitats
The long-eared myotis, fringed myotis, spotted bat, Townsend’s big-eared bat, pygmy rabbit, Wyoming
pocket gopher, and white-tailed prairie dog have been identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO
and have the potential to occur within the CD-C project area. The swift fox and black-tailed prairie dog
are also identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO; however, they are not expected to occur within
the CD-C project area.
Bat Species (long-eared myotis, fringed myotis, spotted bat, Townsend’s big-eared bat). Long-eared
myotis, fringed myotis, spotted bats and Townsend’s big-eared bats inhabit conifer and deciduous forests,
caves and mines, rock crevices, man-made structures and shrublands and have been observed within the
CD-C project area. These bats could be both resident and migratory within the project area and utilize the
project area for feeding; however, hibernation is unlikely because suitable habitat is limited. Inventory
and monitoring specifically for bat species within the CD-C project area has not occurred; therefore,
impacts to these species as a result of implementing the Proposed Action within the CD-C project area are
not known. Acoustic bat surveys, bat carcass surveys, radar surveys and mist netting surveys are four (4)
potential inventory and monitoring techniques that could be used to identify where bat species are present
within the project area and potential impacts to these species. There is limited information pertaining to
impacts to bat species as a result of natural gas drilling (Table I-2a).
Pygmy Rabbit. Pygmy rabbits are a sagebrush obligate and occur in basin prairie and riparian shrub and
tall sagebrush in dense patches with sandy and loose soils. These rabbits are known to occur within the
CD-C project area. The inventory and monitoring protocol for this species is identified in Table I-2a.
Wyoming Pocket Gopher. The Wyoming pocket gopher occurs in side-hills and ridge-tops, in cushionplant communities within otherwise sagebrush-grasslands habitat. The species has the potential to occur
within the CD-C project area. The inventory and monitoring protocol for this species is identified in
Table I-2a. During 2009 interagency/industry survey efforts in the RFO followed WYNDD’s protocol of
trapping for three consecutive nights or until a pocket gopher was captured. Trapping procedures need to
consider the following: allowing trapping during the day (within reason) dependent on forecasted high
temperatures, since pocket gophers are just as likely to backfill during the day as they are at night; and
limiting the number of trap nights per location, as some gophers can be extremely difficult to capture or
their burrows may become inactive over a period of time (i.e., dispersal) rendering trapping unproductive.

White-Tailed Prairie Dog. The white-tailed prairie dog inhabits sagebrush-grasslands and is located
within the project area.
2.2.2.2 BLM Sensitive Upland Game Birds, Migratory Raptors, Songbirds, Shorebirds,
Waterfowl and Habitats
The loggerhead shrike, sage thrasher, Brewer’s sparrow, sage sparrow, white-faced ibis, trumpeter swan,
long-billed curlew, bald eagle, ferruginous hawk, mountain plover, and burrowing owl species have been
identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO and have the potential to occur within the CD-C project
area. These species have the potential to occur in the following habitats:










Loggerhead shrike, sage thrasher, Brewer’s sparrow, and sage sparrow occur within basin/prairie
shrub and mountain foothills shrub habitats, sagebrush and are sagebrush obligate species.
White-faced ibis inhabits marshes and wet meadows.
Trumpeter swan inhabits lakes, ponds, and rivers.
Long-billed curlew inhabits grasslands, plains, foothills and wet meadows.
Bald eagle inhabits large rivers, streams and lakes, but have been observed in the project area
primarily from November through March, forages on winter carrion and the nearest potential
nesting habitat is along the Little Snake River nine miles south of the project area.
Ferruginous hawk inhabits sagebrush-grasslands and has been found in the project area.
Mountain plover inhabits grasslands and has been found within the project area.
Burrowing owl has been observed in sagebrush-grasslands in the project area and has a close
association with burrowing mammals such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and badgers.

The following species are also identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO; however, they are not
expected to occur within the CD-C project area: Baird’s sparrow, Columbian sharp-tailed grouse,
northern goshawk, and peregrine falcon.
The BLM has responsibilities under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) to analyze and protect all
migratory birds. Most of North America’s birds are migratory and migrate during the night, usually at
higher altitudes when weather conditions are favorable. Songbirds are vulnerable to colliding with manmade structures such as buildings, communication towers, power-poles or even wind turbines during poor
weather conditions that force them to lower altitudes (BLM 2011).
Bird surveys are required to estimate the temporal and spatial use of the CD-C project area and vicinity by
birds. Fixed-point count surveys can be used as a tool to inventory for songbird, raptor and other groups
of birds. Radar surveys using marine radar surveillance can also be used to determine avian species flight
patterns in the project area (i.e. foraging movements and migration). Multiple sampling locations should
be identified within the selected study areas and surveyed in consultation with the BLM and WGFD
(Table I-2a).
Songbirds (loggerhead shrike, sage thrasher, Brewer’s sparrow, sage sparrow). Bird surveys are
required to estimate the temporal and spatial use of the CD-C project area and vicinity by these four BLM
Sensitive bird species. Fixed-point count surveys can be used as a tool to inventory for these birds. Radar
surveys using marine radar surveillance can also be used to determine their flight patterns in the project
area (i.e. foraging movements and migration). Multiple sampling locations should be identified within the
selected study areas and surveyed in consultation with the BLM and WGFD (Table I-2a).
Shorebirds (white-faced ibis, long-billed curlew). Ground surveys can be used during the breeding
season, mitigation season (migratory) and the non-breeding season (winter) to determine species numbers.
Aerial surveys and four-wheelers can be used for inaccessible areas (Table I-2a).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

Waterfowl (trumpeter swan). In the event that surveys are required, aerial surveys in the fall and mid­
winter will be conducted. Ground surveys can be used for areas that are inaccessible. Ground surveys are
used to verify species composition of some swan flocks. The primary purpose of these surveys is to
document the size of the U.S. trumpeter swan flocks and to enumerate the annual production of cygnets to
fledgling age. The survey also provides some information on territorial occupancy and the distribution of
failed breeders and non-breeders from year to year (USFWS 2011).
Bald Eagle. When bald eagles are located within a proposed project area, then surveys are required that
include nest and production surveys, winter use surveys, and eagle flight patterns and use of the project
area throughout all phases of the project. In addition, analysis or mitigation measures necessary to comply
with the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act are required by the BLM in coordination with the USFWS
(BLM 2011). The CD-C project area does not have any known nesting habitat for bald eagles; however,
bald eagles may fly over the area and feed in the area during certain times of the year, especially winter.
Marine surveillance radar may be required to determine eagle flight patterns in the CD-C project area (i.e.
foraging movements and migration). Multiple sampling locations should be identified within the area and
surveyed in consultation with the BLM. In addition, telemetry studies (radio or satellite) may be required
to determine eagle flight patterns in the CD-C project area (BLM 2011)
Ferruginous Hawk. Ferruginous hawks are found in mixed-grass prairie and sagebrush steppe habitats
during the spring, summer, and fall and generally build nests on rock outcrops, the ground, and cliff
ledges.
Ferruginous hawk surveys are required to: (1) identify nest densities occurring within the CD-C project
area and (2) record nest locations to identify areas with a potential increased risk of disturbance or
collisions for adults or young associated with nest sites (BLM 2011). Ferruginous hawk inventories will
be conducted by the BLM at least every five years (as identified in annual reports), to determine the
location of new nests, based on funding availability. These surveys may be implemented aerially, via
helicopter, or from the ground. Operators may provide financial assistance for aircraft rental, based on
funding availability.
Breeding and nesting monitoring will be conducted annually between April and July at known nest
locations by the BLM or a BLM-approved Operator-financed biologist, in order to ascertain nest activity
status. Monitoring generally will be conducted from the ground, and attempts will be made to determine
the cause of any documented nest failure. Operators may provide financial assistance for aircraft rental, as
necessary. Site- and species-specific ferruginous hawk nest inventories will be conducted as necessary in
association with all APD and right-of-way application field reviews.
All nest/productivity surveys will be conducted using procedures that minimize potential adverse effects
to nesting ferruginous hawks. Specific survey measures for reducing detrimental effects are listed in Grier
and Fyfe (1987) and Call (1978) and include the following:
a. Nest visits will be delayed for as long as possible in the nesting season;
b. Nests will be approached cautiously, and their status (e.g., nestlings/fledglings) will be determined
from a distance with binoculars/scope;
c. Nests will be approached tangentially and in an obvious manner to avoid startling adults;
d. Nests will not be visited during adverse weather conditions (e.g., precipitation events, windy
periods, and the hottest part of the day);
e. Visits will be kept as brief as possible;
f. All inventories will be coordinated by the BLM;
g. The number of nest visits in any year will be kept to a minimum; and
h. All raptor nest location data will be considered confidential.

Mountain Plover. Mountain plover breeding habitat includes short-grass prairie and shrub-steppe
landscapes, dry land, cultivated farms, and are frequently associated with prairie dog towns. Plovers
usually nest on sites where vegetation is sparse or absent; conditions that can be created by herbivores,
including domestic livestock and prairie dogs. Vegetation in shortgrass prairie sites is typically less than 4
inches tall. Nest sites within the shrub-steppe landscape are also confined to areas with little to no
vegetation, although surrounded by areas visually dominated by shrubs. Commonly, nest sites within
shrub-steppe areas are on active prairie dog towns. Nests are commonly located near a manure pile or
rock. In addition to areas disturbed by prairie dogs or livestock, nests have also been found on bare
ground created by oil and gas development activities and on dryland, cultivated agriculture in the southern
part of their breeding range. Mountain plovers are rarely found near water. Positive indicators for
mountain plovers therefore include level terrain, prairie dogs, bare ground, cactus pads, cattle, widely
spaced plants, and horned larks. It would be unusual to find mountain plovers on sites characterized by
irregular or rolling terrain, dense, matted vegetation, grass taller than 4 inches, wet soils, or the presence
of killdeer.
Mountain plover habitat within the CD-C EIS has been mapped within the project area; however, standard
site-specific habitat surveys will be conducted as necessary in association with all APD and right-of-way
application field reviews. Surveys, if required, will be conducted by the BLM or a BLM-approved
Operator-financed biologist to detect the presence of plovers. Surveys will generally be conducted during
the period of April 24 through May 10 to determine presence/absence of mountain plovers and June 25
through July 10 to determine density of nesting mountain plovers (Table I-2a). These dates may change
after consultation with the USFWS and WGFD.
Burrowing Owl. Burrowing owls are commonly found in prairie dog towns, are migratory, breed
throughout the plains and prairies of the western United States and winter in the southern United States
and throughout Mexico. Federal and state laws prohibit the harming and killing of burrowing owls and
the destruction of active nests.
Prairie dog colonies and other suitable burrowing owl nesting areas on and within 0.75 miles of existing
and proposed disturbance areas will be searched for western burrowing owls by the BLM from April 15
through September 15 to determine the presence or absence of nesting owls within the CD-C project area
(BLM 2011). If burrowing owls are found, attempts will be made to determine reproductive success. In
addition, standard site-specific surveys will be conducted in association with all APD and right-of-way
application field reviews.
2.2.2.3 BLM Sensitive Amphibians, Reptiles, and Fish Species and Associated Habitats
The northern leopard frog, Great Basin spadefoot toad, Colorado River cutthroat trout, roundtail chub,
flannelmouth sucker, and bluehead sucker have been identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO and
have the potential to occur within the CD-C project area. The Western boreal toad and hornyhead chub
are also identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO; however, they are not expected to occur within
the CD-C project area.
There are no sensitive reptile species identified in the CD-C project area at this time. If species are
identified in the future, then presence/absence surveys and hibernacula/maternity den site searches will be
required in sensitive reptile habitat (BLM 2011) at the CD-C project area and site-specific APD and/or
right-of-way level.
Northern Leopard Frog and Great Basin Spadefoot Toad. Habitat mapping, Acoustic Breeding
Surveys, and Visual Encounter Surveys (Table I-2a) can be used to determine if the northern leopard frog
and Great Basin Spadefoot species are present within the CD-C project area and at the APD and/or rightof-way application process.

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

Colorado River Cutthroat Trout, Roundtail Chub, Flannelmouth Sucker, and Bluehead Sucker. At
this time, the fish species inventory in the CD-C project area has been completed. BLM sensitive fish
species population monitoring will continue to be conducted by the WGFD and the BLM. Monitoring for
the associated habitats for sensitive fish species will be required and may include channel morphology,
water quality, and in-stream habitat.
2.2.2.4 BLM Sensitive Plant Species and Associated Habitats
The meadow milkvetch, Cedar Rim thistle, Gibbens’ beardtongue, and persistent sepal yellowcress plants
have been identified as BLM Sensitive Species in the RFO and have the potential to occur within the CD­
C project area. The many-stemmed spider flower, Laramie columbine, dune wild rye, Laramie false
sagebrush, and limber pine are also identified as BLM Sensitive Plant Species in the RFO; however, they
are not expected to occur within the CD-C project area.
Locations for BLM Sensitive Plant Species within the CD-C project area will be mapped using the best
available data from WYNDD modeling and ground-truthing. This habitat information will be digitized
into a GIS format and may be used to guide these plant surveys at the appropriate time of the year (BLM
2011).
Meadow Milkvetch, Cedar Rim Thistle, Gibbens’ Beardtongue, and Persistent Sepal Yellowcress
Plants. Sensitive plant surveys will be required within the CD-C project area. In addition, surveys for
site-specific species or associated habitats will be implemented at the APD and/or right-of-way
application processes to determine the potential to affect these plant species (Table I-2a).
2.2.3 Big Game and Associated Habitats
Data on big game use of crucial winter ranges and migration corridors within and adjacent to the project
area will be requested by the BLM from the WGFD, as deemed necessary by the BLM. Surveys are
required to fully understand the big game use in the project area and the associated impacts that may
occur (BLM 2011). This information will be used to assess the effectiveness of protection measures
implemented for the project. In the event that BLM, in consultation with the WGFD and other interested
parties, determines that additional data should be collected for big game, these issues will be discussed at
the annual meeting.
Big Game Crucial Winter Range. A radio or satellite telemetry study will be developed in cooperation
between the BLM and WGFD to monitor the use of big game crucial winter range within the CD-C
project area. In addition, Pellet Count Surveys can be used to evaluate the seasonal spatial distribution of
big game species based on the presence of pellet groups.
Shrub age can be an important aspect, within mule deer habitat, often indicating that older-aged plants are
more typical with most inventory and monitoring studies. Older plants typically produce leaders with
greater lignin, greater secondary compounds which limit digestibility and less vigor. Current research in
various locations (e.g., Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Utah) have identified nutrition as an aspect currently
limiting mule deer’s ability to increase in numbers. This occurs in both winter ranges as well as
transitional ranges for mule deer (BLM JIO-PAPO, 2012).
Big Game Migration Corridors. A radio or satellite telemetry study will be developed in cooperation
between the BLM and WGFD to determine movement of big game and potential migration corridors
within the CD-C project area.
2.2.4 Raptors and Associated Habitats
Raptor surveys are required to: (1) identify the species and nest densities occurring within the CD-C
project area and (2) record raptor nest locations to identify areas with a potential increased risk of
disturbance or collisions for adults or young associated with nest sites (BLM 2011). Raptor inventories

I-10

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

will be conducted by the BLM at least every five years (as identified in annual reports), to determine the
location of new raptor nests, based on funding availability. These surveys may be implemented aerially,
via helicopter, or from the ground. Operators may provide financial assistance for aircraft rental, based on
funding availability.
Breeding and nesting monitoring will be conducted by the BLM or a BLM-approved Operator-financed
biologist, annually, at known nest locations, between February and August, in order to ascertain nest
activity status. Monitoring generally will be conducted from the ground, and attempts will be made to
determine the cause of any documented nest failure. Operators may provide financial assistance for
aircraft rental, as necessary. Site- and species-specific raptor nest inventories will be conducted as
necessary in association with all APD and right-of-way application field reviews.
All raptor nest/productivity surveys will be conducted using procedures that minimize potential adverse
effects to nesting raptors. Specific survey measures for reducing detrimental effects are listed in Grier and
Fyfe (1987) and Call (1978) and are located in Section 2.2.2.2, Inventory/Monitoring Protocol for
Ferruginous Hawks.
Winter use raptor surveys are required to (1) identify the species and winter densities occurring within the
CD-C project area and (2) record raptor hunting use areas with a potential increased risk of disturbance or
collisions for raptors to predict potential impacts. Suitable raptor perch sites such as cliffs, rock outcrops,
man-made structures, tree tops, and areas of relatively high prey densities should be searched for hunting
raptors. Helicopters can be used for these surveys; however, care should be taken to minimize disturbance
to raptors during surveys (BLM 2011).
2.2.5 Songbirds, Waterfowl, and Shorebirds and Associated Habitats
The BLM has responsibilities under the MBTA to analyze and protect all migratory birds. Bird surveys
are required to estimate the temporal and spatial use of the CD-C project area and vicinity by birds (see
Section 2.2.2.2). Marine surveillance radar surveys and ground surveys such as point counts, line transect
surveys, and spot mapping could be used to determine presence of these species.
Point count surveys can be used as a tool to determine songbird and other groups of birds. Radar surveys
using marine radar surveillance can also be used to determine avian species flight patterns in the project
area (i.e. foraging movements and migration). Multiple sampling locations should be identified within the
selected study areas and surveyed in consultation with the BLM and WGFD (Table I-2a).
2.2.6 Amphibians, Reptiles, and Fish and Associated Habitats
Amphibian surveys would be required since there are riparian habitats or playas within the CD-C project
area. In addition, surveys for site-specific species or associated habitats will be implemented at the APD
and/or right-of-way application processes to determine the potential to affect amphibians, reptile and fish
species.
Amphibian Species and Associated Habitats. Habitat mapping, Acoustic Breeding Surveys, and Visual
Encounter Surveys (Table I-2a) can be used to determine amphibian species presence within the CD-C
project area and at the APD and/or right-of-way application process.
Reptile Species and Associated Habitats. Presence/absence surveys and hibernacula/maternity den site
searches will be required in potential reptile habitat (BLM 2011) at the CD-C project area and sitespecific APD and/or right-of-way level.
Fish Species and Associated Habitats. The use of hydroacoustics, gill netting, seining, and
electrofishing by boat, canoe, or backpack can be used to measure fish abundance and distribution
(AZGFD 2009, Taylor and Maxwell 2007).

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

2.2.7 General Wildlife Species
BLM staff will be responsible for maintaining records of selected wildlife species observed during the
course of their activities on the project area. Operator personnel may also provide data on wildlife
observations. The information provided will include observations of wildlife species, their numbers,
location, activity, and other pertinent data as applicable and identified on the General Wildlife
Observation Data Sheet (Table I-2a). Where Operators are uncertain of the United States Geological
Survey (USGS) coordinates for an observation, a general description of the location may be provided and
in instances where species or sex information is questionable, Operators will identify the observation as
such.
Additional inventory and monitoring measures may be applied for other species as specified in annual
reports (Table I-1). Surveys will be conducted in adherence with protocol to be established by the BLM,
other agencies and Operators, and Operators may provide financial assistance for these inventory and
monitoring investigations (Table I-2a).

2.3 DETERMINE AND IMPLEMENT PROTECTION MEASURES, EFFECTS
ANALYSIS, AND APPLY ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT
Long-term studies and monitoring programs identified above, along with implementing protection
measures, should be established to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various mitigation
techniques. Efforts should be made to continually integrate monitoring data into adaptive management
strategies, including making individual and compiled results available to industry and agencies to improve
energy-development and mitigation techniques. Opportunities to enable agencies, conservation
organizations, and energy companies to collaboratively interact and contribute data should be identified
(WGFD 2010). Evaluations of the biological response of focal species are integral to assessing success in
delivering conservation programs (Naugle 2011).
During project development, the BLM is responsible to manage or restore habitat to conserve, recover,
and maintain species populations consistent with the CD-C EIS and Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) plans.
The Rawlins RMP states that a full range of mitigation options will be considered when developing
mitigation for project-level activities, including those located within the CD-C project area. The wildlife
protection measures proposed herein have been developed from past measures identified for oil and gas
developments in Wyoming and are basically tools to implement while exercising adaptive management.
Additional measures may be included and/or existing measures may be modified in any given year as
allowable and as deemed appropriate by BLM in consultation with other agencies, Operators, and
interested parties. These measures will be specified in annual reports (Table I-1). Protection measures
will be implemented by Operators with assistance from and/or in consultation with the BLM. In addition,
these measures may be modified on a site-specific basis as deemed appropriate by the BLM after
completion of the APD and right-of-way application field reviews.
The principal protection measure for most wildlife will be species- and project-specific measures as well
as general wildlife and associated habitat protection measures. The implementation of these measures
may also benefit other wildlife species found on and adjacent to the project area. Sensitive and crucial
habitats should be avoided where possible. Protection measures (e.g., BMPs identified in the Rawlins
RMP and CD-C EIS, Appendix C) will be applied based on the analysis of information gathered through
inventory and monitoring. These BMPs are included in the Rawlins RMP and CD-C EIS and include, but
are not limited to, measures such as timing restrictions to protect species and habitat from disruptive
activities during critical periods, modifications of BLM fences to allow big game species greater freedom
of movement to avoid disruptive activities, and vegetation treatments, such as herbicide treatments,
seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping for regeneration, planting shrubs or trees, or fertilization.
The process of adaptive management will be used to determine the effectiveness of BMPs and necessary
changes in conservation management will be made if identified. This process allows ineffective

management actions to be modified, or new actions implemented, to reduce impacts to wildlife from
development.
The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Energy by Design – Cooperative Mitigation Planning for the CD-C
Gas Field (Appendix G) is a science-based approach designed to reduce conflicts and steer development
away from conservation priorities, increase the cost-effectiveness of mitigation, and direct funding to
higher-value conservation. The project blends landscape-level conservation with the mitigation hierarchy
including: (1) avoid; (2) minimize/restore; and (3) offset to improve mitigation efforts. This is
accomplished in a four step process which includes the following;
a. Develop a landscape conservation plan (or use an existing landscape plan);
b. Blend landscape conservation planning with mitigation hierarchy to evaluate conservation and
development conflicts;
c. Determine the residual impacts associated with development and select an optimal offset portfolio;
and then
d. Estimate the offset contribution to conservation goals.
TNC’s final report for the CD-C project area was completed on August 1, 2009. Protection measures and
adaptive management for the CD-C project area could be identified from this plan.
The Wyoming Landscape Conservation Initiative (WLCI) was created in 2007 as a multi-agency and
stakeholders’ initiative designed to maintain and enhance wildlife habitat and other resource values within
energy development and other changes. Partners are conducting science-based research and monitoring,
completing habitat enhancements and restoration, encouraging effective reclamation and mitigation
practices, identifying and prioritizing landscape-scale conservation work, and promoting grazing practices
which benefit wildlife, ranchers, and open-space conservation. Initial funding for this program has come
through federal appropriations and projects to date have included fence modifications and exclosure
fencing, prescribed burns, riparian enhancements, invasive species treatments, river restoration, and
conservation easements (WGFD 2010). Protection measures and adaptive management for the CD-C
project area could be identified from this plan.
2.3.1 Special Status Species and Associated Habitats: Protection Measures (Adaptive
Management)
The level of protection required for Special Status Species is obligatory under the ESA. If crucial features
for any Special Status Species are found during on-site surveys of the proposed project, avoidance of
these features will be required first. In the event this is not feasible, the BLM will conference and/or
consult and coordinate with the USFWS to determine and implement the most effective protection
measures required to protect Special Status Species and their habitats. Habitat and species conservation
measures for Special Status Species are identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) biological
assessment and the biological opinion. Both documents will be adhered to for compliance with the ESA
and conservation measures will be applied to all surface-disturbing and disruptive activities, as
appropriate. In the event that a Special Status Species is observed, especially during construction
activities, work at the project site will be curtailed until there is concurrence between BLM and the
USFWS on what activities can be authorized. Activities will, in most cases, be delayed until such time
that no adverse effects will occur.
The Rawlins RMP requires the BLM maintain, restore, or enhance Special Status Species, as well as
Sensitive Species habitat to prevent listing under the ESA, in coordination with other local, state and
federal agencies. It is assumed that the protocol specified for general wildlife will likely benefit Special
Status Species as well. If any management agency identifies a potential for impacts to any Special Status
Species, additional measures may be implemented as specified in annual reports.

Black-footed Ferret. Habitat and species conservation measures for the black-footed ferret are identified
in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) biological assessment and the biological opinion. Both documents will
be adhered to for compliance with the ESA and conservation measures will be applied to all surfacedisturbing and disruptive activities, as appropriate. These protection measures are identified to reduce
impacts to the black-footed ferret within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54). If blackfooted ferrets are found on the project area, the USFWS will be notified immediately and formal
consultations will be initiated to develop strategies that ensure no adverse effects to the species. Before
ground-disturbing activities are initiated in black-footed ferret habitat, authorizations to proceed must be
received from the BLM, in consultation with the USFWS.
Greater Sage-Grouse. Habitat and species protection management actions for greater sage-grouse are
identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts
to the greater sage-grouse within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, pages 2-54 to 2-55). Projects
located within the Wyoming Governor’s Core Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (Executive Order 2011-5) will
have additional protection measures attached to reduce and/or remove potential impacts to greater sagegrouse (IM WY-2012-019). To control the population of mosquitoes that might spread West Nile virus,
larvicidal briquettes will be placed in standing water pools as appropriate. Adult mosquitoes could also be
treated with insecticides if necessary (BLM 2008c).
Ute Ladies’-Tresses Plant. Habitat and species conservation measures for the Ute ladies’-tresses plant
are identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) biological assessment and the biological opinion. Both
documents will be adhered to for compliance with the ESA and conservation measures will be applied to
all surface-disturbing and disruptive activities, as appropriate. These protection measures are identified to
reduce impacts to the Ute ladies’- tresses plant within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54).
Colorado River Fish Species. Habitat and species conservation measures for Colorado River fish species
are identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) biological assessment and the biological opinion. Both
documents will be adhered to for compliance with the ESA and conservation measures will be applied to
all surface-disturbing and disruptive activities, as appropriate. These protection measures are identified in
the Rawlins RMP, page 2-54.
2.3.2 BLM Wyoming State Sensitive Species (Plants/Animals) and Associated Habitats:
Protection Measures (Adaptive Management)
Surface-disturbing and disruptive activities that would potentially affect the habitat of Special Status
Species will be intensively managed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, surface-disturbing and
disruptive activities will be intensively managed to minimize impacts on identified crucial habitat for
sensitive species for the purpose of protecting these species and their associated habitats. Coordination
with the WGFD will allow the Recommendations for Development of Oil and Gas Resources Within
Important Wildlife Habitats management actions to be implemented to reduce impacts to BLM sensitive
species (Table I-2b).
2.3.2.1 BLM Sensitive Small Mammals and Associated Habitats
Bat Species (long-eared myotis, fringed myotis, spotted bat, Townsend’s big-eared bat). Habitat and
species protection measures for BLM sensitive bat species are identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM
2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to bat species within the CD-C project
area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54). In addition, all open vent stack equipment shall be designed and
constructed to prevent bat use and potential mortalities.
Pygmy Rabbit. Habitat and species protection measures for the pygmy rabbit are identified in the
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to the pygmy
rabbits within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54). The BLM has identified additional
protection measures to reduce impacts to this species.

Wyoming Pocket Gopher. Habitat and species protection measures for the Wyoming pocket gopher are
identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts
to the Wyoming pocket gopher within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54). To protect the
identified Wyoming pocket gopher and associated habitat, the BLM has identified additional protection
measures to reduce impacts to this species. The survey protocol is available from the BLM Rawlins Field
Office upon request.
White-tailed Prairie Dog. Habitat and species protection measures for the white-tailed prairie dog are
identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts
to the white-tailed prairie dog within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54 to 2-55).
2.3.2.2 BLM Sensitive Upland Game Birds, Migratory Raptors, Songbirds, Shorebirds,
Waterfowl and Habitats
Habitat and species protection measures for the BLM Sensitive raptors, songbirds, shorebirds and
waterfowl are identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to
reduce impacts to upland game birds, migratory raptors, songbirds, shorebirds, and waterfowl within the
CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-52 to 2-55). These are required to comply with both the
Rawlins RMP and the MBTA.
Songbirds (loggerhead shrike, sage thrasher, Brewer’s sparrow, sage sparrow). All open vent stack
equipment shall be designed and constructed to prevent avian mortalities due to bird use and perching. In
addition, nesting habitats could be treated with nitrogen fertilizers (BLM 2008c).
Shorebirds (white-faced ibis, long-billed curlew). Protection measures that could reduce impacts to
nesting shorebirds would be implemented on surface-disturbing and disruptive activities located near
water habitats such as mudflats, salt ponds, marshes, rocky shores and agricultural fields (USFWS 2011).
Waterfowl (trumpeter swan). Protection measures that could reduce impacts to waterfowl would be
implemented on surface-disturbing and disruptive activities located near water habitats such as wetland,
and marshes (Wetlands Regional Monitoring Program Plan 2002). In addition, not permitting the use of
open pits (Naugle 2011) in the natural gas field would reduce impacts to waterfowl species.
Bald Eagle and Ferruginous Hawk. Habitat and species protection measures for the bald eagle and
ferruginous hawk are identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a), pages 2-53 to 2-55. These protection
measures are identified to reduce impacts to the bald eagle and ferruginous hawk within the CD-C project
area. Protection protocol will be as described for raptors (See Section 2.3.1). Additional measures will be
applied on a species- or site-specific basis, as deemed appropriate by the BLM and/or USFWS, and
specified in annual reports.
Mountain Plover. Habitat and species protection measures for the mountain plover are identified in the
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to the mountain
plover within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-52 to 2-55). Mountain plover habitat will be
avoided where practical due to the presence of alternative well and road development sites. Where these
habitats will be disturbed, reclamation will utilize procedures designed to reestablish suitable plover
habitat. The primary protection measure for mountain plover on the project area will be avoidance plover
habitat during the breeding season.
Burrowing Owl. Habitat and species protection measures for the burrowing owl are identified in the
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to the burrowing
owl within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-53 to 2-55).
2.3.2.3 BLM Sensitive Amphibians, Reptiles, and Fish Species and Associated Habitats
Habitat and species protection measures for the BLM sensitive amphibian, reptile and fish species are
identified in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a), page 2-54. In addition, a portion of the Upper Muddy

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

I-15

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

Creek/Grizzly Wildlife Habitat Management Area occurs within the CD–C project area (Rawlins RMP,
page 2-41) which affords additional protection measures for Colorado River fish species unique to the
Muddy Creek watershed.
2.3.2.4 BLM Sensitive Plant Species and Associated Habitats
Habitat and species protection measures for the BLM sensitive plant species are identified in the Rawlins
RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to sensitive plant species
within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54 to 2-55).
Operators will finance site-specific surveys for BLM Sensitive Plant Species prior to any surface
disturbance in areas determined by the BLM to contain potential habitat for such species (BLM 2008b).
These surveys will be completed by a qualified botanist as authorized by the BLM and this botanist will
be subject to the BLM’s 6840 policy requirements. Data from these surveys will be provided to the BLM,
and if any sensitive plants or habitats are found, BLM recommendations for avoidance of the proposed
project location will be implemented (BLM 2008c).
Meadow Milkvetch, Cedar Rim Thistle, Gibbens’ Beardtongue and Persistent Sepal Yellowcress
Plants. In extreme cases when the proposed project cannot be relocated, then seed-banking of these plants
from the disturbance location would be recommended to attempt off-site propagation, since most of the
common techniques such as off-site compensation or habitat restoration have proven largely unsuccessful
(BLM 1997).
2.3.3 Big Game Species and Associated Habitats: Protection Measures (Adaptive
Management)
Big Game Crucial Winter Range. The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) requires the BLM to maintain,
restore, or enhance habitat function in crucial winter range, including those areas located within the CD-C
project area. Habitat and species protection measures for the big game species and their habitats are
identified in the Rawlins RMP. These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to big game
species within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-53 to 2-54). In addition, a portion of the
Upper Muddy Creek/Grizzly Wildlife Habitat Management Area occurs within the CD–C project area
(Rawlins RMP, page 2-41) which affords additional protection measures for elk and mule deer crucial
winter range. Coordination with the WGFD will allow the Recommendations for Development of Oil and
Gas Resources Within Important Wildlife Habitats management actions to be implemented to reduce
impacts to big game species (Table I-2b).
Snow fences, if used, will be limited to segments of ¼ mile or less. Project personnel will also be advised
to minimize stopping and exiting their vehicles in big game winter habitat during crucial winter periods.
In addition, escape openings will be provided along roads in big game crucial winter ranges, as designated
by the BLM, to facilitate exit of big game animals from snowplowed roads. The use of gates on roads
within development areas would also preclude or limit motorized public access in sensitive wildlife areas.
Additional habitat protection and/or improvement measures may also be applied in any given year as
directed by the BLM, in consultation with Operators and other agencies, and specified in annual reports.
There are several projects that can be implemented to improve habitat and use for big game species which
include, but are not limited to: (1) fertilization projects which help offset direct and indirect habitat losses
by increasing sagebrush production, enhancing available winter forage and potentially increasing
palatability and nutrient quality for wintering big game (specifically mule deer) (BLM 2012, BLM
2008c); (2) closing roads from January 1-April 30 each year to protect big game from disruptive human
activity which, during difficult winter months, can increase the mortality rate for these animals and
patrolling the areas is required to allow the BLM to educate the public, distribute maps, answer questions,
deter violators, encourage the public to report violations, and issue citations when needed; (3) implement
chemical thinning treatments (tebuthioron, or Spike™) to increase forage variety, quantity and quality

I-16

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

and improve the big sagebrush and mountain shrub age-class structure; (4) establish conservation
easements; (5) implement fence modification projects; (6) implement prescribed fire treatments for big
game species (e.g., spring and fall ranges should focus on herbaceous component to help does with
fawning and winter ranges should focus more on shrubs and shrub productivity); (7) seeding after fires;
(8) mechanical treatments such as crushing with an aerator and including seeding in the treatment; (9)
chaining, disking and imprinting pipe harrowing and aerating; (10) mowing; (11) other vegetation
treatments such as planting of shrubs and aspen; and (12) control of invasive weeds (BLM 2012).
Big Game Migration Corridors. Big game migration corridor habitat protection measures are identified
in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to big
game species within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54). Surface-disturbing and disruptive
activities will be managed, on a case-by-case basis, in identified big game migration and transitional
ranges to maintain their integrity and function for big game species in these areas. Although fences are
not a direct result of natural gas development, fences that are identified to be a problem to big game
migration, as a result of development, will be modified to meet BLM fence standards. New fences are
allowed in big game migration corridors, provided they meet BLM fence standards.
2.3.4 Raptors and Associated Habitats Protection Measures (Adaptive Management)
The primary protection measure for raptor species on the project area will be avoidance of nest locations
during the breeding season. Habitat and species protection measures for raptor species are identified in the
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to raptor species
within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-53). Coordination with the WGFD will allow the
Recommendations for Development of Oil and Gas Resources Within Important Wildlife Habitats
management actions to be implemented to reduce impacts to raptor species (Table I-2b)
The goshawk, osprey, and screech owl raptor species are located within the RFO area; however, they
require different habitat types than those located within the CD-C project area and are highly unlikely to
nest within the project area. In the rare event that one of these species is found, their breeding and nesting
habitat will be protected by the protection measures found in the Rawlins RMP.
2.3.5 Songbirds, Waterfowl, and Shorebirds and Associated Habitats Protection
Measures (Adaptive Management)
Habitat and species protection measures for songbirds, waterfowl, and shorebirds species are identified in
the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to songbirds,
waterfowl, and shorebirds within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-52 to 2-54). All open vent
stack equipment shall be designed and constructed to prevent use birds and to discourage perching.
Surface-disturbing and disruptive activities will be intensively managed. BMPs will be applied to surfacedisturbing and disruptive activities to maintain or enhance habitat for these species ((BLM 2008a).
Coordination with the WGFD will allow the Recommendations for Development of Oil and Gas
Resources Within Important Wildlife Habitats management actions to be implemented to reduce impacts
to songbirds, waterfowl, and shorebird species (Table I-2b)
2.3.6 Amphibians, Reptiles, and Fish and Associated Habitats Protection Measures
(Adaptive Management)
Habitat and species protection measures for amphibian, reptile and fish species are identified in the
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). These protection measures are identified to reduce impacts to the
amphibians, reptiles, and fish within the CD-C project area (Rawlins RMP, page 2-54). Coordination with
the WGFD will allow the Recommendations for Development of Oil and Gas Resources Within Important
Wildlife Habitats management actions to be implemented to reduce impacts to amphibian, reptile, and fish
species (Table I-2b)

APPENDIX I—WILDLIFE MITIGATION, MONITORING, AND PROTECTION PLAN

2.3.7 General Wildlife Species Protection Measures (Adaptive Management)
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) requires the BLM manage projects through facility placement and
minimization of construction disturbance to maintain connectivity between large contiguous blocks of
undisturbed habitat. Reclamation activities associated with proposed projects within the CD-C project
area must include wildlife habitat objectives in the plans.
Unless otherwise indicated, the following protection measures will be applied for all wildlife species.
Additional measures primarily designed to minimize impacts to other resources (e.g., vegetation and
surface water resources, including wetlands, steep slopes, etc.) are identified in the EIS in Chapter 4, and
these measures may provide additional protection for wildlife. Additional actions may be applied in any
given year to further minimize potential impacts to wildlife. These actions will be specified in annual
reports.
All roads on and adjacent to the project area that are required for the proposed project will be
appropriately constructed, improved, maintained, and signed to minimize potential wildlife and vehicle
collisions and facilitate wildlife (most notably big game) movement through the project area. Appropriate
speed limits will be adhered to on all project roads, and Operators will advise employees and contractors
regarding these speed limits. Some existing roads on the project area and surrounding transportation
planning area may be reclaimed if they become redundant, and/or closed (gated and locked, year-round or
seasonally) to deny unnecessary access.
To protect important habitat in portions of the project area (i.e., ephemeral draws dominated by basin big
sagebrush), areas with sagebrush greater than three feet tall will be avoided where possible.
Additional non-species-specific wildlife mitigations that may reduce and/or eliminate potential impacts to
species and associated habitats include the following:
a. Reserve, work-over, and flare pits and other locations potentially hazardous to wildlife will be
adequately protected by netting and/or fencing as directed by the BLM to prohibit wildlife access.
b. If dead or injured raptors, big game, migratory birds, or unusual wildlife are observed on the project
area, Operator personnel will contact the appropriate BLM and WGFD offices. Under no
circumstances will dead or injured wildlife be approached or handled by Operator personnel.
c. Employee and contractor education will be conducted regarding wildlife laws. If violations are
discovered on the project area, Operators will immediately notify the appropriate agency. If the
violation is committed by an employee or contractor, said employee or contractor will be disciplined
and may be dismissed by the Operator and/or prosecuted by the WGFD and/or USFWS.
d. Operators will implement policies designed to control off-site activities of operation personnel and
littering, and will notify all employees (contract and company) that conviction of a violation can
result in disciplinary action, including dismissal.
e. Use of smaller rigs, directional drilling, oak mats, and purpose-built rigs.
f. When studies become available that indicate the need for changes, modifications of timing or other
stipulations would be implemented or deleted based on the findings.
Additional project- and site-specific mitigation measures may be added in future years, as specified in
annual reports.

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has developed a cultural resources program designed to
inventory, evaluate, and manage cultural resources on BLM-administered public land and in areas of
BLM responsibility. The BLM management of cultural resources (archaeological, historic, and sociocultural properties) is in accordance with the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966, as amended, and other applicable legislation.

IDENTIFICATION OF CULTURAL RESOURCES
The BLM requires cultural resource inventories for actions with federal responsibility that include surface
disturbance as a part of the action. The purpose of inventories is to identify cultural resources prior to any
ground-disturbing activity. This way, sites can be protected through project redesign or other mitigation
measures prior to any threat of disturbance. Numerous laws and regulations mandate this policy. For a
brief overview of selected laws and policies dictating BLM’s treatment of cultural resources, please see
the end of this appendix.
Three classes of cultural resource inventory have been established; Class III is the most intensive.
Class I inventories are completed with the use of existing data from cultural resource inventory files
maintained by both the BLM and the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). Class I
inventories are conducted at two different levels: at the planning stage of an environmental impact
statement (EIS) to produce a regional overview; and at the site-specific level for individual proposed
projects to determine if previous cultural resource inventories have been conducted within the area of
potential effect (APE). The purpose of Class I inventories is to provide cultural resource specialists and
managers with an informed basis for understanding the nature of the archaeological record within the area
in question.
Class II inventories are statistically-based sample surveys designed to aid in characterizing the probable
density, diversity, and distribution of cultural properties in the area, to develop and test predictive models,
and to answer appropriate research questions. Within individual sample units, survey aims, methods, and
intensity are the same as those applied in a Class III survey. Class II surveys may be conducted in several
phases, using different sample designs, to improve statistical reliability.
Class III intensive field surveys are conducted by professionals through pedestrian survey of an entire
target area. The intent of a Class III inventory is to locate and record all historic properties and is
consistent with standards in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and
Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716). Class III inventories conform to the prevailing professional survey
standards for the region involved, provided that the regional standards meet or exceed the Secretary's
Standards and Guidelines. Because a Class III survey is designed to produce a total inventory of the
cultural properties observable within the target area, once it has been completed, no further survey work
should be needed in the target area as long as the current standards are met. Areas with a high probability
of containing buried cultural materials or known cultural materials may require additional work or
professional monitoring and/or data recovery excavations. Areas that require additional work are analyzed
on a case-by-case basis, depending on the proposed action and the types of cultural resources present in
the project area.

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

BLM JURISDICTION ON PRIVATELY OWNED AND/OR SPLIT-ESTATE LANDS
(including the checkerboard land pattern)
Survey
The BLM frequently authorizes permits and rights-of-way, or provides approvals for actions on federal
lands in which portions of the overall project may take place on non-federal lands or the federal action
may have contingent or cumulative effects on non-federal lands. Before the BLM can authorize (through
permit, license, etc.) any project that may adversely affect significant cultural resources (i.e., historic
properties), the BLM has the legal responsibility to take into account the effects of its actions on these
resources. In order for the BLM to fully consider the effects of its actions, it also has the responsibility to
gather the information necessary to know what cultural resources may be affected, evaluate the resources
for eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, and mitigate adverse affects to
historic properties where possible.
If a project requires the use of federally-owned surface lands as well as privately owned surface lands,
there are two authorities that require federal agencies to apply the same NHPA Section 106 compliance
standards to private lands as they do to federal lands. The regulations at 36 CFR, Part 800.4(b) require the
federal agency to "take the steps necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential
effect." That this includes both federal and non-federal lands is implicit throughout the statute and the
regulations, since the regulatory definition of "area of potential effect" is "the geographic area or areas
within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or use of historic
properties" [36 CFR, Part 800.16(d)]. It makes no distinction between federal and non-federal lands.
More explicit, however, is Executive Order No. 11593, entitled "Protection and Enhancement of the
Cultural Environment." Section 1(3) of the EO states that all federal agencies: " ... in consultation with the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, institute procedures to assure that federal plans and programs
contribute to the preservation and enhancement of non-federally owned sites, structures and objects of
historical, architectural, or archaeological significance." The BLM's responsibility for inventory,
evaluation, and protection of cultural properties on lands outside BLM administrative jurisdiction is
limited according to the degree to which the Field Manager's decisions determine or control the location
of surface-disturbing activities on those lands.
BLM makes this policy known to project proponents, who in turn are responsible for providing all of the
information the BLM requires for making informed decisions. If cultural resource data is lacking from
private lands so that the BLM authorized officer cannot make an informed decision, the BLM cannot
allow the undertaking to proceed. Thus, it is the responsibility of the project proponent to acquire the
appropriate information.
Within the checkerboard land pattern that encompasses much of the planning area, Wyoming BLM has
set forth the policy that the entire project area, if it covers any federal lands, must be inventoried. The
reasoning for this is that the distances between federal ownership and private ownership are so short, that
the potential for the federal portion to not dictate the placement of the project on private is remote.
Split estate lands are defined as those lands where surface ownership transferred to private landowners
from the federal government but the mineral rights were retained by the federal government. These
situations arose either through patent under the 1914 amendment to the Homestead Act or purchase under
the Stock-raising Act of 1916. Each of these Acts also allowed for the federal government to "reenter and
occupy so much of the surface ... as may be required for all purposes reasonably incident to the mining or
removal of coal or other minerals." At the time of purchase, the buyer agreed to these terms. Since
compliance with the NHPA Section 106 process is required of a federal agency by statute and regulation

J-2

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

prior to the federal action, then being able to complete that process is a purpose reasonably incident to the
extraction of the minerals.
Site Management
As stated above, BLM has multiple authorities for requiring cultural resource inventories on private lands.
This jurisdiction only holds forth with federal undertakings. Cultural resources that are located on private
lands are recorded for the permanent record and appropriate mitigation measures are applied, in
consultation with the private landowner. This jurisdiction comes from the requirement that the federal
agency must take into account its effects on all historic properties. Once the federal undertaking has been
fully processed, the federal responsibility for an historic property is completed. The historic property
remains under the ownership of the landowner, thus BLM has no control over the historic property
outside of the venue of a federal undertaking.
Evaluation of Cultural Resource Sites
Criterion for Eligibility

The BLM evaluates the significance of cultural resources identified during inventory in consultation with
the Wyoming SHPO to determine if the resources are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). Cultural resource properties may be considered eligible for listing in the
National Register if they meet one or more of the following criteria identified in 36 CFR 60.4:


Criterion A. An historic property is associated with an event or events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of America's history.
 Criterion B. An historic property is associated with the lives of persons significant to our past.
 Criterion C. An historic property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method
of construction, or represents the work of a master, or possesses high artistic value or represents a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction.
 Criterion D. An historic property has yielded or may be likely to yield information important in
prehistory or history.
To facilitate evaluation of cultural resource values in Wyoming, the BLM has devised guidelines for
determining the eligibility of archaeological and historical sites and historic trails (BLM Manual
8110.32). The guidelines supplement the National Register criteria for evaluation (36 CFR 60.4) and
provide consistency across all BLM jurisdictions. Application of the guidelines ensures that significant
cultural resources are recognized and managed accordingly.
Aspects of Integrity

Integrity is the ability of a property to convey its significance. To be listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, a property must not only be shown to be significant under the National Register criteria,
but it also must have integrity. The evaluation of integrity is sometimes a subjective judgment, but it must
always be grounded in an understanding of a property's physical features and how they relate to its
significance.
Historic properties either retain integrity (this is, convey their significance) or they do not. Within the
concept of integrity, the National Register criteria recognizes seven aspects or qualities that, in various
combinations, define integrity.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

J-3

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

To retain historic integrity a property will always possess several, and usually most, of the aspects. The
retention of specific aspects of integrity is paramount for a property to convey its significance.
Determining which of these aspects are most important to a particular property requires knowing why,
where, and when the property is significant.








Location. The place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the historic event
occurred.
Design. The combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure, and style of a
property.
Setting. The physical environment of an historic property.
Materials. The physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular period of time
and in a particular pattern or configuration to form an historic property.
Workmanship. The physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during any given
period in history or prehistory.
Feeling. The property's expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time.
Association. The direct link between an important historic event or person and an historic property.

Contributing and Non-Contributing to NRHP Eligibility

Properties that encompass large areas can be deemed to have contributing and noncontributing portions.
Contributing portions are seen to retain integrity of the values for which the property is considered
eligible for the NRHP. Non-contributing portions are identified portions of the property which are not
deemed to retain the integrity of values which would render the property eligible for the NRHP. The
determination of contributing versus noncontributing portions of an eligible property can be made at any
time after adequate evaluation has been conducted.
Historic trails including the Overland and Cherokee, the Rawlins to Fort Washakie Freight Road, and the
Rawlins to Baggs Freight Road, are considered eligible for the National Register under Criterion A.
However, some portions of the trails no longer retain the aspects of integrity necessary for eligibility. As
there have been no encompassing inventories of entire trails within the Resource Management Plan
Planning Area (RMPPA), portions of trails are evaluated to determine if they contribute to the eligibility
of the property on a case-by-case basis. Trail segments are evaluated pursuant to the National Register
criteria of integrity (location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association). If a
predominance of criteria are met, the segment will be considered contributing to the properties' overall
NRHP eligibility.
BLM Use Allocations
After determination of eligibility, significant cultural resource properties are further evaluated for assignment
to one or more use categories. The BLM has established six use categories as follows:


Scientific Use. This category applies to any cultural property determined to be available for scientific
or historical study using currently available research techniques, including methods that would result
in the property's physical alteration or destruction. Recommendations to allocate individual properties
to this use must be based on documentation of the kinds of data the property is thought to contain and
the data's importance for pursuing specified research topics.
 Conservation for Future Use. A cultural property included in this category is deemed worthy of
segregation from all other land or resource uses, including cultural resource uses, which threaten the
maintenance of its present condition or setting, and will remain in this use category until specified
provisions are met in the future.

J-4

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT


Traditional Use. This category is to be applied to any cultural resource known to be perceived by a
specified social and/or cultural group as important in maintaining the cultural identity, heritage, or
well being of the group. Cultural properties assigned to this category are to be managed in ways that
recognize the importance ascribed to them and seek to accommodate their continuing traditional use.
 Public Use. This category may be applied to a cultural property found to be appropriate for use as an
interpretive exhibit in place, or for related educational and recreational uses by members of the
general public.
 Experimental Use. This category may be applied to a cultural property judged well suited for
controlled experimental study, to be conducted by BLM or others, concerned with the techniques of
managing cultural properties, which would result in the property's alteration, possibly including loss
of integrity and destruction of physical elements. It should not be applied to cultural properties with
strong research potential, traditional cultural importance, or good public use potential, if it would
significantly diminish those uses.
 Discharged from Management. This category is assigned to cultural properties that have no remaining,
identifiable use. Most often these are prehistoric and historic archaeological properties, such as small
surface scatters of artifacts or debris, whose limited research potential is effectively exhausted as soon
as they have been documented. Properties discharged from management remain in the inventory, but
they are removed from further management attention and do not constrain other land uses.
When a cultural resource property is assigned to one or more use categories, a decision is made pertaining to
the management of that property. The criteria and guidelines for the evaluation of cultural resources and the
assignment of significant cultural resource properties to specific use categories would remain unchanged under
all the alternatives addressed in this plan.

Determinations of Effect
Once the eligibility of an historic property has been determined, the BLM must then determine the effects
a proposed undertaking may have on a cultural resource. Standard measures for reducing effects are to be
considered part of the project design. Determination of effect must be made after standard treatment
measures and best management practices (BMP) have been integrated into the project design. The final
project design must incorporate all agreed upon treatment measures and be included in the Conditions of
Approval or components of the Surface Use Plan, Plan of Operations, or Plan of Development.
No Historic Properties Affected. If no cultural resource sites eligible for listing in the NRHP are present
in the proposed project area, there are historic properties present but the undertaking will have no effect
upon them, or a proposed project will not be visible from an historic property or there is no contrast
between the project and the setting, the BLM will find that the undertaking has no potential to affect
historic properties.
No Historic Properties Adversely Affected. If a proposed project will cause effects to an historic
property, but the effects will not diminish the aspects of integrity nor the characteristics that make the
property eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, only noncontributing portions of
historic properties will be affected, or if setting is an important aspect of integrity for an historic property
and the project will cause a weak contrast, the BLM will find that the undertaking has no potential to
adversely affect historic properties.
Historic Properties Adversely Affected. An adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter,
directly, or indirectly, any of the characteristics of an historic property that qualify the property for
inclusion in the National Register in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property's location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association. Consideration shall be given to all
qualifying characteristics of an historic property, including those that may have been identified

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

J-5

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

subsequent to the original evaluation of the property's eligibility for the National Register. Adverse effects
may include reasonably foreseeable effects caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be
farther removed in distance, or be cumulative.
Consultation
SHPO Consultation

According to the Programmatic Agreement between the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(ACHP) and the BLM, the BLM is required to consult with the Wyoming SHPO on eligibility and effects
to each cultural property. The Wyoming BLM and Wyoming SHPO have developed a Protocol for
consultation that serves to streamline the process and reduce consultation time frames from the guidelines
set forth in the 36 CFR 800 regulations. Under the Protocol between the Wyoming BLM and the
Wyoming SHPO, those sites recommended as Eligible for listing under Criteria A, B, or C or the setting
is an important aspect of integrity requiring case-by-case consultation with the Wyoming SHPO.
Additionally, the BLM has implied concurrence for determining eligibility and effects for sites eligible
for listing under Criterion D of the NHPA. Determination of effects to sites follows the criteria outlined in
36 CFR 800.5.
Native American Consultation

In addition to consultation with the Wyoming SHPO office, the BLM conducts Native American
Consultation in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act
of 1978, and Executive Order No. 13007. The BLM has created a process for conducting Native
American consultation for federal undertakings, as described in BLM Manual 8120 and BLM Manual H8120-1. The BLM has worked extensively with tribes known to inhabit the region to establish a protocol
for consultation. Consultation with Native American tribes occurs during the planning process of
environmental impact statements and when individual projects are proposed that may impact properties
that have traditional use (i.e., Traditional Cultural Properties [TCPs]) or are sacred to Native American
cultures. When one of these site types is identified within proximity to a proposed undertaking, the project
proponent and tribal governments are notified. Determinations of eligibility and effects the project may
have on the site are determined in consultation with tribal representatives. The BLM does not authorize
any undertaking that has the potential to affect TCPs or Native American Sacred Sites without first
consulting with tribes. The likelihood of inadvertently affecting a TCP or sacred site is low because of the
established protocols BLM has developed with tribal representatives.
Interested Parties

The BLM will solicit such input through the public participation opportunities afforded by BLM's land
use planning and environmental review processes established under the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, and in
accordance with regulations at 43 CFR Part 1610.3. Interested parties shall be invited to participate in the
Section 106 consultation process if they have a demonstrated interest in a BLM undertaking or action on
historic properties. Such interested parties may include, but are not limited to, local governments,
grantees, permittees, owners of affected lands or land surfaces, Indian tribes, and other interested parties
determined jointly by BLM and SHPO.
In making determinations of effect, BLM may request comments of interested parties. When BLM makes
a determination of adverse effect, they will request comments of interested parties. BLM will maintain
lists of interested parties based on their identified interests.

J-6

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

BLM and SHPO will consult to identify invited concurring parties based on their demonstrated interest
and level of participation. Invited concurring parties will be provided the opportunity to sign a
Memorandum of Agreement or Programmatic Agreement. Refusal by an invited concurring party to sign
an agreement will not invalidate the agreement.
Management of Cultural Resources
Management objectives for significant cultural resource values provide a direct link between the
assignment of properties to use categories and the achievement of the cultural resource program
objectives. The basic management objectives for significant cultural resource values would remain
unchanged under all of the alternatives addressed in this plan.
Specific management actions that could be taken to achieve these objectives at selected significant
properties are described in the discussions of the various alternatives. Management objectives for
significant properties that have not yet been identified or for which inventory data are insufficient as of
this writing will remain unchanged, but management actions for these properties will be prescribed on a
case-by-case basis and will be addressed in amendments to this plan when appropriate.
Standard Protective Measures

Within the framework described above, the BLM has developed protective measures to minimize adverse
effects (as defined in 36 CFR 800.5[1]) on significant cultural resource values. Protective measures are
used in response to the proposed actions of BLM programs involving surface disturbance. These
measures include cultural resource inventories, evaluation of cultural resources located during inventory,
setting assessments where applicable, best management practices and mitigation of potential adverse
impacts on significant cultural resources.
A setting assessment is used to determine what physical features of a proposed undertaking will be visible
from an historic property for which setting is an important aspect of integrity. Visibility of undertakings
will vary. The scale of visual analysis should be commensurate with the scale of the undertaking. In the
majority of cases, undertakings will not be seen beyond three miles; pipelines, fiber-optic and other
ground level disturbance will not likely be seen beyond a mile. In rare cases, undertakings may be seen
beyond five miles if they are unusually large or are skylined on the horizon, such as wind turbines and
communication towers.
A setting assessment can also be used to determine whether a proposed undertaking will introduce audible
elements to the historic property where setting is an important aspect of integrity. These proposed
undertakings may include compressor stations, pumping stations, or wind turbines. An assessment of the
existing audible elements will be documented and then the BLM archaeologist will work with the project
proponent to ensure new audible elements do not result in an adverse effect. Best management practices
and mitigation measures will be utilized to achieve this goal.
Best Management Practices

In situations where a proposed undertaking has the potential to affect the physical integrity of an historic
property, there are numerous measures that can be applied to reduce or eliminate the effects. BLM
archaeologists work with the contracting archaeologist and the project proponent to determine which
practice would best suit the needs of all parties. Application of BMPs is dependent upon the nature of the
undertaking, and the nature of the historic property.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

J-7

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Avoidance. Avoidance, through modification of the proposed undertaking, is the primary and preferred
measure used to protect cultural resources. This can be accomplished at the project planning stage.
Monitoring. In situations where avoidance of adverse affects is not feasible, or there is a determination of
no adverse effects, but the potential remains for adverse effects through inadvertent discovery, a BLM
permitted archaeologist will monitor construction activities. The presence of a monitor is to ensure that
buried cultural materials are immediately identified and that construction activities in that area are halted
to avoid further impacts to the site. Prior to BLM authorization of the project, the project proponent
submits a discovery plan to the BLM for review which outlines the way in which cultural resources will
be treated and the responsibilities of the project proponent. This plan is reviewed by BLM archaeologists
and submitted to SHPO for concurrence. In the case where monitoring results in a discovery situation, the
discovery plan is enacted. Depending on the nature of the discovery the project may be allowed to
proceed, redesigned, or data recovery may be required.
Standard Measures to Reduce Visual Contrast. When a proposed project is found to be within the
contributing setting of an historic property, an assessment of potential impacts is conducted through
viewshed analysis, on-site inspection, and photo inspection. For historic trails such as the Cherokee Trail,
Overland Trail, Rawlins to Fort Washakie Road and Rawlins to Baggs Road, protection measures would
be carried out similar to other historic properties if any project were found to be located within a quarter
mile of a contributing portion of the historic trail. When a proposed project is outside of the quarter mile
buffer of the trail, but found to be within the viewshed that contributes to NRHP eligibility, analyses of
potential impacts to the integrity of the setting would be carried out in the same way as other properties
where setting is an aspect of integrity. Best management practices used to ensure that the contributing
viewshed of historic properties are not adversely affected include:











Consolidating project facilities among oil and gas developers—this also facilitates cumulative
analysis.
Developing coordinated road and pipeline systems.
Reducing the amount of surface development by consolidating facilities (e.g., develop bottom hole
wells using directional drilling from a single surface well location).
Using low profile facilities.
Proper sighting and location to maximize the use of topography and vegetation to screen
development. Design projects to blend with topographic forms and existing vegetation patterns.
Using environmental coloration or advance camouflage techniques to break up visual intrusion of
facilities that cannot be completely hidden.
Using broken linear patterns for road developments to screen roads as much as possible. This can
include feathering or blending of the edges of linear rights-of-way to break up the linearity.
For livestock control, using electric fencing with low-visibility fiberglass posts and environmental
colors (e.g., sage green).
Designing linear facilities and seismic lines to run parallel to key observation points rather than
perpendicular.
Modifying the orientation of facilities to present less of a visual impact (e.g., a facility with several
tanks lined up so that one obscures the visibility of the others).

Mitigation
Mitigation measures are determined by the types of proposed actions, the nature of the potential effect
and the qualities of the historic property that render it eligible for NRHP listing. Mitigation measures are
applied when best management practices will not reduce or minimize adverse effects. Mitigation may
include data recovery. Consultation with the Wyoming SHPO and the ACHP is required when proposed

J-8

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

APPENDIX J—CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

actions are expected to adversely affect properties eligible for the National Register and mitigation is
determined to be the best course of action.
Data Recovery. There are two times during a project that data recovery may be implemented. The first is
when it is determined prior to project construction that there will be an adverse effect to an NRHP eligible
property. The project proponent, the BLM, and the SHPO work together to develop a data recovery plan
which will mitigate the adverse effects. The second is after a discovery situation when it is determined
that the project has already adversely impacted an historic property. Again, the project proponent, BLM
authorized officer, and SHPO work to develop a plan that mitigates all effects of the construction. Data
recovery in itself is a destructive process, thus it must be carried out in a way to successfully retrieve all
pertinent information from the site.
HABS/HAER (Historic American Buildings Survey/Historic American Engineering Record).
HABS/HAER documentation as a mitigation measure may be implemented if no other mitigation
measure would adequately minimize the adverse effect. This documentation includes large format
photography, drawings, and research of the property to document all aspects of the property prior to
adverse effects.
Agreement Documents. In situations where data recovery or HABS/HAER documentation is not
appropriate to mitigate adverse effects or multiple historic properties will be affected by a single
undertaking, the BLM will work with the SHPO and the project proponent to develop an agreement
document. Depending on the nature of the undertaking, this may result in a Memorandum of Agreement
(MOA) or a Programmatic Agreement (PA). The agreement document will outline the manner in which
adverse effects will be mitigated, and the roles and responsibilities of each signatory. The agreement
document stays in effect until all measures have been completed to the satisfaction of all parties.
Cultural Resource Laws and Regulations
American Antiquities Act of 1906 provides for permits to authorize scholarly use of properties, for
misdemeanor-level penalties to control unauthorized use, and for presidential designation of outstanding
properties as national monuments for long-term preservation.
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966


Section 106 directs all federal agencies to take into account effects of their undertakings (actions and
authorizations) on properties included in or eligible for the NRHP.
 Section 110 sets inventory, nomination, protection, and preservation responsibilities for federally
owned cultural properties. Section 110 (c) requires each federal agency to designate a Preservation
Officer to coordinate activities under the act.
American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 establishes the policy of the United States to protect and
preserve for the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiian the inherent right of freedom to
believe, express, and exercise their traditional religions. Federal agencies are directed to evaluate their policies
and procedures to determine if changes are needed to ensure that such rights and freedoms are not disrupted by
agency practices.
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 provides felony-level penalties for the unauthorized
excavation, removal, damage, alteration, defacement, or the attempted unauthorized removal, damage,
alteration, or defacement of any archaeological resource, more than 100 years of age, found on public lands or
Indian lands. The act also prohibits the sale, purchase, exchange, transportation, receipt, or offering of any
archaeological resource obtained from public lands or Indian lands.

Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 requires Native American consultation
for the excavation and/or removal of "cultural items" including human remains, funerary objects, sacred
objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. Consultation is also required if "cultural items" are discovered
during land use activities.
Executive Order No. 13007: Indian Sacred Sites establishes access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred
sites by Indian religious practitioners on federal lands. The federal agencies shall avoid adversely affecting the
physical integrity of such sacred sites and maintain confidentiality of said sites.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

1. PURPOSE AND NEED
1.1

INTRODUCTION AND REGIONAL SETTING

BP America Production Company (BP), representing itself and more than 20 others (collectively referred
to as the “Operators”) submitted a proposal to the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) Rawlins Field Office (RFO) to expand development of natural gas and condensate
resources within two previously developed project areas described as the Continental Divide/Wamsutter
II and Creston/Blue Gap project areas. The BLM has designated the new consolidated proposal the
Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) Natural Gas Development Project.
The proposed project combines two separate proposals submitted to the BLM:




In April 2005, the RFO received a proposal from Devon Energy Corporation and other federal
leaseholders to drill up to 1,250 infill natural gas wells and associated facilities. A total of 275
natural gas wells had previously been approved for the area in the 1994 Record of Decision (ROD)
for the earlier Creston/Blue Gap Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (BLM 1994). The Devon
proposal was initiated as the Creston/Blue Gap II Natural Gas Project.
In November 2005, the RFO received a proposal from BP and other federal leaseholders to drill up
to 7,700 additional wells and associated facilities within a portion of the previously approved
Continental Divide/Wamsutter II natural gas project area. The May 2000 ROD for the Continental
Divide/Wamsutter II Environmental Impact Statement had approved up to 3,000 wells (BLM 2000).

After reviewing both the Continental Divide and Creston/Blue Gap II proposals, and considering their
concurrent timing, their proximity, and the similarity of the Proposed Actions, the BLM determined that
the two projects should be combined into one infill project with up to 8,950 wells.
The BLM has prepared this draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze the effects of the
project’s proposed infill drilling and field development in compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (as amended) (NEPA) (42 United States Code [U.S.C.] 4321 et seq.) and the Council
on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations. This EIS describes the direct, indirect, and cumulative
impacts of existing and new development in the CD-C project area.
The project area consists of approximately 1.1 million acres (1,672 square miles, or mi2) located in
Townships 14 through 24 North, Ranges 91 through 98 West, Sixth Principal Meridian, Carbon and
Sweetwater counties (Map 1-1). The eastern boundary of the CD-C project area is about 25 air miles west
of the city of Rawlins; the western boundary is roughly 50 miles east of the city of Rock Springs.
Interstate 80 (I-80) generally bisects the project area. The checkerboard2 pattern of land ownership in the
central portion of the project area is a result of early land grants from the federal government to the Union
Pacific Railroad Company. The BLM, the State of Wyoming, and private owners issued the oil and gas
leases covering these lands. The RFO manages BLM surface lands and the federal mineral estate in the
project area. The BLM manages approximately 626,932 surface acres (58.6 percent), the State of
Wyoming owns approximately 48,684 acres (4.5 percent), and private landowners own approximately
394,470 acres (36.9 percent), as shown in Map 1-1. The map also shows all natural gas development to
date within and adjacent to the project area. Table 1-1 describes both the surface and mineral ownership
within the project area.

The checkerboard refers to the generalized land ownership pattern, characterized by alternating private and public
ownership of sections, 20 miles either side of the Union Pacific Railroad.

The State of Wyoming is a Cooperating Agency in this EIS, with active participation from many state
agencies including the State Planning Office, Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD), State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ), and
Wyoming Department of Agriculture (WDA). Regional cooperating agencies include Sweetwater County,
the Little Snake River Conservation District, and the Sweetwater County Conservation District.

1.2

OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

Based on current knowledge of natural gas reservoir characteristics (geology, flow from existing wells,
anticipated recovery rates, and economics), the Operators propose drilling up to 8,950 infill natural gas
wells, including up to 500 coalbed natural gas (CBNG) wells, in addition to the more than 4,400 wells
already drilled in the project area (Map 1-1). The precise locations of these additional wells have not been
identified at this time. The Operators anticipate drilling at well densities of up to one well per 40 acres.
Wells may be drilled conventionally with a vertical well bore on a single pad, or with multiple directional
bores from a single pad. The proposed project also includes construction and operation of ancillary
facilities such as: roads; gas, water, and condensate-gathering pipelines; overhead and buried power lines;
and separation, dehydration, metering, and fluid-storage facilities.
The total number of wells drilled would depend largely on variables outside of the Operators’ control,
such as production success, appropriate engineering technology, economic factors, commodity prices,
availability of commodity markets, and lease stipulations and restrictions. The Proposed Action is
explained in more detail in Chapter 2 and in Appendix B, Plan of Development. Appendix B includes
details on project site planning, development, and operations including general plans and descriptions for
transportation, reclamation, and hazardous materials management. Wyoming BLM standard operating
procedures and practices currently used in all surface-disturbing activities throughout the Rawlins Field
Office would be employed for this project (see Appendix C, Best Management Practices and
Conditions of Approval). Additional appendices containing information related to project scoping,
operations and procedures, mitigation, and resource-specific issues include:

CHAPTER 1—PURPOSE AND NEED

Construction, development, production, and abandonment would comply with all applicable federal, state,
and county laws, rules, and regulations (see Section 1.7). Best Management Practices committed to by the
Operators on public lands include the design and construction of all new roads to a safe and appropriate
standard to accommodate their intended use, painting of all new facilities a color that best allows the
structures to blend in with the background, interim reclamation of well locations and access roads, and
final reclamation and recontouring of all disturbed areas.

1.3

PREVIOUS AND EXISTING OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA

The CD-C project lies in the center of a large area that has seen extensive natural gas exploration and
development. Map 1-2 shows the boundaries of the most recent natural gas projects. The Continental
Divide project and then the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II project were two predecessors of the CD-C
project, both with much greater area. The Creston/Blue Gap project was another predecessor. Four other
projects lie adjacent to, or even within, the CD-C project area: Atlantic Rim to the east, Desolation Flats
to the southwest, Table Rock at the center west, and Luman Rim at the northwest corner. Table Rock at
and Luman Rim are two relatively small projects approved by the Rock Springs Field Office in the last
two years. The other and much larger predecessor and neighboring projects are summarized in Table 1-2.

Creston/Blue Gap Natural Gas Project. Natural gas development and production in the southeastern
portion of the project area (Map 1-2) was analyzed and approved under the Creston/Blue Gap EIS and
ROD (BLM 1994). The decision allowed a maximum of 275 wells on 250 locations on a 160-acre
spacing pattern. This project is fully constructed and the CD-C Proposed Action includes infill
development associated with the same project area.
Continental Divide/Wamsutter II Natural Gas Project (CDW2) . The CDW2 project comprised
approximately 1,061,200 acres—531,400 acres of federal surface, 9,800 acres of state surface, and
520,000 acres of private surface (Map 1-2). The Proposed Action analyzed in the EIS included up to
3,000 wells at 3,000 well locations, with approximately 1,500 miles of new roads, 1,500 miles of new
pipeline, five compressor stations, one gas-processing facility, 10 evaporation ponds, five disposal wells,
and 50 water wells. The ROD (BLM 2000) approved up to 2,130 wells, with the remaining 870 wells (not
more than 435 wells or well locations on federal lands and/or federal mineral estate) to be reviewed
pending revision of the Rawlins Resource Management Plan (RMP). With the approval of the Rawlins
RMP in 2008, the remaining wells were authorized. This project is fully constructed and the CD-C
Proposed Action includes infill development associated with the same project area.
Desolation Flats Natural Gas Field Development Project. The EIS analyzed a proposal to conduct
exploratory drilling and development of up to 385 wells and associated production and transmission
facilities within the area known as Desolation Flats. The project area is approximately 233,542 acres,
located within the BLM Rawlins and Rock Springs Field Offices, immediately to the southwest of the
CD-C project area (Map 1-2). The 2004 ROD (BLM 2004) approved 385 wells at 361 locations. After an
initial period of development, drilling activity has fallen off in recent years.

Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Development Project. This project is located on the southeastern boundary
of the CD-C project area, encompassing approximately 270,080 acres (Map 1-2). The 2006 ROD (BLM
2006a) called for drilling and development of approximately 1,800 CBNG wells and 200 conventional
gas wells on state, private, and federal lands with a density of eight wells per 640 acres. Drilling is
expected to occur for approximately 15 years. New wells are expected to have an operational life of 30 to
40 years. Associated facilities include access roads, gas and water collection pipelines, compressor
stations, and electrical/power system development. After an initial period of development, drilling activity
has fallen off in recent years.

1.4

PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE ACTION

The Operators propose to develop, produce, and market natural gas and other fluid minerals from the CD­
C project area that are needed to meet the national domestic energy demand. Under its authority to issue
oil and gas leases and consistent with the Great Divide Resource Management Plan (RMP), updated and
renamed in December 2008 as the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a), the RFO has leased federal minerals
within the entire project area. The BLM oil and gas leasing program encourages development of domestic
oil and gas reserves, consistent with the BLM’s multiple-use mission.
The BLM’s purpose and need is to determine the conditions under which the applicant’s valid existing
rights from federal oil and gas leases within the CD-C project area may be exercised in accordance with
the BLM’s multiple-use mandate, the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) of 1920 as amended, the Federal Land
Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), and the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform
Act of 1987. The MLA, as amended, provides that exploration and development of domestic oil and gas is
in the best interest of the United States. The intent of the MLA and its implementing regulations is to
allow, and essentially encourage, lessees or potential lessees to explore for oil and gas or other mineral
reserves on federally-administered lands.
The BLM is also directed by the FLPMA to manage public lands for multiple use including recreation,
wildlife habitat, development of timber and forest products, livestock grazing, and energy and mineral
production such as the CD-C proposal. The BLM must consider the proposal for exploratory actions and
full-field development of natural gas resources within the CD-C project area in a manner that meets the
multiple-use mandate of the agency and sustains the health and productivity of public lands for the use
and enjoyment of present and future generations. The BLM will consider approval of the proposed
drilling in a manner that reduces impacts on water and wildlife resources throughout the CD-C project
area, consistent with the lease rights granted to the applicant.

1.5

DECISIONS TO BE MADE

As a result of the analysis presented in this EIS, the BLM will decide whether to allow, and under what
conditions to allow, the development, operation, maintenance, and reclamation of expanded development
on federal lands and the federal mineral estate within the project area. The BLM will determine what
levels of impacts are approved, and what Conditions of Approval, Best Management Practices,
mitigation, monitoring, and surveying would be required. The ROD associated with this EIS will not be
the final review or the final approval for all actions associated with this project. The BLM must review
and authorize each component of the project that involves the disturbance of federal lands on a sitespecific basis. The methods normally used to evaluate and authorize surface-disturbing activities are an
Application for Permit to Drill (APD), right-of-way grant, or Sundry Notice, with supporting
environmental record of review, which would be required before any construction could occur.
Evaluations at this level include site-specific analyses of proposed well locations, tiered to the broad-scale
level analysis included in this EIS.

REGULATORY SETTING

This EIS incorporates key provisions of the FLPMA of 1976, which directs the BLM to manage public
lands and their resource values to “best meet the present and future needs of the American people”
(Section 103 [43 USC 1702]) and to coordinate resource management “without permanent impairment of
the productivity of the land and the quality of the environment with consideration being given to the
relative values of the resources and not necessarily to the combination of uses that will give the greatest
economic return or greatest unit output” (Section 103(c) [43 USC 1702]). The FLPMA also states that it
is appropriate that some lands be used “for less than all of the resources” (Section 103 (c) [43 USC
1702]).
The BLM RFO is the lead agency for this EIS because the federal lands proposed for development are
under its jurisdiction. The BLM has provided guidance, input, participation, and independent evaluation
during EIS preparation. Previously listed federal and state agencies and local governments participated in
the preparation of this EIS as cooperators. The BLM, in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) 1506.5(a) and (c), is in agreement with the information and analyses presented in this EIS and
approves and takes responsibility for the scope and content of this document.
This EIS was prepared in accordance with NEPA, and CEQ regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR
1500–1508), and is in compliance with all applicable regulations and laws subsequently passed,
including: USDI requirements (Department Manual [DM] 516 [516 DM 1 through 6, 11]); Environmental
Quality (U.S. Department of the Interior 2005); guidelines listed in the BLM National Environmental
Policy Act Handbook H-1790-1 (BLM 2008c); Guidelines for Assessing and Documenting Cumulative
Impacts (BLM 1994); CEQs Considering Cumulative Effects under the National Environmental Policy
Act (Council on Environmental Quality 1997).

1.7

AUTHORIZATIONS AND PERMITS

This section describes the general federal, state and county permitting environment in which the CD-C
natural gas development project will operate. Table 1-3 contains a full listing of the pertinent federal,
state and county authorizing actions and the agencies that administer them.
Oil and gas leases on federal mineral estate are issued by the BLM consistent with regulations regarding
federal oil and gas leasing and operations (43 CFR, Parts 3100 and 3120, respectively). Stipulations may
be added as terms of a lease when the lease is issued to reflect management guidance established in the
Rawlins RMP.
Once a lease is issued, the leaseholder/operator must apply for and receive site-specific authorization(s)
prior to drilling within the leasehold area. To meet required environmental obligations, the leaseholder/
operator must submit to the BLM an APD or its associated application for right-of-way so that the
appropriate environmental review may be prepared. Environmental documents such as an Environmental
Assessment, Categorical Exclusion, or the appropriate environmental record of review for APD or rightof-way authorizations often include site-specific Conditions of Approval that add further operational
requirements.
Drilling of federal minerals is subject to the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Orders (43 CFR Subpart 3164 –
Special Provisions). BLM Onshore Order Nos. 1 and 2 require an applicant to comply with the following
conditions:





Operations must result in the diligent development and efficient recovery of resources;
All activities must comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations applicable
to federal leases;
All activities must include adequate safeguards to protect the environment;
Disturbed lands must be properly reclaimed; and

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

1-7

CHAPTER 1—PURPOSE AND NEED


All activities must protect public health and safety.

Onshore Order No. 1 specifically states that lessees and operators are held fully accountable for their
contractors' compliance with the requirements of the approved permit and/or plan (Part IV; March 7,
2007).
Pipeline and road rights-of-way on federal lands would be issued under the authority of the Mineral
Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, or the FLPMA. Right-of-way grants authorizing construction of
ancillary facilities, access roads, and pipelines would grant operators certain rights subject to the terms
and conditions incorporated into the grant by the BLM.
Several Executive Orders (EOs) also affect implementation of the proposed project. These EOs, which are
binding on all government agencies, place restrictions on government approval of construction activities
and apply to wetlands, floodplain management, migratory birds, environmental justice, and invasive
species.
The BLM must adhere to specific provisions regarding the draining of federal minerals from adjoining
non-federal lands. These provisions are codified in 43 CFR 3100.2, which states that, upon determination
that lands owned by the U.S. are being drained of oil or gas by wells drilled on adjacent lands, the BLM
may execute agreements with the owners of adjacent lands whereby the U.S. and its lessees shall be
compensated for such drainage. In addition, where lands in any lease are being drained of their oil and gas
content by wells either on another federal lease, issued at a lower rate or royalty, or on non-federal lands,
the lessee shall both drill and produce all wells necessary to protect the lease lands from drainage.
In lieu of drilling necessary wells, the lessee may, with the consent of the BLM, pay compensatory
royalty. These provisions are also incorporated in the lease terms contained in all federal oil and gas
leases (Form 3100-11). A list of the major permits, approvals, and authorized actions necessary to
construct, operate, maintain, and abandon project facilities for the Continental Divide-Creston Natural
Gas Development Project is provided in Table 1-3. Please note that this list is intended to provide an
overview of the key regulatory requirements that would govern project implementation. Additional
approvals, permits, and authorizing actions may be necessary.

CONFORMANCE WITH THE RAWLINS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN

The BLM issued its ROD for the Rawlins RMP in December, 2008. The Rawlins RMP provides direction
for managing 3.5 million acres of BLM-administered public land and 4.5 million acres of BLMadministered federal mineral estate in Albany, Carbon, Laramie, and Sweetwater Counties, Wyoming,
including the entire CD-C project area. The proposed CD-C development would be in conformance with
the 2008 Rawlins RMP and the BLM decisions relating to the CD-C proposal will be in conformance
with the RMP with one area of exception. Alternative B, Enhanced Resource Protection (Section 2.2.3)
contains several provisions that, if included in the CD-C ROD, may require an RMP amendment. For
example, the RMP requires “avoidance of surface-disturbing and disruptive activities within 500 feet of
perennial waters, springs, wells and wetlands.” For Muddy Creek and its tributaries that distance would
be increased to 0.25 miles by Alternative B. If it is determined that this or other elements from Alternative
B are to be included in the CD-C ROD, then the CD-C ROD would initiate the necessary RMP
amendment procedures.
Two elements of the Rawlins RMP that affect public resource management within the CD-C project area
may be revised before a ROD is issued on the CD-C project proposal: the management of visual resources
and the management of greater sage-grouse habitat.




The RFO’s resolution of RMP protest issues required additional planning on visual resource
management (VRM). On April 11, 2012, the RFO published a Notice of Intent to amend the RMP
with regard to the VRM designations. Subsequent to the completion of the RMP, the RFO updated
the visual resource inventory for the planning area and will use the update as a baseline for a revised
designation of VRM classes. The potential effect of this revision on management of visual resources
on public lands in the CD-C project area is described in Section 4.11, Visual Resources. Should the
RMP amendment for VRM designations be completed before the CD-C EIS is completed, the CD-C
ROD will reflect changes in VRM designations for the CD-C project area.
On May 28, 2010, the BLM Wyoming State Office announced its intention to prepare RMP
amendments to revise sage-grouse and sagebrush management for the Rawlins, Rock Springs,
Kemmerer, Pinedale, Casper, and Newcastle RMPs. Amending the RMPs would provide
consistency in applying the BLM Wyoming sage-grouse policy and also would assure consistency
with the Wyoming Governor’s Sage-Grouse Implementation Team’s Core Population Area
Strategy. Should the RMP amendment for sage-grouse management be completed before the CD-C
EIS is completed, the CD-C Record of Decision (ROD) will reflect changes in management of
greater sage-grouse called for by the RMP amendment.

Reasonably foreseeable development of oil and gas resources for the Rawlins Resource Area during the
20-year life of the RMP was estimated at 8,822 wells, resulting in gross surface disturbance of 57,819
acres and net surface disturbance of 15,472 acres including roads and pipelines. The number of wells
drilled and the estimated disturbance acreage were included in the RMP for analysis purposes only. The
estimates should not be construed as a cap or limit on the number of wells that could be drilled, or on the
amount of surface disturbance resulting from the development of oil and gas resources within the resource
area. No such constraints were intended and the RMP contains no decision that would cap drilling or
disturbance.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Scoping Process

Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations on implementing NEPA call for an early and open
process to determine the scope and significance of issues to be addressed in the EIS (40 CFR Sec.
1501.7). One of the principal goals of this scoping process is to involve the public in the identification of
issues, concerns, and potential impacts that may require detailed analysis in the EIS. The formal scoping

1-12

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 1—PURPOSE AND NEED

process for the Continental Divide-Creston EIS began with a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS on
additional drilling in the Creston/Blue Gap natural gas field. (As described in Section 1.2, Overview of
the Proposed Project, the Continental Divide-Creston EIS began as an EIS on just the Creston/Blue Gap
area.) That NOI was published in the Federal Register on September 8, 2005, inviting the public to
comment on a proposal for more extensive development in the Creston/Blue Gap II natural gas field. A
public meeting was held in Rawlins on October 13, 2005. During the scoping period on the Creston/Blue
Gap II Project, the BLM received 29 individual comment letters, faxes, and e-mails.
Very soon after the Creston/Blue Gap scoping process had been completed, BLM RFO received a
proposal from BP America Production Company (BP), representing themselves and other leaseholders, to
further develop lease holdings in the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II natural gas area. The BLM decided
to combine this project with the Creston/Blue Gap project into a single EIS and initiated another scoping
process for the newly named Continental Divide-Creston EIS. The BLM published a NOI for the larger
Continental Divide-Creston project on March 3, 2006. A public meeting to discuss the project was held in
Rawlins on April 6. In addition to the 29 comments received during the original scoping period, 21
comment letters, faxes, and e-mails were received for the combined Continental Divide-Creston Project.
Most of the respondents were the same for both projects.
As part of the scoping process, the BLM invited other federal, state, and local government agencies to
participate in the EIS process as cooperating agencies. The RFO hosted an “interested Agency” briefing
in January 2006 to bring the project to the attention of locally interested state, federal and local agencies.
The State of Wyoming, Sweetwater County, the Little Snake River Conservation District , and the
Sweetwater County Conservation District requested and received Cooperating Agency status.
The issues and concerns identified during the process described above are described in more detail in
Appendix A. Key issues and concerns are summarized below.
1.9.2

Key Issues and Concerns

All comments received during the scoping process were reviewed and analyzed. The BLM identified nine
key or driving issues based primarily upon the potential quantity, intensity, or duration of an impact,
and/or the degree of agency or public interest in the issue. The range of alternatives was developed in
response to these key issues, and the potential impacts associated with these issues.


Air Quality: Potential project and cumulative impacts on air quality, including air quality-related
values (AQRV).
Estimate potential changes in emissions brought about by the project, including nitrogen oxides
(NOx), particulate matter greater than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), and ozone. Estimate projectgenerated ozone using state-of-the-art scientific methods. Impact analysis should include evaluation
of regional haze and visibility effects on Category I airsheds. Modeling should address cumulative
emissions in the project area and regionally, assuming reasonably foreseeable natural gas and other
development.



Cultural resources: Estimate the impact on the historic trails and transportation corridors in the
project area.
The Overland Trail, Cherokee Trail, UPRR, and Lincoln Highway pass through the project area.
These trails have been inventoried and evaluated for eligibility to the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP), and appropriate mitigation will be developed that would preserve the setting which
contributes to that eligibility.



Hydrology: Degradation of water quality by project construction and drilling activities, issues
related to disposal of CBM-produced water.
The project may increase salt and sediment loads to and depletions from Colorado River
watersheds. What will be the selenium content of produced water? It should be no higher than 2

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

1-13

CHAPTER 1—PURPOSE AND NEED

micrograms per liter (μ/L) to protect fish, waterfowl, shorebirds, and other wildlife. No surface
disposal of produced water should be allowed due to increased salt loading within the Colorado
River basin.


Land Ownership: The great majority of the project area is in the “Checkerboard,” greatly
complicating impact reduction through mitigation.
A number of respondents noted that mitigation efforts on public land may not be imposed on nearby
private lands, thus undermining the success of that mitigation. Examples cited included wildlife
winter range, surface disturbance, traffic management, and non-native species.



Non-native, Invasive Plant Species: Evaluate the current and projected presence of non-native,
invasive species.
Already-extensive development in the project area has resulted in increased infestation by invasive
species. The regional drought has exacerbated this situation. To what extent will further
development of the project area increase the problem and what measures can be taken to control and
manage the spread of invasive species? To what extent is wildlife habitat and rangeland diminished
by invasive species?



Range Resources: Loss of livestock forage and project-associated hazardous conditions to area
livestock/livestock operations.
Respondents indicated concerns for livestock operations in the project area. Concerns were
generally associated with: the direct loss of forage and the associated potential for a reduction in
permitted livestock numbers; water quality impairment; movement restrictions; alterations due to
pipeline trenches, roads, and fences; management problems associated with the inability to access
two-track routes from project-developed crowned-and-ditched roads; and livestock hazards from
vehicle collisions, drinking contaminated water from project pits, entrapment in pipeline trenches,
and the increase in fugitive dust emissions potentially causing dust-induced pneumonia.



Special Status Species: What are the T&E and sensitive wildlife species that could be impacted by
the project, and what would be the extent of the effects?
There are resident populations of greater sage-grouse and mountain plovers and other special status
species. If black-footed ferret populations were found in the project area, would they be affected if
prairie dog populations were reduced? Could downstream habitat of Colorado River Endangered
fish populations be affected by soil sedimentation or water depletions? The EIS should include
identification and mapping of important habitats, and measures to avoid or mitigate loss of those
habitats.



Socioeconomics: Define the impact of the project on traditional socioeconomic indicators and
examine the question of technical vs. economic recoverability of the resource.
Some respondents expressed concern over the effect of the project on local employment,
infrastructure, and public finance. Additional concerns focused on the development of oil and gas
resources leading to the destruction of other economic activity like recreation and second-home
development. One respondent questioned the advisability of complete recovery of the natural gas
resource.



Surface disturbance/reclamation: The extent of existing and proposed surface disturbance and its
effects on all resources in the project area.
Many respondents identified the volume and distribution of surface disturbance as an issue for
several resources in the project area—wildlife and wildlife habitat, cultural resources, soils and
vegetation, and range resources. Directional drilling was frequently cited as a method to minimize
surface impacts. Proper reclamation of disturbed lands is critical to minimizing impacts on all area
resources and reclamation in arid environments, especially during periods of drought, is challenging
and may require specialized methods.

1-14

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 1—PURPOSE AND NEED


Wildlife Habitat: The project has the potential to further fragment wildlife habitat and seriously
diminish the value of that habitat for many species.
Previous development in the project area has created a network of roads that has already fragmented
habitat. The Proposed Action would quadruple the number of wells and has the potential to greatly
increase fragmentation through proliferation of access roads. What impact will this have on the
wildlife species in the area, and in particular, pronghorn, mule deer, and elk. Examine the effects of
natural gas production on winter range within the project area. The analysis should fully explore
mitigation efforts to minimize habitat fragmentation and to offset losses created by fragmentation;
mitigation measures could include limiting use to existing roads, closure of some existing roads, and
traffic controls. The need and methodology for wildlife and habitat monitoring should be fully
explored.

2. THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES
2.1

INTRODUCTION

The BLM identified a range of alternatives to the Proposed Action based on issues, concerns, and
opportunities raised in public comments during scoping; interdisciplinary interaction between resource
professionals; and collaboration with cooperating and other interested agencies. Comments on the
Proposed Action received during the public scoping period are summarized in Section 1.9, Public
Participation. A more detailed description of the public comments is found in Appendix A: Summary
of Scoping Comments by Category. The alternatives to the Proposed Action that are examined in detail
in this Draft EIS include Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling; Alternative B: Enhanced Resource
Protection; Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap—High and Low Density Development Areas;
Alternative D: Directional Drilling; and Alternative E: No Action. The Proposed Action and the
alternatives are described in this chapter. The BLM NEPA Handbook (H-1790-1) calls for expression of
the BLM’s preferred alternative in the Draft EIS if one exists (BLM 2008c). The BLM does not have a
preferred alternative for the CD-C Natural Gas Development Project at this time. The BLM believes that
the Proposed Action and the action alternatives all have elements that would address the project purpose
and need and will review public comment on the Draft EIS before determining a preferred alternative. A
preferred alternative will be designated in the Final EIS.
Although the development activities anticipated in the Proposed Action and in the alternatives would take
place on federal, state, and private lands, BLM authority applies only to the activities that would occur on
BLM-administered lands. Those activities on BLM-administered lands and mineral estate for the
Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) Natural Gas Development Project must conform to the Rawlins
RMP. The Rawlins RMP was completed in December 2008 (BLM 2008a) and is available at
<http://www.blm.gov/rmp/wy/rawlins/documents.html>.

2.2
2.2.1

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES
The Proposed Action

BP America Production Company and other operators (the Operators) propose to drill up to 8,950 wells
on approximately 1.1 million acres of federal, private, and state mineral estate (Map 1-1). These wells
would be in addition to the more than 4,400 wells that have already been drilled in the CD-C project area.
Up to 500 of the proposed wells could be coalbed natural gas (CBNG) wells. The project, as defined by
the Operators, is summarized here. For more detailed information, please see the Operators’ detailed Plan
of Development in Appendix B.
The proposed natural gas wells could be drilled either conventionally (with a single vertical well bore on
each well pad) or with multiple directional well bores from a single pad. It is anticipated that all wells
would be drilled during the 10- to 15-year period after project approval. Although actual operations are
subject to change as conditions warrant, the Operators’ long-term plan of development is to drill at the
average rate of approximately 600 wells per year until the resource is fully developed. The Operators
anticipate drilling infill wells at potentially up to 40 acres per down-hole well bore. Based on existing
reservoir and well performance information, most gas wells will be completed in the Almond Formation
(Mesa Verde Group), although secondary reserves may be encountered in other formations (e.g. Lewis,
etc.). The average life of a well is expected to be 30 to 40 years. Combining well life with a 15-year
production period produces a potential project life of 45 to 55 years. Factors outside of the Operators’
control, including geologic characteristics, reservoir quality, engineering technology, and economic
conditions could affect the Operators’ ability to adequately drain the reservoir and could result in fewer
than 8,950 wells being drilled.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-1

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

The facilities required by the project would include: roads; gas, water, and condensate gathering
pipelines; overhead and buried power lines; production facilities (separation, metering, treating, fluid
storage, compression, artificial lift, etc.); disposal well and/or surface disposal facilities; equipment
storage facilities; and other associated facilities. In general, gas would be transported via subsurface
pipelines to centralized compression and treatment facilities, although some well-site compression may be
included on an as-needed basis. Produced water would be transported by truck to water-disposal wells or
evaporation ponds, or by pipeline to treatment facilities. Existing arterial roads would provide the main
access to and within the project area.
2.2.1.1

Construction Activities

Since much of the project would largely be an infill development in an existing natural gas field, new
road construction would not be extensive. The primary access to the project area is Interstate 80 (I-80).
Existing arterial roads, including Wyoming State Highway (WY) 789 and several Sweetwater and Carbon
county roads, provide access within the project area. New road construction would primarily be short
sections of road from the existing road network to new well sites and support facilities. Some existing
access roads may need to be improved to accommodate increased traffic. Specific locations for access
roads are not known at this time but will be included in permit applications and will be evaluated by the
BLM during onsite inspections.
The project would include the construction of 8,950 well bores from both single-well pads and well pads
with multiple directional well bores. Construction of a typical single-well pad would require
approximately 6.3 acres, which includes 0.9 acres for an access road. A typical multiple-well pad would
disturb approximately 2.45 acres per well bore, which includes 0.45 acre for an access road. Operators
will determine the locations of new wells according to the subsurface reservoir, the topography of the
area, and Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) spacing rules. Dimensions of drill
pads will depend on topography and specific well needs.
Table 2.4-1 shows the estimated surface disturbance for the Proposed Action and the alternatives to the
Proposed Action.
2.2.1.2

Drilling and Completion

Well-drilling and completion activities will be in compliance with Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Order
No. 2. These guidelines specify the following:
…proposed casing and cementing programs shall be conducted as approved to protect or isolate all
usable water zones, potentially productive zones, lost-circulation zones, abnormally pressured zones,
and any prospectively valuable deposits of minerals. Any isolating medium other than cement shall
receive approval prior to use.
The Operators anticipate that the drilling-rig count within the project area would be up to 25 rigs at any
particular time in order to achieve development objectives. Wells would be drilled utilizing conventional,
mechanically powered mobile drilling rigs. Drilling each gas well would take from 7 to 20 days, with
additional time likely for directional wells and wells deeper than 10,000 feet. The Operators propose to
drill year-round subject to environmental considerations.
Approximately 20,000 to 30,000 barrels (bbls) of water are needed to perform drilling operations for each
well. Fresh water would be used for drilling the first 5,000–7,000 feet of each gas well, and water-based
muds would be used for the remainder of the drilling operation. Water would come from existing and new
water-supply wells within the project area, as well as from produced-water sources. The use of produced
water to the greatest extent possible would conserve fresh-water aquifers. No water would be withdrawn
from surface waters of the project area.

2-2

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

A fenced reserve pit, approximately 10 to 12 feet deep, would be excavated within the pad to temporarily
store drilling fluids and cuttings. The reserve pit would be lined if so specified in the APD; in nonenvironmentally sensitive areas and when a fresh water-based drilling mud is used, the reserve pit may be
unlined pending evaluation of the distance to surface water, depth to useable ground water, soil type and
permeability, and anticipated types of fluids that would be contained in the pit. Reserve pits would be
constructed so as minimize the potential to leak, break, or allow discharge and in accordance with APD
Conditions of Approval (COAs). The reserve pit would be fenced on three sides during drilling operations
and on the fourth side when the rig moves off the location. On producing wells, the reserve pit would be
reclaimed per the requirements specified in the approved APD. Reserve pits may be re-used for multiple
wells being drilled from a single pad. Although not specified in the Operators’ Plan of Development, the
use of closed-loop drilling systems that allow for reuse of drilling fluid and remove the need for a reserve
pit may be implemented.
Drilling operations require approximately 8 to 10 personnel and six vehicles on location at any given time
each day during normal operations. An additional 10 to 15 personnel and six vehicles would be required
on location during the running and cementing of production casing. A cementing plan is submitted with
the drilling plan as part of the Application for Permit to Drill (APD). This plan is reviewed by the BLM
and/or the WOGCC.
When production casing has been cemented in place, completion operations would begin. In general,
completion consists of perforating the production casing, pressure testing, stimulation of the formation
utilizing hydraulic fracturing technology, flow-back of fracturing fluids, flow testing to determine postfracture productivity, and installation of production equipment to facilitate hydrocarbon sales.
Hydraulic fracture stimulation is required on the majority of wells in the project area during completion
operations in order to enhance productivity. Combinations of fluids and proppants are pumped down the
well bore through the perforations in the casing, and into the formation to optimize stimulation. One
common stimulation technique utilizes gelled fresh water (with CO2 and/or N2 frequently added for
reservoir protection and enhanced flowback) and fracture proppants to provide bridging and increased
permeability. Sand, resin-coated sand, ceramics, or bauxite can be used as proppants. Gels and other
chemical additives provide fluid viscosity. Sufficient rate and pressure are reached to induce a fracture in
the target formation. The proppant carried in the fluid serves as a bridge to keep the created fracture open
and to provide a flow path that allows reservoir fluids to move more readily into the well bore. Water
used for stimulation purposes generally comes from water supply wells. Stimulation fluids recovered
during flow back and subsequent production operations are temporarily contained in the completion,
flare, or reserve pit. As discussed under Drilling Operations in Section 4.4.4.1, the hydraulic fracturing
process is currently being regulated or is being evaluated by the EPA, the BLM, and the WOGCC.

In May of 2012, the BLM proposed a new rule under 43 CFR Part 3160 (BLM 2012a) to regulate
hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian lands. The rule would (1) provide disclosure to the public of
chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on these lands, (2) strengthen regulations related to well bore
integrity, and (3) address management and storage of flowback water. In April of 2012, the EPA issued
final rules that include the first federal air quality standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically
fractured, along with requirements for several other sources of pollution in the oil and gas industry (EPA
2012a).
Completion and testing operations typically require approximately 10 to 20 (up to 30) days to perform, 2
to 30 personnel, and 1 to 20 vehicles on location. Approximately 4,000–12,000 bbls of water per well
would be needed for completion and testing operations. Drilling and completion activities together would
require 24,000-42,000 bbls of water per well.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-3

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

2.2.1.3

Production Facilities

Production facilities on the well pad would typically include wellhead valves and piping, separation,
dehydration, metering equipment, oil and water production tanks, a methanol storage tank and pump, and
telemetry equipment. Production equipment would be fueled by natural gas or electricity. Telemetry
equipment is currently used or planned for use by most Operators to improve well evaluation and
operational efficiency, and to minimize well visits. Production pits would not be used. Well-site
compression could be utilized on an as-needed basis. Buried natural gas gathering lines would be installed
to transport produced gas from new wells to the existing gas-gathering pipeline system. The Operators
would continue to use existing natural gas transmission pipelines that serve the project area. New natural
gas transmission pipelines are not included as a component of the proposed project.
The project may also include the development of an overhead electrical system to provide commercial
power to portions of the field, as well as lower-voltage, buried power utilities to individual well pads. The
overhead system is estimated to include approximately 36 miles of line.
2.2.1.4

Pipelines

The Operators would use existing natural gas transmission lines that serve the project area. Operators are
not responsible for the construction or operation of gas transmission lines, and new transmission lines are
not included as a component of the CD-C project.
Gathering lines would be installed below the surface to transport the produced gas from the new wells to
the gas gathering pipeline system. The gas production lines would be located adjacent and parallel to well
access roads where possible to minimize surface disturbance. New pipelines would cross federal, state,
and private surfaces in a route developed to minimize both resource conflicts and development costs.
Pipeline construction consists of trenching, pipe stringing, bending, welding, coating, lowering pipeline
sections into the trench, and backfilling. In general, construction widths would be 50 to 75 feet when not
adjacent to a road and 25 to 50 feet when adjacent to an existing or new road. Newly constructed
pipelines would be hydrostatically tested to ensure structural integrity. As an example of water
requirements, approximately 2,700 gallons of water would be required to test one mile of four-inch
pipeline. Hydrostatic test water would be disposed of as approved by the BLM and/or the State.
2.2.1.5

Compression, Gas Treatment, and Ancillary Facilities

Because the existing compression infrastructure in the project area would not provide sufficient capacity
to compress the additional gas volumes anticipated from the CD-C project, supplemental compression
would be required at various locations throughout the project area. An estimated 24,936 horsepower (hp)
of additional compression may be needed as the project is developed for dedicated compressor sites and at
well sites. The additional compressor sites, including a large central pipeline compression facility and
possibly some well-site compression, could add up to 60 acres of disturbance.
It is anticipated that one additional central gas-processing/stabilization facilities would be needed within
the project area, affecting up to 30 acres.
2.2.1.6

Produced-Water Disposal

Produced water from conventional natural gas production may be stored in tanks at the well site prior to
transport by water-hauling trucks or transported in flowlines to collection facilities for disposal. All
produced water disposal would be in accordance with applicable WOGCC and WDEQ requirements and
approved under BLM Sundry Notice, as appropriate. An estimated 30 new injection wells and 20
produced water handling facilities would be constructed to dispose of produced water. The Operators
have no plans for surface discharge of produced water. Conventional wells in the project area average 18
bbls/day of produced water. Produced water, condensate, and gas would be separated at the well site or at

2-4

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

central facilities. Depending on the method of disposal, permits are required from WDEQ-WQD (surface)
or WOGCC (subsurface) for disposal of produced water.
This document does not analyze the disposal of produced water from CBNG development. The volume of
water produced in CBNG development is typically and initially much greater than for conventional gas
production. CBNG-produced water might be stored onsite in a lined pit or storage tank, or watercollection lines might be installed to transport water to a water-treatment facility, evaporation ponds,
injection wells, subsurface drip areas and/or approved discharge points. The actual volumes produced and
the methods by which the produced-water would be managed are greatly dependent on the site-specific
development proposals, and it would be speculative for the BLM to analyze this aspect of CBNG
development in detail in this EIS. For that reason, this document does not contain any description of
produced-water disposal for CBNG development and does not analyze the impacts of such development.
When the BLM receives site-specific CBNG proposals in the CD-C project area, those proposals,
including their produced water treatment, will be analyzed in a future NEPA document.
Interim reclamation on well pads and roads would begin as soon as possible after the well is put into
production. The reserve pit, that portion of the well location and access road not needed for production
operations, and pipeline corridors would be reclaimed according to the requirements specified in the
approved APDs. Well pads and roads would be reclaimed and reseeded back to the minimum size
required.
When production at a well site is completed, the Operators would cut off the casing three feet below the
final graded ground level and cap it. All surface equipment would be removed from the site and the
surface would be recontoured to its original appearance, to the extent possible. Topsoil would be
distributed over the location to blend the site in with its natural surroundings. All surface disturbance
would then be planted with an appropriate seed mixture. Reclaimed sites would be monitored to ensure
erosion is prevented and/or controlled and the desired plant species are being re-established. Monitoring
would continue until the reclamation is deemed successful.
2.2.1.7

Operator-Committed Practices

Plan of Development. The Operators’ Plan of Development indicates that they would adhere to all lease
and APD conditions, as well as all federal and state laws, regulations, and policies implemented through
statute and/or resource management planning decisions implemented through NEPA. The Operators
specifically cite BLM Instruction Memorandum No. 2004-194, Integration of Best Management Practices
into Application for Permit to Drill Approvals and Associated Rights-of-Way, and note that Best
Management Practices (BMPs) to be considered in nearly all circumstances include the following:






Interim reclamation of well locations and access roads soon after the well is put into production;
Painting of all new facilities a color which best allows the facility to blend with the background,
typically a vegetated background;
Design and construction of all new roads to a safe and appropriate standard, “no higher than
necessary” to accommodate their intended use; and
Final reclamation recontouring of all disturbed areas, including access roads, to the original contour
or a contour that blends with the surrounding topography.
The Operators commit to performing these environmental protection measures during the
implementation of their proposed project. Appendix C includes a summary description of the
BMPs and APD COAs typically used by the BLM in the Rawlins Field Office to implement the
federal laws, regulations, and policy aimed at mitigating environmental impacts.

Air Quality. During preliminary near-field air dispersion modeling analyses of CD-C project emissions
it was apparent that the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration impacts were above the 1-hour NO2
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for modeling scenarios that included drill rig

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-5

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

engines with Tier 0 emissions levels, and it was necessary to consider drill rig engines with at least Tier
2 emissions levels in order to demonstrate compliance with the 1-hour NO2 NAAQS. Therefore the CD­
C Operators committed to using a minimum of Tier 2 drill rig engines for drilling operations. This
commitment will be included and become enforceable in the Record of Decision.
2.2.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Although not stated explicitly, the Operators’ Proposed Action assumes a substantial amount of
directional drilling. Approximately 42 percent of the 8,950 wells to be drilled would be located on
multiple-well pads and drilled to the target formation directionally; the other 58 percent would be located
on single-well pads and drilled vertically. The estimated surface disturbance that would result from the
Proposed Action would be reduced because of the directional drilling. However, the proposal contains no
commitment on the part of individual Operators or the group as a whole to implement that amount of
directional drilling. The directional drilling included in the proposal is tied to the current plans of
individual Operators and could change as Operators, leaseholders, or conditions change.
In order to examine the possibility that all 8,950 wells would be drilled from single-well pads, the BLM
developed Alternative A, with 100-percent vertical drilling. All other elements of the CD-C project would
remain as described in the Proposed Action. With the assumption of 100-percent vertical drilling, the
estimated surface disturbance is increased by 31 percent, from a project total of 47,200 acres to 61,696
acres.
Table 2.4-1 shows the estimated surface disturbance for this alternative along with the Proposed Action
and the other alternatives.
2.2.3

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Environmental protection and mitigation of environmental impacts are important aspects of the BLM’s
management of natural gas development on public lands. The RFO has a suite of basic protections that are
used to minimize the effects on resources. Restrictions and limitations called for by the Approved
Rawlins Resource Management Plan (RMP) are imposed prior to development activities. Additionally, a
number of standard operating procedures and Best Management Practices are implemented as needed.
These are described below and throughout the description of Alternative B as Basic Protections. The
premise of the Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative is that intensive natural gas development may
increase the risk of adverse impact for some resources and thus those resources may require protections
and mitigation beyond the Basic Protections. This alternative identifies the resources that may be more at
risk from natural gas development and the Enhanced Resource Protections that would be implemented
for these resources, which include enhanced protections and mitigation.
The alternative also recognizes that future development may be more intensive than currently expected or
may have unintended consequences, resulting in impacts on wildlife habitats and populations in areas that
were not anticipated or impacts that occur at a faster pace than anticipated. For that reason, the alternative
describes disturbance and population thresholds that, if crossed, would signal the need for still more
protections and mitigation. The thresholds are described below and throughout the alternative description
as Surface Disturbance Thresholds and Population Thresholds.
The resources that would receive enhanced protection under this alternative are:

Chain Lakes alkaline wetland communities and other playas; and
Livestock grazing.

Basic Protections
Most of the above resources already have protective measures specified in the RMP or applied as standard
operating procedures. Such measures would apply to oil and gas operations within the CD-C project area
under all alternatives. These Basic Protections are described below in each section for the resources
receiving enhanced protections as a reminder that these requirements apply at all times regardless of
alternative. For example, no activity is permitted within 0.25 mile of the perimeter of an occupied sagegrouse lek year-round. During the sage-grouse nesting/early brood-rearing season, March 1 – July 15, no
activity is permitted within all identified sage-grouse habitat. Other RMP measures are provided in
detailed guidelines for resource management such as those found in RMP Appendix 11 – Water Quality
and Watershed Management.
Standard operating procedures for resource protection can be found in Conditions of Approval (COAs)
placed on an APD or in terms and conditions placed on a right-of-way grant (see Appendix C). In
addition to items aimed at minimizing soil and water erosion and promoting successful reclamation, those
measures may include such things as pre-disturbance surveys, consultation on facility location, signage,
and constraints on traffic.
Recently, interim conservation measures for sage-grouse have been proposed by Wyoming BLM
Instruction Memorandum (IM) WY-2012-019 (February 10, 2012), which provides new statewide
measures for protection of greater sage-grouse habitat. The IM provides interim program direction
consistent with Washington Office IM No. 2012-043 until BLM Wyoming's effort to evaluate effective
greater sage-grouse conservation measures through amendment of RMPs is completed. The protective
measures identified in the IMs referenced above, or their functional equivalents, were analyzed within the
range of alternatives.
Enhanced Resource Protections
Alternative B builds on the basic protections that are currently in effect in the project area, expanding the
scale of some measures or adding new measures. An example of an expanded measure is increasing the
avoidance zone around the Chain Lakes wetlands and other playas from 500 feet to 0.25 mile. Examples
of new measures are burying new power lines within 1 mile of an occupied lek or in winter concentration
areas, and extending the current monitoring program in Upper Muddy Creek to Lower Muddy Creek.
Specific expanded resource protections are described for each of the high-value resources but several
general protections apply to all. Three of these are:
1. Uniform application of dust-abatement procedures during construction and drilling operations yearround and seasonally, as needed, on well sites, pipelines, and collector and well access roads.
2. Environmental awareness training during orientation for all employees and subcontractors,
including information about native wildlife, sensitivity to various kinds of impacts, Wyoming
wildlife laws, etc.
3. BLM will require remote monitoring at well pads when a surface disturbance threshold of 5 percent
is reached for the resources that have that threshold.
In addition, Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs) that would affect any of the described resources
except livestock forage would be submitted with an overall development plan. The development plan
would be submitted either for an individual lease or several leases. It should aim at reducing surface
disturbance and disturbance associated with vehicle traffic and other human activity and should include,
at a minimum:


Consideration of cluster development of production facilities;

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES









A road system that minimizes construction of new roads;
Individual road design that minimizes surface disturbance while still meeting safe standards for the
intended use;
Reconstruction of access roads to a lower standard once drilling is completed and the operation
phase has begun;
Reclaiming of all but one road once production starts if more than one road is built within the lease;
A travel plan that minimizes vehicular traffic for monitoring and servicing wells and other facilities
and that includes closures and/or time-of-day restrictions for production roads during the winter
season;
Consideration of pipelines for transporting liquids offsite or installation of larger-capacity storage
tanks to reduce the number of truck trips to well sites; and
A snow-removal plan to ensure protection of resources.

Plans for development within the entire Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds should include, at a
minimum, the following additional road/pipeline requirements:






Detailed development, transportation, and reclamation plans, including road design, culvert
placement, steep slopes, etc.;
Design of improvements to existing roads or construction of new roads to minimize hydrologic
alteration;
No new road crossings of Muddy Creek;
Development of specific road design criteria based upon site-specific review and likely including a
combination of mitigation options; and
Submission of data from inspections of erosion control BMP’s within the Muddy Creek and Bitter
Creek watersheds would be required. The format and frequency of submission of these data would
be coordinated with the BLM and could use the same information collected under the Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) or other BLM-approved monitoring method.

Surface Disturbance Thresholds
There may be instances in the future where natural gas development is even more intense locally than
currently anticipated or where the overall impacts are greater than expected. In such cases, the Enhanced
Resource Protection Alternative includes surface disturbance thresholds for five of the seven high-value
resources: mule deer crucial winter/yearlong range and migration corridors; pronghorn antelope crucial
winter/yearlong range and migration corridors; greater sage-grouse lek, nesting/brood-rearing habitat, and
winter concentration areas; ferruginous hawk nests; and livestock grazing.
Generally, two threshold levels are specified:3
 A lower level, usually 5 percent of protected habitat within a lease and/or right-of-way, that signals
a potential problem and mandates an evaluation of reclamation success. If reclamation success is
limited, a revised plan would be required to address the failings. The initial level also calls for an
assessment of the disturbance to determine if mitigation is needed. If it is, APDs will not be
processed or approved until the BLM has received and approved a mitigation plan that will
effectively mitigate the impact to the affected resource.

3

The 5% and 10% thresholds rely on WGFD guidance on mitigating oil and gas development and its references to High and
Extreme impacts on habitat. High is generally referred to as 20-60 acres of disturbance within a section, and 5% is a proxy for that
(640 acres X .05 = 32 acres); Extreme is 60 acres or more per section and 10% is a proxy for that (640 acres X .10 = 64 acres).
Percentages have more utility than absolute figures when areas less than or larger than a section are under discussion.

2-8

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES


A higher threshold level, usually 10 percent of protected habitat within a lease, would require
habitat improvement projects in addition to the above requirements.

Disturbance that is counted against the threshold includes all disturbance, both current and pre-existing,
that is associated with natural gas access roads, pipelines, well pads, or other facilities that serve the
Operator’s lease and off-lease rights-of-way on adjacent BLM lands that also service the lease. Rights-of­
way that cross a lease but service other Operators’ leases would not count in the percentage calculation.
The details of the surface disturbance thresholds for each of the five resources are described in the
sections below.
Population Thresholds
Additionally, there are population thresholds for four resources: mule deer crucial winter/yearlong range
and migration corridors; pronghorn antelope crucial winter/yearlong range and migration corridors;
greater sage-grouse lek, nesting/brood-rearing habitat, and winter concentration areas; and ferruginous
hawk nests and potential nesting substrate. If the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) were to
express formal written concern that a species population within the project area were declining at an
accelerated rate compared to the rest of the population, a technical team would be assembled to prepare a
mitigation plan as described above. APDs would not be processed or approved until the BLM has
received and approved a mitigation plan that will effectively mitigate the impact to the affected resource.
The plan would include, but not be limited to:





Evaluation of reclamation success and a request that the Operator provide a revised reclamation
plan to address any failed reclamation.
Implementation of BLM-approved habitat-improvement projects such as water developments or
vegetation treatments. (The BLM may coordinate habitat improvement projects among multiple
Operators.) New well pads would not be authorized without Operator participation in habitatimprovement projects.
Limitation of the number of well pads per section to maintain habitat effectiveness.

The preferred mitigation would be site-specific. If a species status were to change in the future, additional
data, especially seasonal habitat use and condition data, would be collected and additional protective
measures would be developed.
2.2.3.1

Pronghorn Antelope and Mule Deer

Area of Concern: Pronghorn Antelope Crucial Winter Range/Yearlong Range (referred to as “CWR” in
the description of this alternative) and Migration Corridors (Map 3.8-2) and Mule Deer Crucial Winter
and Crucial Winter/Yearlong Range (also referred to as “CWR”) and Migration Corridors (Map 3.8-4).
Basic Protections:
RMP Requirements
 Seasonal restrictions on construction, drilling, and other activities from November 15 – April 30.
 Disruptive activities within big game crucial winter range would require the use of BMPs designed
to reduce the amount of human presence and activity during the winter months (Appendix 15 of the
ROD).
 Surface-disturbing and disruptive activities would be managed on a case-by-case basis in identified
big game migration and transitional ranges to maintain their integrity and function.
 Fences identified to be a problem for big game migration would be modified to meet BLM fence
standards. New fences would be allowed in big game migration corridors, provided they meet BLM
fence standards.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-9

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES


Standard site-specific requirements
 Appendix 15 of the RMP includes other BMPs that can be considered to reduce impacts from gas
development, some of which are included as requirements in this alternative (e.g., remote well
monitoring).
Enhanced Resource Protections:
 Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs) within mule deer or pronghorn antelope crucial winter or
crucial winter/yearlong range and migration corridors would be submitted as part of an overall
development plan for an entire lease or several leases. The plan is described above under the general
requirements for the alternative.
In addition, the following requirements would be implemented throughout mule deer and pronghorn
antelope crucial winter range or crucial winter/yearlong range and migration corridors:
 Man camps would be prohibited on BLM land;
 Noise-reduction technology, such as hospital grade mufflers, sound walls or soundproof buildings,
or adding silencers to cooling fans, would be required at compressor stations; and
 Migration corridors would be monitored to determine which fences restrict movement and fences
modified to reduce impacts to migrating big game species.
Surface Disturbance Thresholds:
When surface disturbance for natural gas access roads, pipelines, well pads or other facilities exceeds 5
percent of pronghorn antelope or mule deer CWR and migration corridors within a lease, BLM would:





Evaluate reclamation success in the lease and review, approve and oversee the implementation of an
Operators’ revised reclamation plan to ensure it addresses the reason for the failed reclamation. The
calculated percentage disturbance would be adjusted downward for successful interim reclamation.
Conduct an assessment of the disturbance and determine if enhancement of CWR is needed at this
time. If so, begin implementation.
Require installation of remote monitoring at all well pads.

If surface disturbance reached 10 percent of pronghorn or mule deer CWR and migration corridors in a
lease, habitat improvement projects would be required in addition to the requirements above. The BLM
would establish an interagency CD-C working group and consult with them to determine which projects
would be beneficial. These projects could include, but would not be limited to:



Water developments.
Vegetation treatments such as herbicide treatments, seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping
for regeneration, planting shrubs or trees, fencing, establishing food plots, etc.

Population Thresholds:
Mule deer and pronghorn antelope in the project area are managed by the WGFD on a Herd Unit basis.
Three mule deer Herd Units overlap the project area (Map 3.8-3). The resource of concern in this
alternative for mule deer is CWR and migration corridors which only occur in the project area within the
Baggs Herd Unit (Map 3.8-3). In 2010, the Baggs herd population was estimated at 22,000 animals,
which is well above the WGFD population objective of 18,700 (Table 3.8-1). The project area includes
less than 25 percent of the total Baggs Herd Unit acreage and only 6.3 percent of the crucial winter range
and crucial winter/yearlong range.
For pronghorn, there are also three Herd Units that overlap the project area (Map 3.8-1). The Baggs and
Red Desert Herd Units each contain a portion of pronghorn CWR. Migration corridors are found in all
three units. The Red Desert Herd Unit’s CWR lies north of I-80 along the majority of its route across the
project area. The CWR for the Baggs and Bitter Creek Herd Units is adjacent to WY 789 in the
southeastern portion of the project area (Map 3.8-1), overlapping the majority of the mule deer CWR.

2-10

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

Aerial surveys of the three Herd Units are done on a rotating basis, typically every two to three years. All
three of the Herd Units are much larger than the portion within the project area; 26 percent of the Red
Desert Herd Unit, 23 percent of the Bitter Creek Herd Unit, and 9 percent of the Baggs Herd Unit lie
within the project area. Only 16 percent of the combined CWR for these Herd Units occurs in the CD-C
project area.
If the WGFD were to express formal written concern that any of the herds within the project area was
declining at an accelerated rate, all new APDs on leases within mule deer and pronghorn antelope CWR
in the CD-C project area would require an approved mitigation plan if the population decrease in those
Herd Units were attributable in whole or in part to oil and gas development. The plan would include, but
not be limited to:






Evaluation of reclamation success in the lease and review, approve and oversee the implementation
of an Operators’ revised reclamation plan to ensure it addresses the reason for the failed
reclamation.
Implementation of BLM-approved habitat-improvement projects such as water developments or
vegetation treatments. (BLM may coordinate habitat improvement projects among multiple
Operators.) New well pads would not be authorized without Operator participation in habitatimprovement projects in the affected Herd Unit.
Limitation of the number of well pads to no more than four per section within CWR to maintain
habitat effectiveness.

If the population status of a species were to change in the future, additional data would be collected and
additional protective measures would be developed.
2.2.3.2

Greater Sage-Grouse

Area of Concern: Greater sage-grouse lek, nesting/brood-rearing habitat (Map 3.9-2), and winter
concentration areas occur throughout the project area. Protections for the small parts of the project area
that are within sage-grouse core areas (Map 3.9-2), for which IM WY-2012-019 (February 10, 2012)
prescribes more stringent protections, are described separately. In addition, the BLM has entered into an
effort to revise all RMPs to address sage-grouse conservation efforts. As this process unfolds and the
RFO RMP amendment is finalized, the requirements for sage-grouse conservation in the RFO may
change from the current condition. The Wyoming Core Area strategy (SWED 2011) applies to all
activities, proposed in a designated core area, that require a permit from any State of Wyoming regulatory
agency. The Wyoming conservation strategy for greater sage-grouse continues to evolve and the
requirements that would be applied to proposed activities in all seasonal sage-grouse habitats will change
as the strategy changes.
Basic Protections:


RMP Requirements:
o Surface-disturbing activities or occupancy are prohibited on and within 0.25 mile of the
perimeter of an occupied (or undetermined) greater sage-grouse lek. In addition, disruptive
activities are prohibited between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. from March 1 to May 20 on and
within 0.25 mile of the perimeter of an occupied greater sage-grouse lek. (Disruptive activities
are those that would require people and/or the activity to be in nesting habitats for a duration of
1 hour or more during a 24-hour period.[IM WY-2010-029])
o Avoid surface-disturbing and/or disruptive activities in all identified nesting and early broodrearing habitat from March 1 to July 15.
o Authorization of high-profile structures would be granted on a case-by-case basis from within
0.25 to 1 mile of the perimeter of an occupied sage-grouse lek.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-11

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

o


Surface disturbing and other activities potentially disruptive to delineated greater sage-grouse
winter concentration areas are prohibited during the period of November 15 to March 14.

IM WY-2012-019 Requirements summarized:
o West Nile Virus - Artificial water impoundments would be managed to the extent of BLM’s
authority to prevent the spread of West Nile virus where the virus poses a threat to sage-grouse.
(See specific provisions in the IM.)
o Timing and Distance Restrictions Within Core Areas
- Surface occupancy and/or disruptive activities are prohibited on or within 0.6 mile of the
perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks.
- Surface-disturbing and/or disruptive activities are prohibited or restricted from March 15 to
June 304 within all suitable sage-grouse nesting and early brood-rearing habitat.
- Surface-disturbing and/or disruptive activities in delineated sage-grouse winter
concentration areas are prohibited from December 1 to March 14 to protect core
populations of sage-grouse that use these winter concentration habitats. Not all these
WCAs that support core area populations, are located within current core area boundaries.
o

Timing and Distance Restrictions Outside Core Areas
- Surface occupancy and/or disruptive activities are prohibited on or within a 0.25 mile
radius of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks.

o

Density and Disturbance Within Core Areas
- For authorization of new proposed actions within sage-grouse core areas, including where
there are valid existing rights, the BLM will consider an alternative that would limit
activities to an average of no more than one oil and gas or mining location per 640 acres
and an average of no more than 5 percent habitat disturbance (related to all programs or
applicable sources of “disturbance” using the SGEO [Greater Sage-grouse Core Area
Protection Program] Disturbance Density Calculation Tool). In addition, the BLM has
entered into an effort to revise all RMPs to address sage-grouse conservation efforts. As
this process unfolds and the RFO RMP amendment is finalized, the requirements for sagegrouse conservation in the RFO will change from the current condition.



Noise – The BLM will work with Operators to limit noise where it could reduce functionality of
habitats that support core area populations. The BLM will evaluate limitation of new noise sources
on a case-by-case basis. The BLM’s near-term goal is to limit noise sources that would negatively
impact core area sage-grouse populations and to support the establishment of ambient baseline noise
levels for occupied core area leks.



Standard site-specific requirements – Appendix 15 of the RMP includes other BMPs that can be
considered to reduce impacts from gas development, some of which are included as requirements in
this alternative, e.g., remote well monitoring.

Enhanced Resource Protections:
Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs) within greater sage-grouse lek, nesting/brood-rearing habitat, and
winter concentration areas would be submitted as part of an overall development plan for an entire lease
or several leases. The plan is described previously in the general requirements portion of the alternative.
In addition, the following requirements would be implemented throughout sage-grouse habitat:

4

IM WY-2012-019 allows for the Governor’s Executive Order Timing Restriction (March 15-June 30) to be expanded by up to 14
days prior to or subsequent to these dates where credible data support different timeframes.




Burying new power lines and using low-profile facilities within 1 mile of an occupied lek or in
winter concentration areas;
Use of noise-reduction technology so that noise would not exceed 49 decibels measured at 30 feet
from the source at all drilling, production and compressor sites;
No more than one oil and gas or mining location per 640 acres and no more than 5 percent habitat
disturbance (related to all programs or applicable sources of disturbance).
Surface Disturbance Thresholds:

The BLM has authority to apply a number of protective measures to minimize impacts upon sage-grouse
and their habitat. This surface disturbance threshold requires that certain of those measures go into effect
on a lease if surface disturbance for natural gas roads, pipelines, well pads or other facilities has exceeded
5 percent of non-core sage-grouse lek, nesting/early brood-rearing habitat, or winter concentration areas
in a lease or right-of-way or one oil and gas or mining location per 640 acres within core areas, the BLM
would:


Require remote well-monitoring at all well pads;
 Evaluate reclamation success in the section and request from the Operator a revised reclamation
plan to address any failed reclamation. The calculated percentage disturbance would be adjusted
downward for successful interim reclamation.
 Conduct an assessment of the disturbance and determine if enhancement of sage-grouse habitat is
needed at that time. If so, begin implementation.
If surface disturbance were to reach 10 percent or 2 oil and gas or mining locations per 640 acres of
non-core sage-grouse lek, nesting/early brood-rearing habitat, or winter concentration areas in a lease,
habitat improvement projects would be required. Projects could include, but would not be limited to:
 Vegetation treatments such as fertilization, seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping for
regeneration, planting shrubs, establishment of food plots, etc.
 Water developments.
Population Thresholds:
If WGFD were to express formal written concern that the population of sage-grouse is declining at an
accelerated rate, all Operators on public lands within sage-grouse lek, nesting/early brood-rearing habitat
or winter concentration areas would implement a mitigation package identified by BLM that would
include, but not be limited to:









Evaluation of reclamation success in the lease or right-of-way and a request to the Operator to
provide a revised reclamation plan to address any failed reclamation.
Vegetation treatments such as fertilization, seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping for
regeneration, planting shrubs, establishment of food plots, etc. (BLM may also coordinate habitat
improvement projects among multiple Operators.)
Timing and Distance Restrictions (Non-core areas to conform with core areas):
When the threshold is reached, surface-disturbing activity or surface occupancy would be prohibited
or restricted on or within a 0.6 mile of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks. In addition,
disruptive activities within 0.6 mile of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks are restricted
from 6:00 pm to 9:00 am from March 1 – May 15.
Avoid surface-disturbing and disruptive activities in suitable greater sage-grouse nesting and early
brood-rearing habitat within 2.5 miles of the perimeter of an occupied lek from March 15 – June 30.
Prohibition of surface-disturbing and disruptive activities within 0.5 mile of sage-grouse winter
concentration areas (non-core areas) from November 15 – March 14.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

Density Restrictions:
 Core Area APDs would be limited to the density disturbance calculation tool thresholds (see density
restrictions in IM 2012-019). When thresholds are exceeded BLM would work to collocate or
minimize disturbance for valid and existing rights.
 When the population threshold is reached in non-core areas, strive to maintain <3 pads per square
mile within 2 miles of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks
 If the population status of the species changes in the future, additional data would be collected and
additional protection measures would be developed.
2.2.3.3

Ferruginous Hawks

Area of Concern: Nests and potential nesting substrate (Map 3.8-8)
Basic Protections:




RMP Requirements:
o No disturbance within 1,200 feet of a ferruginous hawk nest. The distances could vary
depending on factors such as nest activity, species, natural topographic barriers and line-of-sight
distances.
o Seasonal restriction from March 1 – July 31 within 1 mile of a ferruginous hawk nest.
Standard site-specific requirements:
o Surveys of previous active ferruginous hawk nests to determine if they are in use that season.
Lack of occupancy by a certain date could shorten the seasonal restriction.
o If drilling activity within the seasonal distance restriction were started prior to the nesting period
and a ferruginous hawk started utilizing a nest, additional mitigation as determined by the BLM
could be required. This mitigation could include, but would not be limited to:
- education sessions for employees regarding avoidance of the nest;
- reducing speeds and being aware of foraging raptors;
- utilization of alternate access routes to the well that are further away from the nest, etc.

Enhanced Resource Alternative Protections:
No additional protections would apply to ferruginous hawk nests and potential nesting substrate unless
one of the thresholds described below were reached.
Surface Disturbance Threshold:
Operators in all leases that exceed 10 percent of surface disturbance within 1 mile of ferruginous hawk
nests would be required to participate in a development/mitigation plan before additional APDs would be
issued.
Population Thresholds:
If WGFD were to express formal written concern about the ferruginous hawk population, the following
mitigation measures would be implemented immediately:
1. All existing development features and facilities (pads, pipelines, roads, holding yards, compressor
stations, etc.) within 1 mile of ferruginous hawk nests would be inspected to determine
reclamation success. If reclamation has been unsuccessful, measures would be taken to improve the
reclamation of the facilities.

2. Ten man-made5 nests would be built outside of existing monitoring territories on natural substrates,
and farther than 1,200 feet from existing disturbances, prior to January 10th of the year following
receipt of WGFD’s letter of concern.
a. The farther the nest is constructed from existing disturbances the better; nest placement would
take into consideration potential conflicts with sage-grouse seasonal habitat use of the area.
b. These nests would be incorporated into the annual monitoring efforts.
c. Controlled Surface Use and Timing Limitation stipulations would be applied to any nests that
become occupied by raptors.
3. Two artificial nesting structures 6 would be placed outside of existing monitoring territories, and
farther than 1,200 feet from existing disturbances, prior to January 10th of the year following. receipt
of WGFD’s letter of concern.
a. Priority for placement of these nests would be determined based on information regarding
extant nests located on man-made infrastructure, or where there are known repeated attempts at
nesting on man-made infrastructure; nest placement would take into consideration potential
conflicts with sage-grouse seasonal habitat use of the area.
b. These nests would be incorporated into the annual monitoring efforts.
c. Controlled Surface Use and Timing Limitation stipulations would be applied to any nests that
become occupied by raptors.
If the species population continues to decline, additional data would be collected and additional protection
measures would be developed.
2.2.3.4

Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek Corridors/Watersheds

Area of Concern: Muddy Creek (including the Red Wash/Muddy Creek Sensitive Fish Habitat), and the
Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds for water quality (salinity, selenium, and 303d listed waters),
aquatic physical habitats, and sensitive fish habitat (Map 3.9-5).
Basic Protections:


RMP Requirements:
o For protection of amphibians and their habitats, avoidance of surface-disturbing and disruptive
activities within 500 feet of perennial waters, springs, wells and wetlands, and areas within 100
feet of the inner gorge of ephemeral channels.
o Design of road crossings of water bodies that potentially support fish for a portion of the year to
simulate natural stream processes.
o Design of impoundments and instream structures to minimize impacts on Special Status fish
species and their habitats.
o Intensive management of surface-disturbing activities within those portions of the Muddy Creek
drainage that contribute to degradation of reaches previously or currently on the 303d list.
o All basic watershed protections in Section 2.3.16, Water Quality, Watershed, and Soils
Management, and Appendix 13, Reducing Nonpoint Source Pollution with Best Management
Practices, of the RMP ROD.



Standard site-specific requirements:

5

Man-made nests are nests that are built in appropriate habitat and are intended to attract ferruginous hawks.

6

Artificial nesting structures are built to attract hawks that would build their own nest on the structure.

o

Maintenance of existing roads to ensure they are not contributing sediment to Muddy Creek or
adjacent wetlands.
Boring of all pipeline crossings of riparian areas.
Appendices 13 and 15 of the RMP include several BMPs that can be considered to reduce
impacts from gas development, a number of which are included as requirements in this
alternative.

Enhanced Resource Alternative Protections:







For protection of amphibians and their habitats, avoidance of surface-disturbing and disruptive
activities within 0.25 mile of Red Wash, springs, wells, and wetlands. The required avoidance
distance would be further increased on perennial streams to 0.5 mile. Exceptions would only be
granted by the BLM based on environmental analysis and site-specific engineering and mitigation
plans. Only actions within areas that could not be avoided and that would provide protection for the
resource identified would be approved. In-channel activities would be restricted to the low-flow
period.
Current monitoring on upper Muddy Creek would be extended to Lower Muddy Creek in the CD-C
area. This requirement would bring lower Muddy Creek into conformance with the monitoring
being done for upper Muddy Creek and other drainages within the Atlantic Rim project area. If
results of the monitoring program showed impacts to sensitive fish habitat, the BLM and an
interagency CD-C consultation group would determine whether habitat-improvement projects
should be implemented. The projects could include, but would not be limited to: increasing the
number of drainage features along roads, increasing in-stream cover for fish, etc.
A monitoring plan for Bitter Creek watershed will be designed by the RFO.
A risk level analysis will be conducted for the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds using the
existing Rosgen 2008 WARSS process and data to determine the risk of additional sedimentation.
This will permit identification of areas of high erosion potential.

The following requirements related to selenium and salinity for well locations and operations would also
be implemented:



No surface discharge of produced waters within the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds.
Line all reserve pits in the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds with BLM-approved
materials.

2.2.3.5

Chain Lakes Alkaline Wetland Communities and Other Playas

Area of Concern: Chain Lakes Alkaline Wetlands and other playas
Basic Protections:




Livestock Grazing

Area of Concern: Public land grazing allotments (Map 3.18-1)
Basic Protections:



RMP Requirements – Wyoming Standards and Guidelines for Rangeland Health.
Standard site-specific requirements – Immediate repair of any damages to existing range
improvements, fences, cattleguards, gates, etc. caused by natural-gas operations, with such repairs
to be made by the natural-gas Operators in consultation with the grazing permittee.

Enhanced Resource Alternative Protections:








Mitigation of impacts on existing livestock water features such that there would be no adverse
effects on water availability, water quality, or livestock management (trailing routes, fencing, etc.);
mitigation of impacts on water wells, springs, or surface water improvements by new water well
development. If water features are adversely affected by activities of natural gas Operators, the
Operators would be responsible for drilling, maintaining, and monitoring new stock water wells
and/or improving existing water wells, as determined by BLM and the grazing permittees.
Annual meetings conducted by BLM with Operators and grazing permittees to discuss projectspecific impacts and required mitigation. Natural gas Operators will describe their proposed drilling
and maintenance schedules during these meetings.
When APDs are submitted to BLM, notification of the affected grazing permittees and provision to
permittees of a map showing the location of new well pads and access roads.
Thorough power-washing by Operators of all field vehicles—particularly their undercarriages—
before entering the project area or when moving from one part of the project area to another.
During the production phase, as well as the construction phase, control by Operators of fugitive dust
on well sites, pipelines, and access roads as needed.

Surface Disturbance Thresholds:
If the surface disturbance due to natural gas development were to reach 5 percent of an allotment, several
actions would be triggered (in this and later calculations, surface disturbance is used as a surrogate for
available forage):






A review of reclamation success in the allotment. If reclamation efforts had not achieved the
required standards, Operators would be required to submit a revised reclamation plan for achieving
reclamation success and begin implementing that plan.
Planning for future natural gas development to avoid critical grazing areas (i.e. calving grounds,
trailing routes, and identified summer and winter grounds), range improvements, and other
important livestock areas.
If planning were to identify the need for rangeland improvement projects, BLM would begin
planning such projects in consultation with the grazing permittee and the Operators, and may begin
implementing the projects, as warranted. Rangeland improvement projects with allotment-wide
benefits could involve participation of all Operators within the allotment.

If the amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance due to natural gas development were to reach 8 percent
of an allotment, the BLM would require that mitigation be implemented to avoid reaching the designated
RMP significance criterion of a permanent 10-percent reduction in AUMs available for livestock grazing
within the allotment. The type of mitigation would be determined by the BLM in concert with the grazing
permittee and could include, but would not be limited to, the following:


Construction of temporary fencing when necessary in order to protect reseeded areas and other
fragile areas.

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES





2.2.4

Construction of temporary or permanent fences to create pastures to improve livestock distribution
and/or minimize livestock and vehicle collisions (all fences would comply with BLM fence
construction regulations).
Water development projects to distribute livestock, when consistent with the RMP.
Vegetation treatment projects to increase and improve forage for livestock.
Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap—High and Low Density Development
Areas

This alternative designates parts of the project area as high-density development areas—those areas that
have seen the greatest natural gas development to date (Map 2-1). Within the high-density development
areas, a 60-acre cap would be placed on the amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance at any one time in
a section of public land or federal mineral estate. For the remainder of the project area—the low-density
development areas—the cap would be 30 acres per section. The 60-acre cap represents the disturbance
associated with a 9-well per section drilling program (80-acre spacing) achieved with vertical wells only,
a typical development in the high-density area; a 30-acre cap represents the disturbance associated with a
16-well per section drilling program (40-acre spacing) achieved with directional drilling.
All prior surface disturbance committed to long-term use for roads or on-pad production facilities and all
disturbance that had not been successfully reclaimed would count against the cap. Acreage that had
successfully undergone interim reclamation would not count against the cap. For example, within a highdensity development area, a section that had seen 40 acres of historical disturbance for natural gas
development would start the development period with a reduced cap of 20 acres (60 acres less 40). Once
interim reclamation on the development was determined to be successful, the acreage reclaimed could be
rolled over, meaning counted again as undisturbed acreage, and the cap would be increased by the amount
of successful interim reclamation. If, for example, 24 acres of interim reclamation were judged to meet
the interim reclamation standard, it would be rolled over and the cap for that section would increase to 44
acres (20 acres plus 24). Only the 16 acres used for roads and production facilities would continue to
count against the cap.
If there had been no natural gas development in a section within the high-density development area, the
Operator would be able to develop the natural gas resources of that section until surface disturbance from
well pad, access road, and pipeline construction reached 60 acres. At that point, no further disturbance
could take place until acreage that had undergone interim reclamation had been determined to be
successfully reclaimed. Outside the high-density development areas, the same conditions and the same
process would apply, but the cap would be set at 30 acres.
Map 2-1 shows the high-density development and low-density development areas within the project area.
Of the 1,697 sections within the project area, 744 sections (about 44 percent) are within a high-density
development area. Average historic surface disturbance within the high-density development areas is 32.9
acres per section. The average number of wells per section is 5.1. Outside the high-density development
areas, the average disturbance is 4.5 acres per section; the average number of wells per section is 0.7.
Four hundred sections, about 24 percent, have had no development to date.
All public lands in the project area would be subject to the cap. Disturbance on private and state lands
would not count against the cap. The Operators would be required to update their reported disturbance
annually in order to certify the accumulated disturbance on their federal lease holdings to date and the
amount of interim reclamation that had occurred. Under the alternative, the BLM, either on its own or
using subcontractors hired by the Operators, would perform quality control on the reported data and
evaluate the reported interim reclamation and the success of that reclamation. The BLM would then
calculate net available surface disturbance under the cap for each section. As new drilling proposals were
received, they would be evaluated against the net available surface disturbance within the section where

2-18

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

the drilling was proposed. For oil and gas leases smaller than a section, the acreage cap would be adjusted
on a pro-rata basis.
All pre-existing and current surface disturbance associated with natural gas well pads, their access roads,
and gathering pipelines would count against the cap. Major natural gas processing and transmission
facilities would not count against the cap. In addition, federal, state, county, and local roads and
highways, railroads, and disturbances created by ranching operations would not count against the cap.
A central element of this alternative is the standard used to determine if interim reclamation efforts have
been successful and if the reclaimed acreage can be rolled over. The standards to be met for successful
final reclamation of surface disturbance on public lands are described in Appendix E: Reclamation,
which includes Appendix 36 of the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008b) and the Wyoming BLM Reclamation
Policy IM WY-2012-032. Final reclamation of a natural gas well site occurs after a well has completed
production and been plugged and abandoned. Appendix E also includes two other documents that apply
to interim reclamation and the concept of rollover: the Proposed Interim Rollover Objective for the CD-C
Natural Gas Project and the CD-C Rollover Criteria. These two documents would guide the evaluation of
reclamation under the Alternative C surface cap and set the standard for potential rollover of acreage that
had undergone interim reclamation. The Rollover Objective document provides guidance for how best to
achieve interim reclamation that can be rolled over. The CD-C Rollover Criteria document lays out the
standard that must be met if disturbed acreage is to be classified as successful interim reclamation.
Disturbed acreage that met the standards could then be deducted from the number of acres counted as
surface disturbance—that is, rolled over.
During the preparation of the Draft EIS, the State of Wyoming, local Conservation Districts, the
University of Wyoming, participating leaseholders, several CD-C operators, and the BLM developed
interim reclamation objectives (IRO). The purpose of the IRO is to identify when reconstruction and revegetation activities on disturbed lands are adequate for rollover credit. The objectives are to: establish
vegetation cover sufficient to maintain a healthy, biologically active topsoil; control erosion; minimize
loss of habitat, forage, and visual resources during the period of the disturbance; and control invasive non­
native weeds. The specific reclamation success standards for the IRO are as follows:






The area is revegetated with a stable, approved plant community.
Vegetative cover is sufficient to maintain a healthy, biologically active topsoil.
Erosion is controlled.
Habitat, visual, and forage loss is minimized.
No noxious weeds are present.

Reclamation of the disturbed surface would be monitored by the Operators. When an operator determined
that a disturbed site had attained the IRO, the operator would propose to the BLM the rollover of the
reclaimed acreage. If the BLM determined that the standards had been met, the acreage would be rolled
over. If the BLM determined that the standard had not been met, then the operator could attempt to
address the shortcomings of the reclamation and propose the acreage again at some time in the future. In
the event areas that had met the criteria and been rolled over were re-disturbed, the acreage re-disturbed
would again be counted against the cap.
Table 2.4-1 shows the estimated surface disturbance for this alternative along with the Proposed Action
and the other alternatives.

2.2.5

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

This alternative requires that all future natural gas wells on federal mineral estate be drilled from multiwell pads, which would require the employment of directional drilling technology. One new multi-well
pad per section (or per lease if the lease area is less than a section) would be permitted. In sections that
have already had oil and gas development, the enlargement of one existing well pad would be permitted
as the multi-well pad for all future drilling in that section. No new roads or pipeline routes on a lease
would be permitted. Proposals for access across federal lands for oil and gas development on adjacent
private and state parcels would still be considered as appropriate by the BLM.
In sections that have not had oil and gas development at all, one new well pad would be permitted for all
future development. One road and pipeline corridor per well would be permitted. Proposals for access
across federal lands for oil and gas development on adjacent private and state parcels would still be
considered as appropriate by the BLM. No numerical disturbance caps, no rollover credits, and no new
requirements on reclamation are part of this alternative.
The objective of this alternative is to minimize surface disturbance and to reduce habitat loss and wildlife
disruption. A reduction in the number of well pads and associated roads, pipelines, and other facilities
would result in less surface disturbance and thus reduce the amount of habitat directly lost. In addition,
multiple-well pads would be distributed less densely than single-well pads, reducing the habitat
fragmentation and ongoing disturbance created by the network of well-pad access roads.
Operators may request that an APD be excepted from the general rule. Examples of the types of
exceptions that would be considered include:






In sections that have already had some level of development, Operators may request that more than
one existing well pad be used as a multi-well pad. The Operator must establish that the drilling
objective cannot be achieved from any single well pad. In general, such requests would be
considered by BLM after one single-well pad had been enlarged and efforts had been made to
develop the entire section.
In sections that have not had prior development, Operators may request that more than one multiwell pad be constructed. The Operator must establish that the drilling objective cannot be achieved
from a single-well pad. In general, such requests would be considered by BLM after one multi-well
pad had been constructed and efforts had been made to develop the entire section.
Operators may request that road and pipeline routes be relocated. The request should demonstrate
how the relocation would reduce vehicle traffic and increase the efficiency of product
transportation.

It is expected that exception requests would largely be based on difficult surface conditions, topography,
subsurface geology, or fluid mineral resource characteristics that would make it impossible to maximize
the recovery of the gas resource in a lease. CBM proposals may well fall into an exception category.
Requests based on the need to produce in the most economic and efficient manner will be considered.
Table 2.4-1 shows the estimated surface disturbance for this alternative along with the Proposed Action
and the other alternatives.
2.2.6

Alternative E: No Action

NEPA regulations require that the EIS alternatives analysis “include the alternative of no action” (40
Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1502.14(d)). The No Action alternative does not respond to the
purpose and need for the Proposed Action. Rather, it serves as a baseline for comparing the Proposed
Action’s environmental effects (including cumulative effects) and it illustrates the consequences of not
meeting the need for the Proposed Action. Under the No Action alternative, no new Federal wells would

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-21

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

be approved for development as part of the Operators’ proposal to drill up to 8,950 wells on
approximately 1.1 million acres of federal, private, and state mineral estate. However, existing lease
rights granted by the BLM on federal lands or mineral estate would remain in effect. The BLM’s analysis
of the No Action alternative therefore assumes that previously authorized activities would continue but
that no new development on federal lands or mineral estate would occur under the Operators’
proposal. Previously authorized activities include approximately 14 pending APDs, 497 shut-in gas wells,
12 monitor wells, 530 plugged and abandoned wells, 3,292 producing gas wells, and 27 unapproved
APDs, totaling 4,372 wells within the CD-C project boundary as of September 2012 (WOGGC 2012). As
shown on Table 4.0-1, existing surface disturbance related to natural gas development is an estimated
49,218 acres.
Due to the intermingling of federal, state, and private lands within the CD-C, rejection of the Operators’
proposal under the No Action alternative would not mean that no new oil and gas development in the
project area would occur. Such development may be authorized on state and private lands, as the BLM
does not approve or control development on these lands. In addition, the BLM may receive and consider
proposals for access across federal lands for oil and gas development and production-related activities.
The BLM also may receive and consider additional or supplemental proposals (such as pipelines,
compressors, and power lines) to develop leased resources, such as natural gas, on federal lands in the
project area. Individual proposals for geophysical exploration or development, including rights-of-way for
access across federal lands, would be subject to site-specific analysis prior to approval or authorization by
the BLM.

2.3

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED STUDY

Two alternatives were considered and eliminated from detailed study. The alternatives and the reasons for
eliminating them are described below.
2.3.1

Surface Disturbance Cap with Reclamation Credits and Debits

This alternative would place a 30-acre cap on the amount of future surface disturbance in a section of
public land. If previous natural gas development had disturbed the surface in a section, the acreage that
had been successfully reclaimed would be added to the 30 acres. If the disturbance had not been
successfully reclaimed, the acreage would be subtracted from 30 acres. The aim is to provide additional
incentive for successful reclamation and increased disincentive for slow or failed reclamation. For
example, in a section in which 10 acres of surface disturbance had occurred and 6 acres had been
reclaimed, the cap would be modified according to the success or failure of the reclamation on those 6
acres. (The 4 acres used for roads and on-pad facilities would not count one way or the other toward
credits or debits, but would count against the cap.) If the 6 acres met the criteria for successful
reclamation, the modified cap for that section would be 30 acres plus the 6 acres of reclaimed surface, a
total cap of 36 acres (of which 4 had been used for roads and on-pad facilities, leaving 32 acres that could
still be utilized). If, on the other hand, the 6 acres did not satisfy the criteria, the modified cap would be
24 acres—the 30-acre base less the 6 acres of unsuccessful reclamation (4 of which were already
impacted, leaving 20 acres for future development). If half the reclamation met the criteria and half did
not, the 30-acre cap would remain unchanged, as the failed 3 acres would offset the successful 3 acres,
leaving the cap at 30 acres with 4 of those acres encumbered.
After closely considering this alternative, the BLM determined its actual operation would be
unpredictable and that neither the BLM nor the Operators could rely on its results. In certain instances,
the formulation could yield a cap in one section of perhaps 90 acres and in an adjacent section of minus
30 acres. The complexity of the alternative and the uncertainty of its results make it difficult to describe
and there is a high likelihood that the result would be contention between the BLM and the Operators
over the meaning of and the operation of the cap. Because of the complexity and the uncertainty about its

2-22

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

effects, and because Alternative C already satisfied all the criteria for a surface disturbance cap, the BLM
decided that the Surface Disturbance Cap with Reclamation Credits and Debits would not be carried
forward for analysis in the EIS.
2.3.2

Focused Development

The Focused Development Alternative would include the same degree of overall natural gas development
as the Proposed Action, but the drilling would be phased geographically, focusing first on one defined
area and then moving to another area following completion of development in the initial area. The
purpose of the geographical phasing would be to allow large areas of wildlife habitat to remain
undisturbed for an extended period, during which other areas would undergo intense and continuous
development. Several alternatives with this general formulation were considered during discussions
between the Operators and the CD-C cooperating agencies between 2005 and 2009. The BLM was not a
participant in those discussions. Discussions were aimed at identifying larger tracts of habitat that could
remain undeveloped for a considerable period of time and other areas―areas of focused
development―that would be completely developed during that same period. In exchange for agreeing to
delay developing in one area, the Operators would receive exemption from seasonal wildlife stipulations
on public lands in the area of focused development. Upon completion of development in the initial focus
area, that area would in turn have no activity and development would shift to the previously undeveloped
area.
The concept of focused development has two key elements: (1) that the leaseholders, property owners,
Operators, and others with an interest in the production of oil and gas in both the area of focused
development and those in the area of delayed development area be the same or at least have a shared
interest, since all the parties would have to participate if the concept were to be effective; and (2) that the
BLM would be able to exempt the federal oil and gas leaseholders from the seasonal wildlife stipulations.
After considerable examination, it was determined that neither of the key elements could be provided.
In the case of developing a shared interest among those interested in developing the fluid mineral estate,
the sheer number of interests (over 60 different leaseholders within the project area and over 20 different
operators), and the diversity and complexity of their holdings presented legal, planning, and logistical
problems that could not be overcome. Additionally, the substantial portion of the project area that is
within the checkerboard would require participation by private property owners, many of whom are not
federal leaseholders.
The creation of an oil and gas unit is one method of creating a shared interest among various parties. A
unit agreement allows exploration and development of properties owned by multiple parties to proceed
with a program paced to develop all lands within the unit, regardless of ownership boundaries. Unitizing
the CD-C project area to create a shared interest would not work because: (1) The leaseholders, property
owners, operators, and operating rights owners over such a wide geographical area—the whole project
area or a large part of it—do not have sufficient interests in common for a single exploratory unit to be
formed; (2) Developing exploration units requires certain levels of obligation to drill wells. Under the
Yates decision, if the drilling is successful and yields a producing well, all leases covered by the unit are
considered held by production (Yates Petroleum Corp. et al., 67 IBLA 246, 1982). Holding hundreds of
thousands of leasehold acreage without development is not in the best interest of the BLM as the federal
lessor; and (3) Leases are offered and granted with certain time terms, during which leaseholders and
Operators are obligated to develop the leases or the leases will expire. If a CD-C project unit were to
form, then hundreds of thousands of leased acres could be held by production from only a few wells and
the owners of these leases likely would not receive the returns needed to pay out the cost of acquiring the
leases. This in turn could result in the operator not being able to drill and produce at adequate levels to
meet their income requirements or returns on investment. This would be a major impact to stockholder
value and the development of U.S. energy.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

2-23

CHAPTER 2—THE PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES

It was also determined that exempting the leaseholders from seasonal wildlife stipulations could not be
done. The BLM reviewed the federal laws and regulations that govern the management of habitat of
species protected under the ESA and those that were designated as Special Status by the BLM and
concluded it could not agree to the necessary blanket exemptions, over such a large area, for such an
extended period of time. With no ability to bring about either of the key elements of the Focused
Development alternative, the participants in the discussion concluded that such an alternative could not be
properly designed and implemented.

The intensity of impacts on geologic resources would vary in relation to the surface disturbance by alternative, but would be low

Paleontological resources have been identified in over 30 localities within the project area. Implementation of the Proposed
Action or any of the action alternatives may impact paleontological resources—in a negative way by destroying or damaging
them and making them unavailable for scientific inquiry—to the extent that the ground is disturbed by development activities,
(see Table ES-1 above). Disturbance could be beneficial by resulting in the discovery and preservation of fossils that add to
scientific knowledge. Pre-disturbance surveys and disturbance mitigation where appropriate would minimize adverse impacts.

Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, surface water impacts could include contamination of surface water

Significant impacts to groundwater are not expected under the Proposed Action or the action alternatives because the

springs and flowing wells used for stock and domestic purposes, because of state-of-the-art construction techniques, and
because of implementation of BMPs and COAs related to drilling.

Air Quality

Impacts from the Proposed Action and all action alternatives would not cause an exceedance of any ambient air quality
standard and would not exceed the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Class II Increments at a 250-meter distance
from project sources. However, modeled impacts at a100-meter distance from field development project sources did result in
short-term concentrations that were predicted to be above the 1-hour NO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the
24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10 Wyoming Ambient Air Quality Standard (WAAQS). Impacts would not exceed the
PSD Class I or Class II increments at any of the Class I and sensitive Class II areas. The visibility analysis indicated a
maximum of 5 days with project emissions resulting in impacts greater than the 0.5 delta deciview (Δdv) threshold at any of the
Class I and sensitive Class II areas; using the 98th percentile value as a threshold, there are zero days above the 0.5 Δdv
threshold. There would be no nitrogen and sulfur deposition impacts that exceed BLM critical load values at any Class I or
sensitive Class II area. In addition there would be no impacts to sensitive lakes that exceed threshold values. All BLM-approved
energy development projects will comply with applicable air quality regulations and standards, as determined by the WDEQ.
Biological Environment

Vegetation

Vegetation has already been strongly affected; historic disturbance equivalent to 5.6% of the area’s surface has already
occurred. Additional disturbance would produce combined historic and project-related disturbance for the Proposed Action and
each action alternative equivalent to the surface area percentages shown below. Even with successful implementation of
reclamation practices, about 40 percent of the disturbed area would remain in an unvegetated state during the production period
for the project—45-55 years. The remaining 60 percent of the disturbed area would have reduced productivity while reclamation
is in progress and would have an altered species composition and density for the life of the project and beyond, including a longterm loss of shrubs. Estimated percentage vegetation disturbance by alternative, including the historical 5.6% disturbance, is:

mule deer. Significant impact can be reached by actions that result in disruption or irreplaceable loss of vital and high-value
habitats such as crucial winter range and migration corridors, resulting in impacts that exceed the High or Extreme impact
definitions. Big game species in the area are expected to be significantly affected by the Proposed Action and Alternatives A,
B, and C but not by Alternative D.

Measures aimed at avoiding and protecting special-status plants that would be implemented under the Proposed Action and all

disturbance decreases and the number of disturbance sites is reduced, the likelihood of adverse impact is diminished further.

Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, adequate visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and conditions of
approval would allow oil and gas development to be compatible with the management objectives for VRM Class III landscapes in
the project area by partially retaining the existing character of the landscape. Development would be compatible per se with
VRM Class IV objectives because VRM Class IV is meant to allow for major modification of the existing character of the
landscape. There would be no new impacts under Alternative E, No Action.

Socioeconomics

Transportation

The Proposed Action and the action alternatives would generate similar effects with minor differences. About 1,600 direct
project-related jobs would be created by Year 15 of development. Total project-related employment (direct, indirect, and induced
jobs) would climb to a peak of around 4,000 jobs in Year 14, an addition to existing project employment. Employment effects
would continue during production after the field is fully developed, but be lower than those during development. Following
completion of development and production, regional employment would decrease by over 4,300 jobs, including both new and
existing jobs, a net job loss. Population changes would closely follow employment gains and losses, peaking at about 3,700 new
residents and almost 1,000 temporary workers during Year 15 of development and falling to about 700 residents by Year 20.
Community facilities should be adequate to accommodate the added population but may require expansion during the latter part
of the 15-year development cycle. Demand for community facilities would substantially diminish after development is completed.
Substantial government revenues would be generated by the natural-gas production—about $3.8 billion in federal royalties, an
estimated $530 million in state mineral royalties, and $3.1 billion in ad valorem and gross products taxes. Project-related
employment, population, and revenue generation effects would not occur under Alternative E, No Action.
Development-related estimated peak annual average daily traffic (AADT) by alternative is as follows (estimated long-term
production-related AADT is the same for all alternatives, 1,360):

Oil and Gas and Other
Minerals

Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, the natural gas resources of the project area would be developed fully.
Natural gas reserves produced over the life of the project are estimated at 12.02 trillion cubic feet. Under Alternative E, the
Operators would still possess lease development rights but it is assumed that fluid mineral resources would not be developed
under this proposal.

Health and Safety

The Proposed Action and all action alternatives would result in similar impacts to the public and site workers, including
increased risk of vehicle collisions on interstate highways and local road systems.

Waste and Hazardous
Materials

Currently authorized and approved actions are already exerting stress on the permitted and authorized disposal facilities
proximal to the project area. Authorization of the Proposed Action or Alternatives A through C would result in further stress to
the capacity of permitted waste management units used by the operating companies, including those used for management of
solid waste, produced water, and drilling mud. Alternative D may serve to extend the life of some existing disposal facilities.

The Continental Divide splits the project area into approximately northern and southern halves and, to a
greater or lesser degree, parallels the I-80 highway and utilities corridor. Along and just north of the I-80
corridor, Five Mile Ditch, Latham Draw, and Hansen Draw drain the western part of the Great Divide
Basin, whereas Buck Draw and Creston Draw drain to the northeast, off Latham Mesa. Farther north and
northwest, the physiography of the project area is dominated by eolian features, and most watercourses
are short and drain into small to very large interior basins. North of Tipton, the topography of the Red
Desert Basin, the Lost Creek Basin, Chain Lakes Flat, and Battle Springs Flat is typified by eolian flats
and dry playas lying in broad topographic depressions surrounded by areas of vegetated sheet or dune
sand. These larger depressions are developed between elevations of about 6,450 and 6,600 feet. Dozens of
smaller, internally drained basins occur near and south of the I-80 corridor, most notably including the
Wamsutter and Frewan Depressions (at about 6,600 to 6,700 feet in elevation), and basins southeast of the
Creston I-80 exit (S ½ T20N:R92W and SE ¼ SW ¼ T20N:R91W). Hundreds of smaller, internally
drained basins occur throughout the project area, especially in places in which the surface rock or soil has
been covered by dunes or a veneer of windblown sand.
In the eastern part of the project area, Fillmore Creek is a primary drainage north of the Continental
Divide. Its principal tributaries include Coal Gulch, Coal Bank Wash, and Badwater Creek. Muddy
Creek—tributary to the Little Snake River—is the dominant drainage south of the Divide. Its tributaries
include Holler Draw, Chicken Springs Creek, and Soap Hole Wash that flow south off the Continental

Divide, supplemented by the south-flowing Barrel Springs Draw and Antelope Creek, and the eastflowing Windmill Draw, Red Wash, Blue Gap Draw, Robbers Gulch, Little Robbers Gulch, and the
North Fork of Cottonwood Creek. Surface elevations within the project area range from a high of 7,822
feet on North Flat Top in the NW ¼ Section 2, T14N:R93W, to a low of 6,340 feet in the lower drainage
of Muddy Creek in Section 32, T14N:R91W, making project area relief about 1,482 feet. The slope of the
land along the floodplain of Muddy Creek within and marginal to the project area is a gentle 400 feet in
26.2 miles, or about 0.29 percent. Limited areas of exposed rock forming rugged badland hills border the
Muddy Creek valley to the east and west, and some of these badland hills exhibit slopes of up to 13.7
percent for short distances. The region of greatest physical relief in the study area—along North Flat Top
in Section 35, T15N:R93W—has a slope of 18.9 percent, or about a 1,000-foot rise in elevation per mile.
The majority of the project area, however, shows gentler slopes of 1.7 to 4.2 percent (about 90–220
feet/mile).
The project area is dominated by semiarid desert that receives an average of 7.1 inches of annual
precipitation, ranging from 3.8 inches to 13.6 inches. The annual temperature ranges from -30 ºF in winter
to more than 100 ºF in summer. Sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) is the dominant vegetation and grows in
patches and thickets. Along the larger drainages sagebrush is supplemented by bunch grasses, cheatgrass,
greasewood, rabbitbrush, lichens, cottonwood, and a variety of other plants (Roehler 1993). Vegetation is
wholly absent in several areas of badlands, and gullying can be severe in areas of headward erosion
derived from badland areas, in places where the overlying sediment has been disturbed, or on poorly
vegetated slopes greater than 2 percent. Much of the lower reach of Muddy Creek is entrenched in a
floodplain gully system up to 20 feet in depth.
3.1.2

Regional Geologic Overview

The project area lies within the southern and eastern parts of the Great Divide and Washakie structural
basins, sub-basin regions of the Greater Green River Basin of southernmost central Wyoming.
Structurally, rocks in the area dip in a curving fashion to the west, southwest, and south of the structural
high of the Sierra Madre Range, and to the south off the Wamsutter Arch, into the Washakie structural
basin.
The west flank of the Sierra Madre is bounded by a major eastward-dipping reverse fault system, along
which it was elevated over the eastern edge of the Greater Green River Basin (including the Washakie
Basin) during the Laramide Orogeny of the late Cretaceous to early Tertiary period. These reverse faults
are not exposed at the surface, but rather lie buried beneath early Tertiary sediments that fill the basin.
The Washakie and Greater Green River basins to the west, into which the surface rocks dip, are bounded
by east-west oriented structural highs, the Wamsutter Arch to the north and Cherokee Ridge to the south,
respectively. The structural axis of Cherokee Ridge trends along the Wyoming/Colorado state line and
separates the extreme southeastern arm of the Greater Green River Basin of Wyoming from the Sand
Wash Basin of Colorado. Numerous faults occur along Cherokee Ridge, many of which show evidence of
recurrent motion throughout the last 20 million years. None of these, however, show indication of
Quaternary movement (Case et al. 1994).
Geologic mapping by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Wyoming Geologic Survey (Weitz and
Love 1952, Love 1970, Love and Christiansen 1985, Love et al. 1993, Roehler 1973, 1977, 1985; Honey
and Hettinger, 2004; Hettinger and Honey, 2005) documents that the project area has surface sedimentary
exposures of Quaternary, Tertiary, and Late Cretaceous age. These deposits are in turn underlain in the
subsurface by Phanerozoic-age sedimentary rocks of Cretaceous to Cambrian age, which are in turn
underlain by Precambrian metamorphic bedrock that comprises part of the ancient North American craton
(continental core) and exceeds two billion years in age.

Rock terminology for the Cretaceous (Mesaverde Group, a subsurface unit in the project area) is
complicated in that scientific studies of these rocks reference a number of different formations within the
project area. Although the Wyoming Chart of Stratigraphic Nomenclature lists the Almond, Ericson,
Rock Springs, and Blair formations within the Mesaverde Group in the Washakie Basin, alternative
terminology has been used for these same rocks by authors describing the coals of the Mesaverde. Rock
equivalent names for the Ericson Sandstone include the Williams Fork Formation or Pine Ridge
Sandstone; for the Rock Springs Formation, the Allen Ridge Sandstone or Iles Formations; and for the
Blair Formation, the Haystack Mountain Formation.
Additional details on surface deposits are provided in Section 3.1.3. Petroleum production targets are

3.1.3

Quaternary Deposits

Quaternary deposits in the project area include widespread deposits of alluvium, colluvium, and slope
wash; eolian sand dunes; and residuum developed on formations of Cretaceous (Lance Formation),
Paleocene (Fort Union Formation), and Eocene (Battle Spring, Green River, and Wasatch Formations)
ages.
Extensive deposits of windblown sand blanket bedrock exposures of Tertiary rocks in T15-17N:R93W,
with more isolated deposits occurring in T15N:R92W (Love and Christiansen 1985). These deposits
range in thickness up to about 30 feet, and the sediment has been partly stabilized by vegetation,
dampness, and weak cementation in some areas. Relatively pure, naturally size-sorted eolian sand is an
economic resource, and sand-quarry pits have been developed in Section 9, T15N:R92W and just to the
southeast of that area, outside the project boundaries (Harris 1996). The northern part of the project area
is dominated by eolian deposits and an eolian-created topography. The Red Desert, Lost Lake, and String
Lake Basins are deflated playas surrounded by loess deposits.
Deposits of alluvium, at least up to 30 feet thick, are developed in the bed and floodplain of Muddy Creek
in the central and southeast parts of the project area, and much thinner alluvial accumulations occur in the
beds of tributary streams near where they join Muddy Creek. The alluvium consists for the most part of
medium to fine sand, mud, and mudstone rip-up clasts, all derived from the surrounding badland hills.
Chert pebbles, sandstone clasts, and weathered Eocene soil (paleosol) nodules commonly occur as part of
streambed loads. Pebble to cobble-sized gravel forms some of the ancient terrace sediment above Muddy
Creek on its east side, and these deposits are exploited locally as road metal or in making concrete filler
(for example, in the SW ¼ SE ¼ Section 21, T18N:R91W). The site of the lauded “Rawlins Mammoth,”
discovered in 1961, is located near Chicken Springs in the NW ¼ SW ¼ SE ¼ Section 1, T18N:R91W.
Drapes of colluvial sediment, consisting mainly of mud with a lesser amount of fine sand and lag
accumulations of Eocene soil nodules, border nearly all the badland hills and are derived from them.
Terrace gravel and gravel deposits of Holocene and perhaps Pleistocene age occur sporadically
throughout the area along the former course of Muddy Creek and at higher elevations. Older high-level
terrace gravels suggest that Muddy Creek and its subsidiary tributaries drained northward into the Great
Divide Basin in the past and that its present southward drainage into the Little Snake River was the result
of stream piracy.

3.1.4

Tertiary—Battle Spring Formation

The Battle Spring Formation (Pipiringos 1961) is a fluvial deposit of middle Eocene age that forms a
foundation for most of the buttes and mesas bordering the playas in the project area north of the
Continental Divide. The unit consists of gray, orange, and red mudstones, volcanic mudstones,
carbonaceous mudstones, orange and brown sandstones, and stringers of gravel conglomerate, and it is
especially well exposed in the area of Ruby Knolls and on the east side of Frewan Mesa. The Battle
Spring Formation has yielded a small fauna of fossil vertebrates, including the fragmentary bone of a
crane or a large, flightless bird discovered during reconnaissance fieldwork for this project.
3.1.5

Tertiary—Green River Formation

Within the project area, the Eocene Green River Formation (chiefly of middle Eocene age) is restricted to
the area around the I-80 corridor (between Wamsutter and Tipton Buttes) and to the extreme southwest,
where it makes up the upper part of the escarpment forming Flat Top Mountain. From oldest to youngest,
the Green River consists of the Luman Tongue, the Tipton Tongue, Wilkins Peak Member (lower part
only), Godiva Rim Member, and the Laney Member. Sediments comprising the Green River Formation
accumulated in environments in and adjacent to Lake Gosiute (and its predecessor Lake Luman) in
response to the rise and fall in lake level during the Early Eocene. Environments of deposition included
fluvial, paludal, freshwater lacustrine, saltwater lacustrine, pond and playa lake, evaporate pans, mudflat,
and volcanic and fluviovolcanic (Roehler 1993).
The Luman Tongue forms the base of the Green River Formation on the southern edge of the Great
Divide Basin. The tongue is composed chiefly of organic-rich oil shales, carbonaceous shales, limestones,
sandstones, and mudstones that accumulated in Lake Luman above deposits of the Ramsey Ranch
Member of the Wasatch Formation (Section 3.1.6). The Luman deposits interfinger laterally to the north
and south with varicolored (chiefly red) floodplain deposits of the Wasatch Formation. At its maximum
extent, Lake Luman occupied an area of about 6,650 square miles.
The Tipton Tongue (including the Scheggs and Rife beds) of the Green River Formation conformably
overlies the Niland Tongue of the Wasatch Formation, and is composed chiefly of marlstone, calcareous
shale, and oil shale. The Scheggs Bed is predominantly oil shale and lesser algal limestones, sands, and
muds that accumulated in lake and lake-shore environments during the first major expansion of ancient
Lake Gosiute. Deep-lake oil shale in the Scheggs Bed preserves abundant fossils of ostracods and
shallow-water lake sediments containing abundant stromatolites, the remains of calcareous algal reefs.
The stromatolites exhibit a wide variety of bizarre forms that are related to ecological conditions such as
water depth, temperature, salinity, and sedimentation rate, as well as other factors. The Rife Bed forms
the top of the Tipton and consists chiefly of organic-rich oil shale, interbedded with a lesser amount of
algal limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and mudstone. The oil shale of the Rife accumulated in the deepest
parts of the lake during a 500,000-year period when Lake Gosiute dwindled to about half its former size
(about 7,500 square miles) during deposition of the Scheggs Bed. The salinity of the lake must have
increased dramatically as evidenced by thin layers of saline minerals such as nahcolite and disseminated
crystals of shortite that occur in the upper part of the bed. Algal limestone and sands accumulated in
shallower and shoreline areas.
The Wilkins Peak Member consists of many layers of cyclic sediments that include, in ascending order:
oil shale, trona, halite, and mudstone that accumulated in Lake Gosiute. Only the lower part of the
member is present in the project area. This part of the member consists chiefly of shales, sandstones, and
trona and halite that accumulated in brackish Lake Gosiute as the lake shrank in size. The Godiva Rim
Member consists chiefly of gray-brown kerogenous shale, ostracode-bearing sandstone, siltstone, and
limestone that overlie and interfinger with the Cathedral Bluffs Member of the Wasatch Formation and is
overlain and interfingers with the LaClede Bed of the Laney Shale.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—GEOLOGY

The Laney Shale (including the LaClede and Hartt Cabin beds) forms the top of the Green River
Formation and records in its sediments the greatest expansion of ancient Lake Gosiute followed by its
final contraction and desiccation. At its peak the lake in which the Laney accumulated occupied more
than 75 percent of the Greater Green River Basin, or about 15,000 square miles (Bucheim 1981,1986,
Bucheim et al. 1977).The Laney Shale (including the LaClede and Hartt Cabin Beds) conformably
overlies and interfingers with the Cathedral Bluffs Tongue of the Wasatch Formation, and is dominated
by calcareous shale, oil shale, and shaley marlstone.
In the Piceance Basin of Colorado, the Green River Formation contains massive amounts of economically
important oil shale, and elsewhere the formation is also known to yield economically important deposits
of trona and gilsonite. The Green River is well known for its locally abundant remains of well-preserved
fossil fish and much rarer specimens of other fossil vertebrates.
3.1.6

Tertiary—Wasatch Formation

The lower Eocene Wasatch Formation is the most extensively exposed geologic unit in the project area,
with a distribution exceeding that of any other rock unit. Bedrock exposures of the Wasatch Formation,
however, are generally limited to the steep, east-facing escarpments bordering much of the west side of
Muddy Creek, especially beneath Flat Top Mountain, along “The Bluffs” north of Baggs, and in westdipping cuestas north and south of the townsite of Dad. Other exposures are locally developed along and
marginal to deeply incised streams on south Mexican Flats.
Within the project area, the Wasatch Formation is divided into the Main Body, Ramsey Ranch Member,
Niland Tongue, and the Cathedral Bluffs Tongue. Regionally, the Main Body of the Wasatch Formation
consists of up to 2,130 feet of variegated mudstone and sandy mudstone, gray sandstone, carbonaceous
shale, and coal (Bradley 1964; Sullivan 1980; Roehler 1985) that were deposited in alluvial channels and
back swamps, and on floodplains. Toward the basin center, the Main Body of the Wasatch conformably
overlies the Paleocene Fort Union Formation, but farther east it overlaps the Fort Union and lies with
angular unconformity on both the Fort Union Formation and the Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation. The
floodplain deposits of the Main Body have two distinct color patterns. Around the basin edges the
floodplain deposits range from red to varicolored, with some shade of red dominating. In the central parts
of basin these red floodplain deposits are replaced laterally by green to gray floodplain deposits. Green to
gray coloration appears to have been the result of accumulation of sediments in areas that were
permanently water saturated, where iron compounds were reduced. In addition to floodplain deposits the
main body of the Wasatch Formation includes some freshwater limestones that accumulated in ponds and
marshes in low-lying areas and some coarse-grained sands and conglomerates that accumulated along the
basin margin in alluvial fan environments. Deposits of the Main Body accumulated contemporaneously
with deposits of the Ramsey Ranch Member of the Wasatch Formation and Luman and Tipton tongues of
the Green River Formation.
The Ramsey Ranch Member consists of carbonaceous shale, coal, limestone, gray and green or red
variegated sandstone and mudstones that accumulated in swamps, shallow lakes and ponds, and
floodplains and rivers during the early stages of the development of Lake Gosiute. The member contains
important deposits of oil shale, uranium, and coal.
The Niland Tongue of the Wasatch Formation consists of brown sandstone, drab mudstone, and
carbonaceous shale that conformably overlie the Luman Tongue of the Green River Formation. The
Niland Tongue has the same aerial distribution as the Luman Tongue of the Green River Formation.
Where the Luman Tongue is absent the name Niland Tongue is discarded and those rocks are not
separated from the underlying main body of the Wasatch.
The Cathedral Bluffs Tongue forms the uppermost rocks of the Wasatch Formation, overlying the Tipton
Shale of the Green River Formation, and closely resembles those of the Main Body in the dominance of
variegated mudstone and gray sandstone.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—GEOLOGY

Economically important uranium deposits occur in coals of the Main Body and Ramsey Ranch Member
of the Wasatch Formation north of Wamsutter, just west of the project area (Masursky 1962), and in the
region around Creston and Latham (Harris et al. 1985; Harris and King 1993). Uranium is also known in
arkoses of the Battle Springs Formation of the central Great Divide Basin (Pipiringos 1961), a unit
approximately equivalent to the Cathedral Bluffs Tongue of the Wasatch within the report area.
Fossil vertebrates are locally abundant in the Wasatch Formation, including all the subunits that comprise
the formation in the CD-C project area. Fossils are most abundant where they have weathered from
immature through mature paleosols. However, about 10 miles north of Baggs, Wyoming, sandstones of
the Cathedral Bluff Member that interfingers with the Tipton Shale have produced fossils of 11
mammalian species including primates, condylarths, tillodonts, dinocerates, and perissodactyls (Roehler
1988) as well as the fossils of mollusks, ostracodes, burrows, worm trails, and an unidentified tubular
impression. The mollusks include very abundant shells of the gastropods Goniabasis and Viviparus as
well as freshwater unionid bivalves.
The most important Wasatch Formation fossil vertebrate locality within the study area is the so-called
“Dad Local Fauna” (Gazin 1962), which was collected from the east-facing exposures of the Main Body
of the formation developed on bluffs north and south of the townsite of Dad. The University of Wyoming
Geological Museum has 11 fossil vertebrate sites in the Wasatch Formation within the project area.
3.1.7

Tertiary—Fort Union Formation

Within the project area, the Paleocene Fort Union Formation is developed in a curved, westerly dipping
outcrop. Regionally, the unit lies with erosional or angular unconformity atop the Upper Cretaceous
Lance Formation (Roehler 1993). The best Fort Union exposures occur in the northeast part of the area, in
Section 23, T18N:R92W; however, good but smaller and less-continuous Fort Union exposures occur
beneath Wasatch-capped buttes developed just east of Muddy Creek, between the townsites of Dad and
Baggs, Wyoming.
Regionally, the Fort Union Formation consists of up to 3,400 feet of drab mudstone, sandy mudstone,
sandstone, carbonaceous shales, and coal. These rocks were deposited in alluvial channels and flood-basin
backswamps (Sanders 1975), and up to 1,500 feet of Fort Union rocks are exposed in the Riner area,
between Red Rim and Creston Junction (Sanders 1974).
Honey and Hettinger (2004) and Hettinger and Honey (2005) have mapped three members of the Fort
Union Formation in the Blue Gap and Peach Orchard 7.5-minute quadrangles. These include, from
youngest to oldest, the Overland, Blue Gap, and China Butte Members. The China Butte Member
includes many mapped coalbeds included in five coal-bearing zones. These include the Fillmore Ranch,
upper and lower Muddy Creek, Olsen Draw, and Red Rim coal zones.
The Fort Union Formation in the project area, as well as in all of south-central Wyoming, constitutes an
enormous, largely untapped reserve of coal. Unfortunately, most of this resource occurs in thin and/or
discontinuous beds (Smith et al. 1972; Sanders 1974, 1975; Beaumont 1979; Edson 1979; Hettinger and
Brown 1979; Honey and Roberts 1989; Honey and Hettinger 1989a; Honey 1990; Jones 1991; Hettinger
et al. 1991; Hettinger and Kirchbaum 1991) that are exceedingly difficult to mine economically. Sanders
(1974, 1975) reports thin and discontinuous Fort Union coalbeds that thicken up to 9.8 feet in places, and
units 5–25 feet thick are developed in the upper 600–700 feet of the formation just northeast of the project
area. Edson (1979), Honey and Hettinger (1989a), Honey and Roberts (1989), and Honey (1990) named
and/or numbered Fort Union coalbeds within and north and west of the project area, and provided
subsurface correlations of coal-bearing units. Honey and Roberts (1989) recorded up to 75 feet of total
coal thickness in the lower part of the Fort Union Formation in the Baggs area, and Honey and Hettinger
(1989b) documented individual coalbeds up to 27.7 feet thick in the Fillmore Ranch Coal Zone (Edson
1979), within the project area.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—GEOLOGY

The most recent coal-mining activity within the project area is in the Fort Union Formation at Cherokee
Mine Number 1, in the SW ¼ SW ¼ NE ¼ Section 2, T19N:R92W, about 6 miles south of Creston
Junction. Coal mining is also planned for the Creston Area (in T19N:R92W), and at the Chris Butte Mine
Project area along the Continental Divide in Section 15, T18N:R91W.
Fossil vertebrates are well known from the China Butte Member of the Fort Union Formation within the
study area, the most noteworthy locality being Swain Quarry, in the NE ¼ Section 3, T15N:R92W (Rigby
1980). Apart from Swain Quarry, the UW Geological Museum has one locality in the project area—Fort
Union rocks—and an additional 13 Fort Union sites have been developed in recent years by M.C.
McKenna and J.G. Honey.
The contact of the Fort Union Formation with the underlying Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation is
everywhere marked by a pronounced angular unconformity and generally a thick-channel sandstone
(Roehler 1993). It is unknown if the Tertiary-Cretaceous boundary is preserved in the area, but earliest
Paleocene (Puercan age) rocks certainly are (see Section 3.3 Soils).
3.1.8

Upper Cretaceous—Lance Formation

Few exposures of Lance rocks extend into the project area, and the Lance Formation/Fort Union
Formation contact in part forms the project area’s eastern boundary over a short distance. However,
patches of Lance are exposed in a few areas, notably in the SE ¼ Sections 13, 23, and 34, T17N:R92W,
and in the E ½ Section 4, T16N:R92W.
The Lance Formation is a largely alluvial deposit made up of about 2,890 feet of interbedded gray
sandstone and sandy mudstone, carbonaceous shale, and coal (Hettinger et al. 1991; Hettinger and
Kirschbaum 1991). Honey and Hettinger (2004) and Hettinger and Honey (2005) recognize two subunits
of the Lance Formation in the Blue Gap and Peach Orchard 7.5-minute Quadrangles. These include an
upper Red Rim Member and an underlying unnamed member. The Red Rim Member is chiefly
conglomeratic sandstone. The underlying unnamed member contains several coal units. The thickest of
these, which is about six feet thick, occurs about 25 to 45 feet above the base of the formation.
Regionally, the Lance overlies the Fox Hills Sandstone (Smith 1961, Gill et al. 1970, Hettinger et al.
1991, Roehler 1993), which is included in the Lewis Shale on many maps. To the east the Fox Hills may
be absent, and the Lance directly overlies the Lewis Shale (Weitz and Love 1952, Love and Christiansen
1985). Further eastward, Lance rocks correlate with the Medicine Bow Formation (Merewether 1971) and
farther west, the Lance thins to less than 197 feet on the west side of the Washakie Basin (Roehler 1985).
The Lance Formation is well-known for its dinosaur remains and, within the project area, Lance rocks
have yielded sparse remains of fish, crocodilians, and mammals (J.G. Honey, personal communication).
3.1.9

Geologic Hazards

Of known naturally occurring geologic hazards, fault-generated earthquakes, floods, landslides, or other
mass movement, the most likely to affect the project area are mass movements that could be initiated on
steep slopes. Flooding may be a hazard adjacent to steeply dipping rock outcroppings where high runoff
may be expected; however, there are few such areas within the project boundaries.
There are no known faults with evidence of Quaternary movement mapped within the project area (NEIC
2003, WGS 2003); however, a number of unmapped faults are known to exist in the Washakie Basin area
in southern Sweetwater and Carbon Counties. Further field investigation is necessary to determine if any
of these faults should be deemed active (USGS 2012a).
Only one earthquake has been recorded within the project area. The earthquake, with a 4.3 Richter
magnitude occurred April 4, 1999 and its epicenter was located near Baldy Butte in T17N:R92W
(41.45˚N:107.74˚W). It was felt in Rawlins, Sinclair, Baggs, Wamsutter, and Rock Springs. Residents of
Rawlins reported that pictures fell off walls. The most noteworthy damage occurred between Baggs and

3-12

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—GEOLOGY

Creston Junction, and at Wamsutter (USGS 2012a). The owner of a ranch house located approximately 30
miles north of Baggs reported that cinder-block walls in the basement of the home cracked, separated, and
may have required replacement. A motel and associated residence in Wamsutter also suffered cracks in
the cinder-block walls of the basement. No other earthquake epicenters have been recorded in or
immediately adjacent to the area in the past 100 years, indicating that earthquakes are probably an
unusual event and that the area may not be very seismically active (USGS 2012a).
Carbon County is primarily in Seismic Zone 1 of the Uniform Building Code. Effective peak
accelerations (90 percent chance of non-exceedance in 50 years) in this zone can range from 5%g–10%g,
where g = the gravitational acceleration constant (see Glossary). New probabilistic acceleration maps for
Wyoming are available from the USGS (USGS 2012a). These maps assume accelerations based on what
would be expected if firm soil or rock were present at the surface.
Ground accelerations shown on the USGS maps in Wyoming may be affected by local soil conditions. If
fairly soft, saturated sediments are present at the surface, and seismic waves pass through them, surfaceground accelerations will usually be greater than would be experienced if only bedrock were present.
Thus, ground accelerations shown by the USGS maps may underestimate the local hazard.
The USGS maps indicate that in the southern part of Carbon County: (1) for the 500-year map (10 percent
probability of exceedance in 50 years), the estimated peak horizontal acceleration in Carbon County is
about 4%g; (2) for the 1,000-year map (5 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years) is about 3.9%g;
and (3) for the 2,500-year map (2 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years) is about 11%g. These
accelerations are roughly comparable to intensity V and VI earthquakes. An intensity VI earthquake can
result in fallen plaster and damaged chimneys.
The historic record of earthquakes is limited and it is nearly impossible to determine when a 2,500-year
event last occurred in the county. This uncertainty, coupled with use by the International Building Code
of the record of 2,500-year events for building design, suggests that it is appropriate to use the 2,500-year
probabilistic maps for Carbon County analyses.
Honey and Hettinger (2004) have mapped landslide deposits covering about a quarter-section along the
north side of Cottonwood Creek in Section 31, T14N:R92W and Section 6, T13N:R92W of the Peach
Orchard 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle. These deposits are of limited extent and occur along the
contact between the Main Body of the Wasatch Formation and overlying Tipton Tongue of the Green
River Formation.

PALEONTOLOGIC RESOURCES
Paleontological Resource Preservation Act

The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act (PRPA 2009) was signed into law as part of the Omnibus
Public Lands Management Act of 2009, Public Law 111-011 (123 Stat. 1173; 16 USC 470aaa) (OPLMA
2009). It states that these resources on federal land (except Indian land) shall be managed and protected
“using scientific principles and expertise” and also requires the development of “appropriate plans for the
inventory, monitoring, and scientific and educational use of these resources” in accordance with
applicable agency laws, regulations, and policies. These plans emphasize interagency coordination and
collaborative efforts where possible with non-federal partners, the scientific community, and the general
public. In addition, programs to increase the public's awareness about the significance of paleontological
resources are to be established.
The PRPA formally defines paleontological resources as “any fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of
organisms, preserved in or on the earth’s crust, that are of paleontological interest and that provide
information about the history of life on earth,” and as such include the fossilized remains of plants and
animals as well as their traces.

3.2.2

Potential Fossil Yield Classification (PFYC) System

The PFYC system is described in BLM Instruction Memorandum [IM] No. 2008-009, Potential Fossil
Yield Classification (PFYC) System for Paleontological Resources on Public Lands (BLM 2007d). The
IM is summarized here and is included in its entirety in Appendix D, Paleontological Resources
Program Guidance. The system is based on the premise that the probability of finding paleontological
resources can be broadly predicted from the geologic units present at or near the surface. Under the
system, geologic units are classified according to the relative abundance of fossils and their sensitivity
to adverse impacts, with a higher class number indicating a higher potential.
The PFYC system provides baseline guidance for predicting, assessing, and mitigating paleontological
resources. The classification is an intermediate point in the analysis, used to assist in determining the need
for further mitigation assessment or actions.
The descriptions for each class (provided below) serve as guidelines rather than as strict definitions. Note
that the definition of fossil may be redefined in the Rules and Regulations Section of the PRPA, which is
still in draft.
Class 1 – Very Low. Geologic units that are not likely to contain recognizable fossil remains.



Units that are igneous or metamorphic, excluding reworked volcanic ash units.
Units that are Precambrian in age or older.

The probability for impacting any fossils is negligible.
Class 2 – Low. Sedimentary geologic units that are not likely to contain vertebrate fossils or
scientifically significant nonvertebrate fossils.





Vertebrate or significant invertebrate or plant fossils not present or very rare.
Units that are generally younger than 10,000 years before present.
Recent eolian deposits.
Sediments that exhibit significant physical and chemical changes (i.e., diagenetic alteration).

The probability for impacting fossils is low.
Class 3 – Moderate or Unknown. Fossiliferous sedimentary geologic units where fossil content varies
in significance, abundance, and predictable occurrence; or sedimentary units of unknown fossil potential.





Often marine in origin with sporadic known occurrences of vertebrate fossils.
Vertebrate fossils and scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils known to occur
intermittently; predictability known to be low.
(or)
Poorly studied and/or poorly documented. Potential yield cannot be assigned without ground
reconnaissance.

Class 3a – Moderate Potential. Units are known to contain vertebrate fossils or scientifically significant
nonvertebrate fossils, but these occurrences are widely scattered.
Class 3b – Unknown Potential. Units exhibit geologic features and preservational conditions that
suggest significant fossils could be present, but little information about the paleontological resources of
the unit or the area is known.
Class 4 – High. Geologic units containing a high occurrence of significant fossils.
Class 4a – Unit is exposed with little or no soil or vegetative cover. Outcrop areas are extensive
with exposed bedrock areas often larger than two acres.

3-14

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—PALEONTOLOGIC RESOURCES

Class 4b – These are areas underlain by geologic units with high potential but have lowered risks of
human-caused adverse impacts and/or lowered risk of natural degradation due to moderating
circumstances. Extensive soil or vegetative cover; bedrock exposures are limited or not expected to
be impacted. Areas of exposed outcrop are smaller than two contiguous acres; outcrops form cliffs
of sufficient height and slope so that impacts are minimized by topographic conditions; other
characteristics are present that lower the vulnerability of both known and unidentified
paleontological resources.
The probability for impacting significant paleontological resources is moderate to high, and is
dependent on the proposed action.
Class 5 – Very High. Highly fossiliferous geologic units that consistently and predictably produce
vertebrate fossils or scientifically significant invertebrate or plant fossils, and that are at risk of humancaused adverse impacts or natural degradation.
Class 5a – Unit is exposed with little or no soil or vegetative cover. Outcrop areas are extensive
with exposed bedrock areas often larger than two contiguous acres.
Class 5b – These are areas underlain by geologic units with very high potential but have lowered
risks of human-caused adverse impacts and/or lowered risk of natural degradation due to
moderating circumstances.
The probability for impacting significant fossils is high.
3.2.3

Known Paleontological Resources in the CD-C Project Area

Known paleontological resources (frequently referred to here as fossils or fossil resources) within
sedimentary deposits in the project area record the history of animal and plant life in Wyoming during the
early part of the Cenozoic Era (Paleocene and Eocene Epochs) and the latest part of the Mesozoic
(Cretaceous Period) Era. As described above, current mapping documents six geologic deposits exposed
at the surface in the project area. These include, from youngest to oldest: (1) unnamed deposits of
Quaternary (Holocene to Pleistocene) age, (2) the middle Eocene Battle Spring Formation, (3) the middle
and early Eocene Green River Formation, (4) the Wasatch Formation of early Eocene age, (5) the Fort
Union Formation of Paleocene age, and (6) the Lance Formation of Latest Cretaceous age.
With the exception of the Holocene deposits that are probably too young to contain fossils, all
sedimentary rock units exposed in the project area are known to produce or have the potential to produce
scientifically significant fossil resources. Scientifically significant fossils have been recovered from the
Wasatch (Morris 1954; Honey 1988; Roehler 1972, 1991a–b, 1992a–c, 1993; Roehler et al. 1988), Fort
Union (Rigby 1980, Winterfeld 1982), and Lance Formations (Dorf 1942, Estes 1964, Clemens 1986,
Clemens et al. 1979, Breithaupt 1982 and 1985, Weishample 1992, Archibald 1993, Lillegraven 2002,
Honey 2003) within the project area or immediately adjacent areas.
Specifically, 15 fossil localities are known to occur within the project area in the Lance Formation and 17
fossil localities are known to occur within the Fort Union Formation. The Lance Formation localities
occur in the Separation Peak (T20N:R90W), Fillmore Ranch (T18N:R20W), Doty Mountain (T17N:R91–
92W), Peach Orchard Flat (T15N:R91W) and Blue Gap (T15N:R91W) 7.5-minute Quadrangles. The Fort
Union Formation localities occur in the Separation Peak (T20N:R90W), Fillmore Ranch (T19N:R91W),
Duck Lake (T16–17N:R91-91W), Mexican Flats (T16N:R92W) and Blue Gap (T15–16N:R91–92W) 7.5­
minute Quadrangles. Localities from both the Lance and Fort Union Formations produce a wide variety of
fossil remains, including those of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Of great importance is the
occurrence within the Fort Union Formation of some of the oldest known Paleocene-age fossil vertebrates
in the world, which are considered to be of Puercan age (earlier Paleocene) and are very rare (Honey
2003).

3.2.4

Taphonomy and the Occurrence of Fossils

Taphonomy is the study of the origin and nature of accumulations of fossil materials or their traces. In
general, vertebrate fossils are much rarer than invertebrate fossils, but there are sites where extraordinary
accumulations of fossil vertebrates are found.
Knowledge of the geologic context of vertebrate fossils collected at a site is critically important in
evaluating the reason fossils occur where they do. The geological context of a deposit contains
information about whether the deposit formed under marine (ocean), lacustrine (lake), or fluvial (riverine)
conditions. In the project area, five geological formations have high potential for yielding fossil
vertebrates. From oldest to youngest, these are: (1) the Lance Formation (Upper Cretaceous), (2) the Fort
Union Formation (Paleocene), (3) the Wasatch Formation (lower Eocene), (4) the Green River Formation
(middle Eocene), and (5) the Battle Spring Formation (middle Eocene). None of these formations is of
marine origin, and only the Green River Formation was deposited under largely lacustrine conditions. The
Lance, Fort Union, Wasatch, and Battle Spring formations are dominantly of fluvial (river, stream, and
associated floodplain) origin.
In lacustrine environments, fossil vertebrate remains might accumulate in shales deposited under openwater conditions or, closer to shore, in units containing coarser clastic material. Fluvial sediments (those
deposited by streams) represent two basic environments: the channel and the floodplain. Channel deposits
are generally dominated by sandstone and/or gravel conglomerate, whereas floodplain sediments consist
chiefly of mudstones. Because they were subjected to periodic drying during intermittent deposition,
rocks comprising floodplain deposits are commonly color-variegated. The thicknesses of the colored
horizons reflect the relative maturity (relative time to form) of the ancient soils (Bown and Kraus 1980a
and 1980b).
In fluvial rocks, the accumulation of vertebrate material may be either active or passive. Active
accumulation involves the concentration of bones by running water. All fossil vertebrate concentrations
formed by active accumulation are made up of remains that have been transported after death, although
they need not have been transported very far.
Passive accumulation includes all mechanisms of concentrating fossil material in fluvial environments in
which the remains of the organism are not transported to a large extent after death. Examples of passive
accumulation include: (1) the slow buildup of bones in quicksand deposits, (2) the preservation of remains
as a result of ash-falls, and (3) the gradual accumulation of the remains of dead animals in the upper (A)
horizons of soils (paleosol accumulations). Because paleosols are ubiquitous in ancient fluvial sequences,
and because floodplains with forming soils occupy more than 98 percent of the area of any basinal area of
fluvial accumulation, the vast majority of vertebrate fossils accumulate as part of passive paleosol
accumulations (Bown and Kraus, 1981b). Paleosols, like modern soils, form between times of major
(depositional) events. The amount of vertebrate remains that accumulates during these events can be
staggering. If only three bones/year accumulated on a soil surface 247 acres in area, as a paleosol that
formed for 50,000 years, that soil might be expected to yield 150,000 individual bones.
Lance Formation

The presence of fossil localities of scientific significance in the Lance Formation is well established and
has a long history (Breithaupt 1982). One of the earliest discoveries was the remains of a horned dinosaur

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—PALEONTOLOGIC RESOURCES

(ceratopsian) discovered about 15 miles southeast of Point of Rocks near the old Black Butte Stage
Station in 1872. These remains were identified as the new species Agathaumus sylvestris by Cope in 1872
and represent the first dinosaur remains found in strata now referred to as the Lance Formation.
Within the project area, the Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation consists of up to 2,900 feet of interbedded
gray sandstone and sandy mudstone, carbonaceous shale, and coal. The Lance Formation is well-known
for its dinosaurian remains (Breithaupt 1982); however, the only Lance fossil vertebrates found within the
project area are some rare fish and crocodilian remains, as well as a few mammal teeth collected from
anthills (J.G. Honey 2003). The provenance of these remains is uncertain, but they probably came from
poorly developed paleosols.
Fort Union Formation

The Fort Union Formation is exposed within the project area as up to 3,400 feet of drab mudstone, sandy
mudstone, sandstone, carbonaceous shales, and coal. Fossil vertebrates—especially mammals—are wellknown from Fort Union rocks in and adjoining the study area (Rigby 1980; J.G. Honey 2003), the most
noteworthy localities being Swain Quarry, in Section 3, T15 N:R 92 W, and another site in the basal part
of the formation discovered by J.G. Honey, the paleontologist cited in the reference above. Swain Quarry
yields principally mammal teeth from a sandstone, and both that site and the new site discovered by
Honey are almost certainly gradual active accumulations of bones on point bars of meandering streams.
Winterfeld (1982) has recorded the occurrences of fossil vertebrates in greenish to greenish-gray Fort
Union mudstones. As these deposits are relatively thin and tabular in nature, it is quite likely that they
represent the “A” horizons of relatively mature damp paleosols, and are therefore passive accumulations.
Wasatch Formation

The Ramsey Ranch Member, Main Body of the Wasatch Formation and the Niland and Cathedral Bluffs
Tongues of the Wasatch comprise bedrock exposures of the Wasatch Formation within the project area.
Numerous fossil vertebrates, invertebrates, and trace fossils are known from the Main Body throughout
southern Wyoming (Granger 1916; Gazin 1952, 1956, 1962; 1965; McGrew and Roehler 1960; West
1973), including deposits previously referred to as the Knight and Almy “formations” by Veatch (1907).
These fossils include somewhat more primitive forms of rodents, carnivores, early horses, artiodactyls,
and condylarths than those in the stratigraphically younger Cathedral Bluffs Member and range between
early to middle early Eocene (early to late Wasatchian) in age.
Fossil vertebrates are locally abundant in the Wasatch Formation, including all the subunits that comprise
the formation in the project area. Fossils are most abundant where they have weathered from immature
through mature paleosols. However, about 10 miles north of Baggs, Wyoming, sandstones of the
Cathedral Bluff Member that interfingers with the Tipton Shale have produced fossils of 11 mammalian
species including primates, condylarths, tillodonts, dinocerates, and perissodactyls (Roehler 1988) as well
as the fossils of mollusks, ostracodes, and burrows, worm trails, and an unidentified tubular impression.
The mollusks include very abundant shells of the gastropods Goniabasis and Viviparu,s as well as
freshwater unionid bivalves. These fossil-bearing sandstones represent deposition in a delta system
prograding into Lake Gosuite. West of the project area, Wasatch vertebrates are described as coming from
drab, carbonaceous mudstones containing the remains of terrestrial mollusks (Savage et al. 1972; Gazin,
1962; Savage and Waters, 1978; Williams and Covert, 1994). These deposits appear to be damp
paleosols.
Green River Formation
The Laney Shale (including LaClede and Hartt Cabin beds), Godiva Rim, Wilkins Peak (lower part only)
members and Tipton (including the Scheggs and Rife beds) and Luman tongues comprise bedrock
exposures of the Green River Formation within the project area (Roehler 1991a, 1991b, 1992a, 1992b,
1992c, 1993).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT— PALEONTOLOGIC RESOURCES

Apparently, the only fossils known from the Godiva Rim Member are ostracodes. The Laney Shale is
quite fossil-rich in places and is well-known for its fossil fish. Fossil gastropods, bivalves, and fish are
common in the LaClede Bed. Small planorbid gastropod fossils of Gyralus militaris are extremely
abundant and widespread in one particular layer (about a foot thick) that is recognized as a stratigraphic
marker bed, the Gyralus Marker Bed. Impressions of plants and insects also occur in some shales of the
LaClede Bed. Stromatolites—the remains of ancient reefs—also characterize the unit. Some of the
stromatolies may be as much as 25 feet high and 10 feet wide. The Hartt Cabin Bed produces abundant
fossil vertebrates, mostly fish, but also reptiles and mammals, along the eastern edge of the Washakie
Basin at Willow Creek.
Plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossils have been reported from the Wilkins Peak Member
elsewhere in Wyoming (Grande 1984, 1989; Olsen 1987, 1992). Roehler (1974) noted a fossil bird
locality in the member south of Rock Springs at Scrivner Butte. Another fossil bird locality occurs a few
miles away in the Four J Rim Quadrangle. This locality has yielded the dissociated skeletons, including
skulls, of the wading bird Presbyornis. The number of individual birds preserved in the layer may number
into the many thousands. Hundreds of fossil flamingo bones, apparently the remains of a large nesting
colony, have been collected from a locality developed in rocks of the lower part of the member at a
locality discovered near Oregon Buttes in gray-green lake claystone (McGrew and Feduccia 1973). The
locality was originally described as occurring in the Cathedral Bluffs Member of the Wasatch Formation,
but its location in lake sediments means that the locality actually occurs in the Wilkins Peak Member.
The Scheggs Bed preserves the fossil remains of ostracodes, gastropods, such as Goniabasis tenera and
Viviparus sp., and the large unionid bivalve Lampsilis. Fish fossils also occur abundantly along outcrops
of the Scheggs Bed (Roehler 1991a, 1991b, 1992a, 1992b, 1992c, 1993). One fossil mammal locality
occurs in the Scheggs Bed and this locality, discovered in an ostracodal limestone along Parnel Creek a
few miles north of Rock Springs, (T24N:R102W) produced the mold of a jaw of the early horse
Hyracotherium, with incisors and molar impressions. Roehler (1992c) noted that fossil fish are locally
abundant in the Rife Bed in the Sand Wash and Washakie basins.
Fossils of freshwater molluscs are abundant throughout the Luman Tongue and the assemblages of fossils
are commonly characterized by the large prosobranch gastropods Goniabasis tenera and Viviparus sp.
and by the large unionid bivalve, Lampsilis sp. Fish, ostracod, and trace fossils are also common in the
unit.
Battle Spring Formation
The Battle Spring Formation was named by Pipiringos (1955) for up to 3,300 feet of arkosic sandstone
that “… intertongues with … the Red Desert, Niland, and Cathedral Bluffs tongues of the Wasatch
Formation, and the Lumen and Tipton tongues and Laney Shale Member of the Green River Formation”
(Pipiringos 1961). Love and Christiansen (1985) mapped Battle Spring rocks as far south as I-80 west of
Rawlins, and included in it several hundred feet of gray, green, gold, and red mudstones, thin arkosic
ribbon sandstones, and carbonaceous shales. No fossil vertebrates have been reported from Battle Spring
rocks within the project area; however, bone fragments, including one of a fossil bird, were found in red
mudstones (paleosols) during a reconnaissance survey for this study.

3.3

SOILS

Soils in the CD-C project area vary widely, but are predominantly formed from residuum on bedrockcontrolled uplands and alluvium in playas (BLM 1999). Residuum refers to unconsolidated, weathered, or
partly weathered mineral material that accumulates by disintegration of bedrock in place. Variable
average annual precipitation patterns exist across the project area, with three different precipitation
gradients that range from 7 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 inches. The project area is dominated by the 10- to
14-inch precipitation zone with the northwest corner of the project area in the 7- to 9-inch precipitation

zone and a small portion in the southeast area in the 15- to 19-inch precipitation zone (Texas Resource
Consultants [TRC] 1981; Wells et al. [Wells] 1981).
Two Order 3 soil surveys were previously completed by the BLM in cooperation with the Soil
Conservation Service [now known as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS] for most of the
CD-C project area (TRC 1981; Wells et al. 1981). For areas not covered by the existing soil surveys,
Order 3 field mapping was completed by KC Harvey Environmental, LLC during May 2007. During the
field mapping, existing soil-mapping units from the TRC and Wells 1981 surveys were extended into the
unmapped areas of the project area using aerial imagery. The proposed soil map unit boundaries in the
unmapped areas were then verified in the field by sampling the soils to a depth of 60 inches with a
Giddings probe (Giddings Machine Company, Colorado).
A total of 387 soil complexes, associations, taxadjuncts, and variant map units occur within the 1,070,086
acres that comprise the CD-C project area. A total of 286 soil series comprise the 387 map units.
The majority of the project area is used as rangeland for domestic livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and
recreation. A small portion of the area is used for production of native hay, both irrigated and dryland,
and utilization of wood for fence posts and firewood (TRC 1981; Wells et al. 1981). Since the 1950s,
development of the area’s natural gas resources has become a major land use.
3.3.1

General Description of Major Soil Types

Soils in the project area were formed from erosion of bedrock exposed at the surface and from lacustrine,
alluvium, loess, and eolian deposits (BLM 1999). The parent material in the project area is dominated by
tertiary shales and sandstones and uplifted cretaceous sedimentary rock (Munn and Arneson 1998). Soils
on the tertiary bedrock are poorly developed with little clay accumulation. Sandy soils occur on stabilized
sand dunes and in areas with active dunes. Saline soils exist in playas, and sodic soils occur on alluvial
fans derived from high-sodium parent materials. The project area contains soil orders of alfisols,
inceptisols, mollisols, and aridisols. All soils within the project area have a frigid temperature regime.
Soil texture is a mix of fine-loamy, coarse-loamy, and sandy materials. Slopes are generally level to
undulating (zero–10 percent) and are separated by areas with steeper slopes (10–40 percent) to vertical
slopes (rock outcrops).
3.3.2

Soil Limitations

To assess the potential limitations of the CD-C project area soils, five areas of concern were addressed:
water erosion, wind erosion, runoff potential, local road construction limitations, and reclamation
potential. These were evaluated using soils information from the two soil surveys completed by the BLM
(TRC 1981; Wells et al. 1981). Results are summarized in Table 3.3-1 and a discussion of each category
is provided below.
Information from individual soil map units was used to evaluate the soil limitations. If multiple soil series
existed within a single map unit, rankings were assigned based on the soil series that comprised the
greatest acreage within the unit. To provide the most unbiased ranking, assignments were made using the
relative size of the included soil series rather than the most limiting or the least limiting soil series within
the map unit.
To ascertain the distribution of potential soil limitations for existing natural gas disturbances, the number
of current wells drilled in each of the rating class areas for each limitation was determined.

3.3.2.1

Water Erosion

To assess the potential for soil erosion caused by water, the soil erosion factor (K) obtained from data
recorded by TRC and Wells in 1981 and soil slope data were used to rank the CD-C project area soils for
susceptibility to erosion. Slope data were derived from the digital elevation model for the project area.
The K indicates the susceptibility of a soil to sheet and rill erosion (Institute of Water Research 2002). It
is one of the six factors used in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation to predict the average annual
rate of soil loss by water erosion. The K is based on percentage of silt, sand, organic matter, soil structure,
and hydraulic conductivity. The soil-surface horizon K was used to group the project area soils into
water-erosion classes.
The values for K factors and slope ranges used to group the soil into slight, moderate, and severe watererosion classes are provided in Table 3.3-2. The K value and percent slope data were queried to
determine the surface area relative to the slight, moderate, and severe erosion classes. These data were
plotted on Map 3.3-1 to illustrate the potential for water erosion in the CD-C project area. Overall, the
susceptibility to water erosion is slight, with 748,850 acres or 69.9 percent of the project area rated as
having slight water-erosion potential (Table 3.3-1). Only 4.3 percent of the project area, or 45,808 acres,
is rated as having a severe water-erosion potential. The large percentage of area classified as having slight
water-erosion potential is controlled by the flat slopes that occur throughout the project area.

At present 72.8 percent of the total wells currently drilled within the CD-C project area are located within
soils that have a slight risk for water erosion.
3.3.2.2

Wind Erosion

To assess the potential of soil erosion by wind, the wind-erodibility class was obtained from data recorded
by Texas Resource Consultants (1981) and Wells et al. (1981). Wind-erodibility groups are made up of
soils that have similar properties affecting their resistance to wind erosion in cultivated areas. Soils are
grouped according to percent sand, silt, and clay; calcium carbonate content; presence of surficial coarse
fragments; and surface-wetness conditions.
The potential for wind erosion in the CD-C project area is shown on Map 3.3-2. Soils within the 1 and 2
wind-erodibility groups are classified as a severe limitation for wind erosion; soils in the 3, 4, and 4L
wind-erodibility groups are considered as a moderate limitation for wind erosion; and soils in the 5, 6, 7,
and 8 wind-erodibility groups have a slight limitation for wind erosion (TRC 1981, Wells et al. 1981). A
moderate limitation because of wind erosion exists for 80 percent of the total project area or 859,633
acres (Table 3.3-1). Only 9.4 percent or 100,534 acres and 6.1 percent or 65,204 acres, respectively, are
rated to have slight and severe limitations to wind erosion, respectively.
At this time, 78 percent of the total wells currently drilled within the CD-C project area are located within
soils that have a moderate limitation for wind erosion.

3.3.2.3

Runoff Potential

To assess the potential for surface runoff, the hydrologic soil group was obtained from Texas Resource
Consultants (1981) and Wells et al. (1981). The hydrologic soil group classifies soils according to their
runoff-producing characteristics, which include depth to the water table, infiltration rate, permeability
after prolonged wetting, and depth to the lowest permeable layer. Also, site-specific factors relating to
management practices are considered, such as compaction, crusting, organic matter, and vegetative cover.
The hydrologic group rating only considers the potential for runoff when soils are thoroughly wet and
does not consider the slope of the soil.
The potential for surface runoff in the CD-C project area is shown on Map 3.3-3. Soils within Hydrologic
Soil Group A are considered to have a low runoff potential, Hydrologic Soil Group B soils have a
moderate runoff potential, and Hydrologic Soil Groups C and D soils are considered to have a high runoff
potential. Surface-runoff potential was predominantly moderate, composing 34 percent of the project area
or 362,499 acres (Table 3.3-1). A rating of high runoff potential was given to 299,336 acres or 28 percent
of the CD-C project area.
At this time, 36 percent of the total wells currently drilled within the CD-C project area are located within
soils that have a moderate runoff potential.
3.3.2.4

Road Construction

To assess the degree of limitation to the construction of roads, unsurfaced road ratings were obtained
from TRC (1981) and Wells et al. (1981). Road rankings were based on depth to bedrock, soil strength,
shrink/swell potential, soil texture, large surface stones, slope, and surface wetness.
The potential limitation for the construction of roads in the CD-C project area is shown in Map 3.3-4.
The CD-C project area is predominantly rated as having a moderate limitation for road construction, with
63.5 percent, or 680,344 acres, having this rating (Table 3.3-1). The limiting features to road construction
are provided in Table 3.3-1. Soil strength, depth to bedrock, and sandy soil textures are the main
limitations to construction in the CD-C project area.
At present, 64 percent of the total wells currently drilled within the CD-C project area are located within
soils that have moderate limitations to road construction.
3.3.2.5

Reclamation Potential

Reclamation is the reconstruction of topographic, soil, and plant conditions following disturbance to
allow the area to fully function as part of the ecosystem (Munshower 1994). The BLM’s long-term
objective of final reclamation is to set the course for eventual ecosystem restoration, including the
restoration of the natural vegetation community, hydrology, and wildlife habitats. In most cases, this
means returning the land to a condition approximating or equal to that which existed prior to the
disturbance. The Operator must achieve short-term stability, visual, hydrological, and productivity
objectives of the surface-management agency and must take steps to ensure long-term objectives will be
reached though natural processes (USDI and USDA 2006).
To determine reclamation potential of the CD-C project area soils, the topsoil rating presented in the soil
surveys prepared by Texas Resource Consultants (1981) and Wells et al. (1981) was used as a direct
correlation of the soil reclamation potential. Soils having good, fair, or poor topsoil ratings are classified
on Map 3.3-5 as having good, fair, and poor reclamation potential, respectively. The soil classifications
defined in the soils survey are influenced by many factors such as rainfall, slope, and aspect in addition to
the physical and chemical composition of the soil. The direct correlation used between topsoil rating and
soil reclamation potential indirectly considers the factors that would be favorable or unfavorable for soil
reclamation.

The reclamation potential of the CD-C project area is primarily poor, with 537,228 acres or 50 percent of
the total project acreage having this rating (Map 3.3-5, Table 3.3-1). Locations identified as “No Rating”
on Map 3.3-5 generally consist of rock outcrops or rock surfaces that did not include a topsoil rating since
topsoil is not present in these locations.
Rankings of fair and good were given to 25 percent or 269,565 acres, and 21 percent or 221,785 acres of
the CD-C project area, respectively. The limiting features to reclamation are provided in Table 3.3-1.
Saline/sodic soil conditions and either clayey or sandy soil textures are the main limitations to
reclamation of the CD-C project area.
At this time, 57 percent of the total wells currently drilled within the CD-C project area are located within
soils that have poor reclamation potential. For the currently drilled well locations with limitations to
reclamation, the main limitation to reclamation is saline/sodic soil conditions.
3.3.3

Watershed-Based Land Health Assessment

In 2008 the RFO finished conducting Standards and Guidelines Assessments for all the watersheds within
the field office. These are watershed-based land health assessments mandated by the Director of the BLM
on a 10-year basis. From 1998 through 2000, the RFO conducted Standards and Guidelines Assessments
on an allotment basis; however, in 200, in order to meet this 10-year timeframe, larger-scale watershedbased reports were undertaken. The Upper Colorado River and the Great Divide Basin were the first two
watershed reports completed (2002 and 2003, respectively), and are due for reassessment over the next
three years, at which time progress towards management objectives will be evaluated. Standard 1 –
Watershed Health, states that “[w]ithin the potential of the ecological site (soil type, landform, climate,
and geology), soils are stable and allow for water infiltration to provide for optimal plant growth and
minimal surface runoff” (BLM 2001a). Standard 1 is considered met if upland soil cover generally
exceeds 30 percent and obvious signs of soil erosion are not apparent, and if stream channels are stable
and improving in morphology. Key watershed health-related issues identified by the Standards and
Guidelines Assessment for the Upper Colorado River and Great Divide Basin include erosion from
improved and unimproved roads, and short- and long-term erosion from oil and gas field development.
During the 2001 field season, project area watersheds within the Upper Colorado River Basin were
assessed (BLM 2002). Barrel Springs Draw, a sub-watershed within the Muddy Creek watershed, and the
Lower Sand Creek sub-watershed within the Little Snake River watershed, were determined to meet
Standard 1. The Upper Muddy Creek and Lower Muddy Creek sub-watersheds within the Muddy Creek
watershed did not meet Standard 1. Holler Draw and Chicken Springs Wash in the Upper Muddy Creek
watershed (2,500 acres), and Little Robber and Cottonwood Creek in the Lower Muddy Creek watershed
(6,000 acres) have large, active head-cuts caused by gradient readjustment processes; therefore, because
the stream channels are not stable, these areas did not meet Standard 1.
During the 2002 field season, project area watersheds within the Great Divide Basin were assessed (BLM
2003). All sub-watersheds, including Battle Springs Flat, Buck Draw, Cyclone Draw, Latham Draw, Red
Creek, Red Desert Basin, Red Wash Draw, Salt Sage Draw, and Upper Separation Creek were determined
to meet Standard 1.

WATER RESOURCES

Water resources in the CD-C project area include both surface water and groundwater. A majority
(approximately 70 percent) of the project area is located within the Great Divide Basin (hydrologic unit
code [HUC] 14040200). Approximately 29 percent of the project area is within the White-Yampa Basin
(HUC 140500) and 1 percent is within the Upper Green Basin (HUC 140401). Watershed basins within
the project area are shown on Map 3.4-1. Surface water in the Great Divide Basin drains internally, with
no surface hydrologic outlet. The Upper Green and White-Yampa watersheds are part of the Upper
Colorado Basin (HUC 14).
Groundwater resources in the project area include unconfined (water table) and confined aquifers. The
unconfined aquifers are generally shallow, blanket-type deposits of Quaternary or Tertiary age and are
generally found within 400–600 feet of the ground surface. Alluvial deposits fall into this category.
Confined aquifers are bound by relatively impermeable rocks and are generally in the deeper formations,
such as the Mesaverde Group. Most of the geologic formations of pre-Oligocene age in the project area
contain water under confined pressure (Welder and McGreevy 1966). Conventional oil and gas wells
would be completed in the Almond Formation in the Mesaverde Group at depths between 8,000 and
12,000 feet. Coalbed natural gas (CBNG) development, if undertaken, would primarily target the Fort
Union Formation with secondary reserves targeted in the Wasatch, Frontier, and Lance formations at
depths between 550 and 7,700 feet.
3.4.1

Climate and Precipitation

Climate and precipitation, as detailed in Section 3.5 (Air Quality), greatly influence the character and
condition of the surface and groundwater resources. The project area is located in a continental dry, cold­
temperature-subarctic climate (Trewartha 1968). The climate is characterized by precipitation deficiency,
where potential evaporation exceeds precipitation. Temperatures are generally cold, with fewer than eight
months of the year having an average temperature greater than 50° F. Summer days are warm, summer
nights are cool, and winters are cold. Strong and prolonged winds periodically sweep the project area
throughout the year, being especially prevalent in winter.
These climatic conditions (low precipitation and high evaporation rates) result in the prevalence of
surface water features in the project area with ephemeral or intermittent flows. The climatic conditions are
reflected in the limited amount of shallow groundwater and the prevalence of confined aquifer systems.
Recharge to the groundwater systems generally occurs at higher, distant elevations, with limited local
recharge to the shallow aquifers.
3.4.2

Surface Water

There are three major drainage basins associated with the project area (Map 3.4-1). The Continental
Divide runs east and west across the central portion of the project area. Drainages in the project area south
of the Continental Divide flow into the Upper Green Basin or the White-Yampa Basin. Tributaries to
Bitter Creek drain the portion of the project area within the Upper Green Basin. Bitter Creek flows to the
Green River, which flows to the Colorado River, and ultimately to the Pacific Ocean. Tributaries to the
Little Snake River drain the portion of the project area within the White-Yampa Basin. The Little Snake
River flows to the Yampa River, which flows southwest to its confluence with the Green River in
Colorado. Drainage north of the Continental Divide is contained in the Great Divide Basin. As mentioned
above, the Great Divide Basin is internally drained, with no surface hydrologic outlet.
Just over 1 percent of the project area is within the Upper Green Basin. Tributaries to Bitter Creek (Red
Wash and Laney Wash) begin in the project area and flow out of the area to the southwest (Map 3.4-1).
Surface water hydrology data are limited for the portion of the project area within the Upper Green Basin
due to the dry nature of the climate and resulting minimal stream-flow in the area.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

Very small portions of the White-Yampa Basin within the project area are drained by Willow
Creek/Shallow Creek (tributaries to Sand Creek) and the North Prong of Red Creek. The remainder of the
White-Yampa Basin within the project area is drained by Muddy Creek and its tributaries. Muddy Creek
is the dominant water feature within the project area and it flows into the perennial Little Snake River,
immediately south of the project area (Map 3.4-1).
Most surface water flow within the Great Divide Basin is ephemeral (occurring only in response to
localized rainfall or snowmelt) or intermittent (flowing water during certain times of the year, when
groundwater provides water for stream flow). The only streams in the Great Divide Basin with perennial
flow are the upper portion of Separation Creek, in the Atlantic Rim area, and Lost Soldier Creek, in the
Green Mountain area. Lost Soldier Creek is not within the project area. A majority (approximately 85
percent) of the Great Divide Basin drainage area within the project area drains internally, not leaving the
project area. Approximately 10 percent of the Great Divide Basin drainage area within the project area
receives run-on from other areas in the basin (Bear Creek, Red Creek, Lost Creek, and Stewart Creek to
the north, and Smiley Draw to the west). Surface water from the remaining 5 percent of the project area in
the Great Divide Basin drains to the east off the project area by way of Creston Draw, Buck Draw, and
Fillmore Creek, which are tributaries to Separation Creek. Major surface water features within the Great
Divide Basin associated with the project area are shown on Map 3.4-2.
3.4.2.1

Surface Water Location and Quantity

Detailed information regarding surface water quantity within the project area is provided in Appendix F,
Water Resources Supplemental Data. Historic flow data are available near the project area from one
station on Muddy Creek (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] Station 09259000) and one station on the Little
Snake River (USGS Station 09257000). Current flow data are available from one station, monitored
between 2004 and the present, on Muddy Creek (USGS Station 09258980). Historic flow data in the
Great Divide Basin are available near the project area from two stations on Separation Creek (USGS
Stations 09216525 and 09216527). Although all five of these stations are outside of the project area, they
represent the nearest USGS flow monitoring stations.
Upper Green Basin
A very small portion of the project area drains into the Upper Green Basin (Map 3.4-1). Less than one
percent of the project area is drained by tributaries to Bitter Creek (HUC 14040105). Bitter Creek is a
perennial stream that flows into the Green River approximately 50 miles west of the project area.
Historical flow data (1975-1981) are available from one monitoring station on Bitter Creek (USGS
Station 09216545). Flow data from this station varied widely, from zero to 333 cubic feet per second
(cfs).
White-Yampa Basin
Approximately 29 percent of the project area is drained by the White-Yampa Basin (Map 3.4-1).
Watersheds within the White-Yampa Basin that are associated with the project area include the Muddy
Creek Sub-basin (HUC 14050004) and the Little Snake Sub-basin (HUC 14050003).
Muddy Creek begins in the Sierra Madre Range, east of the project area. Muddy Creek and its ephemeral
tributaries, including Barrel Springs Draw (and its tributaries North Barrel Springs Draw and Windmill
Draw), Blue Gap Draw, Robbers Gulch, and Red Wash, are included in this sub-basin. Muddy Creek
flows west to Wyoming State Highway (WY) 789, where it enters the project area. It then flows south,
meandering in and out of the project area, to its confluence with the Little Snake River near Baggs,
Wyoming, approximately 6 miles south of the project area (Map 3.4-1). The Muddy Creek watershed
encompasses approximately 1,200 square miles (mi2) and ranges in elevation from about 6,300 to about
8,200 feet.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

Muddy Creek is a high-elevation, cold-desert stream. Streamflow varies with location along the drainage.
Muddy Creek exhibits perennial flow for the majority of its length, and in some years flows intermittently
because of irrigation water removal south of the George Dew/Red Wash wetlands complex. In years with
high runoff amounts, Muddy Creek flows perennially throughout its length. Snowmelt (typically March to
mid-June) produces significant runoff from higher elevations of the watershed, east of the project area.
The intermittent stream flow that is present in some reaches below the George Dew/Red Wash wetlands
complex is due to contributions from springs, seeps, and flowing wells. High-flow events can occur in
response to precipitation events during the summer and fall months.
Flow in the tributaries to Muddy Creek is predominantly ephemeral, responding to localized snowmelt
and rainfall events, but tributaries may also experience some intermittent flow due to contributions from
springs and seeps. Tributary channels are generally dry and prone to flashy, periodic flood events from
isolated thunderstorm systems from May to October.
Beatty (2005) divided Muddy Creek into two major segments: upper Muddy Creek and lower Muddy
Creek (Map 3.4-1). The upper segment is identified as that portion of the watershed upstream of a large
headcut stabilization structure that is located in Section 11, T17N: R92W. This structure is located just
downstream of where Muddy Creek crosses the ARPA boundary and just upstream of where Muddy
Creek crosses WY 789 (Map 3.4-1). The four primary tributaries mentioned above are within the lower
segment, which extends from the large headcut stabilization structure to the Little Snake River
confluence. Lower Muddy Creek is highly erosional and has abundant channel incisions (Beatty 2005).
Channel substrates in the lower segment consist of very fine-grained sediments (sands, silts, and clays). A
large wetland complex (George Dew/Red Wash) occurs on the reach of Muddy Creek that lies west of
WY 789 (Map 3.4-2). This wetland area consists of impoundments, artificially constructed channels,
vertical drop structures, headgate structures for water diversion, overflow spillways, and a braided streamchannel network.
The historical mean flow rates at two USGS Stations (09259000 and 09258980) on Muddy Creek near
Baggs were 14.8 cubic feet per second (cfs) and 18.0 cfs, respectively. Calculated median flows at the
same two stations were 2.8 cfs and 1.1 cfs (USGS 2011a). Median flows are generally more
representative of the central tendency of the data because outliers (highest and lowest flow rates) can
dramatically impact the average whereas the median is less affected. Because precipitation varies
significantly from year to year, annual runoff values can vary significantly. Based on the 1,200 mi2
drainage area and a 2004-2010 average annual runoff of 14,360 acre feet per year, the unit runoff for the
Muddy Creek at USGS Station 09258980 is about 0.2 inch per year (USGS 2011a).
The Upper Muddy Creek Watershed/Grizzly Wildlife Habitat Management Area (Grizzly WHMA) is
located primarily east of the CD-C project area (Map 3.9-5). The western-most portion of the Grizzly
WHMA lies within the CD-C project area. The WHMA consists of 59,477 acres of public lands surface in
a checkerboard pattern. The goal of the WHMA is to “manage habitat for the Colorado River fish species
unique to the Muddy Creek watershed” (BLM 2008a). In the Grizzly WHMA, the WGFD has been
working with the BLM, the grazing permittee, and the Little Snake River Conservation District (LSRCD)
to implement similar measures. According to the Rawlins RMP, the area is open to oil and gas leasing
with intensive management of surface-disturbing and disruptive activities (BLM 2008a).
Willow Creek/Shallow Creek (tributaries to Sand Creek) and the North Prong of Red Creek are drainages
in the Little Snake Sub-basin that drain a small portion of the project area. Sand Creek and the North
Prong of Red Creek flow into the Little Snake River approximately 8 miles from the southwest corner of
the project area boundary (Map 3.4-1). Willow Creek/Shallow Creek and the North Prong of Red Creek
are unclassified ephemeral drainages. No flow data are available for Willow Creek or the North Prong of
Red Creek. The Little Snake River originates in the Sierra Madre Range and flows southwest into
Colorado. The historical (1910–1923 and 1938–1971) mean flow rate at USGS Station 09259000 on the
Little Snake River near Dixon was 514.3 cfs. Calculated median flow at the same station was 100.0 cfs

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 14, 2012

3-33

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

(USGS 2011a). Because precipitation varies significantly from year to year, annual runoff values can vary
significantly. Based on the 988 mi2 drainage area above USGS Station 0925700 and a 1911-1971 average
annual runoff of 372,355 acre feet per year, the unit runoff for the Little Snake River at USGS Station
09257000 is about 7.1 inches per year (USGS 2011a).
Great Divide Basin
The northern 70 percent of the project area is within the Great Divide Basin, a closed basin that is
bounded by the Continental Divide on all sides and has no surface hydrologic outlet (USGS 1976; Seaber
et al. 1987). The Great Divide Basin is a relatively shallow depression with isolated buttes, pan-like
depressions, and sparse vegetation. In general, streams within the Great Divide Basin are ephemeral, but
can be intermittent in sections (Lowham et al. 1976). The only streams in the Great Divide Basin with
perennial flow are the upper portion of Separation Creek, in the Atlantic Rim area and Lost Soldier Creek,
in the Green Mountain area. Numerous ephemeral streams flow toward the center of the Basin and
terminate in natural or artificially constructed impoundments or disappear due to losses to diversions,
evaporation, and/or infiltration (seepage). There are some spring-fed systems such as the Battle Springs
Flat and unique alkaline wetland systems around Chain Lakes. Since a majority of the project area is
within the Great Divide basin and since it is a closed basin, a majority of the surface water flow
originating in the CD-C project area terminates within the project boundary.
The Chain Lakes wetlands are located in the north central portion of the CD-C project area (Map 3.4-2).
They are managed cooperatively by the WGFD and BLM as the Chain Lakes WHMA. The Chain Lakes
WHMA consists of 30,560 acres of public lands in a checkerboard pattern. This area is one of the lowest
topographic regions (6,500 feet in elevation) within the Great Divide Basin, resulting in numerous
shallow lakes that are alkaline due to the lack of external water outlets. The annual precipitation of less
than 7 inches, high evaporative loss rates, and surface salt crusting also contribute to shaping this
community. The lakes and adjacent moist soils support a variety of plant and animal species adapted to
this environment. The goal of the Chain Lakes WHMA is to “manage the unique, fragile, and rare
alkaline desert lake system and wildlife habitat values associated with the lake system” (BLM 2008a).
According to the approved Rawlins Resource Management Plan (RMP), the area is open to oil and gas
leasing with intensive management of surface disturbing and disruptive activities (BLM 2008a).
While a majority of the surface water flow originating in the project area terminates within the project
boundary, the majority of surface water leaving the project area in the Great Divide Basin flows into
Separation Creek via Fillmore Creek and Creston Draw. Separation Creek flows adjacent to and east of
the CD-C project area to Separation Lake. Separation Creek is, for most of its length, an ephemeral
stream. It exhibits perennial flow in its upper reaches. Average flows documented at the two stations near
Riner are 1.3 to 1.8 cfs. Estimated annual runoff volume for downstream reaches of Separation Creek is
2,500 acre-feet (Larson and Zimmerman 1981). Fillmore Creek is an ephemeral stream (WDEQ 2001)
that flows only in response to snowmelt or rainstorms, with snowmelt as the biggest contributor. Springs
provide minor flow in the upstream reaches.
Several other small ephemeral streams flow out of the project area but also have no outlets from the Great
Divide Basin.
Reservoirs, Lakes, and Ponds
According to the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office (SEO) database, there are 286 reservoirs with valid
water rights within the project area (SEO 2011). Approximately 96 percent (274) of these water bodies
have an appropriated use of stock. Major reservoirs within the CD-C project area are shown on Map 3.42. A complete list of valid surface-water rights associated with reservoirs, lakes, and ponds is included in
Appendix F, Water Resources Supplemental Data.

Wetlands
Wetlands are aquatic features defined as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do
support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands
generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas” (33 CFR 328.3(b)). The prolonged presence
of water creates conditions that favor the growth of specially adapted plants and promote the development
of characteristic wetland (hydric) soils (EPA 2007). Vegetation in wetland environments is highly
productive and diverse and provides habitat for many wildlife species. These systems as a whole play
important roles in controlling floodwaters, recharging groundwater, and filtering pollutants (Niering
1985).
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) administers a regulatory program under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act (CWA), which requires a permit for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into
Waters of the U.S. (WoUS), including jurisdictional wetlands. This regulatory program requires that an
inventory of all WoUS, including wetlands, be performed; permits be acquired prior to dredging or filling
jurisdictional wetlands; and impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and Other Waters of the U.S. (OWUS) be
adequately mitigated.
Formal wetland delineations have not been confirmed by the USACE for the project area. A preliminary
evaluation of potential wetlands within the project area was completed using National Wetland Inventory
(NWI) mapping. According to the NWI mapping, prominent natural wetland systems are found near
internally drained sub basins in the northern portion of the project area within the Great Divide Basin
(Hay Reservoir area, Lost Creek Basin, Battle Springs Flat, and Chain Lakes Flat) and artificially
constructed/enhanced wetlands occur along Muddy Creek (George Dew/Red Wash wetland complex) in
the southern portion of the project area (Map 3.4-2). There are also a large number of small wetlands
linked to natural or artificially constructed impoundments throughout the project area. The vegetation
types associated with riparian/wetlands habitats are discussed in Section 3.6.2.9.
3.4.2.2

Surface Water Use

As of February 2011, the SEO had a total of 383 permitted surface water rights on record within and 1
mile adjacent to the project area (SEO 2011). Stock use was associated with 334 of the surface water
rights. Surface water rights were also associated with irrigation (39), wetlands and fisheries (30),
miscellaneous (13), reservoir supply (12), industrial/oil (10), domestic (7), temporary use (4), flow
through non-consumptive (2), wildlife (2), flood control (1), recreation (1), and unspecified (1). The total
for permitted uses exceeds the number of permitted surface water rights due to the fact that many of the
surface water rights were permitted for multiple uses. A complete list of valid surface-water rights is
included in Appendix F.
WDEQ classifies Wyoming surface water resources according to the water body’s use designation. More
detailed information regarding surface-water use classifications are presented in Appendix F.
Ten lakes and reservoirs within the project area are classified for use by WDEQ (Map 3.4-2). None of the
lakes or reservoirs in the project area are classified for outstanding value (Class 1). The highest
classification on lakes and reservoirs within the project area is drinking water (Class 2AB). One reservoir
(Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir) is within this classification. The highest classification for five of the
lakes/reservoirs is fish consumption (Class 3A). The highest use classification for the remaining four
water bodies is other aquatic life (Class 3B).
Seventeen streams and springs within the project area and two near the project area are classified by the
WDEQ. None of the streams in or near the project area are classified for outstanding use (Class 1). The
Little Snake River, located near the project area, is classified for use as drinking water (2AB). The highest
classification for two streams within or near the project area is non-game fish (2C). The highest

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 14, 2012

3-35

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

classification for 14 of the 19 streams/springs is other aquatic life (Class 3B). The highest classification
for the remaining two streams is for non-aquatic life use (Class 4B/C).
3.4.2.3

Surface Water Quality

In the arid high plains of southwestern Wyoming, surface-water quality, like stream flow, is variable both
spatially and temporally. Perennial stream water is generally of better quality than that of the ephemeral
and intermittent streams. The quality of runoff is largely dependent upon the amount of salts, sediments,
and organic materials that accumulate in dry stream channels between periods of runoff. Factors that can
govern the amount of buildup of these materials are a basin’s physical characteristics, land uses, and
season of the year. More detailed information regarding water quality is presented in Appendix F.
According to Section 3.3 Soils, the project area contains many types of topsoil that are saline or sodic.
These soils, when eroded as a result of runoff events, can make salt available for dissolution into surface
waters. Approximately 70 percent of the entire project area was rated as having slight water erosion
potential, approximately 22 percent had moderate water erosion potential, and just over 4 percent had
severe water erosion potential (the remaining 4 percent was not rated). Nearly 73 percent of existing
project area disturbance is located on lands with slight water erosion potential, nearly 22 percent on lands
with moderate water erosion potential, and 3 percent on lands with severe water erosion potential (the
remaining 3 percent was not rated) (Section 3.3.2 Soil Limitations).
Various federal and state agencies (e.g., USGS, BLM, EPA, and WDEQ) have monitored surface-water
quality in and around the project area. Surface water samples have been analyzed for physical and
chemical properties, salinity, and major ions. From this pool of existing water quality data, representative
surface-water quality data were selected for inclusion in this EIS based on selecting sites on significant
surface water courses and the availability of multiple samples from a particular site. Surface water quality
data were evaluated from ten water-quality monitoring stations. Detailed information regarding surfacewater quality within the project area is provided in Appendix F.
Surface water quality information in the Upper Green and White-Yampa sub-basin is available near the
project area from two stations on the Little Snake River (USGS Stations 09257000 and 09259050), four
stations on Muddy Creek (USGS stations 09258900, 09258050, 09258980, and 09259000), one station on
Lower Barrel Springs Draw (USGS Station 09216310), and one station on Bitter Creek (USGS Station
09216545). Six of the seven sampling stations in the Upper Green and White-Yampa sub-basin are
outside of the project area but indicate water quality of streams leaving the project area. Historic surfacewater quality data in the Great Divide Basin are available for Fillmore Creek (USGS Station 09219240),
the Chain Lakes (Station 481), and Separation Creek (USGS Station 09216527). The first two sampling
stations listed are within the project area. Separation Creek is adjacent to and east of the project area.
Baseline Water Quality Data
Baseline surface-water quality data at selected sites associated with the project area are presented in
Table 3.4-1.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

Surface water quality information in the Muddy Creek watershed was examined for this EIS at Muddy
Creek (USGS Stations 09258050, 09258980, 09259000, and 09259050 stations) and Lower Barrel
Springs Draw (USGS Station 09216310). The water quality was variable both spatially and temporally.
Muddy Creek water quality was characterized by moderate conductance and total dissolved solids (TDS)
concentrations. The predominant ions were sodium, sulfate, and bicarbonate. Lower Barrel Springs Draw
had moderate conductance and TDS values.
Water quality in the Little Snake River was characterized (based on analysis at USGS Stations 09257000
and 09259050) by low conductance and TDS concentrations. The water type was calcium bicarbonate.
Water quality in the Bitter Creek watershed (based on analysis at USGS Station 09216545) was variable.
Conductance and TDS values for Bitter Creek tended to be higher than those levels seen at the other
stations.
Water quality in the Great Divide Basin was examined at three stations. Upper Fillmore Creek (USGS
Station 09219240) had low conductance and TDS levels. Separation Creek (USGS Station 09216527) had
variable conductance. TDS concentrations in Separation Creek were low. The Chain Lakes/Hansen Lake
(WDEQ 481) had high conductance and high TDS levels.
Surface waters associated with the project area had moderately to highly basic pH (7.7 to 9.1). Dissolved
oxygen concentrations were moderate (5.2 to 11). Hardness values varied between soft in the Chain Lakes
(67 mg/L CaCO3) to hard in Separation Creek (467 mg/L CaCO3). Alkalinity (as expressed as
bicarbonate) varied from 68 mg/L in upper Fillmore Creek to 1,400 mg/L in Chain Lakes.
Suspended solids concentrations were typically high in Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek. Suspended
sediment concentrations, like TDS concentrations, were greater in the ephemeral and intermittent streams
than the perennial Little Snake River. The mean suspended solid concentrations in the Great Divide Basin
ranged between 141 mg/L (Upper Fillmore Creek) and 490 mg/L (Separation Creek).
Turbidity values were consistent with the suspended solids concentrations. Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek
had turbidity of up to 1,260 and 305 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs). The Little Snake River
showed turbidity of up to 167 NTUs. Lower Barrel Springs Draw and Upper Fillmore Creek showed
turbidity less than 100 NTUs. Turbidity at Separation Creek was 131 NTUs.
The ionic composition of the various surface water bodies associated with the project area was variable.
Major ion characterization of each surface water sample was compared. Bicarbonate was the dominant
anion (negatively charged ion) in the Little Snake River, Lower Barrel Springs Draw, and the Chain
Lakes. Sulfate was the dominant anion in Muddy Creek, Bitter Creek, Upper Fillmore Creek, and
Separation Creek. Chloride was not dominant in any of the samples. Calcium was the dominant cation
(positively charged ion) in the Little Snake River. Sodium was the dominant cation in Muddy Creek,
Lower Barrel Springs, Bitter Creek, the Chain Lakes, and Separation Creek. Magnesium was high in
Upper Fillmore Creek.
Irrigation suitability of the streams as a function of sodium-adsorption ratio and salinity was examined for
each stream sample. The Little Snake River, Muddy Creek, Lower Barrel Springs Draw, and Upper
Fillmore Creek are in the C1-S2 category. C1-S2-categorized water can be used for all crops and soils
where salt toxicity is concerned; however, the sodium may cause clay particles in irrigated soils to swell
and disperse and thereby reduce the soil infiltration rate. Bitter Creek and Separation Creek are in the C2­
S1 category. C2-S1 water should be used with caution on moderately salt tolerant crops and should not be
used on salt sensitive crops. Water from the Chain Lakes is categorized as C3-S2 water, indicating that
crop production would suffer greatly if it were used for irrigation.
Based on average values, Muddy Creek was moderately suitable as an irrigation-water supply where
flows are available. The George Dew/Red Wash wetland complex is the primary location where Muddy
Creek is used for irrigation (the wetland complex is formed by spreader dikes along Muddy Creek) (Maps

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

3.4-2 and 3.9-5). This area is primarily used for cattle and there is a diversion for small-scale bottomland
irrigation along Muddy Creek.
Salinity has become a major concern within the Colorado River drainage basin. The 1972 Clean Water
Act required the establishment of numeric criteria for salinity for the Colorado River and in 1973, seven
Colorado River basin states created the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Forum. The Forum
developed water quality standards for salinity including numeric criteria and a basin-wide plan of
implementation. The plan consists of a number of control measures to be implemented by State and
Federal agencies. In 1974, Congress enacted the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act. The Act was
amended in 1984 to require the Secretary of Interior to develop a comprehensive program to minimize
contributions from lands administered by the BLM.
Selenium, like mercury and other metals, bioaccumulates in organisms at each trophic level. Aquatic life
is exposed to selenium primarily through diet. Unlike mercury or PCBs, concentrations of selenium do
not increase significantly in animals at each level of the food chain going from prey to predator (EPA
2011b). The core regulatory guidelines for aquatic selenium pollution in the United States are the Aquatic
Life Water Quality Criteria (Aquatic Life Criteria) derived by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1977. The current aquatic life chronic criterion for
selenium set by the EPA and WDEQ is 5 μg/L (EPA 2011b and WDEQ 2001).
3.4.2.4

Water Bodies with Impairments or Threats

The WDEQ evaluates streams periodically to determine what streams are threatened or impaired relative
to the use classification. The current threatened and impaired streams are listed in Wyoming’s 2012
305(b) Water Quality Assessment Report (WDEQ 2012). According to the assessment report, a portion of
Muddy Creek (west of WY 789) is listed as threatened. No other surface water bodies in the project area
are listed as threatened or impaired, although one other segment of Muddy Creek outside of the project
area is listed as impaired due to exceedances of chloride and selenium criteria.
According to WDEQ (2012), “Unstable stream channels and loss of riparian function have been
identified as problems in much of the Muddy Creek Sub-basin,” in reference to Muddy Creek. The
LSRCD, working through a Coordinated Resource Management (CRM) process with the BLM,
landowners, grazing permittees, WGFD, and other stakeholders, addressed these water quality and
riparian habitat problems. As part of the CRM process, LSRCD managed several Section 319 watershed
improvement projects in the upper Muddy Creek drainage. Implementation measures included upland
water development, cross fencing, and vegetation and grazing management. While the CRM process is no
longer formally in place, the beneficial effects are still being realized.
Within the project area, several projects have been designed for Muddy Creek to address physical
(riparian condition and bank stability) degradation of the stream channel, which threatens its aquatic life
support. Upstream of the project area reclamation measures included planting a variety of woody riparian
vegetation to help stabilize streambanks, removal of a culvert on Muddy Creek, and restoration of 0.75
mile of Muddy Creek in the upper watershed. According to WDEQ, results of this project showed
considerable improvement to stream stability, aquatic habitat and riparian health, especially in the upper
Muddy Creek tributaries (WDEQ 2012).
Habitat degradation has been identified by the BLM and LSRCD as a serious water-quality concern on
Muddy Creek from Red Wash (in the project area) downstream to the Little Snake River. According to
WDEQ (2012), habitat degradation is likely caused by season-long riparian grazing that is exacerbated by
accelerated erosion associated with oil and gas activities. WDEQ (2012) also states, “… projected
increases in CBM [CBNG] development may lead to increased surface disturbance and increased erosion
and sediment loading.” Several grazing management BMPs are being implemented in much of this lower
watershed including changes in length, timing and duration of grazing, and cross-fencing. The Upper
Muddy Creek Watershed/Grizzly WHMA is located in the north central portion of the CD-C project area.
This WHMA was established with the goal to “manage habitat for the Colorado River fish species unique

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

to the Muddy Creek watershed” (BLM 2008a). In the Grizzly WHMA, the WGFD has been working with
the BLM, the grazing permittee, and the LSRCD to implement similar measures.
3.4.2.5

Salinity Issues in the Colorado River Basin

The southern 30 percent of the project area is located in the Colorado River Basin; as such, point-source
discharge permits are regulated by the State of Wyoming in accordance with its adoption and
incorporation into the Water Quality Rules and Regulations of the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control
Forum (CRBSCF), which was established in 1973 (CRBSCF 2008). The CRBSCF is composed of
representatives from each of the seven Basin states appointed by the governors of the respective states.
The CRBSCF was created for interstate cooperation and to provide the states with the information
necessary to comply with Section 303(a) and (b) of the Clean Water Act. In 1975, CRBSCF proposed, the
states adopted, and the EPA approved water quality standards which included numeric criteria and a plan
of implementation to control salinity increases in the Colorado River. The plan was designed to maintain
the flow-weighted average annual salinity concentrations at or below the 1972 levels, while the Basin
states continued to develop their compact-apportioned water supply (CRBSCF 2008).
According to the CRBSCF, the focus for the implementation of salinity standards in the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program policy “shall be a no-salt return policy
whenever practicable.” The NPDES Program policy (revised in 2002) states that the permitting authority
may permit the discharge of salt from new industrial sources upon a satisfactory demonstration by the
permittee that salt loading to the Colorado River from the new construction is less than one ton per day or
366 tons per year, or the proposed discharge from the new construction is of sufficient quality in terms of
TDS concentrations that the maximum TDS concentration is 500 mg/L for discharges into the Colorado
River and its tributaries upstream of Lees Ferry, Arizona (CRBSCF 2008). In general, the salinity
concentrations have decreased at the monitoring stations since the program was implemented (CRBSCF
2008).
As one of the seven member states of the CRBSCF, Wyoming regulates point discharge sources of
salinity in the Wyoming portion of the Colorado River Basin through its Wyoming Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (WYPDES) permit program. The program is administered by the WDEQ/Water
Quality Division (WQD) (WDEQ 1982).
3.4.3

Groundwater

The project area occurs in the Colorado Plateau and Wyoming Basin groundwater regions described by
Heath (1984) and the Upper Colorado River Basin groundwater region described by Freethey (1987).
More specifically, the project area is located over the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins in
eastern Sweetwater and southwestern Carbon counties. The northern half of the project area is occupied
by the Great Divide Basin and the southern half of the area is occupied by the Washakie Basin, with the
Wamsutter Arch separating the two structural basins. Relatively recent studies by the USGS (Mason and
Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006;) cataloged the groundwater resources within Sweetwater and Carbon
counties, which include the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins. Groundwater resources include
deep and shallow, confined and unconfined aquifers. Groundwater occurrence and flow in the project area
are controlled largely by the geologic structure and precipitation in the area. Most of the saturated
geologic units in the project area are heterogeneous, consisting of aquifers, semi-confining units, and
confining layers.
3.4.3.1

Groundwater Location and Quantity

Welder and McGreevy (1966) reported that the geologic formations capable of producing the greatest
quantities of water in the project area include the following: Quaternary alluvium; Tertiary deposits in the
Wasatch and Fort Union Formations; Cretaceous units, including the Mesaverde Group and the Frontier
and Cloverly Formations; the Sundance-Nugget Sandstone of the Jurassic age; and the Tensleep and

3-40

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

Madison Formations of the Paleozoic Era (Figure 3.1-1, Section 3.1.2). General aquifer characteristics
are provided in Appendix F. Fisk (1967) estimated that the amount of moderately good-quality
groundwater within the Great Divide Structural Basin was 500 million ac-ft and 300 million ac-ft. within
the Washakie Structural Basin. The available data are not adequate for estimating the quantities of
groundwater stored within the individual hydrogeologic units or the aquifer systems in the Green River
Watershed Basin, which includes the Great Divide and the Washakie structural basins, but estimates of
producible water volumes are available for the Tertiary formation beneath the Greater Green River Basin
(Cleary et al. 2010).
Quaternary aquifers in the Great Divide and Washakie basins are comprised of alluvial deposits along
floodplains and isolated wind-blown and lake sediments. The Quaternary aquifers in the vicinity of the
project area occur in alluvial deposits along Muddy Creek (Washakie Basin), in the Red Desert Flats area
and around lakes (Great Divide Basin), and in wind-blown segments in the northwest and southeast of the
project area. Groundwater flow within the sandy Quaternary aquifers is typically downward toward
permeable underlying formations (Collentine et al. 1981). Intermittent drainages also often contain
groundwater in the associated unconsolidated valley fills. Incised drainages serve as capture areas for
wind-blown sand in reaches perpendicular to the prevailing winds. The sand-choked drainages favor rapid
infiltration of rainfall and snowmelt, leading to contact springs and seeps where groundwater, perched in
sandy surface deposits, escapes along contacts with less permeable bedrock. Thicknesses of Quaternary
sediments range from zero to 70 feet. Well yields are typically less than 20 gallons per minute (gpm)
(Welder and McGreevy 1966).
“Minor” Tertiary aquifers in the project area occur in the Laney Member of the Green River Formation
(mostly in the Washakie Structural Basin). “Major” Tertiary aquifers in the project area include the
Wasatch, Battle Springs, and Fort Union (Washakie and Great Divide basins). Using nomenclature of
Collentine et al. (1981), “minor” and “major” aquifers are characterized based on their relative waterbearing potential. Aquifers near the surface are recharged from direct downward percolation of
precipitation and snowmelt and from seepage losses from streams. Deep aquifers are also recharged by
these processes in outcrop and subcrop areas and from slow leakage from overlying and underlying
aquifers. Thicknesses of Tertiary deposits vary from zero to more than 4,000 feet. Wasatch Formation
wells yield up to 50 gpm. The Laney Member of the Green River Formation and the Battle Springs and
Fort Union formations can yield hundreds of gpm to wells (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006).
There are six wells that are designated as municipal use and supply a public water system completed in
Tertiary age aquifers (all in the Wasatch Formation) within the project area. These six wells are
associated with water supply for the Town of Wamsutter. Using estimates of the volume of producible
groundwater from Cleary et al. (2010), the volume of groundwater in the top 1,000 feet of the Tertiary
formation under the project area is approximately 9.67 million ac-ft. Fisk (1967) estimated that the
amount of moderately good-quality groundwater within the Great Divide Structural Basin was 500
million ac-ft and 300 million ac-ft. within the Washakie Structural Basin.
Upper Cretaceous aquifers include “minor” aquifers in the Lance and Fox Hills formations. “Major”
aquifers of this period include the formations within the Mesaverde Group (Almond Formation, Ericson
Formation, Rock Springs Formation, and Blair Formation in descending order), the Baxter Shale, and the
Frontier Formation. The Mesaverde Group contains “major” aquifer units (the Almond Formation, Pine
Ridge Sandstone, Allen Ridge Formation, and Haystack Mountains Formation), and is referred to as the
Mesaverde Aquifer (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006) in the Washakie and Great Divide basins.
Due to water-quality variability, it is considered a groundwater source only near outcrop areas. Units
within the Mesaverde Group yield natural gas to conventional gas wells in the area. In the Atlantic Rim
area to the east, coal seams within the Almond Formation are the target of CBNG development. In areas
where they occur, Upper Cretaceous strata range from a few hundred feet to 5,000 feet thick. Well yields
from the “minor” aquifers are typically less than 25 gpm. Well yields of up to several hundred gpm are
reported for the “major” aquifers (Welder and McGreevy 1966).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

The Lower Cretaceous aquifers generally are deeply buried in the center of the Great Divide and
Washakie basins, though these formations outcrop near the eastern edge of the project area. The lower
Cretaceous strata consist of shale layers that act as regional aquitards or leaky confining layers (Mowry
and Thermopolis shales). The Cloverly Formation is a “major” aquifer. Yields to wells range from 45 to
240 gpm (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006). There are no wells that are designated as a
domestic use or as a municipal use and supply a public water system completed in Lower Cretaceous
aquifers within the project area.
The low-permeability Morrison Formation separates the Sundance-Nugget Aquifer of the Jurassic age
from the Upper Cretaceous aquifers. The Jurassic-age Sundance-Nugget aquifer is comprised of
permeable sandstone with minor quantities of shale, siltstone, and limestone (Collentine et al. 1981). The
flow characteristics of the Sundance-Nugget aquifer are not well-defined. These aquifer units range from
about 200 to 450 feet thick. Well yields are less than 35 gpm in the Sundance aquifer and up to 200 gpm
in the Nugget aquifer (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006). There are no wells that are designated
as a domestic use or as a municipal use and supply a public water system completed in Sundance or
Nugget aquifers within the project area.
According to Collentine et al. (1981), two “important water-bearing intervals” occur in Paleozoic-Era
rocks within the project area. The Pennsylvanian age Tensleep Formation consists of fine- to mediumgrained sandstone between confining layers of the Chugwater Formation (Triassic) and the Amsden
Formation (Pennsylvanian) (Collentine et al. 1981). The Madison aquifer is comprised of limestone and
dolomite bordered on the top by the fine-grained Amsden Formation and on the bottom by Cambrian
rocks. Early Paleozoic rocks are notably absent from far southeast Wyoming and extremely thin on the
west flank of the Sierra Madre uplift east of the project area. The zero isopach line for these Paleozoic
units lies across and north of the Sierra Madre uplift indicating either non-deposition or erosion and
complete removal of these units across the ancestral uplift prior to deposition of Mesozoic and Cenozoic
age rocks. The truncated edge of Cambrian and Mississippian rocks lies east of the project area according
to Blackstone (1963). Wells completed in the vicinity of the project area within both of these Paleozoic
age aquifers, where present and of significant thickness, have demonstrated yields up to 400 gpm. There
are no wells that are designated as a domestic use or as a municipal use and supply a public water system
completed in Tensleep or Madison aquifers within the project area.
3.4.3.2

Groundwater Use

The SEO water rights database indicates that there are 1,081 groundwater wells permitted within or 1
mile adjacent to the project area (SEO 2011). Permitted well uses include stock (294), miscellaneous
(218), domestic (80), industrial (18), municipal (6), irrigation (5), and test wells (1). The total for
permitted uses exceeds the number of well permits due to the fact that many of the wells are permitted for
multiple uses. A complete list of valid groundwater rights is included in Appendix F.
Other than designated land uses described above, little information is available on groundwater use
specific to the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins. In 1981, total groundwater use in the Great
Divide and Washakie basins was estimated by Collentine et al. (1981) at between 20,000 and 24,000
acre-feet per year, approximately 30 percent of the total water use. More recent estimates of groundwater
use are available on a county-wide basis. In 2000, Sweetwater County groundwater use was estimated at
57,000 acre-feet per year, approximately 30 percent of the overall water used (Mason and Miller 2005). In
2000, Carbon County groundwater use was estimated at 7,000 acre-feet per year, less than 2 percent of
the overall water used (Bartos et al. 2006).
3.4.3.3

Groundwater Recharge and Discharge

Recharge to aquifers in the project area occurs by infiltration of precipitation on outcrop areas, infiltration
of snowmelt runoff from the mountains, and seepage from streams and lakes.

3-42

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

Four major groundwater-recharge areas are identified in the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins.
Three of these areas are outside of the project area near Rock Springs in Sweetwater County and the
Atlantic Rim area in Carbon County. The fourth recharge area is the topographic high area around
Creston Junction (Map 3.4-1). Piezometric levels in hydrogeologic units are higher in these four major
recharge areas than other parts of the basin, probably because the higher altitude of these features results
in slightly higher annual precipitation. Welder and McGreevy (1966) reported that most streams in the
Washakie basin are “losing” streams, contributing to local groundwater recharge in the basin. The same is
likely true for streams in the Great Divide Basin. Fisk (1967) estimated that the combined annual recharge
for the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins was at 11,300 ac-ft. Section 4.9.3.1, Special Status
Species, Proposed Action, includes a discussion of potential annual depletions to the Colorado River
System.
Aquifers in the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins are reported to be in direct hydraulic
connection across the Wamsutter Arch. Recharge is reported to be at least 15 cfs in both basins. Due to
the large groundwater storage capacity and the low recharge rate, estimates indicate that it would take
more than 50,000 years to refill the fresh-water aquifers of the basins with groundwater if all of the
groundwater was removed (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006).
In general, groundwater discharge from the aquifers throughout the project area occurs through seepage to
streams and springs, discharge to wells, evaporation, and underground flow (Mason and Miller 2005;
Bartos et al. 2006). According to Mason and Miller (2005), groundwater from the Mesaverde formation
discharges to the Little Snake River, downstream of the confluence with Muddy Creek. Much of the
deeper groundwater in the basins is artesian (i.e., having a static water level which rises to an elevation
above the saturated zone). This results because the major recharge areas in the basins are exposed at
higher elevations, putting the confined groundwater under hydraulic pressure. Water in a confined aquifer
that is under hydraulic pressure will rise above the top of the aquifer when the overlying confining bed is
pierced or broken, resulting in discharge from the confined aquifer (Mason and Miller 2005). The source
of some of the water within the Chain Lakes surface water features in the Great Divide Basin is thought to
be artesian groundwater that flows at the surface (WGFD 2008).
3.4.3.4

Groundwater Flow Direction

As discussed in Section 3.4.3.1, formations capable of producing the greatest quantity of water in the
project area include the Quaternary alluvium, Tertiary deposits in the Wasatch and Fort Union
Formations, Cretaceous units, including the Mesaverde Group and the Frontier and Cloverly Formations,
the Sundance-Nugget Sandstone of the Jurassic age, and the Tensleep and Madison Formations of the
Paleozoic Era. More detailed information regarding potentiometric surfaces of project area aquifers and
groundwater flow are presented in Appendix F.
The Quaternary aquifers consist of unconsolidated sand and gravel formations, mainly of alluvial origin,
interbedded with lake and wind-blown sediments. The Quaternary alluvium is highly permeable,
absorbing rainfall and stream flow, transmitting it downward to underlying formations.
The groundwater flow direction in the Tertiary-aged Wasatch aquifer is from areas of recharge toward the
basin center. In the Great Divide Structural Basin, Wasatch aquifer groundwater flows from the
northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. In the Washakie Structural Basin, groundwater generally
flows from west to east in the southern part of the Washakie Structural Basin. In the northern portion of
the Washakie Basin groundwater motion is largely static. Some groundwater flows westward from the
Washakie Structural Basin along Bitter Creek and southward along Muddy Creek.
Groundwater flow direction for the Upper Cretaceous-aged aquifer within the Mesaverde Group is
undefined in the northern part of the Great Divide Structural Basin. Groundwater within the aquifers of
the Mesaverde Group is reported to flow from the Great Divide Basin toward the east, southeast,
southwest, and west. In the Washakie Structural Basin, groundwater is reported to flow to the west and
south (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-43

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

Available potentiometric data are sporadic and could not be used to delineate flow patterns in the
Sundance-Nugget aquifer. Potentiometric heads are highest in the uplift areas to the east, west, north, and
northeast (Collentine et al. 1981).
The groundwater flow direction for the Paleozoic-aged Tensleep aquifer is generally from the recharge
areas along the northern and eastern flanks of the Great Divide Basin. Additional recharge into the
Washakie Basin may occur to the south and east of the Rock Springs uplift. Tensleep aquifer groundwater
flow is from the recharge areas toward the basin centers (Collentine et al. 1981). The groundwater flow
direction for the Paleozoic-aged Madison aquifer is generally west, away from the outcrops (sources of
recharge) towards the Great Divide and Washakie basin centers (Bartos et al. 2006).
3.4.3.5

Groundwater Quality

For the most part, comparisons between groundwater quality within the different structural features in the
project area are difficult given the large variation in water quality within the features. In general, the
quality of the groundwater underlying the Great Divide and Washakie basins is largely related to the
depth of the aquifer, the type of strata in the saturated zone, the recharge rate and volume at the area
sampled, and the residence time of the groundwater in the aquifer. Typically, quality of groundwater
within a given hydrogeologic unit usually deteriorates with depth.
Water-quality samples collected from wells and springs within Quaternary and Tertiary hydrogeologic
units that were being used to supply water for livestock and wildlife were typically of good water quality
(i.e. fresh water, see below). Wells that do not produce usable water are usually abandoned, and springs
that do not produce usable water typically are not developed. In addition, where hydrogeologic units are
deeply buried, they usually are not tapped for a water supply when a shallower supply is available. For
these reasons the groundwater quality samples from the Quaternary and Tertiary hydrogeologic units are
most likely biased toward better water quality and do not represent a random sampling of the units.
Although the possible bias of these data does not allow for a complete characterization of the water
quality of these hydrogeologic units as a whole, it probably allows for a more accurate characterization of
the units in areas where they are shallow enough to be economically used.
Most of the groundwater-quality samples used to characterize Mesozoic and Paleozoic hydrogeologic
units came from the USGS Produced Waters Database (USGS 2011b). Although these samples were
collected only where oil and gas production has taken place, they probably have less bias in representing
ambient groundwater quality within hydrogeologic units developed as a result of this project than samples
used to characterize Quaternary and Tertiary hydrogeologic units.
Baseline groundwater-quality data (TDS and selenium) at selected aquifers associated with the project
area are presented in Table 3.4-2. More detailed data regarding groundwater quality are presented in
Appendix F.
TDS concentrations in ground-water samples are classified according to the USGS salinity classification
(Heath 1983) as follows: fresh, 0-1,000 mg/L; slightly saline, 1,000-3,000 mg/L; moderately saline,
3,000-10,000 mg/L; very saline, 10,000-35,000 mg/L; and briny, more than 35,000 mg/L.
TDS values for 18 samples collected in Quaternary aquifers in Sweetwater County ranged from fresh to
very saline with the median value within the slightly saline range. In Carbon County, 32 samples
collected from Quaternary aquifers varied from fresh to moderately saline with the median value within
fresh range.

TDS concentrations from 80 samples collected from the Wasatch aquifer (Tertiary age) in Sweetwater
County ranged from fresh to moderately saline, with a median value within the fresh/slightly saline range.
TDS values for 11 samples collected in Carbon County ranged from fresh to moderately saline, with a
median value within the slightly saline range. TDS values from samples collected in Sweetwater County
of water produced by oil and gas extraction from the Wasatch/Fort Union formations ranged from slightly
saline to briny. TDS values of produced water from the Wasatch aquifer above 60,000 mg/L occurred at
depths greater than about 2,500 feet below ground surface (Mason and Miller 2005).
TDS concentrations in 30 samples collected in Sweetwater County from the aquifers of the Mesaverde
group ranged from fresh to very saline, with a median value within the fresh/slightly saline range. TDS
from 130 samples collected in Carbon County from the aquifers of the Mesaverde Group ranged from
fresh to briny. TDS in 221 samples of water from oil and gas production in the Mesaverde ranged from
slightly saline to briny with a median value within the very saline range.
TDS concentrations from samples collected from the Nugget aquifer in Sweetwater County ranged from
slightly/moderately saline to very saline/briny. TDS values for 15 samples collected in Carbon County
ranged from slightly saline to briny, with a median value within the moderately saline range. TDS values
from 28 samples collected in Sweetwater County of water produced by oil and gas extraction from the
Nugget formation ranged from moderately saline to briny.
TDS concentrations from 17 samples collected from the Madison aquifer in Sweetwater County ranged
from moderately saline to briny, with a median value within the very saline range. TDS values for 11
samples collected in Carbon County ranged from fresh to very saline, with a median value within the
slightly/moderately saline range. TDS values from samples collected in Sweetwater County of water
produced by oil and gas extraction from the Madison Formation ranged from moderately saline to briny.
In general, TDS concentrations typically increase with the depth below ground surface. TDS values are
usually higher when the aquifer is interbedded with lake or marine deposits that contain evaporate
minerals.
Selenium values obtained from samples of selected aquifers are included in Table 3.4-2. In comparison to
the number of samples analyzed for TDS, selenium sampling results are sparse but they do provide some
idea of the potential for encountering excessive selenium in produced water. EPA’s current chronic
criterion for selenium is 5 μg/L (EPA 2011a). WDEQ/LQD’s groundwater fish/aquatic life use suitability
limit for selenium is also 5 μg/L (WDEQ/LQD 2005). Both the EPA’s chronic criterion and WDEQ­
WQD’s suitability limits for selenium were exceeded in Quaternary aquifer water samples.
Confining beds typically restrict the movement of groundwater between aquifers, hence, movement of
potential contaminants between aquifers. Although there is some downward movement of the water from
the shallow surficial units, most of the groundwater movement, if any, is upward from the deeper
confined aquifers to the shallower unconfined aquifers. Water in a confined aquifer is under hydraulic
pressure and will rise above the top of the aquifer when the overlying confining bed is pierced or broken
(Mason and Miller 2005). There is potential for groundwater quality degradation due to the piercing of
confining layers and vertical and horizontal migration and mixing of waters of variable qualities between
the layers. Improperly completed wells, especially poor casing or cementing, could produce such a result.
There are no data suggesting this is currently a problem in the CD-C project area.
3.4.3.6

Springs and Flowing Wells

As described above, water in a confined aquifer is under hydraulic pressure and will rise above the top of
the aquifer when the overlying confining bed is broken (spring) or pierced (well). When the hydraulic
pressure is great enough, the water from a well completed in a confined aquifer can reach the surface,
resulting in a flowing well. Springs and flowing wells are important local water sources for livestock,
wildlife, and wild horses. It is unclear how many springs and flowing wells are located within the project
area. The SEO records identify two named springs among the 1,081 groundwater rights within 1 mile of
the project area (SEO 2011). The SEO records indicate that 118 of the 1,081 groundwater rights are
flowing wells (SEO 2011). Of the 1,081 groundwater rights, 325 lack the information to determine if the
groundwater permit is for a spring or flowing well.
3-46

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

According to previous studies, springs in the area intercept the ground surface in three geologic units.
South of Interstate 80 (I-80), springs occur in the Green River Formation. North of I-80, springs occur in
the Wasatch and Battle Springs formations (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006).
Historic water-quality data were located for 16 water samples collected from springs or flowing wells
(WRDS 2007, USGS 2007). Water quality for these samples is variable. Conductance levels range from
769 to 16,215 µmhos/cm. TDS levels ranged from 479 to 12,755 mg/L. Detailed information related to
springs and flowing wells can be found in Appendix F. Based on a February 2011 search of SEO water
rights information, none of the 16 springs evaluated for water quality are covered by valid water rights.
3.4.3.7

The Safe Drinking Water Act as it Relates to Groundwater

The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the main federal law that regulates drinking water quality,
including drinking water from groundwater sources. Under the SDWA, the EPA sets standards for
drinking water quality and oversees the states, localities, and water suppliers who implement those
standards. Two aspects of the SDWA that are relevant to an assessment of the groundwater quality related
to the CD-C project are the underground injection control (UIC) program and the sole source aquifer
(SSA) protection program. The UIC program ensures that injection wells meet appropriate performance
criteria for protecting underground sources of drinking water (USDW). As defined in 40 CFR 144.3, an
USDW aquifer supplies any public water system or contains a sufficient quantity of groundwater to
supply a public water system; currently supplies drinking water for human consumption or contains fewer
than 10,000 mg/l total dissolved solids and is not an exempted aquifer (i.e. exempt from SDWA
regulation). The EPA defines an SSA as an aquifer that supplies at least 50 percent of the drinking water
consumed in the area overlying the aquifer. While there are no EPA designated SSAs associated with the
CD-C project area, there are aquifers in the area that qualify as an USDW.
Quaternary age aquifers within the CD-C project area likely do not qualify as USDWs since there are no
wells designated for domestic or municipal use and supply a public water system. Further, the yields from
these aquifers are not likely sufficient to sustain a public water system. Tertiary age aquifers within the
CD-C project area qualify as USDWs based on the presence of Wamsutter municipal wells and on the
suitability of the groundwater quality. Wyoming State Engineer records indicate that one domestic well is
completed in the Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation aquifer within the project area.
There are no wells that are designated for municipal use or supply a public water system completed in
Upper Cretaceous aquifers within the project area. Upper Cretaceous age aquifers within the CD-C
project area qualify as USDWs based on suitability of water quality, on the presence of a sufficient
quantity of groundwater to supply a public water system, and the one domestic well completed in the
Lance Formation aquifer. Due to the depth of the Upper Cretaceous aquifers in the CD-C area (2,000 to
12,000 feet depending on location [Mason and Miller 2005]) and the low population density of the area,
these aquifers are not likely to be the target for large numbers of domestic or public water system wells.
Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic age aquifers within the CD-C project area could qualify as USDW based
on suitability of water quality and based on the presence of a sufficient quantity of groundwater to supply
a public water system but, due to the depths of the aquifers in the CD-C area (2,000 to 12,000 feet
depending on location [Mason and Miller 2005]), Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic age aquifers are not
likely to be the target for domestic or public water system wells. Pennsylvanian age and older aquifers
within the CD-C project area could qualify as USDW based on the presence of a sufficient quantity of
groundwater to supply a public water system but, due to the depths of these aquifers in the CD-C area
(4,800 to 18,000 feet depending on location [Mason and Miller 2005]) and the low population density of
the area, they are not likely to be the target for domestic or public water system wells.
3.4.4

Injection Wells

As discussed above, subsurface water-disposal methods are administered by the EPA under the UIC
program (40 CFR 144). The UIC program ensures that injection wells meet appropriate performance
criteria for protecting USDWs. There are five classes of injection wells permitted under the UIC program
based on similarity in the fluids injected, activities, construction, injection depth, design, and operating
Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WATER RESOURCES

techniques. Class II and Class V injection wells would likely be used to dispose of produced water
resulting from the CD-C project. Class II injection well permits are issued by the WOGCC for injection
of fluids associated with oil and natural gas production (EPA 2011b),and are issued by the WOGCC
under a 1989 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the EPA and the WOGCC. Class V injection
wells are permitted through WDEQ-WQD and cover wells not included in Classes I-IV. Most Class V
wells (facilities) inject non-hazardous fluids into or above USDWs and are typically shallow, onsite
disposal systems (stormwater drainage wells, cesspools, and septic tanks) but also include more complex
wells that are deeper and often used for commercial or industrial facilities (EPA 2011b).
According to WOGCC information there are 18 permitted Class II injection wells within the CD-C
project area that are capable of operation (WOGCC 2011a). The target injection formations for these
wells are Big Red (1), Ericson (1), Fort Union (1), Fort Union/Lance (1), Fox Hills (1), Lewis (1),
Mesaverde/Lance (1), Almond (2), Mesaverde (2), and Lance (7). According to WOGCC information
there are no permitted Class V injection wells within the project area but there are seven Class V wells
adjacent to the project area (WOGCC 2011a). All seven wells are the deeper injection type and target the
Haystack Mountain (1), Deep Creek (3), and Mesaverde Coal (3) formations.

AIR QUALITY

Regional air quality is influenced by a combination of factors including climate, meteorology, the
magnitude and spatial distribution of local and regional air pollution sources, and the chemical properties
of emitted pollutants. Within the lower atmosphere, regional and local scale air masses interact with
regional topography to influence atmospheric dispersion and transport of pollutants. The following
sections summarize the climatic conditions and existing air quality within the project area and
surrounding region.
3.5.1

Regional Climate

The CD-C project area is located in a semiarid (dry and cold), mid-continental climate regime. The area is
typified by dry, windy conditions with limited rainfall and long, cold winters. The nearest meteorological
measurements were collected at Wamsutter, Wyoming (1897-2011), located near the center of the project
area at an elevation of 6,800 feet above mean sea level; (WRCC 2012).
The annual average total precipitation at Wamsutter is 7.1 inches, with annual totals for the period of
record ranging from 3.8 inches (1979) to 13.6 inches (1983). Precipitation is greatest from spring to
summer, tapering off during the fall and winter months. An average of 27.4 inches of snow falls during
the year (annual high 78.0 inches in 2010), with the majority of the snow distributed evenly between
November and April.
The region has cool temperatures, with an average range (in degrees Fahrenheit [˚F]) between 7.1˚F and
28.6˚F in January to between 48.9˚F and 84.5˚F in July. Extreme temperatures have ranged from -40˚F
(2011) to 105˚F (1897). The frost-free period generally occurs from May to September. Table 3.5-1
shows the mean monthly temperature ranges and total precipitation amounts.

The CD-C project area is subject to strong and gusty winds, often accompanied by snow during the winter
months, producing blizzard conditions and drifting snow. The closest comprehensive wind measurements
were collected in the project area at the WDEQ meteorological monitoring station located approximately
2 miles northwest of Wamsutter. To describe the wind flow pattern for the region a wind rose for the
Wamsutter site, for years 2008 through 2010, is presented in Figure 3.5-1. Tables 3.5-2 and 3.5-3
provide the wind speed and wind direction distributions in tabular format. From this information, it is
evident that the winds originate from the west to southwest nearly 36 percent of the time and from the
south to southeast over 37 percent of the time.

The frequency and strength of winds greatly affect the transport and dispersion of air pollutants. The
annual mean wind speed is 11.4 miles per hour (mph), and the relatively high average wind speed
indicates good dispersion and mixing of any potential pollutant emissions.

Overview of Regulatory Environment

The WDEQ-AQD is the primary air quality regulatory agency responsible for estimating impacts once
detailed industrial development plans have been made, and those development plans are subject to
applicable air quality laws, regulations, standards, control measures, and management practices. Unlike
the conceptual ‘reasonable, but conservative’ engineering designs used in NEPA analyses, any WDEQ­
AQD air quality preconstruction permitting demonstrations required would be based on very site-specific,
detailed engineering values, which would be assessed in the permit application review. Any proposed
facility which meets the requirements set forth under Wyoming Air Quality Standards and Regulations
(WAQSR) Chapter 6 is subject to the WDEQ-AQD permitting and compliance processes.
Federal air quality regulations adopted and enforced by WDEQ-AQD limit incremental emission
increases to specific levels defined by the classification of air quality in an area. The Prevention of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) Program is designed to limit the incremental increase of specific air
pollutant concentrations above a legally defined baseline level. Incremental increases in PSD Class I areas
are strictly limited, while increases allowed in Class II areas are less strict. Under the PSD program, Class
I areas are protected by Federal Land Managers (FLMs) through management of air quality related values
((AQRVs) such as visibility, aquatic ecosystems, flora, fauna, and others.
The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments established visibility as an AQRV for FLMs to consider. The 1990
Clean Air Act amendments contain a goal of improving visibility within PSD Class I areas. The Regional
Haze Rule finalized in 1999 requires states, in coordination with federal agencies and other interested
parties, to develop and implement air quality protection plans to reduce the pollution that causes visibility
impairment.

Regulations and standards which limit permissible levels of air pollutant concentrations and air emissions
and are relevant to the CD-C project air impact analysis include:






NAAQS (40 CFR Part 50) , WAAQS (WAQSR Chapter 2), CAAQS (5 CCR 1001-14);

New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) (40 CFR Part 60);
Non-Road Engine Tier Standards (40 CFR Part 89); and
Wyoming 2010 Oil and Gas Permitting Guidance (supplement to WAQSR Chapter 6, Section 2)

Each of these regulations is further described in the following sections.
3.5.2.1

Ambient Air Quality Standards

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
pollutants considered to endanger public health and the environment. The NAAQS prescribe limits on
ambient levels of these pollutants in order to protect public health, including the health of sensitive
groups. The EPA has developed NAAQS for six criteria pollutants: NO2, CO, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, ozone,
and lead. Lead emissions from CD-C project sources are negligible and therefore the lead NAAQS is not
addressed in this analysis. States typically adopt the NAAQS but may also develop state-specific ambient
air quality standards for certain pollutants. The NAAQS and the state ambient air quality standards for
Wyoming (WAAQS) and Colorado (CAAQS) are summarized in Table 3.5-4. The CAAQS are included
in this table due to the proximity of the CD-C project area to Colorado (See Map 3.5-1). PSD Class I and
Class II increments are also included in Table 3.5-7 and a discussion of PSD increments is provided in
Section 3.5.2.3. The ambient air quality standards are shown in units of parts per million (ppm), parts per
billion (ppb), and micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) for purposes of providing the standards as written
in the corresponding regulation, and for comparison with the pollutant concentration units as provided by
the air quality models used for impact analysis (Section 4.5).

area for that pollutant. In March 2009, the Governor of Wyoming recommended to the EPA that Sublette
County and parts of northeastern Lincoln and northwestern Sweetwater Counties be designated nonattainment for ozone due to exceedances of the 2008 75 parts per billion ozone NAAQS. The CD-C
project area is located in eastern Sweetwater and western Carbon counties, outside of the proposed nonattainment area. In April 2012, Sublette County and parts of Lincoln and Sweetwater were designated by
the EPA as nonattainment areas under the 2008 ozone standard <http://www.epa.gov/groundlevelozone/­
designations/2008standards/final/region8f.htm>.
3.5.2.2

Hazardous Air Pollutants

Toxic air pollutants, also known as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), are those pollutants that are known
or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects,
or adverse environmental effects. No ambient air quality standards exist for HAPs; instead, emissions of
these pollutants are controlled by a variety of regulations that target the specific source class and
industrial sectors for stationary, mobile, and product use/formulations. Sources of HAPs from CD-C
operations include well-site production emissions (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, n-hexane, and
formaldehyde), and compressor station and gas plant combustion emissions (formaldehyde).
For the CD-C analysis, short-term (1-hour) HAP concentrations are compared to acute Reference
Exposure Levels (RELs) (EPA, 2011) shown in Table 3.5-5. RELs are defined as concentrations at or
below which no adverse health effects are expected. No RELs are available for ethyl benzene and n­
hexane; instead, the available “Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health” values divided by 10
(IDLH/10) are used. These IDLH values were determined by the National Institute for Occupational

3-54

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—AIR QUALITY

Safety and Health and were obtained from EPA's Air Toxics Database (EPA, 2011). These values are
approximately comparable to mild effects levels for 1-hour exposures.
Long-term exposure to HAPs are compared to Reference Concentrations for Chronic Inhalation (RfCs).
An RfC is defined by the EPA as the daily inhalation concentration at which no long-term adverse health
effects are expected. RfCs exist for both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects on human health
(EPA, 2010). Annual modeled HAP concentrations for all HAPs emitted were compared directly to the
non-carcinogenic RfCs shown in Table 3.5-6..
Long-term exposures to emissions of suspected carcinogens (benzene, ethyl benzene and formaldehyde)
are also evaluated based on estimates of the increased latent cancer risk over a 70-year lifetime.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration

The PSD Program is designed to limit the incremental increase of specific air pollutant concentrations
above a legally defined baseline level. All areas of the country are assigned a classification which
describes the degree of degradation to the existing air quality that is allowed to occur within the area
under the PSD permitting rules. PSD Class I areas are areas of special national or regional natural, scenic,
recreational, or historic value, and very little degradation in air quality is allowed by strictly limiting
industrial growth. PSD Class II areas allow for reasonable industrial/economic expansion. Certain
national parks and wilderness areas are designated as PSD Class I, and air quality in these areas is
protected by allowing only slight incremental increases in pollutant concentrations. Five PSD Class I
areas are located within the CD-C study area as shown on Map 3.5-1: the Bridger, Fitzpatrick, Mount
Zirkel, Savage Run, and Rawah Wilderness Areas. In a PSD increment analysis, impacts from proposed
emissions sources are compared with the allowable limits on increases in pollutant concentrations, which
are called Class I PSD increments; these increments are shown in Table 3.5-7. Dinosaur National
Monument is a federal PSD Class II area given Class I protection for SO2 by the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). The remainder of the impact study area is classified as PSD
Class II, where less stringent limits on increases in pollutant concentrations apply. The Popo Agie

Note: The PSD demonstrations serve information purposes only and do not constitute a
regulatory PSD increment consumption analysis.

Comparisons of CD-C project impacts to the PSD Class I and II increments are for informational
purposes only and are intended to evaluate a threshold of concern. They do not represent a regulatory
PSD Increment Consumption Analysis, which would be completed as necessary during the New Source
Review permitting process by the State of Wyoming.
In addition to the PSD increments, Class I areas are protected by FLMs through management of AQRVs
such as visibility, aquatic ecosystems, flora, and fauna. Evaluations of impacts to AQRVs would also be
performed during the New Source Review permitting process under the direction of the WDEQ-AQD in
consultation with the FLMs.
AQRVs that were identified as a concern for the CD-C project included visibility, atmospheric deposition,
and potential sensitive lake acidification. A discussion of the applicable background data and analysis
thresholds is provided below.
Visibility

Change in atmospheric light extinction relative to background conditions is used to measure regional
haze. Analysis thresholds for atmospheric light extinction are set forth in The Federal Land Managers’
Air Quality Related Values Work Group (FLAG) Report (FLAG 2010), with the results reported in
percent change in light extinction and change in deciviews (dv). A 5-percent change in light extinction
(approximately equal to 0.5 dv) is the threshold recommended in FLAG (2010) and is considered to
contribute to regional haze visibility impairment. A 10-percent change in light extinction (approximately
equal to 1.0 dv) is considered to represent a noticeable change in visibility when compared to background
conditions.
Estimated visibility degradation at the Class I areas and sensitive Class II areas of concern are presented
in terms of the number of days that exceed a threshold percent change in extinction, or dv relative to
background conditions. Although procedures and thresholds have not been established for sensitive Class
II areas, BLM is including these areas in its visibility analysis.
Atmospheric Deposition and Lake Chemistry

The effects of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds on terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems are well documented and have shown to cause leaching of nutrients from soils, acidification
of surface waters, injury to high-elevation vegetation, and changes in nutrient cycling and species

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—AIR QUALITY

composition. FLAG (2010) recommends that applicable sources assess impacts of nitrogen and sulfur
deposition in Class I areas.
This guidance recognizes the importance of establishing critical deposition loading values (“critical
loads”) for each specific Class I area as these critical loads are completely dependent on local
atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial conditions and chemistry. Critical load thresholds are essentially a
level of atmospheric pollutant deposition below which negative ecosystem effects are not likely to occur.
FLAG 2010 does not include any critical load levels for specific Class I areas and refers to site-specific
critical load information on FLM websites for each area of concern. This guidance does, however,
recommend the use of deposition analysis thresholds (DATs) developed by the National Park Service
(NPS) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The DATs represent screening level values for
nitrogen and sulfur deposition from project alone emission sources below which estimated impacts are
considered negligible. The DAT established for both nitrogen and sulfur in western Class I areas is 0.005
kilograms per hectare per year (kg/ha/yr).
In addition to the screening level analysis, project-specific and cumulative modeled results are compared
to critical load thresholds established for the Rocky Mountain region to assess total deposition impacts.
The BLM has compiled currently available research data on critical load values for Class I areas in the
vicinity of the CD-C project area. Critical load thresholds published by Fox et al. (Fox 1989) established
pollutant loadings for total nitrogen of 3–5 kg/ha/yr) and for total sulfur of 5 kg/ha/yr for Bob Marshall
Wilderness Area in Montana and Bridger Wilderness Area in Wyoming. However, the NPS has recently
stated that these pollutant loadings are not protective of sensitive resources and in its “Technical
Guidance on Assessing Impacts to Air Quality in NEPA and Planning Documents” (January 2011)
suggested that critical load values above 3 kg/ha/yr may result in moderate impacts. Research conducted
by Jill Baron (Baron 2006) using hindcasting of diatom communities suggests 1.5 kg/ha/yr as a critical
loading value for wet nitrogen deposition for high-elevation lakes in Rocky Mountain National Park,
Colorado. Recent research conducted by Saros et. al. (2010) using fossil diatom assemblages suggest that
a critical load value of 1.4 kg/ha/yr for wet nitrogen is applicable to the eastern Sierra Nevada and Greater
Yellowstone ecosystems. For the CD-C project, both project-specific and cumulative nitrogen and sulfur
deposition impacts are compared to the following critical load values: 1.5 kg/ha/yr as a surrogate for total
nitrogen deposition and 3 kg/ha/yr for total sulfur deposition for the Class I and sensitive Class II areas
evaluated.
Analyses to assess the change in water chemistry associated with atmospheric deposition are performed
following the procedures developed by the USFS Rocky Mountain Region (USFS 2000). The analysis
assesses the change in the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of the 12 sensitive lakes (Table 3.5-6) within
the CD-C study area (Map 3.5-1). Predicted changes in ANC are compared with the applicable threshold
for each identified lake: 10-percent change in ANC for lakes with background ANC values greater than
25 microequivalents per liter [µeq/L], and less than a 1-µeq/L change in ANC for lakes with background
ANC values equal to or less than 25 µeq/L.
3.5.2.4

New Source Performance Standards

Under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated technology-based emissions standards
which apply to specific categories of stationary sources. These standards are referred to as New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS; 40 CFR Part 60). The NSPS potentially applicable to the CD-C project
include the following subparts of 40 CFR Part 60:





Subpart A – General Provisions;
Subpart Kb – Standards of Performance for Volatile Organic Storage Vessels;
Subpart JJJJ – Standards of Performance for Stationary Spark-Ignition Internal Combustion
Engines; and
Subpart KKKK – Standards of Performance for Stationary Combustion Turbines.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-57

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—AIR QUALITY

Subpart A – General Provisions

Provisions of Subpart A apply to the owner or operator of any stationary source which contains an
affected facility, the construction or modification of which is commenced after the date of publication in
this part of any standard (or, if earlier, the date of publication of any proposed standard) applicable to that
facility. Provisions of Subpart A could apply to proposed CD-C sources that are affected by NSPS.
Subpart Kb – Volatile Organic Liquid Storage Vessels

Subpart Kb applies to storage vessels with a capacity greater than or equal to 75 cubic meters (m3) that
are used to store volatile organic liquids for which construction, reconstruction, or modification is
commenced after July 23, 1984. This subpart potentially would be applicable to storage tanks for natural
gas liquids.
Subpart JJJJ – Spark Ignition Internal Combustion Engines

Subpart KKKK establishes emission standards and compliance schedules for the control of emissions
from stationary combustion turbines that commenced construction, modification or reconstruction after
February 18, 2005. Stationary combustion turbines with a heat input at peak load equal to or greater than
10.7 gigajoules (10 MMBtu) per hour, based on the higher heating value of the fuel proposed as part of
the CD-C project, would be subject to this NSPS.
Subpart KKKK – Stationary Combustion Turbines

Subpart KKKK establishes emission standards and compliance schedules for the control of emissions
from stationary combustion turbines that commenced construction, modification or reconstruction after
February 18, 2005. Stationary combustion turbines with a heat input at peak load equal to or greater than
10.7 gigajoules (10 MMBtu) per hour, based on the higher heating value of the fuel proposed as part of
the CD-C project would be subject to this NSPS.
3.5.2.5

Non-Road Engine Tier Standards

The EPA sets emissions standards for non-road diesel engines for hydrocarbons, NOX, CO, and PM. The
emissions standards are implemented in tiers by year, with different standards and start years for various
engine power ratings. The new standards do not apply to existing non-road equipment. Only equipment
built after the start date for an engine category (1999-2006, depending on the category) is affected by the
rule. Over the life of the CD-C project, the fleet of non-road equipment will turn over and higher-emitting
engines will be replaced with lower-emitting engines. This fleet turnover is accounted for in the CD-C
project emissions inventory.
3.5.2.6

Wyoming 2010 Oil and Gas Permitting Guidance (Wyoming BACT)

The CD-C project area lies entirely within eastern Sweetwater County and western Carbon County in
Wyoming; this area is part of the State of Wyoming’s Concentrated Development Area (CDA; Map 3.53), and is therefore subject to CDA restrictions on emissions set forth in the WDEQ-AQD’s March 2010
“Oil and Gas Production Facilities Chapter 6, Section 2 Permitting Guidance” (WDEQ-AQD, 2010). The
Guidance states, “….all new or modified sources or facilities which may generate regulated air emissions
shall be permitted prior to start-up or modification and Best Available Control Technology (BACT) shall
be applied to reduce or eliminate emissions”. The Guidance establishes presumptive BACT requirements
for emissions from the following source categories for new facilities:

98-percent control of all new/modified tank emissions ≥ 8 tpy (tons per year) VOC within 60 days
of startup/modification.
Dehydration Units. Upon first date of production (FDOP), glycol flash separators and still vent
condensers must be installed/operating on all dehydrators; 98-percent control must be
installed/operational on dehydrators within 30 days of FDOP if total potential uncontrolled
dehydrator VOC emissions are ≥8 tpy; combustion units used to achieve 98-percent control may be
removed upon approval after 1 year if total potential VOC emissions from dehydrators are <8 tpy.
Pneumatic Pumps. Pad facilities: VOC and HAP emissions associated with the discharge streams of
all natural gas-operated pneumatic pumps controlled by at least 98 percent or the pump discharge
streams routed into a closed-loop system such as sales line, collection line, fuel supply; single-well
facilities with combustion units installed for the control of flash or dehydration unit emissions: VOC
and HAP emissions associated with the discharge streams from natural gas-operated pneumatic
pumps controlled by at least 98 percent by routing the pump discharge streams into the combustion
unit or the discharge streams routed into a closed loop system.
Pneumatic Controllers. Install low- or no-bleed controllers at all new facilities.
Well Completions. Green completions are required in the Jonah, Pinedale and Anticline
development fields (JPAD) area and concentrated development areas (Map 3.5-2).
Produced Water Tanks. Pad facilities-upon FDOP, 98-percent control of all produced water tank
emissions. No water produced into open-top tanks; single-well facilities within 60 days of FDOP,
98-percent control of all produced water tank emissions at sites where flashing emissions must be
controlled. No water produced into open-top tanks.
Blow-down/Venting. Best Management Practices and information-gathering requirements
incorporated into permits for new and modified facilities.
Other sources. For uncontrolled sources emitting ≥8 tpy VOC or ≥5 tpy total HAPs that do not have
presumptive BACT requirements, a BACT analysis must be filed with the permit application for the
associated facility.

Flashing losses occur when a liquid with entrained gases goes from a higher pressure to a lower pressure. As the pressure on the
liquid drops, some of the compounds dissolved in the liquid are released, or “flashed” as gas.

3.5.2.7

Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) present in the earth’s atmosphere trap outgoing longwave radiation and warm
the earth’s atmosphere. Higher concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere result in more heat being
absorbed and cause higher global temperatures. Some GHGs, such as water vapor, occur naturally in the
atmosphere, and some such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) occur naturally and are also
emitted by human activities. The global atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by about 36
percent over the last 250 years, and far exceeds pre-industrial values determined from ice cores spanning
many thousands of years (IPCC, 2007). The anthropogenic GHGs of primary concern are: CO2, CH4, NO2
and fluorinated gases. Ice core records extending back over thousands of years indicate that worldwide
emissions of these anthropogenic GHGs have increased dramatically during the industrial era with an
increase of 70 percent between 1970 and 2004 alone (IPCC, 2007).
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the
assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the
World Meteorological Organization in 1988 to provide a clear scientific view on the current state of
knowledge about climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts. The main
activity of the IPCC is to provide at regular intervals Assessment Reports of the state of knowledge on
climate change. The latest report is “Climate Change 2007,” the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).
(IPCC 2007). In AR4, the IPCC concluded that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and most of
the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid 20th century is very likely due to the
observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The IPCC further concluded that,
“continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce
many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than
those observed during the 20th century.”
The impacts of climate change are expected to vary by region, and there is significant uncertainty
regarding the effects of climate change on any particular region. In particular, it is unknown how climate
change will affect the CD-C project area or its surrounding environment. However, AR4 identified
specific risks for North America as a whole, and these are shown below:







Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack, more winter flooding and
reduced summer flows, exacerbating competition for over-allocated water resources.
In the early decades of the century, moderate climate change is projected to increase aggregate
yields of rain-fed agriculture by 5 to 20 percent, but with important variability among regions.
Major challenges are projected for crops that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which
depend on highly utilized water resources.
Cities that currently experience heat waves are expected to be further challenged by an increased
number, intensity, and duration of heat waves during the course of the century, with potential for
adverse health impacts.
Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts
interacting with development and pollution.

The GHGs projected to be emitted by the CD-C Project Alternatives are CO2, CH4 and NO2. The
atmospheric lifetimes for CO2, CH4 and NO2 are on the order of years (IPCC, 2007). Emissions of GHGs
from any particular source become well-mixed throughout the global atmosphere. GHG emissions from
all sources contribute to the global atmospheric burden of GHGs, and it is not possible to attribute a
particular climate impact in any given region to GHG emissions from a particular source. It is possible to
state only that GHG emissions produced by the Proposed Action and action alternatives would add to the
global burden of GHGs and may therefore contribute to climate change impacts to the Affected
Environment produced by world-wide emissions; these impacts may include those shown above.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—AIR QUALITY

In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that EPA has the authority to regulate
greenhouse gases such as CH4 and CO2 as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The ruling did not,
however, require the EPA to create any emission control standards or ambient air quality standards for
GHGs. At present there are no ambient air quality standards for GHGs, and there are no emissions limits
on GHGs that would apply to the sources developed under the Proposed Action and the action
alternatives. There are, however, applicable reporting requirements under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas
Reporting Program. These GHG emission reporting requirements, finalized in 2010 under 40 CFR Part
98, will require the Operators to develop and report annual methane and CO2 emissions from equipment
leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from flaring, onshore production stationary and
portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from stationary equipment. At present, there
are no rules related to GHG emissions or impacts that would affect development of the Proposed Action
or the action alternatives besides these GHG reporting requirements.
3.5.3

Air Pollutant Concentrations

The U.S. EPA and the states set limits on permissible concentrations of air pollutants. The National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), Wyoming Ambient Air Quality Standards (WAAQS), and
Colorado Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) are health-based criteria for the maximum acceptable
concentrations of air pollutants at all locations to which the public has access.
Monitoring of air pollutant concentrations has been conducted within both the CD-C project area and the
study area, shown in Map 3.5-1. Map 3.5-1 presents the locations of ambient air monitoring sites within
the study area. These monitoring sites are part of several monitoring networks overseen by state and
federal agencies, including: WDEQ (State of Wyoming), Clean Air Status and Trends Network
(CASTNET), Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), and National Acid
Deposition Program (NADP) National Trends Network (NTN).
The study area shown in Map 3.5-1 encompasses five Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)
Class I areas and three sensitive Class II areas. The five Class I areas located within the CD-C study area
are the Bridger, Fitzpatrick, Mount Zirkel, Savage Run, and Rawah Wilderness Areas, and the three
sensitive Class II areas are the Popo Agie Wilderness Area, Dinosaur National Monument, and Wind
River Roadless Area.
Air pollutants monitored at these sites include carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone,
particulate matter less than 10 microns in effective diameter (PM10), particulate matter less than 2.5
microns in effective diameter (PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Background concentrations of these
pollutants define ambient air concentrations in the region and establish existing compliance with ambient
air quality standards. The most representative monitored regional background concentrations available for
criteria pollutants as identified by WDEQ-AQD (WDEQ-AQD, 2011) are shown in Table 3.5-8.

Air Quality Related Values

An AQRV is a resource “that may be adversely affected by a change in air quality. The resource may
include visibility or a specific scenic, cultural, physical, biological, ecological, or recreational resource
(FLAG 2010). The (AQRVs) visibility, atmospheric deposition, and the change in water chemistry
associated with atmospheric deposition at acid-sensitive lakes have been identified as a concern at several
Class I and sensitive Class II areas within the study area.
Visibility conditions can be measured as standard visual range (SVR), the farthest distance at which an
observer can just see a black object viewed against the horizon sky; the larger the SVR, the cleaner the
air. Visibility for the region is considered to be very good. Continuous visibility-related optical
background data have been collected in the PSD Class I Mount Zirkel and Bridger Wilderness Areas, as
part of the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) program. The average
SVR at the both the Mount Zirkel and Bridger Wilderness Areas is over 200 kilometers (Visibility
Information Exchange Web System [VIEWS] 2012).
Atmospheric deposition refers to the processes by which air pollutants are removed from the atmosphere
and deposited on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and it is reported as the mass of material deposited on
an area per year (kg/ha-yr). Air pollutants are deposited by wet deposition (precipitation) and dry
deposition (gravitational settling of pollutants). The chemical components of wet deposition include
sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), and ammonium (NH4); the chemical components of dry deposition include
SO4, SO2, NO3, NH4, and nitric acid (HNO3).
The National Acid Deposition Program (NADP) and the National Trends Network (NTN) station
monitors wet atmospheric deposition and the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) station

Table 3.5-10 presents a list of 12 lakes within the study area that have been identified as acid sensitive.
Analyses for potential changes to lake acidity from atmospheric deposition are based on the ANC for the
lake. The most recent lake chemistry background ANC data are also shown in Table 3.5-9. The ANC
values shown are the 10th percentile lowest ANC values which were calculated for each lake following
procedures provided from the USFS. The years of monitoring data that were currently available, and the
number of samples used in the calculation of the 10th percentile lowest ANC values, are provided.
Of the 12 lakes listed in Table 3.5-10, two lakes (Lazy Boy and Upper Frozen) are considered by the
USFS as extremely sensitive to atmospheric deposition since the background ANC values are less than 25
microequivalents per liter (µeq/l).

VEGETATION AND BIOLOGICAL SOIL CRUSTS
Introduction

The CD-C project area is located within the Omernik Level III “Wyoming Basin” Ecoregion 18 (Omernik
1987). This ecoregion is described as a broad intermontane basin dominated by arid grasslands and
shrublands and interrupted by high hills and low mountains. Ecoregion 18 is further divided into seven
smaller Level IV Ecoregions (18a through 18g) to provide a better description of local diversity within the
Wyoming Basin (Chapman et al. 2004). Two of these Level IV Ecoregions are present within the project
area: 18a (Rolling Sagebrush Steppe) and 18e (Salt Desert Shrub Basins). The approximate boundaries of
these two ecoregions within the project area are shown in Map 3.6-1.
Ecoregion 18a is described as a semiarid, vast region of rolling plains, alluvial and outwash fans, hills,
cuestas (a ridge with a gentle slope on one side and a cliff on the other), mesas, and terraces. Average
annual precipitation in this ecoregion ranges from 10–12 inches depending upon elevation and proximity
to mountains. The dominant vegetation in this ecoregion is sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), often associated
with various wheatgrasses (Agropyron spp.) or fescue (Festuca spp.). Elevation, aridity, slope, aspect,
snow accumulation, prevailing winds, and other factors all affect the species composition, morphology,
and density of sagebrush communities in the ecoregion. Ecotones between sagebrush steppe and adjacent
mountain ecoregions may appear at elevations as high as 9,800 feet (Omernik 1987). The ecoregion is
also interspersed with desert shrublands, dunes, and barren area in more arid regions (e.g., Red Desert);
and with mixed-grass prairie at the eastern limit of the ecoregion (Knight 1994). Streams originating in
the center of the basin are usually incised with a low gradient with fine gravel substrates derived from
shales. Small streams are ephemeral or weakly intermittent with sand or platy shale substrates (EPA 2003,
2004).
The Salt Desert Shrub (18e) ecoregion includes disjunct playas and isolated sand dunes. The plains,
terraces, and rolling alluvial fans of Ecoregion 18e have soils that tend to be more alkaline and less
permeable than soils in the Rolling Sagebrush Steppe (18a). Vegetation is a sparse cover of xeric-adapted
species such as shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), and Gardner’s
saltbush (Atriplex gardneri). Areas with stabilized sand dunes are dominated by alkali cordgrass
(Spartina gracilis), Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides), blow-out grass (Redfieldia flexuosa),
alkali wildrye (Leymus simplex), and needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comata). This arid region is
sensitive to grazing pressure, which may promote the spread of invasive weeds such as Russian thistle
(Salsola kali), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), and halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus). Land use is
primarily rangeland and wildlife habitat (Omernik 1987). Streams are incised and flow into playa areas
which are usually seasonal and have high levels of soluble salts (e.g., Chain Lakes area). Substrate is
commonly fine-textured material or platy shale gravels (EPA 2003, 2004).

Primary Cover Types

Native plants in the project area are predominantly drought-tolerant low shrub, grass, and flowering forb
species that are generally distributed according to the biological, chemical, and physical properties of the
parent soils of the area, as well as elevation, slope, aspect, and water availability.9
Fourteen primary cover types were identified and classified in the project area using the digitized data that
were field-verified throughout the 2007 growing season. Ten of the 14 cover types are vegetation cover
types and the remaining four are non-vegetated (bare ground, water, rock or talus slopes, and playas).
Table 3.6-1 shows the GIS-derived acreage of each vegetation and non-vegetated cover type. The
distribution of the various cover types on the project area is shown on Map 3.6-2.

Extended drought conditions throughout southwestern and south-central Wyoming have adversely
impacted many native shrub communities and several drought-related die-backs and die-offs are evident
throughout the project area. The greatest mortality appears to occur in Artemisia species and subspecies
that are more adapted to mesic sites, e.g., basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata) (ATT)
and mountain big sagebrush (A.t. spp. vaseyana var. vaseyana and var. pauciflora). The majority of shrub
mortality appears to be localized within and along the many draws (e.g., Barrel Springs Draw, Red Wash
Draw) and ephemeral drainages within the project area that, in a normal precipitation year, retain enough
moisture through the summer months to support the water requirements of these taxa. The more xericadapted Wyoming big sagebrush (A.t. wyomingensis) (ATW) subspecies and Gardner’s saltbush (Atriplex
gardneri) communities have been least affected. However, many ATW plants exhibit individual stem
death which is common for this subspecies under severe moisture stress (Fisser 1987). With the exception
of the 2007 growing season, seed production of ATW and Gardner’s saltbush has been minimal over the
past six to seven years as a result of drought stress. Plant mortality is also evident in several greasewood
(Sarcobatus vermiculatus) and shadscale stands in the southern portion of the project area (e.g., south of
I-80).

3.6.2.1

Mountain Big Sagebrush Cover Type and Subtype Inclusions

In the past, studies have identified Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana as mountain big sagebrush.
However, recent investigations (Goodrich et al. 1999, Tart and Winward 1996) recognize two varieties of
this subspecies, vaseyana and pauciflora. Numerous field investigations by Hayden-Wing Associates
LLC (HWA) throughout Wyoming have found these two varieties are morphologically similar in growth
form and are usually intermixed in the same habitat. Therefore, in the project area, these two varieties
have been mapped as one type and will be hereafter referred to as mountain big sagebrush (ATVP).
ATVP occupies approximately 54,606 acres within the project area, or about 5.1 percent of the project’s
total land surface area (Table 3.6-1).
Throughout the Intermountain West, ATVP is found at elevations from 3,500–9,800 feet and occurs from
foothills to subalpine zones. Annual precipitation ranges from 12–30 inches. Soils on which mountain big
sagebrush grows range from slightly acid to slightly alkaline and are generally well-drained. Soil moisture
is usually favorable throughout the growing season. A large number of grass, forb, and shrub species
grow in association with this shrub and usually produce an abundance of forage. Open stands with good,
diverse understory are essential to sage-grouse, and such sites can be used in treatment projects to
maintain sufficient shrub density and cover for sage-grouse. It is essential that desirable understory
species and woody species associated with mountain big sagebrush be retained or reestablished as part of
the reclamation effort.
The lower-elevation range of ATVP on the project area is about 6,500–6,800 feet. ATVP plant density
(stems per unit area) increases and plant form becomes more robust at about 6,900 feet. These attributes
are more noticeable on the leeward side of north/south-oriented ridgelines and hogbacks where
topographic features are favorable for extensive snow deposition and retention. The more robust stands
appear to be closely associated with the higher elevations along the west rim of the Continental Divide
which bisects the project area near Wamsutter, and in the Flat Top Mountain complex in the southern
portion of the project area.
The southern and southwestern portions of the project area include the Flat Top Mountain complex (Flat
Top Mountain, East Flat Top Mountain, North Flat Top Mountain, and West Flat Top Mountain) and
Robbers Gulch areas, where higher elevations and a greater moisture regime provide suitable habitats for
ATVP and mountain mixed-shrub communities. North Flat Top Mountain in the NW ¼ Section 2, T14N,
R93W is the highest topographic feature in the project area with an altitude of 7,822 feet. It is at these
greater elevations with deeper soils that ATVP can grow to over 40 inches tall and become so dense that
it is difficult to walk through the stand.
Common grass species associated with the ATVP cover type include:






Bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria
spicata)
Bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus
elymoides)
Green needlegrass (Nassella viridula)
Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis)
Little bluegrass (Poa secunda)








Mutton bluegrass (Poa fendleriana)
Needle-and-thread (Hesperostipa comata)
Oniongrass (Melica bulbosa)
Prairie junegrass (Koeleria cristata)
Spike fescue (Leucopa kingii)
Thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus
macrourus)

Common understory shrubs may include green (Douglas) rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus), gray
(rubber) rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), and snowberry (Symphoricarpus oreophilus), with lesser
densities of antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) and serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia). The
increased average annual precipitation at these ATVP sites provides suitable habitat for a diverse and
abundant forb component. Frequently observed forb species include the following:

The mixed mountain-shrub cover type is similar to the mountain big sagebrush described above, with the
distinction that mountain-shrub species must comprise 5 percent or more of the canopy cover to be
classified as a mixed mountain-shrub cover type. Mixed mountain-shrubs occur in the Flattop Mountain
complex, especially on the north and east aspects, but ATVP is the dominant shrub species at all these
locations.
Chemical treatment of late successional, dense stands of ATVP in the project area has been conducted by
the RFO to reduce sagebrush density and increase herbaceous production. Thinning of ATVP with low
rates of the herbicide tebuthiuron has been demonstrated to enhance herbaceous plant production,
community structure, ecosystem functioning, and biodiversity (Olson and Whitson 2002). The concept of
sagebrush “thinning” was developed at the University of Wyoming and has been shown to have broad
applications in rangeland environments, including restoration projects.
Wildfires and prescribed fires both occur in the ATVP cover type. Mountain big sagebrush is highly
susceptible to injury from fire, and plants are readily killed in all seasons, even by light-severity fires
(Blaisdell 1953, Blaisdell et al. 1982, Neuenschwander 1980). Without rest or post-burn grazing
management, sagebrush cover may return to pre-treatment levels. Lesica et al. (2007) examined 38 sites
in southwestern Montana and found that average post-fire time to full recovery for mountain big
sagebrush was about 32 years. Monitoring of prescribed burns of ATVP with rest or deferment after
burning in Carbon County indicates sagebrush recovery may take up to 50 years to reach pre-burn levels
(Warren 2004).
3.6.2.2

Wyoming Big Sagebrush Cover Type and Subtype Inclusions

Wyoming big sagebrush (ATW) is the dominant vegetation cover type in the project area and occupies
approximately 417,572 acres or about 39 percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1).
The ATW subspecies can be found throughout the Intermountain West on xeric sites, foothills, valleys,
and mesas between 2,500 and 7,000 feet. Annual precipitation varies from 7–15 inches. Soils on which
ATW occur are usually well-drained, gravelly to stony, and may have low water-holding capacity. Soils
are shallow, usually less than about 18 inches deep. Fewer herbaceous species are associated with
Wyoming big sagebrush than with ATT or ATVP. Native bunchgrasses are often important understory
species in ATW communities.
ATW occurs in almost an infinite number of communities and associations. Since the plants are almost
totally dependent upon moisture received through infiltration and percolation of snow or rain water, their
size and productivity responds as a direct result to moisture availability as influenced by soil, chemical, or
other site criteria. The ATW communities with vigorous and productive plants are often located in
depressions/swales protected from wind. These sites have a relatively deep and porous soil. Open, wind­
blown sites normally have a thin, A Horizon topsoil layer. The plants are sparse, small in stature, and
exhibit limited productivity. Fisser (1972) identified three recognizable ATW sub-community
classifications based on obvious plant heights:
1. Arid – average height about 10–12 inches;
2. Intermediate – average height about 12–18 inches; and
3. Mesic – average height about 18–24 inches.

3-70

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

Healthy and vigorous ATW plants located in ideal growing sites can attain a height of 40 inches.
An estimate of the elevation range for ATW in the project area indicates it is the dominant sagebrush
subspecies below an elevation of about 6,500 feet. This elevation is about the same as the lower-elevation
limit of ATVP. Therefore, it becomes apparent that in most cases, the transition zone between these two
taxa is not well-defined and may occur over a distance of several miles depending mainly on parent-soil
characteristics, snow-deposition patterns, slope, and aspect.
The most common grasses associated with the ATW cover type include the following:




Bottlebrush squirreltail
Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum
hymenoides)
Little bluegrass






Needle-and-thread
Thickspike wheatgrass
Western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii)
Threadleaf sedge (Carex filifolia)

Other shrubs often associated with this cover type are typically as follows:






Broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)
Cotton horsebrush (Tetradymia canescens)
Gray rabbitbrush
Green rabbitbrush
Shadscale





Spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa)
Plains prickly-pear cactus (Polyacantha
opuntia)
Winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata)

Forbs are less common than in other sagebrush communities due to the more arid environment. However,
the most frequently observed species include the following:






Beardtongue (Penstemon spp.)
Goldenweed (Happlopappus ssp.)
Hood’s phlox (Phlox hoodii)
Hollyleaf clover (Trifolium gymnocarpum)
Hooker’s sandwort (Arenaria hookeri)







Locoweeds (Oxytropis spp.)
Long-leaf phlox (Phlox longiloba)
Low buckwheat (Erigonum ovalifolium)
Spring parsley (Cymopterus acaulis)
Wild onion (Allium spp.)

An Artemisia taxon closely related to ATW (Winward 1991a) was identified north of the Chain Lake
Flats area. This currently undescribed taxon is tentatively known as Gosiute big sagebrush and is thought
to be a hybrid between ATW and ATV var. pauciflora (Winward 1999). The distribution of this hybrid
Artemisia is believed to be closely associated with the shoreline soils of the ancient paleolake Gosiute in
Wyoming (Winward 1999). A map of the approximate shoreline of Lake Gosiute during the Eocene
(Dyni 1996) indicates the eastern extent of its shoreline was approximately near Creston Junction and
extended northwest into Sweetwater County, crossing the Chain Lakes area. At its maximum extent, Lake
Gosiute covered about 15,000 mi2 (Dyni 1996). Gosiute big sagebrush has many unique characteristics
that are described more fully by Bennett (2004).
On gravelly to rocky, shallow sites, both bluebunch wheatgrass and black sagebrush (A. nova) are found
in addition to a greater density of cushion plants. This subtype inclusion may be observed at certain
locations along Red Creek Road in the northern portion of the project area. The black sagebrush present is
the light form of the genus. Other sub-type inclusions in the ATW cover type include small, open areas
dominated by bud sagebrush (Picrothamnus desertorum) such as that found on the plateau area north of
Lost Creek Basin. The most diverse ATW sub-type inclusions observed are associated with the many
small, stabilized sand dunes that occur in the western and northern portions of the project area. These
dunes are associated with similar dunes found in the Sand Hills, Ferris Mountains, and the Killpecker
Sand Dune areas. When the dune is oriented perpendicular to the westerly winter wind, it is not
uncommon to observe arid-adapted species such as ATW, spiny hopsage, and prickly-pear cactus on the
western aspect of the dune slope and mesic forms such as basin big sagebrush and greasewood on the
leeward side where snow deposition provides greater water availability. The dune sites with the greatest
vegetation diversity occur near the south shore of the several small lakes in the Chain Lakes area where it

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

is not uncommon to observe budsage, ATW, Wood’s rose, shadscale, spiny hopsage, fringed sage (A.
filifolia), greasewood, and green rabbitbrush growing together, intermixed with grasses and forbs in a
very small area.
The value of ATW as an important winter browse species cannot be overemphasized. Mule deer
preference for sagebrush species as winter forage is well-documented (Sheehy and Winward 1981,
Wambolt 2004). Nelson et al. (1994) found that ATW in the winter diets of mule deer in the Baggs
Habitat Unit comprised approximately 74 percent of the total diet. DeBolt (2000) found ATW made up
more than 70 percent of mule deer diets on winter ranges west of WY 789. ATW is also an important
food item for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and taller stands have been shown to
serve as severe winter relief (SWR) habitat for these birds during winters of record-breaking snowfall
such as occurred during the winter of 2000–01 (HWA 2004) and 2010–11 (WRCC 2012).
The sagebrush “thinning” concept discussed in the mountain big sagebrush sub-section (3.6.2.1) has also
been employed by the RFO to reduce ATW density and increase herbaceous production in the Tipton and
Flattop areas of the CD-C project area.
Wildfire is not common in the ATW cover type due to the low quantity of fine fuels in the shrub’s
interspaces that can support and carry a fire. However, in extreme weather conditions (e.g., low humidity,
high temperatures, and strong winds) such as was common during the 2000 fire season, fire was observed
to carry rapidly through a sparse ATW stand west of Medicine Bow, Wyoming (Bennett 2004).
Following fire or other major disturbance, herbaceous species will dominate the treatment site and
recovery to 20 percent canopy cover may take more than 40 years (Young and Evans 1989, Winward
1991b). Site reestablishment is by seed bank, seed production from remnant plants, and seeds from
adjacent plants outside of the burn area. Discontinuity of fuels in ATW communities usually results in
mosaic burn patterns, leaving remnant plants for seed (Bushey 1987). Overall fire return intervals in
ATW appear to have ranged from 10–240 years or more (Winward 1991b, Bunting et al. 1987, Young
and Evans 1989). Reviewers for the Rapid Assessment Reference Condition Model component of the
LANDFIRE project (www.landfire.gov) disagreed about average fire-return intervals in the ATW
vegetation group, but agreed the mean fire intervals of 90–140 years were probably realistic (Schmidt et
al. 2002).
3.6.2.3

Basin Big Sagebrush Cover Type

Basin big sagebrush (ATT) occupies approximately 7,157 acres within the project area or about 0.7
percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). ATT typically occurs on the deeper, welldrained soils usually found along ephemeral and intermittent drainages, floodplains, and leeward slopes
where water availability is greater than on adjacent uplands. It is often co-dominant with greasewood at
certain sites and may occur as small inclusions in the ATW and ATVP cover types. Bennett (2004) found
that heights of ATT are a good measure of site suitability. More arid sites produce plants that average
about 23 inches in height, intermediate sites about 29 inches and mesic sites greater than 62 inches. At
ideal sites such as found along the Muddy Creek drainage, ATT often grows to 10 feet in height, and
plants attaining 13 feet in height have been recorded along the Green River in Sublette County (Bennett
2004). Palatability of ATT is generally considered lower than ATW (Rosentreter 2005). This
phenomenon was observed by the Rawlins BLM staff during the harsh winter of 1983–84 in the Muddy
Creek area. They found that mule deer use of ATW was severe compared to marginal use of ATT, even
though animals were starving and winter mortality reached 50 percent in some Herd Units (Warren 2004).
Common understory species in the ATT cover type include the following:

Wildfires and prescribed burns both occur in this cover type. Where other species are uncommon or
without post-burn grazing management, sagebrush cover may return to pre-treatment levels in 15–20
years. However, monitoring of prescribed burns with rest or deferment after treatment indicate ATT
recovery may take up to 50 years to attain pre-treatment levels.
The recent prolonged drought in south-central Wyoming has had a severe effect on ATT. The majority of
the sagebrush die-backs and die-offs observed at present in the project area occur in ATT and ATVP
stands, both of which depend on perennial mesic conditions for growth, reproduction, and survival. The
heaviest mortality has been observed to occur along ephemeral channels in heavier soils where water
availability is usually good to excellent in normal years. The most robust plants are currently associated
with higher-elevation sandy loam soils on the leeward (usually east) side of slopes where snowdrifts
accumulate, thereby increasing water availability. The same beneficial effect can be seen on the leeward
side of the many snow fences in the project area, especially along I-80 and WY 789.
3.6.2.4

Juniper Woodland Cover Type

The juniper woodland cover type occupies about 536 acres on the project area or about 0.05 percent of the
project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) is the dominant tree
within this cover type. The preferred habitat of Utah juniper is usually associated with shallow, rocky soil
with a fractured rock substrate, where the tree can root down to and take advantage of collected water.
Juniper will also encroach into adjacent sagebrush stands. This can be seen west of the Bluffs in the
extreme southern end of the project area, north of Baggs along the west side of WY 789. In April 2007,
several hundred mule deer were seen daily on the cuesta west of the bluffs. They appeared to be using the
tree area for bedding and thermal cover during the day and then trailing down the slopes to the Muddy
Creek drainage for food and water at night. The dominant sagebrush taxon on the cuesta is ATVP, which
is ranked as more palatable than ATW and ATT (Rosentreter 2005).
Common understory species associated with this cover type include the following:







Beardtongue
Bitterbrush
Black sagebrush
Bluebunch wheatgrass
Canby bluegrass (Poa canbyi)
Goldenweed








Groundsel
Indian ricegrass
Little bluegrass
Miner’s candle (Cryptantha ssp.)
Phlox
Twin bladderpod (Physaria ssp.)

When stands of Utah juniper become too dense, the understory of native grasses and forbs dies out and is
usually replaced by invasive species such as downy brome (Bromus tectorum) and annual forbs. Fire can
be a useful tool in reducing juniper overstory and maintaining understory cover and composition. Where
the understory is too sparse to carry a fire, some form of mechanical treatment may be required to restore
species diversity. A great number of Utah juniper in this area were logged to produce charcoal for the
Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) smelters in Rawlins in the 1870s–80s (Bennett 2004).

3.6.2.5

Greasewood Flats and Fans

The greasewood cover type occupies approximately 246,273 acres within the project area or about 23
percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). Greasewood is a native, deciduous perennial
shrub and can attain heights of 8 feet under ideal growing conditions.
Greasewood inhabits a wide range of plant communities within the project area. Plants are typically found
growing in saline soils that can be quite moist (wet saline meadows) to dry uplands. Greasewood is often
the dominant species in the plant community, but plants are also found associated with saltbush, saltgrass,
shadscale, and ATT and ATW sagebrush communities. Ideal habitat for greasewood within the project
area is often located on saline valley bottoms (e.g., Muddy Creek floodplain) and on salt-bearing shale
outcrops in canyons and on foothills. Sites vary in respect to soil texture and availability of groundwater.
Some sites are wet with high water tables, and others are dry with well-drained soils. Greasewood occurs
in the project area as smaller, mixed stands to large, monotypic stands. The latter were observed in several
large saline basins located in the northern portion of the project area (e.g. Lost Creek and Red Desert
Basins). Greasewood can be found at all elevations of the project area. It often encroaches into the big
sagebrush and saltbush cover types, especially where additional moisture is available, such as on the
many vegetated sand dunes in the southwestern portion of the project area (e.g., north of Mexican Flats).
Greasewood is the dominant shrub associated with the large, vegetated sand-dune complex extending
west to east across the northern portion of the area. The most extensive vegetated dune complex is located
in T23N:R97W and T23N:R96W. Within this complex, several active dunes are also present. The
established greasewood in this sandy area serve as a valuable soil stabilizer by decreasing wind and water
erosion. Black greasewood is also the dominant shrub species in the Chain Lakes region in the northern
portion of the project area. An unusual greasewood growth form was observed in the vicinity of the
several small lakes in this area. The usual upright stature of the plant has been replaced by a low,
prostrate, spreading form which rarely exceeds 10–12 inches in height. It is unknown at the present time
if this is an ecotypic adaptation or if the plants represent a different subspecies. Greasewood distribution
and abundance in the southern portion of the project area is greatest along portions of the Muddy Creek
floodplain corridor and in a large, flat basin immediately north of the Mexican Flats area.
The palatability of greasewood in Wyoming is reported as fair for cattle, domestic sheep, horses,
pronghorn, mule deer, and small mammals, and as poor for elk, white-tailed deer, small non-game birds
and waterfowl (Dittberner & Olson 1983). Poisonous oxalates, found in the leaves, have caused mortality
in sheep. Cattle are rarely poisoned, but spines are reported to puncture the rumen (the first chamber of
the alimentary canal). Greasewood understory composition is not as diverse as in the big sagebrush cover
types.
Common understory species in the black greasewood cover type include the following:





Basin wildrye
Biscuitroot
Bottlebrush squirreltail

Saltbush Flats and Fans and Sub-type Inclusions

Gardner’s saltbush (saltbush) is a native, spreading, low-growing, evergreen perennial sub-shrub and
grows from 8–20 inches in height (McArthur et al. 1978). Saltbush is the third-largest primary cover type
on the project area following the ATW and black greasewood cover types at 172,699 acres or about 16
percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1).
This cover type is found on saline soils in small to large openings or can occur as “stringer” inclusions
within the ATW or greasewood primary cover types. These saltbush stands are sparsely vegetated and
bare soil often exceeds 60 percent of the total ground-cover. Average vegetative stem height of saltbush

on the project area ranges from 4–10 inches but several robust plants in the 16- to 18-inch range were
observed south of the Chain Lakes area along Riner Road. Saltbush reproductive stems were observed to
be particularly abundant during the 2007 growing season at all sites within the project area.
The largest monotypic saltbush communities within the project area are located in the Mexican Flats area.
However, the northern portion of the project area also contains several sizable communities, and
mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) were observed at all locations where this cover type was
dominant. The most common sub-type inclusion in this cover type is birdfoot sagebrush (A. pedifidita)
which may occur as a pure stand or, more typically, intermixed with the saltbush plants.
The persistent leaves of saltbush provide nutritious winter forage for livestock and wildlife species
throughout its range (Nord et al. 1969). It is particularly important for domestic sheep because it provides
the minimum nutritional maintenance requirement for gestating ewes (Fisser & Joyce 1984).
Other common plant species associated with this cover type include the following:






Biscuitroot
Western wheatgrass
Bottlebrush squirreltail
Little bluegrass
Indian ricegrass






Plains prickly-pear cactus
Threadleaf sedge (most common associate
on the project area)
Wild onion
Winterfat

Commonly observed inclusions in the saltbush and desert shrub vegetation types are cushion plant
communities. Cushion-plant vegetation is found on suitable sites scattered across much of the project
area. In the cushion growth form, stems and leaves are densely aggregated near ground level, probably to
reduce the stresses of severe environmental conditions (e.g. cold, high winds, desiccation). Cushion-plant
vegetation has been divided into two broad categories—alpine and lowland—with completely different
species compositions (Knight 1994). The lowland type is found on RFO lands.
According to Jones (2005), a “cushion-plant” is typically defined as a prostrate, acaulescent (having no
stem or only a very short stem), tap-rooted forb that typically grows in a dense mat. Examples can be
found in a number of plant families and include Arenaria hookeri (Caryophyllaceae), Astragalus
spatulatus (Fabaceae), Erigeron composites (Asteraceae), Eriogonum acaule (Polygonaceae), Draba
oligosperma (Brassicaceae), and Phlox muscoides (Polemoniaceae). Cushion-plant vegetation is the short,
often sparse vegetation on rims and outcrops formed in resistant bedrock, where cushion-plants contribute
a major proportion of the plant canopy cover. Arenaria hookeri and Pseudoroegneria spicata are almost
always present in the cushion-plant vegetation and often contribute a substantial amount of the canopy
cover. At many sites, these species are joined by Phlox muscoides (a cushion-plant) as a dominant or co­
dominant. Elsewhere, P. muscoides is absent, and a number of other cushion-plants (Astragalus
spatulatus, Astragalus simplicifolius, Tetraneuris acaulis, Stenotus armerioides) or non-cushion forbs
(especially Phlox hoodii) are regularly present and sometimes contribute much of the canopy cover (Jones
2005).
The concept of cushion-plant vegetation usually excludes sparse vegetation dominated by non-cushion
forbs or sub-shrubs (such as Atriplex nuttallii or Artemisia pedatifida) that occurs on soft bedrock. In the
field, the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD) defines cushion-plant vegetation as vegetation
in which cushion-plants are estimated to contribute at least 50 percent of the canopy cover and the grasses
and shrubs common in the surrounding shrub-steppe vegetation contributes less than 50 percent of the
canopy cover (Jones 2005).
3.6.2.7

Mixed Desert-Shrub

The mixed desert-shrub cover type occupies approximately 142,062 acres on the project area or about 13
percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). The mixed desert shrub cover type as
described in this document is a mixture of shrubs and sub-shrubs occurring in dry, saline upland habitats.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

Shrub cover is often dominated by shadscale but can be a mixture of saltbush, black greasewood and/or
desert cushion plants. Several small sites were observed in the northern portion of the project area along
Red Creek Road where bud sage (Picrothamnus desertorum) is the dominant shrub with plants reaching
10 inches in height with a robust form which is unusual for this species in Wyoming. A herbaceous
understory of forbs and grasses is usually present within this cover type and biological soil crusts are
usually present on the soil surface. This cover type exhibits three phases including: (1) sites dominated by
sagebrush, (2) sites dominated by saline-tolerant shrubs such as greasewood and saltbush, and (3)
discontinuous areas devoid of woody shrubs, but with the same herbaceous understory components
characteristic of shrub-covered areas. As with the saltbush vegetation cover type, cushion plant
communities are often observed in the mixed desert shrub cover type.
Common herbaceous ground-cover species in desert shrub communities include the following:






Bluebunch wheatgrass
Buckwheat
Common yarrow (Achillea millefolium)
Indian paintbrush (Castilleja spp.)
Indian ricegrass







Needle-and-thread grass
Plains prickly-pear
Sandberg bluegrass
Threadleaf sedge
Western wheatgrass

In addition to sagebrush, other shrubs commonly observed in this cover type often include the following:




Gray rabbitbrush
Green rabbitbrush
Shadscale

3.6.2.8




Spiny hopsage
Spiny horsebrush

Vegetated Sand Dunes

Vegetated sand dunes occupy approximately 276 acres within the project area, or about 0.03 percent of
the project’s total land surface (Table 3.6-1). The largest sand-dune complex in the project area is in the
northern portion of the project area and primarily located in T23N:R97W and T23N:R96W in Sweetwater
County, north of County Road (CR) 67 and CR 20. Several dunes in this complex are currently active and
vegetation is absent. Many smaller, vegetated dune sites are located throughout the west-central portion of
the project area west of Dad and near the southern edge of the Chain Lakes area. Greasewood is the
dominant shrub on many of these dunes and serves as a valuable soil stabilizer by decreasing wind and
water erosion. A recent investigation of the Killpecker sand dune area in southwest Wyoming by Mayer
and Mahan (2004) found that the age of eolian sand (15,000 years before present [B.P.]), combined with
those of Folsom (12,950–11,950 years B.P.) and Agate Basin artifacts (12,600–10,700 years B.P.)
overlying eolian sand, indicates the dune field existed at least during the late Pleistocene.
These unique sites provide micro-environments that allow for greater plant diversity than adjacent upland
sites. Steidtmann (1973) found that snow may become incorporated in eolian sand dunes of southwestern
Wyoming when snow cornices on dune crests begin to melt, slide down the lee slope, and are covered by
sand during subsequent lee-slide deposition. In some cases burial is rapid enough to provide the insulation
necessary to preserve the ice and snow within the dune throughout the year. The smaller dunal areas such
as those found west of Dad are predominantly oriented perpendicular to the westerly prevailing winter
wind, forming natural snow-breaks that trap snow on their leeward side. It is not uncommon to observe
ATW (arid form), spiny hopsage, and prickly-pear cactus on the western aspect and ATW (mesic form),
ATT, and greasewood on the leeward side of these smaller, stabilized sand dunes.
The small dune sites south of the Chain Lakes complex often occur within other primary cover types (e.g.,
ATW and saltbush) and form hummocks covered with a diverse shrub and herbaceous understory very
different than the surrounding vegetation. At several sites it was observed that a combination of budsage,
ATW, shadscale, spiny hopsage, fringed sage, greasewood, and green rabbitbrush intermixed with grasses
and forbs were all occupying these small hummocks.

3.6.2.9

Riparian Cover Types

The riparian/wet-meadow cover type occupies about 1,004 acres on the project area or about 0.10 percent
of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). Riparian sites often occur as narrow corridors
traversing many different plant zones. Streams and drainages often occupy very small but important sites
within major land types. The vegetation and habitat provided by the riparian zone is extremely important
to the management of associated lands. Riparian sites attract and sustain livestock and wildlife and are
particularly important during the midsummer months. The recent extended drought has concentrated the
use of riparian sites by livestock, wildlife, and wild horses—usually with deleterious effects. The two
allotments that did not meet Standard # 2 (Riparian/Wetland Health) of the Standards for Public Land
Health (See Section 3.6.3.) were the Cyclone Rim (10103) and Jawbone (00709) allotments. The Cyclone
Rim allotment failed the Standard because of non-functional or Functioning-At-Risk springs and seeps.
Identified causes included previous excessive use by wild horses during the growing season, often
complicated by livestock grazing (BLM 2001a). There is only one permanent water source (Mud Springs)
in the Jawbone allotment (23,000 acres/9,307 ha.) in addition to one well and ten semi-reliable reservoirs.
Summer cattle use was identified as the primary factor affecting the wetland habitat/vegetation in this
allotment. Since the 1998-2000 PFC evaluations, fencing and off-site water development have been
installed at many of these sites (BLM 2001a).
Riparian communities often provide diversity to otherwise rather barren and exposed wildlands. Riparian
habitat within the project area occurs along perennial and intermittent drainages, around seeps and
springs, and around man-made reservoirs. Although small in extent, these areas are the most productive of
all vegetation types and therefore are extremely important for wildlife habitat and livestock forage.
The major drainage in the southern portion of the project area is Muddy Creek (HUC 14050004). Muddy
Creek is described as a high-elevation, cold-desert stream originating in the Sierra Madre Range east of
the project area and terminating at its confluence with the Little Snake River near Baggs, Wyoming.
Upstream from this confluence, numerous unnamed ephemeral channels and named draws flow into
Muddy Creek.
The northern portion of the project area generally drains into the Great Divide Basin (HUC 14040200) via
Separation Creek. The Great Divide Basin is a closed basin bounded by the Continental Divide on all
sides and has no hydrologic outlet (Seaber et al. 1987). The Great Divide Basin is a relatively shallow
depression with isolated buttes, pan-like depressions, and sparse vegetation. Numerous ephemeral streams
flow toward the center of the Basin before disappearing into the soil or man-made impoundments. The
Chain Lakes complex is located approximately 32 miles northwest of Rawlins. Two large lakes and
several small lakes extend from west to east across the flats. This general area supports greater sagegrouse, migratory waterfowl, and shorebirds, and provides winter habitat for pronghorn. Small bands of
wild horses from the Lost Creek Herd Management Area (HMA) are commonly observed in this part of
the project area.
Riparian/wetland habitat within the project area can be defined and described in the following groups:
desert springs and seeps, and streams supported by them; playa lakebeds; wetlands in the Chain Lakes
area; and man-made wetlands around artesian wells. Streams in the area generally flow short distances
supporting riparian vegetation before turning into ephemeral/intermittent drainages that do not support
riparian vegetation. A good example is Lost Creek which is fed by Eagle’s Nest Spring. Riparian
conditions exist above the Red Creek Road culvert before the stream disappears underground. However,
from the culvert and continuing to Lost Lake, the creek’s stream bed is normally dry and its riparian
corridor supports mainly greasewood and non-riparian vegetation. The Lost Creek drainage corridor was
observed to provide excellent pygmy rabbit habitat and appears to be a major travel route and bedding
area for elk from the Red Desert Migratory Elk Herd. Three to seven head of elk were consistently seen in
this area during Apri – May, 2007. The Lost Creek streambed below Eagle’s Nest Spring was
documented by HWA to contain persistent sepal yellowcress (Rorippia calcycina), a BLM-designated

special status plant species. The 2006 and 2007 HWA special status plant species survey results are
available as a separate Technical Report (HWA 2008a).
Riparian grassland habitat types are the most common forms of vegetation found within riparian areas in
the project area. Riparian grasslands are wetland-, stream-, or spring-associated grass and grass-like
communities, which are maintained by a water table within rooting depth during most of the growing
season. Common species include the following:









Alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides)
Asters
Baltic rush (Juncus balticus)
Basin wildrye
Beaked sedge (C. utriculata)
Cinquefoil (Dasiphora floribunda)
Horsetail (Eqisetum arvense)
Inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata)
Kentucky bluegrass



Liddon sedge (C. petasata)
Mat muhly (Muhlenbergia richardsonis)
Mint (Mentha spp.)
Nebraska sedge (Carex nebrascensis)
Redtop (Agrostis stoloifera)
Spike sedge (C. nardina)
Thistle
Tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa)
Wheatgrass

The majority of the project area consists of ephemeral drainages (washes, draws, gullies) which flow only
in response to snowmelt in early spring or as a result of summer precipitation events which are usually of
short but intense duration. Soil erosion may be severe where erosion devices are not present or ground
cover is sparse.
The most prominent natural wetland system in the northern portion of the project area is the Chain Lakes
complex. These lakes and adjacent habitats support riparian grassland and open aquatic-emergent wetland
habitats. Within these alkaline wetlands, the shallow pools where salts accumulate are the harshest
growing environment for plants. Plants must tolerate not only standing water in spring, but also dry and
extremely alkaline soils in late summer. Stunted, scattered plants of arrowgrass (Triglochin spp.), an
exceedingly salt-tolerant, grass-like forb, are frequently the sole inhabitants of these highly alkaline
depressions. Alkali plantain (Plantago eriopoda) and inland saltgrass can survive in less alkaline
depressions. Like most halophytes (plants adapted to grow on salty soils) these plants have the ability to
accumulate higher concentrations of salts in their cell sap than salt concentrations in the soil water. By
concentrating salts, these halophytes can draw soil water into their roots, since water generally flows from
areas of low salt concentration to areas of higher salt concentrations
Plant species in these areas are saline/alkali tolerant and may include:









Alkali plantain
Alkali saltgrass (Distichlis stricta)
American bulrush (Schoenoplectus
americanus)
Arrowgrass
Baltic rush
Buttercup
Cinquefoil (Potentilla spp.)
Greasewood

Hairy goldaster (Heterotheca villosa)
Nuttal’s alkaligrass (Puccinellia
nuttalliana)
Rocky Mountain glasswort (Salicornia
rubra)
Sea milkwort (Glaux maritima)
Slim sedge (Carex praegracilis)
Tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa)

The Chain Lakes wetlands also provide habitat for meadow milkvetch (Astragalus diversifolius var.
diversifolius), recently discovered in 2008 by the WYNDD (Heidel 2008). The species has now been
documented in three extant occurrences in south-central Wyoming, totaling approximately 8,000 plants
within about 187 acres, near the Chain Lakes region of the project area (Heidel 2009) and was recently
added to the BLM sensitive plant list (BLM 2010) (see Section 3.9.2.3 Sensitive Plant Species).
Man-made wetlands occur primarily next to artesian wells and reservoirs or pits. Wetlands supported by
artesian wells are mostly composed of sedges, bulrushes, and several grass species. Many reservoirs and

3-78

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

pits in the project area do not hold water on a year-long basis and the perennial drought that began with
the 2000 growing season has had negative effects on water-storage capabilities and wetland vegetation
health.
An extensive wetland complex known as the George Dew/Red Wash Wetland Complex is located near
Dad about 25 miles north of Baggs, west of and adjacent to WY 789. This site encompasses
approximately 6 miles of willow-dominated (Salix sp.) riparian corridor along Muddy Creek with
associated floodplain and meadows ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 mile wide, constructed and natural
impoundments, and adjacent upland sites dominated by greasewood, sagebrush, and Gardner saltbush.
The George Dew/state land wetlands project is within the Muddy Creek Wetland Complex. The wetland
component of this project was designed to protect and enhance about 1,100 acres of existing wetlands and
create 125 acres of new wetlands (Wyoming Riparian Association 1997).
3.6.2.10 Basin Grassland

The basin grassland vegetation cover type occupies approximately 5,122 acres within the project area or
about 0.5 percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). This cover type is found in
scattered park-like patches throughout the project area. Shrubs such as the native rabbitbrushes, winterfat,
and various sagebrush species and subspecies may be present but cannot occupy more than 25 percent of
the total ground cover to be classified as basin grassland. Herbaceous species often include western
wheatgrass, blue grama, needle-and-thread, threadleaf sedge, Sandberg bluegrass, and prairie junegrass.
Plains prickly-pear is also commonly observed in this cover type.
3.6.2.11 Non-vegetated Cover Type―Bare Ground

Bare ground on the project area accounts for approximately 4,117 acres or about 0.4 percent of the
project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1). Bare ground, as defined in this EIS, contains less than 7.5
percent vegetated ground cover. The soils in these relatively low-production areas and underlying parent
materials are very soft and highly erosive, and the landscape is cut with a large number of drainage
channels. Vegetation, if present in these sites, is sparse and may include various species ranging from
stunted shrub forms to scattered bunchgrasses (e.g., Indian ricegrass and needle-and-thread).
3.6.2.12 Non-vegetated Cover Type―Water

This non-vegetated cover type occupies approximately 2,129 acres or about 0.2 percent of the project area
(Table 3.6-1).
3.6.2.13 Non-vegetated Cover Type―Rock or Talus Slope

This non-vegetated cover type occupies approximately 1,034 acres or about 0.1 percent of the project area
(Table 3.6-1), and includes naturally occurring areas of bare rock such as canyon cliffs, spires, rock
outcrops, and talus fields.
3.6.2.14 Non-vegetated Cover Type―Playa

Playas occupy approximately 124 acres in the project area (Table 3.6-1). Playas are characterized as
water catchments that are most often ephemeral, drain internally, accumulate sediment, and serve as
recharge points to underground aquifers. While playas themselves are usually devoid of vegetation, they
are commonly ringed by greasewood, shadscale, saltbush, and other salt-tolerant plants that provide
critical winter forage for livestock and other herbivores. In Wyoming, playas, when flooded, are
important sources of habitat for wildlife including waterfowl such as ducks and geese, along with sandhill
cranes and shorebirds. Amphibians such as frogs, toads, and salamanders also depend on playas, as do
several major orders of insects.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

In most years playas are dry or water may only cover the lowest portion, the portion near a water source
such as a spring, or the portion where an ephemeral stream discharges onto the playa surface. Between
wet periods the surface of the playa typically dries out completely and may even become desiccated,
forming polygonal cracks and fissures in clay-rich sediments. In playas where the groundwater table is at
or near the surface, soluble salts will precipitate, forming ephemeral crusts that may or may not survive
subsequent wetting episodes. The high salt and clay content of playa surface mud, and the dry and hot
conditions that prevail most of the year, usually prevent plants from becoming established.
3.6.3

Watershed-Based Land Health Assessment

In 2008 the RFO finished conducting Standards and Guidelines Assessments for all the watersheds within
the field office. These are watershed-based land health assessments mandated by the Director of the BLM
on a 10-year basis. From 1998 through 2000, the RFO conducted Standards and Guidelines Assessments
on an allotment basis; however, in 2001 to meet this 10-year timeframe, larger-scale watershed-based
reports were undertaken. The Upper Colorado River and the Great Divide Basin were the first two
watershed reports completed (2002 and 2003 respectively). Because these two watersheds were the first
completed they are due for reassessment, at which time progress towards management objectives will be
evaluated. Two of the standards apply to vegetation. Standard 2, Riparian and Wetland Vegetation, states
that “riparian and wetland vegetation has structural, age, and species diversity characteristic of the stage
of channel succession and is resilient and capable of recovering from natural and human disturbance in
order to provide forage and cover, capture sediment, dissipate energy, and provide for groundwater
recharge.” Standard 2 is considered to be met if riparian/wetland habitat is rated in Proper Functioning
Condition (PFC) and existing management will lead to maintaining and/or improving resource conditions
(BLM 2002).
Standard 3, Upland Vegetation, states that “vegetation on each ecological site consists of plant
communities appropriate to the site which are resilient, diverse, and able to recover from natural and
human disturbance.” Standard 3 is considered to be met if plant communities are sustaining themselves
under existing conditions and management.
During the 2001 field season, project area watersheds within the Upper Colorado River Basin were
assessed (BLM 2002). Results of the 2001 assessment indicated that Standard 2 – Riparian/Wetland
Health, was being met by most allotments within the assessment area with the exception of 14 allotments,
two of which are located in the project area (Cherokee 00408 & Red Creek 10521).
Most of the lentic and lotic sites that are not meeting the standard have been, or are in the process of
being, addressed in management plans or as range improvement projects (BLM 2002). Assessment results
for Standard 3 – Upland Vegetation Health, indicated that natural and ecological processes were
functioning adequately for most vegetation communities. However, the review team had concerns about
the uniformity of age classes in many shrub stands which may lead to over-maturity/decadence on a large
scale if not properly managed. Shrub communities in this late-seral stage are particularly susceptible to
large-scale die-offs due to many environmental and biological factors including drought, insect
infestations, and disease.
3.6.4

Fugitive Dust Effects on Vegetation

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that the largest single source of fugitive dust in the
U.S. is from unpaved roads which contribute about 10 million tons of particulate matter (PM) air
pollution each year (EPA 1998). Dust from roads can contain very fine particles known as PM10
(particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter) and PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in
size). Ten microns equals about 1/7th the diameter of a human hair. Of greatest concern are the PM2.5
particles that make up part of a dust cloud. Although PM and other air-quality issues are described more

3-80

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

completely in Section 3.5 Air Quality, a brief discussion of the negative effects of fugitive dust on
roadside/rangeland vegetation is presented in this section.
Dust deposits on plants can have important effects on plant life. These effects may include (but are not
limited to):













Reduced photosynthesis due to reduced light penetration through the leaf surface. This may cause
stunting and/or reduced growth rates and plant vigor.
Increased incidence of plant pests and disease. Dust deposits can act as a medium for the growth of
fungal diseases.
Reduced efficacy of herbicide sprays due to reduced penetration of the herbicide through the leaf
surface.
Reduced productivity and changes in community structure (the species of plants present) (Farmer
1993).
Increased leaf temperatures and water loss, with decreasing carbon dioxide uptake (Eller 1977,
Hirano et al. 1995, Ricks and Williams 1974, Fluckinger et al. 1979, Thompson et al. 1984).
Decreased palatability and avoidance by wildlife and livestock.
Increased tooth wear for herbivores.
Greater biomass of annual plants within the dust-plume-affected area. Phenological differences (see
Glossary) among the vascular plants are possibly due to differences in soil temperature on and off
the dust-plume area early in the growing season (Spencer and Tinnin 1997).
Susceptibility of vegetation in proximity to roads to chronic diseases affiliated with photosynthesis
and growth, which may eventually lead to accelerated erosion problems from lack of adequate
roadside vegetation, reduction in quality and quantity of available browse for livestock and wildlife,
and creation of new sites for noxious weed infestations (Gebbhart and Hale 1996).
Potential contamination of native wildflowers and their blossoms, altering patterns of pollen
dispersal (and thus gene flow) among plants by altering the foraging behavior of pollinating insects.
This impact could be important in habitats in proximity to unpaved roads occupied by USFWS or
BLM special status plant species of concern.

GIS analysis of the road system within the project area indicates a total of about 5,736 miles of roads
within the project’s boundaries. This total includes: about 126 miles of paved roads (mainly I-80 and WY
789), about 2,055 miles of improved maintained exotic (e.g. graveled/rocked) roads, about 86 miles of
improved maintained natural (e.g., natural surface) roads, and about 3,469 miles of unimproved,
unmaintained natural (e.g., two-track) roads. These totals indicate that the total mileage of paved roads
within the project area represents only about 2.2 percent of the total road system. Section 3.16
Transportation and Access describes the local and regional transportation network associated with the
project area.
The primary factors that generate dust on unpaved roads include (Bolander 1999, Addo and Sanders
1993):





Vehicle speed
Number of wheels per vehicle
Number of vehicles
Vehicle weight





Particle size distribution (gradation) of the
surface material
Restraint of the surface fines (compaction,
cohesiveness/bonding)
Durability of the road surface

A 1993 U.S. Department of Transportation study cites a 1983 Forest Service estimate that for every
vehicle traveling one mile of unpaved roadway once a day, every day for a year, one ton of dust is
deposited along a corridor extending 500 feet on either side of the roadway (Addo and Sanders 1993). In
a study conducted in Australia, McCrea (1984) estimated the potential losses in crop productivity for

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-81

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VEGETATION

various rates of dust deposition. The main focus of the report was on horticultural crops grown alongside
unpaved roads, and in this case the losses occurred within about 656 feet of the source.
To estimate the acreage of the project area that could be affected by road-generated fugitive dust, a GISgenerated mileage total for all improved exotic and improved natural surface roads within the project area
was calculated and then buffered on each side of the road centerline by 578 feet to equal the average total
width from the above two mentioned studies (1,156 feet). The two-track road mileage was not included in
the calculations because of their minimal use. The results indicate that approximately 260,483 acres could
be affected by road-generated fugitive dust deposition, or about 24.3 percent of the project’s total landsurface area. This total, at any given time, would be dependent upon season of use, the primary factors
listed in this section, and weather-related factors, especially the timing and amount of precipitation events
(or lack thereof). A proactive and aggressive road-watering/dust-suppression program could noticeably
lower this estimate during the hotter and drier summer months that are generally associated with greater
dust-generation potential.
3.6.5

Biological Soil Crusts

Biological soil crusts (BSCs), also referred to as cryptogamic, microbiotic, cryptobiotic, and microphytic
crusts, are a complex assemblage of organisms including cyanobacteria, green algae, mosses, lichens,
microfungi, and other bacteria that colonize the first few millimeters of the soil surface. Soil crusts are
found in all hot, cool, and cold arid and semi-arid regions and may constitute up to 70 percent of the
living cover in some plant communities (Belnap 1994). The functions of BSCs in rangeland ecosystems
include retention of soil moisture by serving as a living mulch on the soil surface; reduction of wind and
water erosion; fixing atmospheric nitrogen; and contributing to soil organic matter (Eldridge and Greene
1994).
The primary environmental factors that influence the distribution of biological soil crusts include
elevation, precipitation volume, timing of precipitation, physical and chemical properties of the soil,
topography, and disturbance regimes (Belnap 2001). The historic and current distribution of BSCs in the
project area is largely unknown. However, field work conducted by HWA during May and June of 2007
found soil crusts at several locations within the project area, with moss crusts the most frequently
encountered. Moss crusts were found growing within cacti aggregations or underneath shrub canopies,
and less frequently in the open plant interspaces. Moss crusts were also observed in several plant
communities including those dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, saltbush,
and greasewood. Cyanobacterial crusts were observed in portions of the project area where the soils were
less stable (e.g., sandy areas) or the crusts were re-establishing after disturbance. Lichen crusts were
observed less frequently than moss or cyanobacterial crusts. The Creston grazing exclosure within the
project area was observed to have a well-established lichen crust, including: Aspicilia, Caloplaca,
Collema, Xanthoparmelia, and Psora. The most common moss was Tortula. Crustal development was
greatest underneath shrub canopies or on the edges of bunchgrasses and less so in the plant interspaces.
The assemblage of species present at this Wyoming big sagebrush site indicates a late-successional stage
of crust development. This provides evidence that mature and diverse soil crusts have the potential to
occur within the project area, given suitable environmental conditions.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES

3.7

INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES

Generally, the term “weed” can be used for any unwanted plant. Terms such as aliens, exotics, and
invasives are used interchangeably to describe specific weeds. All these descriptions have a common
concept: plants introduced into an area in which they did not evolve that have the potential to cause
noticeable economic and/or ecological impacts. When weeds become so widespread that they threaten
crops, livestock, or native species, they may become more than just a “weed.” They might then be termed
“noxious weed,” “invasive species,” “exotic species,” “alien species,” or some similar term as set forth in
law by each governing body or land-management agency.
Invasive plant species pose a threat to the long-term productivity, diversity, and aesthetic values of lands
within the RFO. Recent extended drought conditions in Wyoming, in conjunction with unprecedented
energy development and other construction activities in western Wyoming, have favored the
establishment and spread of invasive weed species.,This has occurred not only in disturbed habitats, but
also in native rangeland where the stress of drought has resulted in decreased vigor, annual production,
resilience, and competitive capabilities of native grassland and shrub communities, thus creating an ideal
environment for invasion and establishment of aggressive and invasive weedy species.
The principal invasive weeds known to occur in or near, or which have been treated within, the project
area include (BLM 2002) Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens), houndstongue (Cynoglossum
officinale), halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus), hoary cress (whitetop) (Cardaria draba and Cardaria
pubescens), perennial pepperweed (giant whitetop) (Lepidium latifolium), spotted knapweed (Centaurea
maculosa), common burdock (Arctium minus), and saltcedar (Tamarix spp.). The primary impact of these
invasive species to the range resource is their ability to out-compete native species; in addition to their
competitive nature, Russian knapweed, halogeton, and houndstongue are poisonous to wildlife and/or
livestock.
Many of these invasive species are associated with disturbed areas such as road/pipeline rights-of-way
and well pads. Other common invasive weed species observed in the project area include cheatgrass
(Bromus tectorum), Russian thistle (Salsosa kali), netseed lambsquarter (Chenopodium berlandieri), bull
thistle (Cirsium vulgare), black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), common mullein (Verbascum thapsus),
clasping pepperweed (Lepidium perfoliatum), kochia (Kochia scoparia), as well as several wild mustards.
Of the invasive plant species found in the project area, halogeton represents an ecological and economic
threat to the area due to its unparalleled rapid infestation and widespread establishment. Prior to the onset
of extended drought conditions in Wyoming beginning in 2000, halogeton was present at low densities in
southwest and south-central Wyoming but its presence was primarily restricted to range sites degraded
over time by heavy livestock concentrations such as near feed-grounds, corrals, and travel-ways or
disturbed sites such as the reclaimed Santa Fe Browning gravel pit near Wild Horse Butte (Bennett 2004).
Extensive invasive weed surveys conducted by HWA during the 2007 growing season indicated that
approximately 13,353 acres, or about 1.2 percent of the surface area of the project area, were infested
with halogeton. This is a conservative estimate based upon surveys at specific sites such as well pads and
road/pipeline rights-of-way (HWA 2008b).
Although not quantified, the actual surface area infested by halogeton could be greater based on field
observations that halogeton spreads laterally from infested road/pipeline rights-of-way into adjoining
native rangeland. Observations made during the 2007 growing season, especially along the major
north/south-oriented roads (e.g., Wamsutter Road) indicated that the lateral spread of halogeton was
usually minimal (+ 15–20 feet) on the windward (west) side of the road but could extend as far as 0.25
mile on the leeward side (east) of the road right-of-way. The direction of the prevailing winds during
October and November when the plants are in the seed-drop stage is probably the dominant variable that
controls dispersal direction. Halogeton seed is extremely light and fluffy and easily transported by even a
slight breeze. If the same criteria are used as with fugitive dust impacts (Section 4.7.3.1), it is evident that

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WILDLIFE

as many as 260,000 total acres of disturbed and native rangeland in the project area may be at risk of
infestation with halogeton.

3.8.1

WILDLIFE
Terrestrial Wildlife

Information concerning current and historical wildlife observations and distribution within and near the
CD-C project area were obtained from a variety of sources including BLM, USFWS, Wyoming Game
and Fish Department (WGFD), Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD), and information
compiled from personal communications and unpublished data from BLM, WGFD, and USFWS
biologists. The WGFD Wildlife Observation System (WOS) and WYNDD are the primary repositories
for wildlife information in the state of Wyoming and contain records of wildlife observations for birds,
mammals, herptiles (amphibians and reptiles), fish, and species of special concern. Wildlife information
for the project area was supplemented with survey data collected by Hayden-Wing Associates, LLC
(HWA) during 2006–2007 as part of the baseline and monitoring data requirements for the EIS.
At least 396 wildlife species occur in and around the project area including: 77 mammal, 273 bird, six
amphibian, 10 reptile, and 30 fish species (Appendix H). All wildlife species are important members of a
functioning ecosystem and wildlife community, but most are common and have wide distributions in the
region. Consequently, the relationships of most of these species to the proposed project are not discussed
in the same depth as species that are Threatened, Endangered, rare, of special concern, of special
economic interest, or otherwise of high interest or unique value.
3.8.1.1

Wildlife Habitat

A wide variety of wildlife habitats and associated species occur in the project area. Wildlife habitats that
would be affected by the project include the areas that would be physically disturbed by the construction
of gas wells, related roads, pipelines, and production facilities, as well as zones of influence surrounding
them. Zones of influence are defined as those areas surrounding or associated with project activities
where impacts to a given species or its habitat could occur. The shape and extent of such zones varies
with species and circumstances.
The project area is located in the Wyoming Basin Omernik Level III Ecoregion (18) and includes portions
of the Rolling Sagebrush Steppe (18a) and Salt Desert Shrub Basins (18e) Level IV Ecoregions
(Chapman et al. 2004). Topography in the project area is characterized by rolling plains interrupted by
hills and strike-dip ridges dissected by alluvial and outwash fans that empty into broad, level basins.
Ridges, hills, and rolling plains support vast areas of mixed-grass prairie and Wyoming, mountain, and
basin big sagebrush communities. Active and stabilized sand dunes, as well as disjunct playas and
alkaline flats, are interspersed throughout the project area where existing conditions are favorable for their
formation. Vegetation communities in the poorly drained, alkaline basins are dominated by arid-land
shrubs like greasewood, shadscale, and Gardner’s saltbush. Riparian and wetland habitats are scarce and
found only at a few locations in the project area. Freshwater wetlands in the northern portion of the
project area occur along Riner Road (BLM 3203) in the Chain Lakes area, and along Luman Road (i.e.,
SCR 20) north of Horseshoe Bend where a flowing well supplies year-round water to an enclosed water
impoundment surrounded by emergent vegetation. A few large water impoundments along Muddy Creek
create a series of connected semi-permanent wetlands in moist years in the southeastern portion of the
project area. Detailed descriptions of vegetation community types within the project area are discussed in
Section 3.6 Vegetation.

3.8.1.2

Big Game

Big game are included in the discussion due to their high interest and economic values. Three big game
species occur in the project area, including pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus), and elk (Cervus elaphus). Big game populations are managed by the WGFD within areas
designated as Herd Units. Hunt Areas are the geographic boundaries within which hunting licenses are
valid. Herd size and viability of big game populations are dependent on the combination, availability, and
quality of seasonal ranges, which overlap among species and fulfill different requirements for resident
and migratory big game populations. Table 3.8-1 shows Herd Unit population sizes and parameters
within the project area from WGFD Job Completion Reports. Herd population objectives are set by
WGFD each year based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the carrying capacity of the
habitat, weather (e.g. drought), habitat fragmentation, and competition with other ungulates.
Extreme drought occurred in the Green River Basin from 2000–2004, lessened in 2005, and then returned
again in 2006 and 2007. Higher-than-normal snowfall during the winter of 2007–2008 increased winter
mortality above normal. The winters of 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 were mild and drier than normal and
winter mortalities were few. The springs of 2009 and 2010 saw above-average precipitation and
seasonable temperatures resulting in above-average forage production.

Pronghorn are the most abundant big game within the project area. The project area includes portions of
five Hunt Areas (53, 55, 57, 60, and 61) and three Herd Units (Table 3.8-1; Map 3.8-1). All three Herd

Units are much larger than the portion within the project area, with 26 percent of the Red Desert Herd
Unit, 23 percent of the Bitter Creek Herd Unit, and 9 percent of the Baggs Herd Unit acreages contained
within the project area. Herd numbers can be affected by several factors including weather events
(drought and severe winters), the impacts of excess population numbers (over acceptable management
levels) upon habitat, hunting quotas, and disease. Meeting population objectives can depend upon the
availability of human resources, the accuracy of wildlife information collected, weather variables, disease,
and hunter harvest rates. Average hunter success in the pronghorn Hunt Areas in the CD-C project area is
92 percent, resulting in a prorated annual harvest of approximately 640 animals (WGFD 2009 data). Refer
to Section 3.12 Recreation for a more detailed discussion. Pronghorn seasonal ranges within the project
area include spring/summer/fall (3.3 percent), winter/yearlong (88.3 percent), and crucial winter/yearlong
(8.4 percent) (Table 3.8-2; Map 3.8-2). Although over a dozen pronghorn migratory movements have
been documented within the project area, the corridors are broad and poorly defined (Map 3.8-2).

Seasonal ranges include: Crucial Winter (CW) and Crucial Winter/Year-long (CW/Y) and describe ranges that have been
identified as a determining factor in a population’s ability to maintain itself at a specified level (theoretically at or above the
population objective) over the long term. Not all habitats within designated crucial winter range are of equal quality. Areas with
higher quantity and quality of forage and areas that provide cover from extreme winter weather conditions provide the bestquality crucial winter range habitat. Crucial ranges are typically used 8 out of 10 winters; Winter (W) are used by a substantial
number of animals during winter months (December through April; WGFD 2011b); Winter/Year-long (W/Y) ranges are occupied
throughout the year but during winter they are used by additional animals that migrate from other seasonal ranges; Year-long (Y)
ranges are occupied throughout the year but additional animals do not migrate to this type of seasonal range during winter;
Spring/Summer/Fall (S/S/F) ranges are used before and after winter conditions persist; Non-use areas (OUT) contain habitats of
limited or no importance to the species; Undetermined use areas (UND) are areas or habitats which are expected to or do
support a population or portion of a population of animals, but for which the distribution and importance of the area has not been
sufficiently documented to designate a seasonal range.

Only 16 percent of the CWR for the Red Desert, Bitter Creek, and Baggs Herd Units occurs within the
project area. In the springs of 2007, 2008 and 2010, a pronghorn CWR habitat assessment was conducted
to attempt to define current conditions and identify factors that may be limiting the pronghorn population
within the project area. CWR has long been established, and is accepted, as the most limiting factor for
overall pronghorn populations within the state of Wyoming. However, several other factors can affect
population trends including severe drought, winter severity, hunter harvest, or the impacts of excess
individuals (over acceptable management levels) on habitat. For this assessment, the focus was placed on
the identified CWRs within the project area which also serve as yearlong habitat for pronghorn.
Therefore, an assessment was performed to determine the relative condition of the CWRs as both winter
and yearlong range. In coordination with the WGFD, seven locations were identified to conduct the
condition-class studies. Standard 100-foot line-intercept transects were used to gather vegetation quality
and quantity data. The Extensive Browse method was used to gather utilization, age-class, and form-class
information, and density board measurements were used to gather vertical cover and vegetation height
estimates. The above data were then analyzed by two separate methods. The first method employed a
Habitat Suitability Index model developed in Wyoming specifically for analysis of pronghorn winter
ranges (Allen et al. 1984). The second is a BLM-accepted method for analysis of yearlong pronghorn
range (BLM 1980). The results from these utilization analyses establish a baseline for future year-to-year
comparisons and trends at these sample points (Table 3.8-3).

CWR score is the calculated WFCI (Winter food/cover index)Wyoming pronghorn winter range habitat suitability index, Allen et
al. (1984).
Fair, poor, and good are all relative ratings as defined by the BLM based on the numerical outcome of the condition assessment.

Generally, current conditions of pronghorn CWR are rated as “fair,” reflecting the moderate use of mature
stands of Wyoming and mountain big sagebrush. In addition, CWRs north of I-80 are experiencing
slightly less use than the CWRs along WY 789.
Mule Deer are common year-round residents within the project area. The project area supports resident
and migratory mule deer populations, and includes portions of five Hunt Areas (82, 84, 98, 100, and 131)
and three Herd Units (Table 3.8-1, Map 3.8-3). Average hunter success in the five mule deer Hunt Areas
in the CD-C project area is 45 percent, resulting in a prorated annual harvest of approximately 2,100
animals (WGFD 2009 data). Refer to Section 3.12 Recreation for a more detailed discussion. At least a
dozen mule deer migratory movements have been documented in the southern portion of the project area
(Map 3.8-4). In addition, a telemetry study has revealed migratory movements through the southeastern
portion of the project area (Sawyer 2007).
Assessments conducted in 2001 determined that mule deer CWR located along and near the far
southeastern edge of the project area was not meeting Standard #4 – Wildlife Habitat Health (BLM 2002;
Map 3.8-4). Juniper and sagebrush dominance, declining shrub communities, over-browsing of favored
shrub species, and low forb composition were some of the habitat concerns cited (BLM 2002). Although
this site may not be meeting the standard, broader areas within the landscape may be ecologically
functional. Changes in management may be necessary to address making progress toward meeting this
standard in the future.

Only 6.3 percent of CWR acreage for the Baggs Herd Unit occurs within the project area. Mule deer
CWR habitat assessments were conducted concurrent with pronghorn CWR habitat assessments
conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2010. As with pronghorn, mule deer CWR is the most limiting factor for
populations within the state of Wyoming. In coordination with the WGFD, two locations were identified
to conduct the condition-class studies. The Extensive Browse and density board methods were also
employed to collect data on mule deer CWR sites. The data were then analyzed according to BLMaccepted methods for analysis of mule deer winter range (BLM 1979). The results from these utilization
analyses establish a baseline for future year-to-year comparisons and trends at these sample points (Table
3.8-4).

Mule deer CWR score and rating calculated by BLM (2008).

Data are available for only two sites and may indicate that variable forage conditions likely exist across
the analysis area. Current forage conditions in mule deer CWR associated with the project area were
similar to those of pronghorn; however, heavier use was evident at mule deer sites. At least a dozen mule
deer migratory movements have been documented in the southern portion of the project area (Map 3.8-4).
In addition, a telemetry study has revealed migratory movements through the southeastern portion of the
project area (Sawyer 2007). As discussed above, animal movement along known migratory routes in the
southeastern portion of the project area are compromised by WY 789, energy development, and numerous
rangeland and highway fences (Feeney et al. 2004, WGFD 2010). Mule deer use of the underpasses
constructed under WY 789 has been well documented using remote cameras (WYDOT 2012). The range
condition data provided in Table 3.8-4 is indicative of the forage condition within migration routes.
Although current conditions of mule deer CWR associated with the project area were similar to those of
pronghorn, heavier use was evident at mule deer sites. Nevertheless, results indicated that mule deer
CWR sites have mature stands of big sagebrush with adequate canopy cover and overall production.
Elk are locally common in certain areas within the project area. The project area includes portions of five
Hunt Areas (21, 100, 108, 118, and 124) and four Herd Units (Table 3.8-1, Map 3.8-5). Average hunter
success in the five elk hunt areas in the CD-C project area is 47 percent, resulting in a prorated annual
harvest of approximately 1,440 animals (WGFD 2009 data). Refer to Section 3.12 Recreation for a more
detailed discussion. Elk seasonal ranges located within the project area include yearlong (6.1 percent),
winter (2.5 percent), non-use (51.4 percent), and undetermined use areas (40.0 percent; Table 3.8-2, Map
3.8-6). No elk CWR has been designated or elk migration routes documented within the project area (Map
3.8-6). Therefore no elk CWR site-sampling was conducted. Although no elk migration routes have been
mapped in the project area, they may be present. Elk do migrate from the Sierra Madre mountain range to
winter range along the Atlantic and Red Rims east of the project area (Map 3.8-6), and elk have been
documented using the Baggs/WY 789 underpasses (WYDOT 2012)
Big Game Summary

The project area is used by pronghorn, mule deer, and elk, although the areas and season of use vary by
species. CWR (i.e., crucial winter and crucial winter/yearlong ranges) of pronghorn and mule deer

3-92

collectively comprise approximately 92,842 acres (8.7 percent) of the project area (Map 3.8-7). The
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) states that habitat quality will be functionally maintained within areas of
overlapping big game CWR. Overlapping pronghorn and mule deer CWRs comprise 15,314 acres (1.4
percent) of the project area (Map 3.8-7).
The project area also hosts wild horses, which over time may result in direct (competitive displacement)
and indirect (resource-sharing) competition with pronghorn, mule deer, and elk (see Section 3.10 Wild
Horses). Wild horse populations may impact ungulate habitat over an extended period of time.

Upland Game Birds

Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus
phasianellus columbianus), and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) occur within the project area
(WGFD 2004a). Suitable habitat for chukar (Alectoris chukar), gray partridge (Perdix perdix), ringnecked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), blue grouse (Dendragapus obscurus), ruffed grouse (Bonasa
umbellus), and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) does not exist within the project area, although these
species are present in surrounding areas (WGFD 2004a). Upland game birds are managed by the WGFD
within upland game management areas. The project area includes parts of three Upland Game
Management Areas (UGMAs): Red Desert UGMA 9; Bitter Creek UGMA 10; and Sierra Madre UGMA
25. Greater sage-grouse is a Candidate species for listing under the ESA and Columbian sharp-tailed
grouse is designated as a sensitive species by the BLM. These species are discussed in Section 3.9
Special Status Species.
Mourning doves occupy a wide variety of habitats. Within the project area, mourning doves occur in
sagebrush-grassland, mountain shrub, and riparian vegetation communities. Mourning doves breed within
and migrate through the project area (WGFD 2004a). Based on recent records, mourning doves harvested
within the project area account for a very small percentage of the state total (WGFD 2005b).
3.8.1.4

Raptors

Twenty-six raptor species are known to occur in or around the project area, including 14 that breed or
potentially breed, two that over-winter, and ten that have been recorded as transients or migrants (Table
3.8-5). Five species are designated as sensitive by the BLM and are discussed in detail in Section 3.9
Special Status Species.
A variety of raptor breeding, hunting, and winter habitats occur within the project area. Grasslands,
shrublands, trees and shrubs in riparian areas, and cliffs, low bluffs, rocky outcrops, and badland breaks
all provide suitable nest substrates throughout the project area. Muddy Creek and drainages that support
trees and other riparian vegetation provide habitat for tree-nesting species and provide potential roosting
sites for wintering raptors. Agency and contract wildlife biologists have located at least 938 raptor nests
belonging to at least 11 species in or within one mile of the project area (BLM 2007a; Table 3.8-5; Map
3.8-8). The raptor species utilizing 79 of these nest sites are unknown.

Special-status species indicated by asterisk
Occurrence potential of raptor species includes: known breeding (B); known to be present during breeding season and
potentially breed (pB); known to over-winter (W); and known transient or migrant (t)

It is possible that some of the older documented raptor nests may have deteriorated beyond being suitable
for raptor nesting and the nest sites are no longer available or used by breeding raptors. Nevertheless, nest
sites with nests in suitable condition have the potential to be active in any given year. Moreover, each
year new nests are built. All raptors and their nests are protected from take or disturbance under the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC, §703 et seq.) and Wyoming [Revised] Statute (WRS 23-1-101 and
23-3-108). Golden and bald eagles also are afforded additional protection under the Bald and Golden
Eagle Protection Act, amended in 1973 (16 USC, §669 et seq.).

3.8.1.5

Neotropical Songbirds

Many species of neotropical songbirds utilize the project area for breeding, feeding, migration, and as
year-round habitats (Appendix H, Occurrence Potential of Wildlife in the CD-C Project Area). All
habitats throughout the project area are used to some degree by these species, but especially sagebrushgrassland, mountain shrub, and riparian vegetation communities. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16
USC, §703 et seq.) protects 836 migratory bird species (to date) and their eggs, feathers, and nests from
disturbances. Several migratory raptors and songbird species are also listed as BLM Sensitive Species
(Section 3.9.2).
3.8.2

Fish

Almost all of the CD-C project area drains into two basins: the Little Snake River Basin (a component of
the Colorado River system) and the Great Divide Basin. A very small proportion of the far western part of
the project area drains into Bitter Creek, also a component of the Colorado River system. The Little Snake
River Basin is fed by Muddy Creek, which drains the southeastern portion of the project area. The
majority of the northern part of the project lies within the Great Divide Basin. The Great Divide Basin is
closed, with no eventual outflow to an ocean (Map 3.4-1).
3.8.2.1

Fish Habitat

Due to limited precipitation, the majority of drainages within the project area are ephemeral. Ephemeral
water tables are always below the stream channel, only flowing in direct response to precipitation or
snow-melt. Ephemeral waters only support very limited aquatic communities for short periods when
surface flow is present, although some ephemeral streams in the project area may be used for spawning.
The largest stream within the project area is Muddy Creek, a high-elevation, cold desert stream that is
designated as class 2AB by the WDEQ, and supports game and non-game species. Muddy Creek exhibits
perennial flow for the majority of its length, and in some years flows intermittently as a result of irrigation
water removal south of the George Dew/Red Wash wetlands complex. In years with high runoff amounts,
Muddy Creek flows perennially throughout its length. Streamflow varies with location along the drainage.
About 286 reservoirs and ponds (<1–960 acres) are present within the project area (Section 3.4.2.1).
Some of the ponds and reservoirs that currently exist within the project area are fed by waters recovered
from wells drilled at upstream locations, while others are impoundments on small drainages. These manmade impoundments are generally designed to supply water for livestock and wildlife use. Only one of
these, Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir, is stocked annually with Colorado River cutthroat trout
(Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) by the WGFD. None of the others are known to sustain fisheries.
3.8.2.2

General Fish

About 30 species of fish may occur in the project area or in streams upstream or downstream of the
project area (Table 3.8-6), including ten game-fish species and 20 non-game fish species. This
information is based upon species potentially found in the Great Divide and Little Snake River Basins,
plus four Threatened and Endangered species present downstream in the Colorado River System. About
14 of the 30 species, including six native species, are likely to be present within the project area. Four of
the 30 species are Threatened or Endangered (Section 3.9.1.3) and four are BLM Sensitive Species
(Section 3.9.2.3).
No fish have been collected from any streams within the Great Divide Basin. Consequently, all of the fish
present within streams in the project area are found within the Muddy Creek watershed. Some
impoundments in the Great Divide Basin portion of the project have been stocked with fish in the past,
but none are known to sustain fisheries at the present.

SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Special-status species include: (1) Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, Candidate, or those petitioned for
listing as Threatened or Endangered by the USFWS under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as
amended; and (2) those designated by the BLM State Director as sensitive (BLM 2010).
3.9.1

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, or Candidate Species of Wildlife, Fish, and
Plants

Seven species listed by the USFWS as Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, or Candidate pursuant to the
ESA, that may be found in the RFO are or potentially are present within the project area (USFWS 2010,
Table 3.9-1). Four fish species are found downstream of the RFO in the Colorado River system and may
be impacted if water depletions occur, or if environmental contaminants are increased within the system.
The other four species—Canada lynx, yellow-billed cuckoo, Wyoming toad, and the blowout
penstemon—are located within the RFO; however, they are not located nor do they have habitat within or
near the CD-C project area.

Candidate species are those for which the USFWS has sufficient information to propose for listing as threatened or endangered
under the ESA, but for which development of a proposed listing regulation is precluded by other higher priority listing actions.
Proposed species are those Candidate species that were found to warrant listing as either threatened or endangered and are
currently undergoing a 12-month status review. Conservation measures for candidate and proposed species are voluntary but
recommended because, by definition, the species may warrant future protection under the ESA if adequate conservation
measures are not in place.

3.9.1.1

Threatened or Endangered Wildlife Species

Black-footed ferret. This species is considered the most endangered mammal in the United States. The
original distribution of the black-footed ferret in North America closely corresponded to that of the prairie
dog (Cynomys spp.; Hall and Kelson 1959, Fagerstone 1987). Black-footed ferrets depend almost
exclusively on prairie dogs for food and also use prairie-dog burrows for shelter, parturition, and raising
young (Hillman and Clark 1980, Fagerstone 1987). The species historically ranged throughout most of
the sagebrush and grasslands habitats in Wyoming. Today, the only known population of black-footed
ferrets in Wyoming is the result of the reintroduction of captive-bred ferrets in the Shirley Basin (
approximately 65 miles northeast of the project area). Reintroductions occurred in Wyoming on federal

3-102

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

and state lands from 1991 to 1995. The reintroduced population is classified as nonessential experimental,
and currently is self-sustaining.
The USFWS has designated some areas of Wyoming as not likely to have black-footed ferret habitat
present; these areas have been “Block Cleared” and do not require ferret surveys prior to activities being
permitted. “Non-Block Cleared areas” may contain suitable black-footed ferret habitat. Forty-five percent
of the project area is within portions of the Continental Divide, Desolation Flats, and Dad Non-Block
Clearance areas, which were not included under the black-footed ferret block clearance letter (Map 3.9-1;
USFWS 2004b). Prairie-dog colonies occurring within the Continental Divide, Desolation Flats, and Dad
non-block clearance areas meet requirements for consideration as black-footed ferret habitat (Biggins et
al. 1989), and black-footed ferret surveys may be necessary prior to ground-disturbing activities (Biggins
et al. 1989, USFWS 1989). Mapping and ground surveys indicate that the area and density of active
prairie-dog colonies within the project area may be sufficient to support black-footed ferrets. The RFO, in
coordination with the USFWS, has refined and mapped the white-tailed prairie dog complex areas that
would require pre-disturbance surveys (Map 3.9-1, BLM M. Read, pers. com. 2012).
Numerous historical records of black-footed ferrets have been documented within the project area
(WYNDD 2007, WGFD 2007). Within the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II project area, two young
black-footed ferrets were sighted in 1972 about five miles south of I-80; one adult was sighted in August
1975 in the northern portion; and a black-footed ferret skull was found in 1981 along the northeastern
border. Wild-born black-footed ferrets currently exist in the Shirley Basin; at least 88 ferrets were
observed during a partial survey conducted in 2004 (WGFD 2005b). Various barriers exist between the
Shirley Basin black-footed ferret population and the project area, including highways (i.e., U.S. 287, I­
80), mountain ranges (i.e., Freezeout, Shirley, and Seminoe), reservoirs (i.e., Pathfinder and Seminoe),
and the North Platte River.
Greater sage-grouse is a sagebrush obligate found entirely in the western United States and Canada,
primarily in the Intermountain West. Wyoming contains more sage-grouse than all other states combined.
The species remains common in Wyoming because its habitat is relatively intact compared to other states.
In south-central Wyoming, the harsh climate has limited habitat loss and conversion to settlements and
agriculture. Historically, disturbance to greater sage-grouse habitat in south-central Wyoming has
occurred as a result of livestock grazing, associated sagebrush-control treatments, and oil and gas
development. Landscape-scale disturbance to this habitat has resulted more recently from the increased
development of a variety of energy resources and the associated workforce. The greater sage-grouse is
considered a sagebrush ecosystem umbrella species, which assumes that conserving its habitat will benefit
other species of conservation concern that share the same habitats (i.e., pygmy rabbit, sage thrasher, and
sage sparrow; Rowland et al. 2006).
Sage-grouse depend on extensive areas of sagebrush for food and cover throughout the year. Typically,
strutting grounds or leks are located in open patches within sagebrush habitat and the surrounding area is
considered potential nesting habitat. Nesting habitat tends to have higher sagebrush density, taller live and
residual grasses, more live and residual grass cover, and little bare ground (Connelly et al. 2004). Sagegrouse are dependent upon sagebrush habitats for their year-round survival. This dependency includes
using sagebrush for forage, nesting habitat, brood-rearing habitat, and winter thermal cover. In addition,
sage-grouse require a variety of sagebrush habitat types to meet life-history requirements. Mesic habitats
are also important for brood-rearing during the summer and fall months. The proximity of nesting habitat
to brood-rearing habitat increases its value for broods, but may increase risk for nests (Dzialak et al.
2012).

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Sage-grouse exhibit site fidelity to leks, winter and summer areas, and nesting areas (Schroeder et al.
1999). They may be affected by sagebrush community disturbance and removal. Sage-grouse tend to
avoid areas that may provide perching or roosting opportunities for raptors (i.e., fence posts, power lines,
and other structures) (Connelly et al. 2000 and 2004). Human activity during the breeding season may
disrupt lek attendance and affect local breeding success. Populations across the west have declined from
historic levels due to a wide range of factors including drought, habitat loss, and habitat degradation
(Connelly and Braun 1997, Braun 1998, Connelly et al,. 2000 and 2004).
In 2004, the USFWS conducted a status review of greater sage-grouse throughout their range in response
to petitions requesting the listing of the species under the ESA. On January 7, 2005, the USFWS
determined that the greater sage-grouse did not warrant protection under the ESA. Nevertheless, on
December 4, 2007, U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill reversed the USFWS decision and
remanded the case to the agency for further consideration. After another status review, the USFWS
concluded in 2010 that the greater sage-grouse warranted protection under the ESA; however, ESA
protection was precluded due to other species facing more immediate extinction threats (a warranted but
precluded decision). As a result, the greater sage-grouse was added to the list of Candidate species under
the ESA, which provides a status review every 12 months to determine if immediate attention is
warranted.
Although greater sage-grouse is currently a Candidate species, it receives no statutory protection under
the ESA. However, certain conservation measures and stipulations are enforced by the BLM in
accordance with BLM Sensitive Species management and by state agencies under the Statewide
Executive Directive #2011-5 (SWED 2011, WGFD 2011c), Greater Sage-grouse Core Area Protection
(SGEO) program. The SGEO enhanced habitat protection in sage-grouse core population areas on public
as well as on private lands, when the activities on private land are subject to review or approval by state
or federal statutes. In December 2011, BLM issued Instruction Memorandum (IM) 2012-043 (BLM
2012b) which provides rangewide interim management policies and procedures for conserving sagegrouse and their habitats. This IM reaffirms the application of the Wyoming Core Population Area
Protection process, as follows:
“The BLM field offices do not need to apply the conservation policies and procedures described in
this IM in areas in which (1) a state and/or local regulatory mechanism has been developed for the
conservation of the Greater Sage-Grouse in coordination and concurrence with the USFWS
(including the Statewide Executive Directive 2011-5, Greater Sage-Grouse Core Area Protection);
and (2) the state sage-grouse plan has subsequently been adopted by the BLM through the issuance
of a state-level BLM IM.”
On February 10, 2012, the BLM released IM WY-2012-019, Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Management
Policy on Wyoming BLM Administered Public Lands Including the Federal Mineral Estate. This
document provides guidance to BLM Wyoming field offices regarding management consideration of
greater sage-grouse habitats for proposed activities until resource management planning updates are
completed (BLM 2012c). The IM is consistent with IM WY-2012-043 (BLM 2012b) and is generally
consistent with the SGEO (SWED 2011, WGFD 2011c). The conservation strategy for greater sagegrouse in the State of Wyoming continues to evolve. The Wyoming BLM is currently amending the Field
Office RMPs regarding sage-grouse management and the requirements that would be applied to activities
in sage-grouse habitat will change in accordance with those RMP amendments.
As required by IM WY-2012-019, an 11-mile analysis buffer is required around the project boundary for
large-scale proposed actions (e.g. oil and gas full-field developments). According to the WGFD database,
192 known leks are located within 11 miles of the CD-C project area; 105 are occupied, 13 are
unoccupied, and 74 have undetermined status (Map 3.9-2, WGFD 2010c). Leks are assigned an annual
status of active, inactive, or unknown, and based on this leks are assigned a management status of
occupied, unoccupied (destroyed or abandoned), or undetermined. Within 11 miles of the CD-C project

area, there are approximately 546,600 acres of state-designated core population areas on BLM-managed
land and 244,890 acres on state or private lands.
Prohibition of surface occupancy will be considered and evaluated by the BLM (2012c) and SGEO
(SWED 2011) within 0.25 miles of non-core area leks and 0.6 miles of core area leks, measured from the
perimeter of occupied or undetermined leks. Quarter-mile buffers around the perimeter of occupied or
undetermined status leks located in non-core areas within the project area comprise approximately 3,072
acres (0.29 percent of the project area), which includes 1,215 acres of BLM, 0.17 acres of state, and 1,858
acres of private lands. The 0.6-mile buffers around the perimeter of occupied or undetermined status leks
located in core areas within the project area compromise approximately 4,185 acres (0.3 percent of the
project area), which includes 2,167 acres of BLM, zero acres of state, and 2,018 acres of private lands.
BLM WY IM 2012-019 provides the following management actions for greater sage-grouse (BLM
2012c) and allows for local variation in the timing stipulation applicability dates.

The Rawlins RMP timing stipulation dates are reflected below:






In core population areas, surface-disturbing and disruptive activities will be prohibited in all nesting
and early brood-rearing habitat, regardless of the distance from the nearest lek (Map 3.9-2) from
March 1 to July 15 (BLM 2012, BLM 2008a).
In non-core areas, surface-disturbing and disruptive activities will be prohibited within all identified
nesting and brood-rearing habitat (Map 3.9-2) from March 1 to July 15 (BLM 2012, BLM 2008a).
Surface-disturbing and/or disruptive activities are prohibited or restricted from November 15 –
March 14 in mapped or modeled winter habitats/concentration areas (BLM 2012, BLM 2008a).
Additional greater sage-grouse conservation measures that may be applied by the BLM can be
found in the IM WY-2012-019 (BLM 2012c) and the Rawlins RMP.

BLM and other partners are working to develop statewide seasonal habitat models to identify important
sage-grouse seasonal habitats. Until such time as those models are complete, and in the event there is a
question that suitable nesting and early brood-rearing habitats exist in a particular area, the IM WY-2012­
019 states that seasonal habitats will be determined using appropriate methods found in the Habitat
Assessment Framework, or HAF. The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a, p. 2-55) states that surface-disturbing
and/or disruptive activities are to be avoided in all identified nesting and early brood-rearing habitat (Map
3.9-2) from March 1 to July 15. The RFO also applies this level of protection to nesting and early broodrearing habitat in non-core areas (M. Read, pers. com., February 2012). Currently, RFO wildlife
biologists have defined “identified nesting and brood-rearing habitat” as any mesic shrub-dominated
vegetative community (R. M. Etzelmiller, pers. com., May 2011). Map 3.9.3 provides an overview of
areas where seasonal nesting and early brood-rearing restrictions would be applied unless site-specific
field work indicates that nesting and early brood-rearing habitat is not actually present at a particular
location.
Surface-disturbing and disruptive activities are defined in the Wyoming BLM Guidance for Use of
Standardized Surface Use Definitions (WY Information Bulletin 2007-029). For sage-grouse, disruptive
activity typically includes people and/or the activity in nesting habitats for a duration of one hour or more
during a 24-hour period during the nesting season (BLM IM WO-2010-071 2010).
Greater sage-grouse populations are hunted in some areas of Wyoming, including the project area; the
harvest from the South Central Conservation Area, which contains the project area (Upland Game
Management Areas 9, 10, 24, 25, and 45), comprised 10.2 percent of the statewide yield in 2010 (Table
3.9-2; WGFD 2011). Since 1995, sage-grouse harvest numbers have been reduced by earlier opening
dates, shorter hunting season length, and lower bag limits.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

A sage-grouse population trend analysis (Figure 3.9-1) was conducted to compare sage-grouse
populations associated with the CD-C project area to other related sage-grouse populations in
southwestern Wyoming and the state as a whole. Specifically, the populations compared include (1) CD­
C plus 11-mile analysis area, (2) the Core Population Areas affected by the CD-C project (Greater South
Pass), (3) the statewide population, and (4) the “count” leks in the CD-C project area. The WGFD sagegrouse database (WGFD 2010) was used for this analysis. A count lek is a lek, designated by WGFD, on
which the count lek protocol is performed annually. The count lek protocol is a survey method that is
designed to give greater assurance that the actual peak male attendance is observed for that lek. There are
five count leks related to CD-C; three are located in the east-central project area, one is in the northeast
corner of the project area, and one is in the southeast corner. Average peak male attendance is used as an
index of overall population size because the information is the most readily available and comprehensive.
It has been suggested that a ratio of two hens per male in attendance could be used to determine the
overall population size of grouse in an area. However, there have been a number of studies that call this
ratio into question. Since it is not currently known what conversion factor should be used in the project
area to achieve an accurate total population size, no attempt was made to do so here.
The year 1990 was chosen as a beginning point of the comparison analysis to demonstrate the cyclical
nature of the species. Also during this period, throughout the state, sage-grouse survey and count
protocols were improved and more consistently applied. As demonstrated in Figure 3.9-1, the population
trend in all study groups is similar regardless of the size of the population involved. This comparison of
four different groups of sage-grouse leks removes the question of local weather conditions affecting the
population or the level of survey effort or of any one sub-set of leks affecting or controlling the overall
trend.

As can be seen in Figure 3.9-1, all populations analyzed experienced similar increases and decreases in
numbers of individuals observed. It is generally agreed (Connelly 2004) that sage-grouse populations are
cyclical; Figure 3.9-1 indicates an apparent seven-year cycle.

3.9.1.2

Threatened or Endangered Fish Species

Four federally Endangered fish species may occur as downstream residents of the Colorado River System:
Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius), bonytail (Gila elegans), humpback chub (Gila cypha), and
razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) (USFWS 2004a). The Colorado pikeminnow, bonytail, and
humpback chub are all members of the minnow family. The razorback sucker is a member of the sucker
family. All four of these fish species share similar habitat requirements and historically occupied the same
river systems. Declines in populations of these species are mainly attributed to impacts of water
development (e.g. dams and reservoirs) on natural temperature and flow regimes, creation of migration
barriers, habitat fragmentation, the introduction of competitive and predatory non-native fishes, and the
loss of inundated bottom lands and backwater areas (Minckley and Deacon 1991, USFWS 1993).
The last sighting of any of these fish species in the Little Snake River was of a single Colorado
pikeminnow in 1990. No critical habitat for these species has been designated in Wyoming (Upper
Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program 1999). However, the potential for project-related
reductions in water quantity and/or quality to these tributaries to the Colorado River warrant their
inclusion in this document.
Bonytail. Habitat of the bonytail is primarily limited to narrow, deep, canyon-bound rivers with swift
currents and whitewater areas (Valdez and Clemmer 1982, Archer et al. 1985, Upper Colorado River
Endangered Fish Recovery Program 1999). With no known reproducing populations in the wild today,
the bonytail is thought to be the rarest of the Endangered fishes in the Colorado River System.
The bonytail historically inhabited portions of the upper and lower Colorado River basins. Today in the
upper Colorado River Basin, only small, disjunct populations of bonytail are thought to exist in the
Yampa River in Dinosaur National Monument, in the Green River at Desolation and Gray canyons, in the
Colorado River at the Colorado/Utah border, and in Cataract Canyon (Upper Colorado River Endangered
Fish Recovery Program 1999).
Colorado pikeminnow. The Colorado pikeminnow is the largest member of the minnow family and
occurs in swift, warm waters of the Colorado River basins. The species was once abundant in the
mainstem of the Colorado River and most of its major tributaries throughout Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, and Mexico. It was known to occur historically in the Green
River of Wyoming at least as far north as the City of Green River. In 1990, one adult was collected from
the Little Snake River in Carbon County, Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1995). Subsequent survey attempts
to collect Colorado pikeminnow from this area of the Little Snake River by WGFD personnel failed to
yield any other specimens.
Humpback chub. Habitat of the humpback chub is also limited to narrow, deep, canyon-bound rivers
with swift currents and whitewater areas (Valdez and Clemmer 1982, Archer et al. 1985, Upper Colorado
River Endangered Fish Recovery Program 1999).
The humpback chub was historically found throughout the Colorado River System and its tributaries,
which are used for spawning (Valdez et al. 2000). It is estimated that the humpback chub currently
occupies 68 percent of its original distribution in five independent populations that are thought to be
stable (Valdez et al. 2000).
Razorback sucker. The razorback sucker is an omnivorous bottom-feeder and is one of the largest fishes
in the sucker family. Adult razorback sucker habitat use varies depending on season and location. This
species was once widespread throughout most of the Colorado River Basin from Wyoming to Mexico.
Today in the Colorado River Basin, populations of razorback suckers are only found in the upper Green
River in Utah, the lower Yampa River in Colorado, and occasionally in the Colorado River near Grand
Junction (Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program 1999).

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, Candidate, or Experimental Plant Species

The USFWS (2002) has determined that one threatened plant species, Ute ladies’-tresses, may
potentially be present within the project area (Table 3.9-1). This species is not known to occur within the
project area, but it may potentially be affected by the proposed project. The known locations of this
species in Wyoming include Converse, Goshen, Laramie, and Niobrara Counties. This species is not
known to occur within the project area and the likelihood of it occurring there is low for the following
reasons: (1) much of the project area is very arid and there are few perennial streams; (2) the elevation of
the project area is near the upper limit for the species; (3) very few moist riparian area meadows are
present; (4) where present, the transition from stream margins to upland vegetation is abrupt; and (5) in
Wyoming, the species has only been located in the eastern and southeastern portions of the state (Fertig
2000).
3.9.2

BLM Sensitive Species

The BLM has developed a Sensitive Species List for public lands in Wyoming (Table 3.9-3). The list
includes species that are not listed as Endangered or Threatened by the USFWS but may be rare or
declining in the state.. The objective of the Sensitive Species designation is to ensure that the overall
welfare of these species is considered when undertaking actions on public lands, and that these actions do
not contribute to the need to list the species under the provisions of the ESA. It is the intent of this policy
to emphasize the inventory, planning consideration, management implementation, monitoring, and
information exchange for the sensitive species on the list. The BLM Sensitive Species List is meant to be
dynamic and is reviewed annually with recommendations from BLM and appropriate non-BLM
authorities for additions and deletions (BLM 2010). Twenty-eight species on the BLM Sensitive Species
List that occur in the RFO may occur in or near the CD-C project area.

3.9.2.1

Sensitive Wildlife Species

Twenty terrestrial species and four fish species designated by the BLM as Sensitive that occur in the RFO
may occur in or near the CD-C project area and thus potentially could be affected by the Proposed Action
(Table 3.9-3; BLM 2010, WGFD 2007, WYNDD 2007). The black-tailed prairie dog, Baird’s sparrow,
Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, northern goshawk, trumpeter swan, white-faced ibis, hornyhead chub, and
boreal toad are located within the RFO; however, they are not located nor do they have habitat within or
near the CD-C project area.
Mammals

Fringed myotis. This bat species occupies a variety of coniferous forests, woodland chaparral, and basinprairie shrubland habitats throughout western North America from British Columbia to southern Mexico.
In Wyoming, its residency status is currently unknown (WGFD 2004a). This species could potentially
utilize the project area for feeding; roosting sites may occur in the project area as suitable habitat (i.e.,
caves and mines) is present.
Long-eared myotis may hibernate in Wyoming, but the species is considered uncommon and its
residency status currently is unknown (WGFD 2004a). Long-eared myotis has been documented
approximately 15 miles west of the project area (WYNDD 2007). Suitable habitat for the species occurs
in the project area.
Pygmy rabbit. A sagebrush obligate, the pygmy rabbit requires tall sagebrush and deep, soft soil for
burrowing. Therefore, it is not distributed uniformly across the sagebrush shrub-steppe ecosystem. The
species occurs in eight western states (California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington
and Wyoming), and has been documented throughout western Wyoming including Carbon and
Sweetwater counties. It should be noted that the Columbia Basin Distinct Population Segment in

3-112

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Washington State is managed differently and is currently listed as Endangered under the ESA. In
September 2010, the USFWS released its 12-month finding on a petition to list the pygmy rabbit as
Endangered or Threatened range-wide under the ESA and found that listing was not warranted. Although
listing was not warranted, the USFWS acknowledged several threats to pygmy rabbit habitat including
sagebrush conversion for agricultural purposes, livestock grazing, and energy development. Suitable
pygmy rabbit habitat is patchily distributed but abundant in the Continental Divide Basin and surrounding
areas. Pygmy rabbits have been documented throughout the project area (WYNDD 2007, HWA
unpublished data).
Spotted bat. Although it occurs sporadically as a summer resident across the western United States, the
spotted bat has not been documented in the project area (WGFD 2007, WYNDD 2007). Spotted bat is
associated with juniper shrublands and desert-sagebrush grasslands in Wyoming (WGFD 2004a). The
species may occur in the project area. Roosting habitat such as cliffs is present although perennial water is
lacking.
Swift fox. The swift fox inhabits short-grass and mixed-grass prairies over most of the Great Plains,
including eastern Wyoming (Clark and Stromberg 1987). Studies have documented swift fox in Carbon
and Sweetwater Counties within the project area and the species potentially may occur (Woolley et al.
1995). However, no swift fox have been documented in Sweetwater County in recent years (WGFD 2007,
WYNDD 2007).
Townsend’s big-eared bat can be found throughout Wyoming and its distribution is likely determined
by the availability of roosts such as caves, mines, tunnels, and crevices with suitable temperatures (Clark
and Stromberg 1987). Although its residency status is currently unknown, it may hibernate in Wyoming
in caves (WGFD 2004a). This species has not been observed within or near the project area (WGFD
2007, WYNDD 2007). It may be present in the project area as forage and roosting habitat (caves, mines,
rock outcrops, and buildings) are present.
White-tailed prairie dog. This species occupies grassland, sagebrush, and arid shrubland habitats in
central and western Wyoming (Clark and Stromberg 1987) and is found in scattered colonies throughout
the project area. Approximately 8,818 acres of white-tailed prairie-dog colonies have been mapped within
the project area to date (Map 3.9-3a and 3.9-3b; BLM RFO unpublished data; HWA unpublished data).
Wyoming pocket gopher. Endemic to southeastern Sweetwater County and southwestern Carbon
County, the Wyoming pocket gopher has been documented within the project area (WYNND 2007, HWA
2008 and 2009). Another population has been recorded in Carbon County approximately 20 miles east of
the project area near Bridger’s Pass, and the species may occur elsewhere (Clark and Stromberg 1987). In
August 2007, the Wyoming pocket gopher was petitioned for listing under the ESA. The rationale for
petitioning the species included a lack of knowledge regarding its taxonomy, abundance, population
trends, distribution, habitat requirements, and the potential effects from energy development within their
range. In April 2010, the USFWS determined the Wyoming pocket gopher did not warrant protection as a
threatened or endangered species under the ESA.
As part of the survey efforts for the 12-month status review, HWA biologists collaborated with the BLM­
RFO and WYNDD to conduct an extensive trapping effort during 2008 and 2009. The objective of the
study was to capture Wyoming pocket gophers to genetically verify its status as a separate species, and to
collect additional information on its distribution within the project area and across its predicted range in
general. In 2008, 10 Wyoming pocket gophers and 20 northern pocket gophers were trapped in 351 trapnights within the project area. Capture locations were concentrated within 15 miles southwest of
Wamsutter on the plateaus above Wamsutter and Delaney Rims (HWA 2008c ). In 2009, ten Wyoming
pocket gophers and 12 northern pocket gophers were trapped in 550 trap nights within the project area.
Capture locations were distributed throughout the project area, including eight captures approximately 20
miles southwest of Creston Junction (I-80 and WY 789) and two captures 10 miles north of Creston
Junction (HWA 2009). Wyoming and northern pocket gophers appear to be sympatric (have overlapping
ranges) within the project area.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Birds
Bald eagle. This large North American eagle is normally found near water. It is found throughout North
America, but primarily breeds in Canada, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains, and the
Great Lakes region. Bald eagles have been observed in the project area primarily from November through
March (WGFD 2004a, HWA unpublished data). The species may forage within the project area during
the winter months because of carrion associated with pronghorn, mule deer, and elk winter ranges (Maps
3.8-2, 3.8-4, and 3.8-6). No bald eagle nests or nesting habitat (mature, large diameter trees near open
water) occur within the project area. The nearest potential nesting habitat occurs along the Little Snake
River approximately nine miles south of the project area.
Brewer’s sparrow. A sagebrush obligate, Brewer’s sparrow breeds throughout the intermountain west of
the United States and winters in southern portions of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and western
Texas, and south through the central part of Mexico (Rotenberry et al. 1999, Sibley 2000). Brewer’s
sparrows will breed in a variety of shrubland habitats, but prefer areas dominated by big sagebrush
(Artemisia tridentata; Rotenberry et al. 1999). It prefers to nest in shrubs that are taller and denser than
average (Petersen and Best 1985). This species may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation, and
appears to be affected more by changes at the landscape level than at the local level (Knick and
Rotenberry 1995). Brewer’s sparrow is expected to breed and has been observed within the project area
(WGFD 2004a, WYNDD 2007, HWA unpublished data).
Burrowing owl. The burrowing owl is found throughout the plains and prairies of the western United
States during the spring, summer, and fall (Haug et al. 1993). While the species has the capacity to
excavate its own burrow, it seldom does, relying instead on mammals such as prairie dogs, ground
squirrels, and badgers (Thomsen 1971). The burrowing owl’s close association with burrowing mammals
suggests dependence on them (Haug et al. 1993). Knowles (1999) suggested that the burrowing owl is a
near prairie-dog obligate species because its distribution is so closely tied to that of prairie dogs.
Burrowing owls also use isolated ground-squirrel and badger burrows in hillsides, and road borrow
ditches.
Burrowing owl is listed as a species of special concern across Wyoming, as a consequence of long-term
population declines (Haug et al. 1993). Because of the strong association between burrowing owls and
prairie dogs, declines in the burrowing-owl population have been linked to many of the same factors
associated with declining prairie-dog populations (i.e., rodent-eradication programs and habitat loss).
Furthermore, long-term conservation of the burrowing owl will likely be closely linked to the
conservation and preservation of prairie-dog complexes, and other burrowing mammals. Burrowing owl
occurs and breeds within the project area (BLM 2007a, WGFD 2004a, WYNDD 2007, HWA
unpublished data).
Ferruginous hawk. Primarily found in mixed-grass prairie and sagebrush steppe habitats during the
spring, summer, and fall, the ferruginous hawk generally builds nests on rock outcrops, the ground, or
cliff ledges. Although a small population overwinters in Wyoming, most individuals migrate south for the
winter. Ferruginous hawks are common in south-central Wyoming and breed within the project area
(BLM 2007a, WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007). The western two-thirds of Carbon County hosts one of the
highest nesting densities of ferruginous hawks within Wyoming (BLM 2007a). BLM records document
the occurrence of 577 ferruginous hawk nest sites (Table 3.8-5; BLM unpublished data) in or within one
mile of the project area.
Loggerhead shrike. This species breeds and winters throughout the United States in a wide variety of
open habitats with some shrub or scattered-tree component. A summer resident, it usually builds its nest
within large shrubs such as sagebrush, bitterbrush, or greasewood (Woods and Cade 1996). Loggerhead
shrike populations have experienced declines across much of the species’ range primarily due to loss of
habitat. Livestock grazing in combination with drought is a major factor in the decline. In addition, the
loggerhead shrike is prone to the negative effects of pesticide use because its diet consists largely of

3-116

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

insects. The species is expected to breed and has been observed within the project area (WGFD 2006,
WYNDD 2007, HWA unpublished data).
Long-billed curlew. A locally common summer resident of Wyoming (WGFD 2004a), the long-billed
curlew prefers gentle, rolling topography in native grasslands, sagebrush, and agricultural lands that can
be arid as long as a water source is relatively nearby. One observation of a long-billed curlew has been
documented in the extreme south of the project area (WGFD 2006). It is unlikely the species breeds in the
project area because suitable breeding habitat and water are limited.
Mountain plover. The mountain plover is dependent on short-grass prairie and also is frequently
associated with prairie-dog towns (Knowles et al. 1982). The species nests on the ground in large
grassland areas with short, sparse vegetation and substantial amounts of bare ground. In May 2011 the
USFWS determined that the mountain plover is not threatened or endangered throughout all or a
significant portion of its range. Numerous observations of mountain plovers have been recorded within
the project area (WGFD 2007, BLM unpublished data, HWA unpublished data). Approximately 342,393
acres of occupied or potential mountain plover habitat have been mapped, comprising approximately 32
percent of the project area (Map 3.9-4; HWA unpublished data).
Peregrine falcon. The peregrine falcon breeds throughout North America, including the Arctic, the
Pacific coast, the Rocky Mountains, and scattered areas across the eastern United States. Although
populations of avian prey species in and around the project area may be abundant and diverse enough to
support the species, breeding is unlikely due to the lack of high cliffs suitable for nesting. Nevertheless,
peregrine falcons may be present within the project area during migration.
Sage sparrow. A sagebrush obligate found throughout much of the western United States, the sage
sparrow breeds in sagebrush expanses from the northern edges of the Great Basin west of the Rocky
Mountains to the chaparral and sagebrush scrub in Baja California (Martin and Carlson 1998). Suitable
sagebrush habitat is widespread and abundant within the project area. The sage sparrow is expected to
breed and has been observed within the project area (WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007, HWA unpublished
data).
Sage thrasher. A sagebrush obligate found throughout the intermountain west, the sage thrasher builds
nests in shrub-steppe communities dominated by sagebrush. Suitable sagebrush habitat is widespread and
abundant within the project area. The sage thrasher is expected to breed and has been documented within
the project area (WGFD 2007, WYNDD 2007, HWA unpublished data).

Amphibians

Great Basin spadefoot. An occupant of sagebrush and greasewood communities as well as playas below
6,000 feet, the Great Basin spadefoot deposits eggs in springs or flooded areas formed by heavy rains
(WGFD 2004a). Its life history requires suitable foraging areas, ephemeral breeding ponds, and
overwintering sites. In the winter this species digs its own burrow and will overwinter underground,
sometimes as deep as 15 feet. The Great Basin spadefoot has been documented in Sweetwater, Lincoln,
Fremont, and Natrona Counties, and has been documented within the project area (Baxter and Stone
1992, WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007). Playas and riparian areas within the project area likely support this
species.
Northern leopard frog. This frog species is usually found close to wetlands, cattail marshes, and along
vegetated shorelines during summer, but will venture several hundred meters along wet drainages during
wet periods (Werner et al. 2004). A member of the true frog family (Ranidae), the northern leopard frog
is an obligate of permanent water in the plains, foothills, and montane zones of Wyoming up to 9,000 feet
above sea level (WGFD 2004a). This species has been documented within six miles of the project area
and has a high probability of occurring in any area having perennial water (WYNDD 2007). The northern
leopard frog was petitioned for listing under the ESA; in October 2011 the USFWS determined at listing
was not warranted.
3.9.2.2

Sensitive Fish Species

Fish species that are not listed as Endangered or Threatened by the USFWS, but that may be rare or
declining in the state, have been included on the BLM’s Wyoming Sensitive Species List (BLM 2002).
The intent of the sensitive species status is to ensure that actions on BLM-administered lands consider the
welfare of these species and do not contribute to the need to list any other species under the provisions of
the Endangered Species Act (BLM 2001).
Four BLM Wyoming State sensitive fish species are known to occur in portions of streams on or adjacent
to the project area. These include the roundtail chub (Gila robusta), bluehead sucker (Catostomus
discobolus), flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), and Colorado River cutthroat trout
(Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus) (WYNDD 2003, BLM 2002). The three non-game fish species
(roundtail chub, bluehead sucker, flannelmouth sucker) have been found within Muddy Creek
downstream, within, and upstream of the project area, and in Bitter Creek downstream of the project area
(WGFD 1998, 2004c, 2007a). In general, all three species are associated with hard substrates and deep
pool habitat (Bower 2005).
The Muddy Creek watershed is one of the few stream systems in Wyoming where these three native, nongame fish species exist together (WGFD 2004b) and the only watershed where these species and
Colorado River cutthroat trout are known to coexist. It has also been designated as Aquatic Crucial
Habitat by the WGFD because the area addresses Goal 1 of the WGFD Strategic Habitat Plan (WGFD
2009). Because of the high conservation value of Muddy Creek for these species, multiple studies have
been conducted to increase understanding of their ecology in the creek. The BLM is a signatory to the
range-wide (Wyoming and other states) conservation agreement and strategy for roundtail chub, bluehead
sucker, and flannelmouth sucker where these three non-game species are present. The BLM, WGFD, and
University of Wyoming completed a study to better characterize the abundance, distribution, behavior,
habitat requirements and genetics of the three non-game sensitive species within the Muddy Creek
watershed, which included part of the project area (Beatty 2005). The following is a summary of those
study results for 2004.
Man-made structures have resulted in three fragmented stream segments in the lower Muddy Creek
watershed (Beatty 2005, Map 3.9-5). The farthest downstream segment (segment 1) begins at the
confluence of Muddy Creek with the Little Snake River and extends upstream to a wetland complex with
water-control structures that inhibit fish movement. The farthest downstream segment experiences periods

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

of no surface flow with isolated pools and was dominated by non-native fishes in 2004. The middle
segment (segment 2) consists of a wetland complex with numerous water-control structures and was
dominated by non-native species, particularly the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The upstream
segment (segment 3) extended from upstream of the wetland complex to a headcut stabilization structure
that prevents upstream movement by fish. The upstream segment was dominated by two native species:
roundtail chub (Gila robusta) and speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus). Constructed wetlands and barriers
to upstream movements by fishes appear to influence native fishes and the structure of fish communities
in lower Muddy Creek, similar to the effects of fragmentation and intermittent stream flows in other areas
of the Colorado River Basin.
Compton (2007) completed a study on the effects of barriers on these three sensitive species in Muddy
Creek upstream of the wetland complex. Instream structures prevented or severely limited upstream
movements, but downstream movements over structures occurred. Within each segment in this study
area, roundtail chubs were most abundant and flannelmouth suckers were least abundant among the
three native species. A core population of the three native species existed in one segment and
supported the highest densities of juveniles and adults and the broadest length ranges. Non-native
white suckers, Catostomus commersoni, were the most abundant species in the study area. Their
highest densities occurred in altered habitat. Substantial hybridization with the two native catostomid
species was evident. Compton (2007) concluded that native fish populations in the most upstream
segment may be at risk of extirpation due to low abundance and reproduction. Connectivity among
habitats is required to carry out the life-cycles of native fishes and fragmentation by man-made
structures is affecting their abundance and distribution patterns.

WGFD (2007a) sampled these three species in the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds in 2006
as part of a study of these species within the Green River watershed in Wyoming. Of the three
species, only roundtail chubs were found in lower Muddy Creek. However, flannelmouth suckerwhite sucker hybrids were found there. In upper Muddy Creek within the CD-C project area, all three
species were found as well as flannelmouth sucker-white sucker hybrids and blue sucker-white
sucker hybrids. Flannelmouth suckers also were found in the headwaters of Bitter Creek. WGFD
(2007a) concluded that perhaps the biggest threat to native bluehead and flannelmouth suckers in the
Green River drainage of Wyoming is the occurrence of and subsequent hybridization with nonnative
white sucker.
The Colorado River cutthroat trout, which is a native game fish, has been re-introduced into Muddy Creek
upstream of the project area and into Littlefield Creek, a tributary to Muddy Creek, upstream of the
project area. Before the introduction was made, all fish in these segments of these creeks were eliminated
and a fish barrier was installed on Muddy Creek immediately upstream of McKinney Creek to prevent
non-native fish from gaining access to the stream. In addition to the Colorado River cutthroat trout, the
WGFD is planning to re-introduce all native species into the segment of Muddy Creek upstream of the
barrier. Colorado River cutthroat trout also occur downstream from the project area in the Little Snake
River (Baxter and Stone 1995). This species had been petitioned for listing as Threatened or Endangered;
however, the decision “not warranted to list” was made in June 2007.
Besides Muddy Creek, all of the other streams on the project area are ephemeral and therefore do not
have the potential to support BLM Wyoming State sensitive fish species on a year-round basis. Studies
indicate that the non-game, native species may ascend ephemeral tributary streams to spawn (USFWS
1985, Maddux and Kepner 1988, Weiss et al. 1998). Thus, ephemeral drainages fed by runoff from the
project area may provide habitat for sensitive fish on a seasonal basis.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Bluehead sucker. Present in the Little Snake, Green, Snake, and Bear River basins in Wyoming (Baxter
and Stone 1995, WGFD 1998, WGFD 2004a), the bluehead sucker occupies habitats similar to that of the
roundtail chub. This species is considered rare in Wyoming in comparison with other sucker species. This
species occurs in the Little Snake River and is found in Muddy Creek upstream of and within the project
area (Baxter and Stone 1995, WGFD 1998, WGFD 2004a, Bower 2005, Beatty 2005, Compton 2007,
WGFD 2007a). It has hybridized with non-indigenous white suckers (Catostomus commersoni) in Muddy
Creek (Compton 2007, WGFD 2007a).
Colorado River cutthroat trout. This is the only trout native to the Green River and Little Snake River
drainages in Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1995). Historical records indicate it was present in Muddy
Creek in the mid-1800s (Fowden, WGFD, personal communication). Historically, this subspecies
inhabited clear-water tributaries of the Colorado River in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and probably also in
New Mexico and Arizona (Behnke 1992). This species now occupies only a fraction of its former range.
Some of the most genetically “pure” of the remaining populations of this trout subspecies are found in the
Little Snake River upstream of the project area in Carbon County, Wyoming (Baxter and Stone 1995).
Colorado River cutthroat trout have been re-introduced into Littlefield Creek and Muddy Creek upstream
of the project area. Therefore, this species occasionally may occur within the project area, although
suitable habitat is not present to sustain it. The species is generally associated with steep, clear, cold-water
streams around rocky areas, riffles, deep pools, and near or under overhanging banks and logs (Binns
1977). Colorado River cutthroat trout have been extirpated from much of their original range through
competition with brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout, and hybridization with rainbow trout (Binns
1977).
Flannelmouth sucker. One of the most abundant and widely distributed sensitive fish species of the
tributaries and mainstream portions of the Upper Colorado River Basin, the flannelmouth sucker is found
primarily in the Yampa, Little Snake, Colorado, Green, and Gunnison River. It is also common in Muddy
Creek in Carbon County, Wyoming, upstream of and within the project area (Bower 2005, Beatty 2005,
Compton 2007, WGFD 2007a). There is limited information on the life history of this species. The
available information suggests that flannelmouth suckers utilize habitats in medium to large rivers and are
seldom found in smaller creeks, doing poorly in impoundments (Lee et al. 1980, Baxter and Stone 1995,
and Colorado Water Resources Research Institute [CWRRI] 2000). Causes for their decline include
construction of mainstream dams, altered river flows and water temperatures, and hybridization with the
white sucker (Minckley 1973). The species has hybridized with white suckers in Muddy Creek (Compton
2007, WGFD 2007a).
Roundtail chub. The roundtail chub is a close relative of the federally Endangered humpback chub and
bonytail. Its habitat consists of warm streams and larger rivers, usually in areas with slow-flowing water
adjacent to areas of faster current (CWRRI 2000). This species is common within the Little Snake River
drainage and is found in Muddy Creek upstream of and within the project area (Baxter and Stone 1995,
WGFD 1998, WGFD 2004a, Bower 2005, Beatty 2005, Compton 2007, WGFD 2007a).
3.9.2.3

Sensitive Plant Species

Four BLM sensitive plant species may potentially occur within the project area. Two of the species are
known to occur within the project area (BLM 2002b, Heidel 2008). The names and probability of
occurrence of these species are listed in Table 3.9.1. The following species are located within the RFO;
however, they are not located nor do they have habitat within or near the CDC project area: Laramie
columbine, Trelease’s milkvetch, many-stemmed spider-flower, dune wild rye, limber pine, and Laramie
false sagebrush.
Gibben’s beardtongue. In Wyoming, the known occurrences of Gibben’s beardtongue are confined to
extreme southwest Carbon County and extreme southeast Sweetwater County near the state line. This
plant has been documented approximately 9 miles west of the southern tip of the project area (WYNDD
2007) and it has the potential to likely occur within the project area. Gibben’s beardtongue may occur in

3-122

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

grass-dominated sites with scattered shrubs, semi-barren fringed sagebrush/thickspike wheatgrass
communities with 15–20 percent vegetation cover, or on ashy slopes amid Cercocarpus montanus. It may
also occur on outcrops of the Green River Formation on steep yellowish sandstone-shale slopes below
caprock edges.
Cedar Rim Thistle is endemic to the Wind River and Green River basins of central Wyoming. This plant
has the potential to occur in the project area; however, the species has not been found within the project
area (WYNDD 2007).
Persistent sepal yellowcress is generally found along moist, sandy stream banks, stock ponds, and manmade reservoirs near the high-water line. This species was located by HWA near Lost Creek below
Eagles Nest Spring during special status plant surveys during the 2006 and 2007 growing seasons (HWA
2008a). Results of the surveys indicate the occurrences of persistent sepal yellowcress are mainly
associated with the Lost Creek drainage near the Eagles Nest Spring site in the northern portion of the
project area.
Meadow milkvetch is a perennial halophytic herb found in moist, salt-accumulating habitats. It is
restricted to low topographic positions within the sagebrush zone of valleys and closed-basin drainages in
alkaline meadows, playa shorelines, discharge zones, mounds, and shrub patches (Heidel 2008). The
species has been documented in three extant occurrences in south-central Wyoming, totaling
approximately 8,000 plants within about 187 acres, near the Chain Lakes region of the project area
(Heidel 2009).

3.10

WILD HORSES

The Rawlins Field Office (RFO) maintains and manages wild horses (Equus caballus) in herd
management areas (HMAs) and establishes an appropriate management level (AML) for each HMA.
There are no wild burros within the project area and there will be no further discussion concerning wild
burros in this EIS. The AML is the population objective for the HMA that will ensure an ecological
balance for all users and resources of the HMA (e.g., wildlife, livestock, wild horses, vegetation, water,
and soil). The current AMLs were established in 1994 from a process that included five years of focused
and intensive monitoring, evaluation of data, public input, and environmental analysis (BLM 2005b).
The RFO has the responsibility to protect, manage, and control wild horses in its resource area pursuant to
the Wild Horse and Burro Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-195). The wild-horse program is responsible for
monitoring both the land and the herds, removing excess animals, and preparing animals for adoption.
The RFO manages three HMAs, two of which are partially located within the CD-C project area: the Lost
Creek HMA and a small portion of the Adobe Town HMA (Map 3.10-1). The Lost Creek HMA
encompasses approximately 251,000 acres, of which 235,000 are BLM-administered public lands. Of the
BLM-administered total, approximately 119,600 acres of the HMA are located within the project area,
virtually all of that acreage within the Cyclone Rim Grazing Allotment. The Lost Creek HMA is located
within the closed Great Divide Basin with annual precipitation averaging a little less than six inches. With
the exception of its northern border, all of the Lost Creek HMA surface area in the project area is located
within the Cyclone Rim grazing allotment.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WILD HORSES

The current AML for this HMA is approximately 60 to 82 horses which represents the high and low AML
targets in relation to the gather-and-removal cycle. The current population estimate for the Lost Creek
HMA is 120 adult animals (Mirati 2010). It was last gathered in the fall of 2009. The Lost Creek HMA is
partially fenced from the checkerboard lands to the south. The Antelope Hills HMA adjoins the Lost
Creek HMA to the north and is administered by the Lander Field Office.
The Adobe Town HMA is located approximately 20 miles west of Baggs, within Carbon and Sweetwater
counties. The HMA encompasses approximately 472,812 acres, of which 444,744 acres are BLMadministered public lands. Of the BLM-administered total, approximately 5,826 acres of the HMA—1.2
percent of the total—are located within the CD-C project area (Map 3.10-1), including portions of the
Continental, South Flat Top, Red Creek, and Willow Creek grazing allotments in the southwestern
portion of the project area. Average annual precipitation in this area ranges from 7 inches in the desert
basins to more than 12 inches at some of the higher locations. The current AML for this HMA is
approximately 610 to 800 horses which represents the high and low AML targets in relation to the gather­
and-removal cycle (BLM 2005b, updated June 2011).
The Salt Wells Creek HMA, managed by the Rock Springs Field Office (RSFO), adjoins the Adobe
Town HMA to the west and both share a common, unfenced border. Past capture, census, and distribution
data collected by both the RFO and RSFO indicate considerable movement and interchange takes place
among the horses of these two HMAs (BLM 2005b). Consequently, both the RSFO and RFO work
cooperatively to manage the two HMAs in the most efficient manner. The most recent gather of the
Adobe Town/Salt Creek Complex was conducted in the fall of 2010 resulting in 1,939 horses removed
from the complex. It is estimated that approximately 860 adult horses remain in this complex (Mirati
2010). In the majority of cases, wild horses have no natural enemies and population growth rates have
been shown to be capable of 16- to 25-percent annual increases. This can result in a doubling of the wildhorse population every three to five years (BLM 2005b). However, in several instances, mountain lion
(Felis concolor) predation has been documented to affect population growth rates (Turner and Morrison
2001). In the southern Great Basin of Nevada, mountain lion predation on the young was believed to be a
major population-limiting factor (Greger and Romney 1999) with the recruitment-rate reduction due to
take of foals. It seems reasonable to assume that historically, the gray wolf (Canis lupis) may have had the
same effects on horse-population growth as reported for mountain lion. An unnatural cause, illegal
killing, is also an unfortunate mortality agent. Where predation is not a factor, natural causes such as
starvation, dehydration, disease, and injury are the primary wild-horse mortality agents. In a typical
Rawlins wild-horse population, the highest mortality rates are for the young in their first winter (BLM
2005b).
Wild horses generally prefer perennial grass species as forage. Shrubs are more important during the fall
and winter. On the CD-C project area, the species of grasses preferred depends on the season of the year.
Needle-and-thread and Indian ricegrass are most important during the winter and spring, and wheat
grasses during the summer and fall (BLM 2005b). Crane et al. (1997) determined that wild horses in
south-central Wyoming spent about 61 percent of their daytime hours feeding and selected stream-sides,
bogs/meadows, and mountain big sagebrush habitats over low sagebrush habitats. Sedges (Carex sp.)
were an important component in the horses’ spring/summer diet. This study concluded that palatability
and abundance of graminoid vegetation and proximity to preferred habitats seemed to be the primary
influences on habitat selection by wild horses within their study area.
Several studies address the question of direct competition (displacing a species when they arrive) and
indirect competition (use of the same resources). Olsen and Hanson (1977) conducted a study to
determine dietary overlaps and composition between wild horses, cattle, elk, sheep, and pronghorns in the
Wyoming Red Desert. The percent of season dietary overlaps were most noticeable between wild horses,
cattle, and elk. The study also showed that wild horses, cattle, and elk seemed to be tolerant of feeding on
the same plants in different seasons and the strategy of grazing differed among species. Although this
study only focused on the Red Desert area, there was enough variation in selection of diets between the
different species that there was minimal overlap for the same resources.

3-125

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WILD HORSES

In a similar study conducted in southeastern Oregon, McInnis and Vavra (1987) found that at least 88
percent of the mean annual diets of feral horses and cattle consisted of grasses. The researchers concluded
that because dietary overlap between horses and cattle was high each season (62–78 percent), a strong
potential existed for exploitive competition under conditions of limited forage availability (e.g., extended
drought effects). McInnis and Vavra (1987) also determined in this two-year study that dietary overlap
between horses and pronghorn varied from 7 percent (summer) to 26 percent (winter). Overlap between
pronghorn and cattle varied from 8 percent (winter) to 25 percent (spring), suggesting that non­
competitive coexistence (indirect competition) between pronghorn, wild horses, and cattle was possible at
this level of dietary overlap. It is important to remember that even if species have the same diets, as long
as there are adequate resource supplies there will be no competition. Only when resources are limited
does direct competition occur.
Animal sizes vary and forage requirements change with the size of the animal. Similarly, different classes
of livestock and different species of wildlife have varying requirements depending on size and maturity.
Animal unit equivalents (AUEs) have been calculated for various kinds and sizes of animals. Table 3.101 shows the most commonly used animal unit equivalents of various animal species in relation to a
mature horse.

3.11

HUMAN ENVIRONMENT
VISUAL RESOURCES

3.11.1 Visual Resources Characteristics
As described in Section 3.1.1 Geology, the CD-C project area is part of a semiarid desert dominated by
patches and thickets of sagebrush. Along larger drainages, grasses, greasewood, brush, lichens,
cottonwood, and other plants accompany the sagebrush stands. Colors of gray, brown, and olive
characterize the vegetation, with grasses and forbs changing to shades of brown as they cure in the
summer and fall. Soils and rock strata are shades of red, gray, and brown.
The project area is wholly within the Intermountain Semi-Desert Province of Southwestern Wyoming.
North of Wamsutter, the project area lies within and comprises a large part of the Great Divide Basin
section as a whole. The rest of the project area is almost entirely within the northeastern part of the
Washakie Basin subsection of the Green River Basin section (Reiners and Thurston 1996). Rolling plains
cover the Great Divide Basin part of the project area. The landscape is generally unbroken, so visual
contrast draws attention wherever it occurs. Dune fields and playas (dry lakebeds) break up the sagebrush
plain north of I-80. Elsewhere, cuestas (rims), occasional escarpments, and eroded streambeds create
some visual contrast.
West of the Red Desert Road (BLM 3207) is a feature that USGS maps label the Red Desert Basin; this
area possesses a pebbly soil with a distinctive reddishness that shows through the scattered sagebrush.
The sand dunes of the northern part of the project area are part of a widespread dunes complex; dunes in
the project area are mostly vegetated in contrast to the active, mostly bare dunes at Killpecker Creek,
which is north of Rock Springs and far to the west of the project area.
The Chain Lakes Basin is part of a large playa complex that coincides with the Chain Lakes Wildlife
Habitat Management Area in the northeastern part of the project area. Panoramic views of this area to the
north of Chain Lakes Rim show these seasonal wetlands, which dry out to white alkaline flats. The
occasional springs of Battle Springs Flat, west of Chain Lakes, support considerable greenery.
The extended Delaney Rim-Wamsutter Rim cuesta-and-valley complex divides the northern Great Divide
Basin section of the project area from the Washakie Basin in the south. Panoramas of the central and
northern portion of the project area present themselves from Delaney Rim, and the rim complex itself is
the most prominent geologic feature visible from I-80 as the highway crosses the Great Divide Basin.
Eroded streambeds occur in the southern part of the project area; a key example is the deeply entrenched
gully system in the lower reach of Muddy Creek. Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir, an agricultural pond far
to the south within the project area, is a “social” recreation site (undeveloped and unmanaged) where
usage fluctuates with the water level. Flat Top Mountain in the far south of the project area includes
North Flat Top peak, the high point in the project area. This feature, Little Robbers Gulch, and The Bluffs
are prominent geologic features visible from Wyoming Highway (WY) 789, the major north-south road
through the southern part of the project area.
Cultural modification in the project area includes open disturbance, disturbed areas that are undergoing
reclamation but do not yet blend into the landscape, and many structures. Visible in many parts of the
project area are infrastructure (roads, power lines, and buried pipeline corridors), ranch improvements
(homesteads, shearing sheds, fencing, and water impoundments) and oil and gas development (active drill
sites and production and transportation facilities).
Oil and gas development, ongoing since the 1950s, comprises more than 4,400 natural gas wells in the
project area. This surface disturbance is currently 49,218 acres (4.6 percent of the project area) of which
8,472 acres (0.8 percent) remain unvegetated and in use over the long term for facilities such as roads,

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-127

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VISUAL RESOURCES

well-production facilities, and pipeline facilities. The most common type of disturbance—more than
26,000 acres, or 2.4 percent—is from pipelines crossing the project area. An additional 10,958 acres have
been disturbed for development other than oil and gas; this includes mainly federal, state, and county
highways and roads, plus agricultural improvements.
The potentially affected scenic quality in the project area is low to moderate overall. Cultural
modification due to oil and gas development has negatively affected scenic quality in seven of 15
identified landscape-rating units that are contained wholly or in part within the project area. This is
generally because oil and gas development disturbs existing vegetation and introduces structures, with
unnatural forms, lines, colors, and textures that contrast with the natural landscape character. In one of the
seven landscape rating units found in the project area, the contrast introduced by existing oil and gas
development is seen, attracts attention, and “in places is fairly dominant visually” (BLM 2011a).
I-80 bisects the project area from east to west. Because of high traffic volumes, I-80 is the vantage point
from which potentially the most viewers see the project area. Views from I-80 are mainly of the Great
Divide Basin portion of the project area, with the isolated mountains, uplands, and rims (among them
Delaney Rim, as noted above) in the middle-ground, background, and skyline. Foreground and middleground views from the highway often contain residential, commercial, or industrial structures. Through
travelers and trucks are the predominant users of I-80, and high prevailing speeds mean that motorists see
any given part of the landscape for a short time.
Historically, WY 789 from Creston Junction to Baggs, Wyoming and Craig, Colorado, offered
opportunities for pleasure driving and recreational access in the southern part of the project area. In the
past five years, truck traffic on WY 789, mostly attributed to gas-field and interstate pipeline
development, has grown almost twice as fast as other types of traffic. The Wyoming Department of
Transportation (WYDOT) (Section 3.16 Transportation) now rates the traffic stream on WY 789 at less
than “free-flowing.” Such traffic characteristics may discourage use of WY 789 for pleasure driving and
sightseeing.
The principal county road through the project area—the Wamsutter–Dad/Wamsutter–Crooks Gap Road
South (Carbon County Road [CCR] 701/Sweetwater County Road [SCR] 23S)—is now primarily a
natural gas industry access road. This two-lane gravel road may be busier than any other road serving the
project area except I-80. It receives high levels of heavy and overweight vehicle use, with truck traffic
often moving at high speed and creating considerable dust (Section 3.16 Transportation). These
characteristics now discourage use of this road for casual recreational use except as an access to other
interior roads.
As described in Section 3.16 Transportation, almost all of the 33 other interior roads of the project area
were originally intended for agricultural use, with consumptive wildlife recreation also being a common
use that is traditionally related to agricultural landscapes and lifestyles. In recent years, the many interior
roads have seen increasing use for natural gas industry access. Only three of 27 interior roads owned by
BLM possess right-of-way agreements for all of the private lands that the roads cross. These are Road
3207 (Red Desert Road), Road 3316 (Robbers Gulch Road) and Road 3321 (Little Robber Road).
Therefore, recreation is a historical and current use of the other 24 interior roads but is subject to private
landowner decisions about access.
Because of the extensive road network, all land within the project area is in the foreground or middle
ground of major or other roads (BLM 2011a). Increasing use by oil and gas workers lowers the level of
sensitivity of many interior roads because of the low to moderate concern for scenic quality of most users
in the context of low to moderate total use (BLM 2011a). For VRM sensitivity ratings, foreground and
middle ground are treated alike and represent a distance of up to 3 to 5 miles (BLM 2011a).
The Overland Trail corridor through the project area is an exception because the trail corridor is identified
as a special management area in the RFO’s RMP. The corridor has high sensitivity to scenic quality by
definition because of its special area status and because of the interest it attracts as part of the most

3-128

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—VISUAL RESOURCES

important historic trail in southern Wyoming (BLM 2011a). The trail corridor is described in Section 3.14
Cultural and Historical Resources.
3.11.2 Visual Resources Management System
Visual resources in the project area fall under the BLM’s visual resource management (VRM) system.
Guidance to manage visual resources is found in BLM Land Use Planning Handbook H-1601-1,
Appendix C (BLM 2005c). Land use planning decisions mandate BLM to manage visual resource values
in accordance with VRM objectives, which directly correspond to the assignment of all land to a VRM
class. The BLM designates VRM classes for all land by inventorying the visual resources and by taking
into account management considerations for other land uses. VRM classes may differ from VRM
inventory classes because of management priorities for land use (BLM Land Use Planning Handbook H­
1601-1, Appendix C, Page 11).
The BLM VRM classification system recognizes four VRM classes (Classes I through IV) based on
scenic quality, visual sensitivity levels, and viewer distance zones. Each VRM classification has a
management objective, as described below:
Class I. The objective of Class I is to preserve the existing character of the landscape. This class provides
for natural ecological changes; however, it does not preclude very limited management activities. The
level of change to the characteristic landscape should be very low and should not attract attention.
Class II. The objective of Class II is to retain the existing character of the landscape. The level of change
to the landscape should be low. Management activities may be seen but should not attract the attention of
the casual observer. Any changes to the landscape must repeat the basic elements of form, line, color, and
texture found in the predominant natural features of the characteristic landscape.
Class III. The objective of Class III is to partially retain the existing character of the landscape. The level
of change to the landscape should be moderate. Management activities may attract the attention of the
casual observer but should not dominate the view of the casual observer. Changes should repeat the basic
elements found in the predominant natural features of the characteristic landscape.
Class IV. The objective of Class IV is to provide for management activities that require major
modifications to the existing character of the landscape. The level of change to the landscape can be high.
The management activities may dominate the view and may be the major focus of viewer attention. Every
attempt should be made to minimize the impact of these activities through careful location, minimal
disturbance, and repetition of the basic visual elements of form, line, color, and texture.
3.11.3 Visual Resources Management Class Designations
VRM classes for the project area were established by the Rawlins RMP issued in December 2008. During
preparation of the Approved RMP, a protest was lodged concerning visual resource values within the
RFO. As a result, the BLM-preferred VRM decisions in the Proposed RMP/Final EIS were remanded, in
accordance with guidance in the BLM Land Use Planning Handbook, H-1601-1.
Map 3.11-1 compares oil and gas development extant in the project area as of 2009 to the VRM
classification set by the 1990 Great Divide Resource Management Plan (GDRMP) (BLM 1990). The
1990 GDRMP remained in effect as the RFO undertook the process of amending the RMP. Map 3.11-1
illustrates why there is a potential for conflict in jointly managing oil and gas development and visual
resources in the RFO. The potential was identified by BLM in the GDRMP FEIS:
The widespread development of petroleum, natural gas, and coal in the RMPPA is creating direct,
negative visual impacts within the RMPPA. Currently, visual mitigation of this activity is preventing
mineral development activities from exceeding the established VRM objectives within these areas.
The trend toward continued expansion of natural resource development is creating areas of potential
conflict between this activity and the established VRM class objectives . . . Utilities are also having

an increasing visual impact in the RMPPA. Even buried fiber-optic lines leave obvious visual effects.
…Although visual sensitivity is clearly not the highest priority for many residents and visitors, as
increasing numbers of sightseers and persons seeking various types of recreational opportunities pass
through the RMPPA, an awareness of scenic values and the existing scenic quality grows for some
residents and visitors.
The RFO is in the process of updating the classification of its visual resources. However, until that
process is complete, the RFO must, under the remand, use the VRM classification described in the No
Action Alternative (Alternative 1) of the Proposed RMP/FEIS. Map 3.11-1 reflects that classification
scheme as it applies to the project area. The classification shown on Map 3.11-1 is simply the
classification carried forward from the 1990 GDRMP.
As Map 3.11-1 shows, the project area has mixed land-ownership. This means that some state and private
land within a given VRM classification may not be subject to BLM administration, which applies only
where the federal government owns the surface or the oil and gas beneath the surface. This distinction is
reflected in the analysis of the land within the project area as presented in Table 3.11-1. About 60 percent
of the total project area is VRM Class III; the remainder is VRM Class IV. However, BLM’s authority to
manage visual resources is limited to an estimated 62 percent of the total land area in VRM Class III and
55 percent of the total land area in VRM Class IV. The remainder of the land in each class is exempt from
BLM VRM management objectives because the surface and minerals are private or state owned.

3.11.4 Visual Resource Inventory of February 2011
The RFO began the process of updating its VRM objectives with a formal visual resource inventory
(VRI) prepared in compliance with BLM Manual 8400, Visual Resource Management, and BLM Manual
8410, Visual Resource Inventory. The results of the completed inventory were published in February of
2011 (BLM 2011a). The publication of the updated VRI completes the first step of the process called for
by the administrative remand described in Section 3.11.3 above. Using the updated inventory as a
baseline, further steps remain to be completed to amend the RMP and to update the VRM classifications
of BLM-administered lands in the RFO.
Information from the published VRI (BLM 2011a) has been used in this section to describe and
characterize the affected visual resource environment of the CD-C project area as it exists now. However,
the evaluations found in the inventory are not to be considered a VRM classification now or even,
perhaps, the VRM classification that may be enacted in the future. No re-classification may occur until
the RFO completes the entire RMP amendment process. Until then, as noted in Section 3.11.3, the RFO
must use the 1990 VRM classifications.

3.11.5 Visual Resources Management RMP Amendment
As noted in Section 3.11.3, the BLM completed the RFO RMP revision in December 2008, but a protest
was lodged concerning visual resource values within the RMP planning area, which includes the CD-C
project area. To resolve the protest issue, the RFO is conducting additional planning, beginning with the
update of the RFO visual resource inventory described in Section 3.11.4.10
In April of 2012 BLM published a formal Notice of Intent (NOI) (Federal Register 2012a) to prepare an
amendment to the VRM sections of the RFO RMP along with the required environmental assessment
(EA) and began the amendment process with a 30-day public scoping period that ended May 11, 2012.
The BLM intends to finalize the EA and VRM amendment by the end of 2013.

3.12

RECREATION

3.12.1 Recreation Resources
The main recreation resource of the project area is the public land managed by the BLM and the WGFD.
This section discusses their use primarily for hunting and secondarily for pleasure driving to view
wildlife, especially wild horses. No developed recreation sites exist within the CD-C project area.
Dispersed recreational activity occurs wherever resources and access afford the opportunity. There is one
undeveloped recreation site near the southern boundary of the project area, Little Robbers Gulch
Reservoir, which has been historically used as a group hunting camp and fishing hole.
The project area is entirely within the Western Extensive Recreation Management Area (ERMA), a
management classification of the RFO established by the Rawlins RMP. For the Western ERMA, the
Rawlins RMP directs management to consider three recreation objectives: (1) provide for the health and
safety of visitors, (2) prevent or mitigate resource damage resulting from recreation uses, and (3)
coordinate with other programs to minimize conflicts and adverse impacts on recreational opportunities
[emphasis supplied].
The project area is not part of any of the Special Recreation Management Areas (SRMAs) otherwise
designated by the Rawlins RMP. This means that none of the areas with a high priority for recreation
management in the RFO are to be found in the project area. The only feature in the project area that has a
recreational aspect, and for which there is an explicit management directive in the Rawlins RMP with
implications for recreational use, is the undeveloped recreation site at Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir.
One prescribed management action is targeted towards undeveloped recreation sites, such as Little
Robbers Gulch Reservoir: the action opens a recreation site and its surrounding quarter-mile area to future
oil and gas leasing with a “no surface occupancy” (NSO) stipulation. This means development of
minerals directly under the restricted area may be undertaken by locating the necessary facilities outside
of the restricted area. Although this primarily agricultural reservoir historically has been used as a
hunters’ camp and fishing hole, it has recently been used less than in the past because of fluctuation in the
water level.
BLM considers most of the project area to be Front Country, where improved roads are generally within
1/2 mile of recreation activity. This character prevails because of numerous improved roads in the
Western ERMA that have been developed for oil and gas. Front Country is the second-most abundant
class of recreation lands in the RFO according to the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a). Management affecting
the Front Country recreation settings in the project area is guided by the objectives and actions

This additional planning will not include the decision area for the Chokecherry/Sierra Madre wind energy project because a VRM
amendment to the Rawlins RMP was considered separately as part of the NEPA process associated with the review of the
Chokecherry/Sierra Madre wind energy project.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—RECREATION

enumerated in the Rawlins RMP as described above. Indirectly, the recreation setting is affected by the
VRM objectives established for the project area by the Rawlins RMP because the visual quality of an area
is an important physical and social attribute of a recreation setting. (The Affected Environment for Visual
Resources is described in Section 3.11 and Environmental Consequences for Visual Resources are
described in Section 4.11.).
3.12.1.1 Wildlife Resources

The existing environment for wildlife in the project area is discussed in Section 3.8 Wildlife. The big
game wildlife resource supports hunting, which is the main recreation use of the project area. Hunting in
the project area is mainly for pronghorn, but hunters also pursue mule deer and elk. Wild-horse viewing is
another wildlife recreation use in the project area.
Commercial hunting guides using BLM land in the project area do so by obtaining a Special Recreation
Permit (SRP) from the RFO. Nineteen hunting guides who hold permits to hunt on the WGFD Hunt
Areas that overlap the project area also hold SRPs in the RFO. The project area is likely to be a small
percentage of the total area upon which these hunting guides base their commercial operations.
Information for determining the amount of use by these guides in the project area is not available from
BLM records.
A main hunting resource in the northern part of the project area is the Chain Lakes Wildlife Habitat
Management Area (WHMA) about 32 miles northwest of Rawlins. The Chain Lakes WHMA provides
winter habitat and a seasonal migration corridor for pronghorn. Agreements provide hunter access
throughout the WHMA despite its location in the “checkerboard,” the area of alternating one-square-mile
sections of public and private land. By agreement with the WGFD, the Rawlins RMP opens the WHMA
to future oil and gas leasing but with intensive management of surface-disturbing and disruptive activities.
The wildlife resources of the northern part of the project area also include a block of about 135,000 acres
of contiguous public land northwest of the WHMA (WGFD 2007b).
Wildlife resources in the southern part of the project area include the WGFD Carbon County Walk-In
Area #1 located six miles southeast of Creston Junction. The WGFD walk-in program allows hunters to
enter private land sections in the checkerboard without prior permission. The project area contains 15
sections of Walk-In Area #1 (9,600 acres), about half of which are privately owned. The remainder is
outside of the project area, where it adjoins the 25,600-acre Red Rim-Daley WHMA, also located in the
checkerboard of intermingled public and private land. Ready access for recreation is also available in the
southern tip of the project area where there is another large, continuous block of public land. This block
of public land includes upland habitat in the Flat Top Mountain range and its larger drainages, Blue Gap
Draw, Robbers Gulch, and Little Robbers Gulch. Little Robbers Gulch also contains the undeveloped
recreation site used as a hunters’ camp at Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir, as described above.
3.12.1.2 Other Recreation Resources

A network of small roads and two-tracks covers the project area. Increasingly, traffic has come to be
dominated by vehicles related to oil and gas field-development and maintenance, but the roads continue to
be used for range management and recreation. Full public access for all uses, including recreation, is
available on I-80, WY 789, and Carbon and Sweetwater County roads. The BLM interior road network
comprises 27 numbered routes. However, casual use without permission is limited to three roads where
the BLM possesses full right-of-way agreements. These include Road 3207 (Red Desert Road), Road
3316 (Robbers Gulch Road) and Road 3321 (Little Robber Road). Private resource roads comprising the
interior network of areas with gas development are generally open to the public.
Recreational off-highway vehicle (OHV) use occurs in the project area; however, such OHV use is
typically for the scouting activity that is ancillary to big game hunting rather than it being a primary
recreation activity.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-133

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—RECREATION

Non-consumptive use, which is mostly driving the roads to view wild horses or the Red Desert landscape,
is much less common than hunting. The resources that support these activities are located north of I-80
and are accessed from SCR 67 (Tipton-North Road) and BLM Road 3207 (Red Desert Road). Flat Top
Mountain in the project area south of I-80 also attracts some recreation because of the visual resource
(sightseeing, painting and photography of the mountain and from the overlooks it provides) and by the
recreational setting (OHV, snowmobiling, and non-motorized snow recreation).
The Overland Historic Trail runs east and west across the southern part of the project area. Signage calls
attention to a turnout with an interpretive plaque on WY 789 about 20 miles south of Creston Junction.
This minor feature may attract sightseeing visits by trail enthusiasts. However, this is the only public
access to the trail corridor in the project area.
3.12.2 Recreational Use
The BLM estimates recreation usage at the field-office level, so there are no data available on recreation
participation and recreation visitor days specific to the CD-C project area. Relying on experience, fieldoffice personnel characterize recreation use in the project area as low overall and seasonal during the
year, with most recreational use occurring during the fall big-game hunting seasons.
The BLM generally views the project area as serving a statewide market for undeveloped recreation,
especially the market comprising residents of Carbon County and nearby counties. However, there is
considerable use of the area by non-resident hunters, especially pronghorn and mule deer hunters who are
23 percent and 27 percent non-residents, respectively. The project area also occasionally attracts non­
resident recreation users with special interests such as wild horses, the Red Desert landscape, and historic
trails. Recreation in the project area is shown on Map 3.12-1.
Table 3.12-1 presents data on hunting activity that indicate the level of hunting potentially occurring
within the project area. The table shows the totals for the Hunt Areas that include the project area because
the WGFD does not have information on sub-areas within Hunt Areas (WGFD 2010b).

An estimate based on map analysis is provided of the percentage of each Hunt Area that overlaps the CD­
C project area. In terms of acreage, the project area contains about 28 percent of the involved Hunt Areas
and 22 percent of the involved Herd Units for pronghorn (the Baggs, Bitter Creek, and Red Desert Herd
Units). Similarly, the project area contains about 20 percent of both the involved Hunt Areas and Herd
Units for mule deer (the Baggs, Chain Lakes, and Steamboat Herd Units) and about 18 percent of the
involved Hunt Areas and 16 percent of the involved Herd Units for elk (the Sierra Madre, Shamrock,
Petition, and Steamboat Herd Units). These percentages roughly indicate the project area’s contribution to
hunting activity based on these game populations. Additionally, the project area contains only about 2
percent of the Baggs Hunt Area, which attracts by far the most hunters of all three big-game animals
among the areas overlapping the project area.

The total number of active pronghorn hunters using the Hunt Areas that overlap the project area rose from

declined dramatically in 2008 to 620, then rose to 694 in 2009. Deer hunters in the relevant Hunt Areas
rose to 4,918 in 2007—up 15 percent from 2002—then dropped slightly in 2008 (4,098) and 2009

3.12.3 Recreation Trends
Apart from long-term trends in popularity, the main factor determining the number of hunters using a
particular Hunt Area is WGFD’s allocation of hunting licenses in response to demand and to gamemanagement policies that balance the demand for hunting with the supply of game. BLM personnel have
observed that recreational use in the RFO area in general appears to be steady or in a slight upward trend.
If favorable conditions for wildlife were sustained in the future, then hunting throughout the RFO would
likely continue near current levels. A similar trend may be expected in the project area.
OHV use in the project area that occurs in connection with hunting is limited to existing roads and twotracks by the OHV designations published in the Rawlins RMP, although travel off-road up to 300 yards
is permitted to retrieve a downed game animal or to access a campsite. Despite limitations, the
proliferation of authorized and unauthorized OHV routes is expanding rapidly, potentially detracting from
the recreational setting.
According to a survey in the Carbon County Land Use Plan, fishing, hunting, overnight camping, and
nature appreciation are the four most important outdoor recreational activities to Carbon County residents.
The plan notes that important outdoor recreational activities occur at facilities or on lands that are
developed or managed by other agencies, so the plan encourages coordination to allow substantive input
by the county into agency planning (Carbon County Board of Commissioners and Carbon County
Planning Commission 1998). The land use plan contains no specific recreation plans for land within the
project area.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—LANDS WITH WILDERNESS CHARACTERISTICS

Recreation is mentioned in the Sweetwater County Comprehensive Plan. The plan states that Sweetwater
County goals and objectives relating to public lands and resources include a goal of promoting [public
land management] agency awareness of County issues and interests: “These include, but are not limited
to, natural resource exploration and development, multiple-use land and resource management practices,
agriculture/ranching and recreation, and adequate public access to and across public lands” (Sweetwater
County 2002).

3.13

LANDS WITH WILDERNESS CHARACTERISTICS

Lands with wilderness characteristics (LWCs) are blocks of public land possessing sufficient size,
naturalness, and outstanding opportunities for either solitude or primitive and unconfined recreation, as
defined in BLM Manual Section 6310 (BLM 2012f), Conducting Wilderness Characteristics Inventory on
BLM Lands and Section 6320 (BLM 2012g), Considering Lands with Wilderness Characteristics in the
BLM Land Use Planning Process.
A roadless area of more than 5,000 acres of contiguous BLM land is generally the minimum for
consideration as an LWC; smaller roadless areas of contiguous BLM land may be considered when they
are adjacent to an area already formally determined to have wilderness character or potential. These BLM
manual sections define current policy on LWCs, directing BLM to:
1. Continue to conduct and maintain inventories regarding the presence or absence of wilderness
characteristics; and
2. Consider identified lands with wilderness characteristics in land use plans and when analyzing
projects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
The policies stated in BLM Manual Sections 6310 and 6320 do not encompass wilderness areas already
designated by Congress or formally identified Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs) which are pending before
Congress and are managed as wilderness until a decision is made. Within the RFO, there are five WSAs,
one of which—the Adobe Town WSA—is near the southwest boundary of the CD-C project area but does
not overlay the project area. There are no designated wilderness areas in the RFO.
Specifically to comply with BLM Manual Section 6320, the RFO is tiering this analysis of the Proposed
Action and alternatives to the approved Rawlins RMP issued in 2008 (BLM 2008a and b). During the
land use planning process leading to the approved RMP, the RFO reviewed several citizens’ proposals for
new WSAs. The RFO responded to these proposals by conducting inventories to determine whether the
affected lands possess the wilderness characteristics of size, naturalness, or outstanding opportunities for
primitive, unconfined recreation or solitude, and found two areas located adjacent to existing WSAs that
possess one or more of these characteristics. However, neither of the two areas—Adobe Town Fringe and
West Ferris Mountains—lies within the CD-C project area (see Rawlins RMP Draft EIS Map 2-45, Areas
with Wilderness Characteristics, viewable online at <http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/wy/­
programs/planning/rmps/rawlins/deis/maps.Par.89221.File.dat/48_Map2-45.pdf>).
Although ineligible for designation by BLM as WSAs, the Adobe Town Fringe and West Ferris
Mountains areas with wilderness characteristics were considered for special, protective management
under the RFO’s land use planning authority and were evaluated to determine whether they were
manageable as wilderness. The majority of the areas under consideration are leased for oil and gas
development, in which case the RFO would not have the means to prevent impairment of any wilderness
character that may be present. Therefore, “the BLM elected to manage lands with wilderness character for
multiple use and not for protection of wilderness character” (Rawlins RMP ROD, p. 1-3).
The RFO continues to update the inventory of public lands for wilderness characteristics. All new
information regarding LWCs would be considered by the RFO in the future along with other resource
information in developing and revising land use plans and when making subsequent project-level
decisions.

CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

3.14.1 Cultural Chronology of the Area
Archaeological investigations in the Great Divide Basin and the Washakie Basin indicate that the area has
been inhabited by people for at least 12,000 years from Paleoindian occupation to the present. The
accepted cultural chronology of the Great Divide and Washakie basins is based on a model for the
Wyoming Basin by Metcalf (1987) and revised by Thompson and Pastor (1995). The prehistoric
chronology of the Wyoming Basin, which includes the Great Divide and the Washakie basins, is
documented in Table 3.14-1.

Paleoindian Period

The Paleoindian period is the oldest period for which there is archaeological evidence. It began ca. 12,000
years B.P. and ended around 8500 B.P. This is the transitional period from the Wisconsin ice advance
during the terminal Pleistocene to the warmer and drier climatic conditions of the Holocene. A savannahlike environment with higher precipitation than occurs today was prevalent in southwestern Wyoming.
Understanding paleo-environmental conditions operating at the end of the Pleistocene and into the
Holocene provides insights into the articulation between human populations and the environment
(Thompson and Pastor 1995). Paleoindian sites are rare in southwestern Wyoming. Fifty-one sites have
been documented to contain Paleoindian cultural material in the project area. One site includes a feature
(a hearth) that dates to the Late Paleoindian period at 8840 ± 90 B.P. No cultural material was found with
the hearth.
Isolated surface finds of Paleoindian projectile points are not uncommon and suggest that site
preservation may be a major factor affecting the number of known sites. Paleoindian lithic technology is
distinctive with projectile points serving as chronological/cultural indicators within the period.
Paleoindian tool assemblages include lanceolate points, gravers, and end-scrapers (Thompson and Pastor
1995). Radiocarbon analysis of a mammoth tusk at one site dates the site to 11,000 B.P.
Archaic Period

Settlement and subsistence practices in southern Wyoming remained largely unchanged from the end of
the Paleoindian period through the Archaic and continued until at least the introduction of the horse or
even until historic contact. Reduced precipitation and warmer temperatures occurred ca. 8500 B.P. The
environmental change at the end of the Paleoindian period led to a pattern of broad-spectrum resource
exploitation, which is reflected in the subsistence and settlement practices of the Archaic period. The
resource exploitation became more diverse during the Archaic period. Large side- and corner-notched dart
points and housepits are found during the Archaic period, and the presence of groundstone implements
suggests a greater use of plant resources during this period. Faunal assemblages from Archaic
components document increased use of small animals (Thompson and Pastor 1995).

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Late Prehistoric Period

The Late Prehistoric period (2000-650 B.P.) is subdivided into the Uinta and the Firehole phases. Largescale seed processing and an increase in the number of features including roasting pits is noted in the Late
Prehistoric period, as is the presence of pottery and the introduction of bow-and-arrow technology. A
characteristic of the Uinta phase is clusters of semi-subterranean structures dating to ca. 1500 B.P. At
least two different types of structures have been identified: a more substantial cold-weather habitation and
a less substantial, warm-weather structure serving more as a windbreak. The Firehole phase is
distinguished from the preceding Uinta phase by a dramatic decline in radiocarbon dates, possibly related
to a decline in population density.
Proto-Historic Period

The Proto-Historic period begins sometime after 300 years B.P. with the first European trade goods to
reach the area, and ends with the development of the Rocky Mountain fur trade 150 years ago. The
Wyoming Basin was the heart of Shoshone territory during this period, with occasional forays into the
area by other groups such as the Crow and Ute (Smith 1974). The most profound influence on native
cultures during this time was the introduction of the horse, enabling Native Americans to expand their
range. All forms of rock art denoting horses, metal implements, and other Euro-American goods are
associated with the Proto-Historic period. Metal projectile points have been recovered from both surface
and subsurface contexts in southwest Wyoming.
Historic Period

Historic use of the area is limited. Steep canyons, inadequate water supply, badlands, and escarpments
make the area inhospitable for settlement with only limited ranching activities present. Historic site types
include linear properties such as trails, railroads, and highways and associated sites such as stage stations,
rail stations, and sidings. Other historic site types include cabins, historic inscriptions, mines, cemeteries,
historic cairns, ranches, corrals, stock-herding sites, post offices, small towns, debris and trash dumps,
monuments, and bridges. No homesteads have been documented in the project area. The Homestead Act
of 1862 gave 160 acres to anyone who could pay a $10 registration fee and pledge to live on the property
and cultivate the land. The Grazing Homestead Act of 1916 allowed grazing homesteads to file for 640
acres of land. The Act was intended to help cattlemen. The federal government retained the mineral rights
to the land. In 1934, the Taylor Grazing Act and associated Executive Order 6910 ordered lands
withdrawn from further homesteading claims. These laws ensured the federal government would be the
largest single landowner in Wyoming (Gardner and Johnson 1989). Several ranches or ranch-associated
activities have been documented in the project area. Fur trapping and trading was not an important
occurrence in the study area due to the lack of perennial streams.
Linear historic sites are found within the study area. The Overland Trail crosses the mid-portion of the
study area trending east to west. The Cherokee Trail transects the southern portion of the study area,
trending east to west. The Rawlins–Baggs Road transects the southeastern portion of the study area,
trending generally north to south. The road is located south of I-80 and east of WY 789. The Lincoln
Highway and the original UPRR grade transect the project area trending east-west, generally paralleling
south of the I-80 corridor.

3.14.2 Summary of Extant Cultural Resources
The project area encompasses approximately 1,680 sections of land for a total area of 1.1 million acres.
The State of Wyoming Cultural Records Office in Laramie provided information on the previous work
conducted and sites recorded in the project area. Records at Western Archaeological Services (WAS)
were also consulted. There have been 20,473 cultural resource projects conducted and 4,860 sites
recorded in the project area (prior to 2007). The inventoried area is comprised of 116,322 Block acres.
The site density is 0.04 sites per acre. Many of the projects have been linear Class III cultural resource
inventories for roads, pipelines, powerlines, and seismic projects. Block surveys include wells,
compressor stations, and general block inventories. Other project types in the project area include Class I
data reviews; Class II sampling surveys, monitors, and open-trench inspections; reclamation; range
improvements; test excavations; data-recovery excavations; examination of ethnographic records; and
historic record research. The total amount of open-trench inspections and monitors conducted in the
project area has not been consistently recorded through the years. However, open-trench inspections on
36 projects and blading monitors on 35 projects within the project area have resulted in discoveries.
In southwest Wyoming, sand deposits (sand dunes, shadows, and sand sheets), alluvial deposits along
major drainages, and colluvial deposits along the lower slopes of ridges are recognized as areas of higher
archaeological sensitivity. Cultural resources are also likely to be found around internally drained playa
lakes.
3.14.3 Site Types
Of the total of 4,860 sites recorded prior to 2007, 2,350 were located in Sweetwater County and 2,510 in
Carbon County. Site types included: prehistoric sites (4,266), historic sites (281), and prehistoric/ historic
sites (313). The total percentage for site types is: prehistoric sites (88 percent), historic sites (6 percent),
and sites with prehistoric and historic components (6 percent). Of the recorded cultural resources, 0.04
percent have been listed on the National Register (2 sites; 1 has been destroyed), 23 percent (1,127) are
recommended eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), 50 percent
(3,443) are recommended not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, 25 percent (1,201) remain
unevaluated, and 2 percent (87) have been destroyed. Cultural resources documented in the project area
include prehistoric open camps, prehistoric lithic debris scatters, historic sites, and prehistoric/historic
sites. The types of sites that have been previously identified or predicted to be in the project area are
discussed below.
3.14.3.1 Prehistoric Sites

Prehistoric site types identified in the project area include sites dating to all time periods, burials,
housepits, rock art, hunting blinds, stone circles, rock alignments, rock shelters, cairns, pottery sites,
prehistoric camps, milling/vegetable-processing sites, butchering/bone-bed sites, lithic scatters, quarries,
and primary and secondary procurement sites. Many of these sites have undergone data recovery and/or
test excavations.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-141

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Prehistoric camps contain evidence of a broad range of activities including subsistence-related activities.
Cultural remains include formal features such as fire hearths, stone rings, cairns, rock art, lithic debris,
chipped stone tools, quarries, evidence of milling/vegetable-processing activities including ground stone,
and pottery. Single as well as long-term occupation are represented.
Lithic scatters consist of sites containing lithic debris such as debitage or stone tools. No features or
feature remnants are found at the sites. The sites are interpreted as representing short-term activities.
Quarries are sites where lithic raw material was obtained and initially processed. Primary and secondary
lithic procurement areas are geologic locations where chert and quartzite cobbles have been redeposited
and later used by prehistoric inhabitants for tool manufacture. Archaeological landscapes are secondary
lithic procurement sites identified within the project area. Landscapes are by definition not eligible to the
National Register.
Human burials, rock art (both pictographs and petroglyphs), rock alignment sites, and rock shelters have
been identified as sensitive or sacred to Native Americans. Few such sites have been located in all of
southwestern Wyoming. Numerous stone circle and/or cairn sites have been identified in the project area.
Prehistoric cairns are usually found along ridges overlooking seasonal drainages. Three rock shelters have
been documented in the project area. One site in the study area contains prehistoric and historic rock art
(Romanowski 1998), where two separate panels were identified. The southeast-facing panel contains a
prehistoric zoomorphic figure near the top, similar to a horse or buffalo. Also noted were vertical
scratches representing claw marks. The same panel contains a historic figure near the base. The second
panel faces east and contains historic and modern petroglyphs.
Housepits are found throughout the study area, and radiocarbon analysis dated two internal features to
5900 B.P.
Pottery/ceramics have been documented in the project area as well as numerous pottery sites in
southwestern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado. Small sherds from unknown vessel types were
recovered from most of the sites, and one nearly complete corrugated pot was collected.
Prehistoric/historic site types (313) include prehistoric camp/historic debris scatters and prehistoric lithic
scatters/historic debris scatters. These multi-occupation sites exhibit mixed surface components.
Generally the historic components of these mixed sites are associated with transportation or sheep­
herding activities.
Numerous sites have recently been excavated in the study area, and a data synthesis was compiled for the
Rawlins RMP, greatly increasing the knowledge of hunter/gatherer subsistence strategies in the area. One
site excavated as a result of the CIG Uinta Basin Lateral pipeline dates between 9300–1730 B.P. (Pool
2000). Five components have been identified at the Salamander site ranging from the Early Archaic
period through the Late Prehistoric period (Fleming 2004). Other excavated sites in the project area have
dated to the Late Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period.
3.14.3.2 Historic Sites

A total of 281 historic sites have been documented in the project area. Site types include historic trails,
stage roads, stage stations, ranches, cairns, and debris. Eligible historic linear sites that cross portions of
the project area include the Overland Trail, the Cherokee Trail, the Rawlins–Baggs Road, the Lincoln
Highway, and the UPRR. The Overland Trail crosses the south-central portion of the project area, the
Cherokee Trail crosses the southern portion, and the Rawlins–Baggs Road transects the southeastern
portion of the project area. The Lincoln Highway and the UPRR (original grade) trend east-west through
the central portion of the project area and are located within an area known as the “Southern Corridor.”
As part of planning for the project area, the Lincoln Highway and original grade of the UPRR were
identified and evaluated. BLM has accepted the evaluation with SHPO concurrence.

3-142

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Several sites are associated with the UPRR including sidings, rail camps, bridges, a culvert, and variations
on the original grade. Five railroad sidings have been documented. Six railroad stations have been
reported. Four bridges have been documented along the UPRR mainline. Other sites associated with the
railroad include foundations, camp debris, a shed, and a dugout.
Towns and post offices played a part in the settlement of the project area. Towns were located along the
UPRR and the Lincoln Highway. A post office, ranch, and stage stop were located at Dad, along the
Rawlins–Baggs Road. Recorded communities along the tracks or highway include Tipton, Red Desert,
Wamsutter, and Creston Junction. A “truss bridge” crossing Muddy Creek is considered eligible for
nomination to the National Register.
The Cherokee Trail was used in the 1850s by members of the Cherokee Tribe moving from the Oklahoma
Reservation to the California gold fields. A southern variant of the Cherokee Trail trends southwest,
crossing Savory Creek, and staying south of Ketchum and Five Buttes. The trail crosses the South Fork of
Cherokee Creek and then Smiley Draw, remaining south of Cherokee Creek. The road continues west,
with Wild Horse Butte to the south, descending to the Muddy Creek drainage and continuing west
through Blue Gap Draw. The Cherokee Trail through the project area was identified and evaluated as part
of this project (Johnson 2006). As with any of the westward migratory trails of the mid-1800s, variants
have been documented. Reasons for variations in routes include inaccessibility at certain times of year or
members of the group may have traveled the route previously and found an easier or more direct avenue
to water.
The Cherokee Trail has received a great deal of attention by writers and even the film industry. LeRoy
Hafen, in his work The Overland Mail, contends that the pioneering efforts of the Cherokee Indians led to
the eventual development of the Overland Trail. The net result of the combined effort of novelists,
historians, and the media has been to create a highly romanticized trail that is still not well understood in
terms of the people who used it and the location of the actual route taken by Cherokees traveling west
from Oklahoma to California in 1850 (Gardner 1999).
Excerpts from a Cherokee Trail diarist found in Cherokee Trail Diaries (Fletcher et al. 1999) document
stops along the southern variant of the Cherokee Trail. Mitchell (1850):
“June 30 Sunday . . . frosty and plenty of ice We took an object west [possibly Five Buttes] at a
great distance west to travel to and had great trouble in getting to it Too many bluffs & bad
branches in the way In the evening we got out of the mountains & got to a bad Swamp creek runing
south [This is Muddy Creek north of Baggs, WY] Supposed to be a for of elk head [Little Snake] 7 of
our men were dissatisfied with the corse we were travling & left us taking a more South corse”
The Overland Trail is recommended as eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. The Overland Trail goes
through the project area, traversing the checkerboard land pattern, and has been previously evaluated with
BLM and SHPO concurrence (Johnson et al. 2005). This evaluation included the associated stage
stations. Duck Lake Stage Station, Coal Gulch Stage Station, and the Washakie Stage Station were stops
along the Overland Trail. Gardner et al. (1993) states: “Construction of stage stations at Sulphur Springs,
Washakie, and Duck Lake more than likely took place in 1862.” This time frame coincides with Ben
Holladay beginning his Overland Stage venture to connect Denver, Colorado, with Salt Lake City, Utah.
“Home” stations offered travelers more amenities than “swing” stations where a change of horses
occurred and travelers’ meals were offered. Robert Foote, giving testimony to Senator Cameron during a
request for reimbursement for destruction caused by Native Americans, stated that “Stations from Sulphur
Springs west to Fort Bridger were built from stone.” (Gardner et al. 1993) Along with the construction of
the stage stations was the stringing of the telegraph wires. Freighters as well as emigrants used these
routes.
The Rawlins-to-Baggs Stage Road is an eligible freight and stage road. Mail, goods, and passengers
followed the road on freight wagons and the Overland Stage. The road is first documented in 1881 and
there were subsequent stage stations built along the route. Only the southern tip of the project area

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-143

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

overlaps the Rawlins-to-Baggs Stage Road. The entire segment of the stage road through the project area
has been previously determined as not contributing to the overall eligibility of the road (Rosenberg 2006).
Seven historic rock-art inscriptions have been documented in the project area. The Overland Rock
contains inscriptions associated with the Overland Trail and is listed on the National Register. Three sites
are documented to contain historic rock inscriptions associated with sheep ranching. Nine historic ranches
are documented within the project area and several additional buildings, foundations, corrals, and fences
are ranch-associated. The ranches are generally associated with raising sheep. In Wyoming, large-scale
sheep ranching did not appear until the latter decades of the 1800s; by 1920, however, it was one of the
pillars of the state’s economic base. Ranching families promoted economic wealth with hard work and by
taking chances, such as expanding across the desert of southwest Wyoming. Ranching/stock-herding sites
in the area are generally sheepherder camps exhibiting hole-in-top cans and purple glass. Refuse left
behind from tending herds is usually located on terrain with water as well as a good view to watch over
the herds. One historic log cabin has been documented in the study area. Also reported at the cabin site
are a tipi ring and two fire pits. A wild-horse trap is reported in the project area.
Historic cairns, often associated with sheep-herding, are located on ridges or high points, sometimes
overlooking seasonal drainages.
Historic debris/trash sites are found distributed throughout the project area. These scatters usually include
trash associated with emigration and ranching/herding activities—condensed-milk cans, food cans, baling
wire, glass, and milled wood. The sites are usually found on ridge tops in areas with vegetative cover
conducive for forage and bedding.
One historic mine has been reported in the project area. The Bugas Mine is a small subsurface coal mine
where low-grade coal was extracted, probably between 1950 and 1964. Gardner and Johnson (1991)
recorded its location on a northeast-facing slope overlooking Hansen Draw, approximately one-half mile
south of the Union Pacific Railroad and 2.5 miles northeast of Wamsutter. It is accessed by a faint twotrack road. The surface extent of the Bugas mine includes a 17-mile-long trench with a mine portal at the
west end that is partially blocked with earth. At the east end of the trench is a broad, flat tailings pile of
low-grade coal with some mica cut fragments mixed in. Some low-grade uranium ore was noted in the
mica cut-bank of the trench. It is unknown if any reclamation work has been conducted at the mine since
the initial recording in 1991. The site is recommended not eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places.
One grave, the Divide Burial, has been documented in the project area. The grave of a male Caucasian
was located during the construction of a telecommunication line. The grave was located on Union Pacific
land. Analysis of the human remains and associated coffin and grave goods indicate the male was about
23 years of age and was probably a railroad worker. His remains were moved to the Rock Springs,
Wyoming, cemetery.
3.14.4 Summary
Based on information derived from the data review, it is evident that prehistoric cultural resources are
found along the major ephemeral drainages and along the lower benches of escarpments that dominate the
terrain in the project area. Sensitive areas include drainages such as Muddy Creek, and other locales
where water was or is present—natural springs, playa lakes, and the larger ephemeral washes that provide
intermittent water sources. The numerous springs in the project area would be likely to contain cultural
resources. Seasonal drainages flow into the project area from several escarpments such as Flat Top
Mountain, North Flat Top Mountain, Baldy Butte, Pine Butte, Chain Lakes Rim, Ruby Knolls, Coal
Butte, High Point, Sugarloaf, Horse Butte, Luman Butte, Horseshoe Bend, Siberia Ridge, Lost Creek
Butte, Delaney Rim, Wells Bluffs, Wamsutter Rim, and Big Hill. Certain topographic settings have
higher archaeological sensitivity: eolian deposits (sand dunes, shadows, and sheets), alluvial deposits
along major drainages, and colluvial deposits along lower slopes of ridges.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

Two areas within the study area are identified by the RFO as especially sensitive. The first consists of
approximately 127 cairns along a ridge system in the southern portion of the study area, and the second
consists of a dune complex that spans nine sections. A sensitivity model and treatment plan for the dune
complex was compiled as part of the CD-C project.
The subsistence and settlement patterns in the project area reflect a hunter-gatherer lifeway. Information
about the Paleoindian period is sparse and is not well understood. Research into the subsistence and
settlement patterns used during the Archaic period indicates summer occupations in the mountains, winter
occupations in the foothills, and spring and fall movements utilizing all available zones (Creasman and
Thompson 1997). Subsistence patterns in the Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period are similar in
that they are based on seasonal movement throughout the basins and foothills in response to the
availability of floral and faunal resources (Creasman and Thompson 1997). A broad diet is evident in
extensive procurement and processing of small mammals by 450 B.P. (Shimkin 1947), or possibly earlier
(Bettinger and Baumhoff 1982). Numic-speaking Shoshonean groups occupied the Wyoming Basin and
continued to reside there until Euro-American expansion relegated them to reservations beginning in
1868.
Historic use of the project area was limited by terrain and lack of perennial water sources. Ranches,
limited irrigation, grazing, and limited ranching activities are identified by the historic debris scatters and
historic record. Sheep ranching was an important industry historically, and continues today. Historic trails
and stage stations are located within the project area including the Overland Trail, the Cherokee Trail, the
UPRR (original grade), the Lincoln Highway, the Rawlins-to-Baggs Road, the Wamsutter-to-Baggs
Road, and the Red Wash Wagon Road. Stage stations are associated with the Overland Trail and the
Rawlins-to-Baggs Road.

SOCIOECONOMICS

This section describes recent and current social and economic trends and conditions in and near the CD-C
project area, the geographic area that would be primarily affected by the Proposed Action or alternatives.
Information for this section was derived from a variety of published documents and from interviews with
local officials and service administrators. A Baseline Socioeconomic Technical Report (STR) was
prepared in 2008 (available on the BLM website for this document), which examined a wide range of
socioeconomic conditions and trends in and near the project area. These trends have been monitored over
time, updated, and are presented in this section of the EIS.
Natural gas development has been ongoing in the project area for more than 50 years but the pace of such
development accelerated between 1999 and 2004, then remained high through 2007/2008, contributing to
an economic expansion in Carbon and Sweetwater counties during that same period. Natural gas
development activity in the region was subsequently curtailed in the wake of the national economic
recession that began in December 2007, the repercussions of which continue at the time of this
assessment (mid-2011).
Figure 3.15-1, which displays the total number of wells (which are mostly natural gas wells) in
production in Carbon and Sweetwater counties between 2000 and 2010, illustrates the high levels of
natural gas activity in the early to mid-years of the decade and the subsequent leveling-off of development
in 2008–2009. Development began to accelerate again in Sweetwater County during 2010, but remained
fairly flat in Carbon County.

Socioeconomic effects of historic and ongoing oil and gas development in the project area and the twocounty area are included in this Affected Environment section, as information about these effects provides
valuable insight into the potential effects of the Proposed Action and alternatives and the historic and
cumulative contexts in which they would occur. The socioeconomic effects of the recent energy-related
economic expansion and subsequent contraction are particularly illustrative of potential future
socioeconomic effects of similar occurrences. This section also discusses the often cyclical nature of oil
and gas development and the effects of those expansion and contraction cycles on socioeconomic
conditions within the study area.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

The project area is located in western Carbon and eastern Sweetwater Counties in south central Wyoming
(see Map 3.15-1). Five communities are likely to be primarily affected by natural gas development and
production in the project area: Rawlins and Baggs in Carbon County and Wamsutter, Rock Springs, and
Green River in Sweetwater County. The Town of Wamsutter is near the geographic center of the project
area and is the only incorporated community within the project area. Although sharing some economic
and social characteristics, each community is unique.
The project area is about 40 miles across from east to west, and extends 20 to 25 miles north and up to 45
miles south of I-80, being somewhat keyhole-shaped in general form (Map 3.15-1). I-80 bisects the
project area along an east-to-west alignment. Along I-80, the eastern boundary of the project area is about
25 miles west of Rawlins, the Carbon County seat. The western boundary of the project area is about 40
miles east of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County. Approximately 80 percent of the total project area is
located in Sweetwater County, and approximately 60 percent is within the “checkerboard” of federal/fee
ownership pattern created by federal land grants to the railroad to promote development of the
transcontinental railroad.
The project area is sparsely populated; there are few permanently occupied residences outside of
Wamsutter, although some ranch facilities and a few rural cabins and privately owned lots are occupied
on a seasonal basis, the latter by the owners who park recreational vehicles (RVs) or camp. Green River,
the Sweetwater County seat, lies about 50 miles west of the project area along I-80.
The Carbon County town of Baggs lies about 8 miles southeast of the project area.
Four other communities—the Carbon County towns of Dixon and Sinclair and the Sweetwater County
towns of Bairoil and Superior—may also be minimally affected by the Proposed Action and alternatives.
The size of these communities and their land ownership, lack of temporary housing, and/or distance from
the project area indicate that substantial growth or other socioeconomic effects of the CD-C project would
be unlikely.

3.15.1 Economic Conditions
Economic conditions and trends for the study area were identified based on data from the U.S. Census
Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Economic Profile
System, from Headwaters Economics, available online at: <http://headwaterseconomics.org/tools/eps­
hdt> and from other federal, state, and local sources as cited in the text.
Local economic development and diversification efforts, coupled with expansion in mining, energy
resources, and the local trade and services industries, brought about a period of economic stability
through the 1990s with total employment fluctuating around 24,500 jobs (Figure 3.15-2).

In 2002/03, natural gas development again became a driving economic force in Sweetwater County,
prompted by national energy policy, record-high energy prices, and other factors. From the 2002 level of
23,989 jobs, over 3,400 jobs were added through 2005, with about 4,700 additional jobs added through
2008. Available data indicate a net loss of more than 2,400 wage and salary jobs in 2009, or about 7.5
percent of all such jobs, with a modest increase of approximately 500 jobs in 2010 (U.S. of Economic
Analysis 2011, Wyoming Department of Employment 2011).
In Carbon County, employment also climbed dramatically in the early 1970s, primarily due to energy
resource development (coal, uranium, and oil and gas). The net gain of 6,437 jobs between 1970 and 1980
represented a 90-percent increase in total employment. Like neighboring Sweetwater County, much of the
gain in Carbon County was transitory as nearly 4,200 jobs were lost during the early/mid-1980s as the
local coal and uranium industries both contracted. Thereafter the local economy remained relatively stable
through 2004, at least in terms of employment. More than 200 new jobs were added between 2002 and
2005, and nearly another 1,500 jobs added through 2008. Approximately 1,000 wage and salary jobs were
lost in Carbon County in 2009, nearly 10 percent of all jobs in existence at the beginning of the economic
recession in late 2007, with a further loss of about 200 jobs in 2010. Although the recession figured in
some of the job cutbacks, a substantial number of the losses were associated with the scheduled

completion of a major facility upgrade at the Sinclair Refinery (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2011,
Wyoming Department of Employment 2011).
Table 3.15-1 displays the current composition of the local economies in terms of covered employment.
Mining, construction, and transportation/warehousing are the primary sectors in Sweetwater County’s
economic base. In addition to oil and gas development, the mining industry includes two active coal
mines and four trona mines. Trade, hospitality services, health care, education, and public-sector
employment are also important local economic sectors.
The mining sector has historically been important to Carbon County, but despite the level of recent and
ongoing energy resource development in the region, the mining sector currently plays a more limited role
in the Carbon County economy than that of its western neighbor. Pipeline and wind-energy facility
construction, state government, health care, and the trade, accommodations, and food-service industries
have also been important to the Carbon County economy.

Labor Market Conditions

Local labor markets are reflective of the underlying economic and demographic conditions. From 1990
through 2002, the pool of residents employed or actively seeking work remained relatively steady in
Sweetwater County. Fueled by expanded economic opportunities associated primarily with natural gas
development, migration, and increases in labor-force participation among residents, the local labor force

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

has since expanded by almost 3,700 individuals, or 19 percent in five years. In Carbon County, the local
labor force underwent a slow but protracted decline from 1990 through 2004, shrinking by nearly 1,200
individuals or 14 percent. This period is also characterized by steady out-migration of former residents.
Labor demand tied largely to the increase in natural gas development spawned a reversal in trends,
attracting more than 700 current and immigrating individuals into the Carbon County work force between
2004 and 2008. During the same period, the resident labor force in Sweetwater County expanded by more
than 3,200 individuals, approximately 14 percent (Figure 3.15-3). More recently, weaker labor demand
brought about by the recession and associated impacts on natural gas development in the region resulted
in labor force contractions.

Unemployment in the region since 1990 had generally been between 5.0 and 6.5 percent, on par with or
slightly above the statewide average (Figure 3.15-4). Migration and commuting play important roles in
moderating local unemployment rates. Local unemployment rates dropped sharply in 2000, with a more
protracted decline between 2004 and 2008. During the recent expansion, labor markets were tight across
the state due to the high demand for labor associated with ongoing energy development. In Sweetwater
County average annual unemployment dropped to a record low of 2.3 percent in 2007, representing fewer
than 600 individuals unable to find work, or temporarily between positions. Carbon County also had
record low unemployment in 2007, averaging just over 250 unemployed, representing 3.0 percent of the
local labor force (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010). The effective unemployment rate was likely even
lower as the estimates of the local labor force used to calculate unemployment rates may not capture all
non-resident laborers working in the area but living in motels, RV parks, and other temporary housing.

The tight labor market was reflected in across-the-board labor shortages in Carbon and Sweetwater
counties. All economic sectors appear to be affected by the high demand for workers. The labor shortage
resulted in higher wages, bonuses, and per-diem payments in the natural gas industry. High wages in the
natural gas industry resulted in job shifts and worker loss in other sectors of the economy, creating
upward pressure on wages for employees across the private and public sectors. Even with the increase in
wages, local and state government and private businesses were frequently short-staffed and experienced
high employee turnover during 2007 and 2008 (Derragon 2008, Rader 2007, Spicer 2007). Shortages of
affordable housing in Carbon and Sweetwater counties (discussed in Section 3.15.5) impeded recruitment
of non-local workers, who frequently had difficulty competing for housing with higher-paid gas-industry
workers. Natural gas service companies were required to develop or contract for temporary housing for
employees, many of whom were rotated in and out of the area on a temporary basis.
Employers in other sectors of the economy were in some cases constrained from expanding their business
because of labor shortages. Some retail and service businesses had to limit business hours and, in at least
one case, temporarily ceased operating because of their inability to attract or retain employees.
A slowdown in the pace of natural gas development, combined with the effects of the recession and the
housing mortgage crisis, resulted in substantial economic dislocation and job losses in the region.
Unemployment and unemployment rates more than doubled between 2008 and early 2010, peaking at 7.3
percent and 564 unemployed in Carbon County. Peak unemployment in Sweetwater County topped 2,000
individuals in early 2010, representing 8.8 percent of the labor force. More recently, local unemployment
has declined, to 5.3 percent and 392 unemployed in Carbon County and 5.6 percent and 1,345
unemployed in Sweetwater County in March 2011 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011).
Sections 3.3 through 3.5 of the Baseline STR describe recent trends in key sectors of the Carbon and
Sweetwater County economies including agriculture; minerals; and tourism, travel, and outdoor
recreation. Section 3.6 of the STR discusses energy development effects on retirement migration and non­
location-dependent businesses. Key findings of these sections are discussed below.

3-152

Agriculture

Farm employment has been trending downward in Carbon and Sweetwater counties since 1970. Carbon
County farm employment decreased from 741 in 1970 to 564 in 2000, a 23-percent decrease over the two
decades. Farm employment continues to trend downward in Carbon County, falling below 400 in 2005
and to 369 in 2009.
Sweetwater County farm employment decreased from 552 to 201, a 63.5-percent decrease in the same
period (Headwaters Economics 2007a and 2007 b). Farm employment has since trended upward, to 266
in 2009.
A total of 287 individual farms and ranches, operating on nearly 2.2 million acres of land, were recorded
in Carbon County in the 2007 Census of Agriculture. Both totals represent slight declines relative to the
corresponding totals tallied in the 2002 Census of Agriculture. In 2007, a total of 244 farms and ranches,
operating nearly 1.5 million acres of land, were tallied in Sweetwater County (National Agricultural
Statistics Service 2009).
In 2008, local ranches and farms in the two counties reported total cash receipts of $60.5 million in
agricultural products, with livestock sales the primary source of agricultural revenue in both counties.
Gross annual agricultural sales in Carbon County in 2008 were nearly four times the level in Sweetwater
County during that year. Cash receipts from livestock and crop sales in Carbon County declined by
approximately 20 percent over the past five years, but increased slightly in Sweetwater County (U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis 2010).
Minerals

Mining employment in both counties reflect the period of intensive energy and minerals development in
the late 1970s and early 1980s and the ensuing slowdown as world energy prices fell. Current and
historical mining activity in the study area includes trona mining in Sweetwater County, and coal,
uranium mining and oil and natural gas production in both counties. Mining employment in Carbon
County peaked at 3,563 in 1980, declined to a low of 180 in 2003 and subsequently increased to 621 in
2008. Sweetwater County mining employment declined from its peak of 7,811 in 1981 to a 2000 low of
3,736,11 climbing to 6,717 in 2008 (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 2010). Recession related job
losses in mining from 2008 to 2010 are estimated at about 200 in Carbon County and 500 to 600 in
Sweetwater County (Wyoming Department of Employment, 2011).
Assessing recent mining-sector employment in the study area is complicated by the nature of employment
practices in the natural gas industry. Acute labor and housing shortages within the study area during the
boom years, coupled with the mobile nature of many natural gas drilling and service company operations,
hampered the reporting and tracking of natural gas industry employees. Shortages of local labor resulted
in many workers relocating to the study area on a temporary basis, working at job sites located in several
counties while staying in temporary lodging near the work site, and then returning home for extended
periods. Consequently their employment may not be recorded in the county where they are actually
working, or if their employer is located outside the study area, these workers may not be recorded within
the affected counties at all.
Oil and natural gas exploration and production have been important but volatile elements of the Carbon
and Sweetwater County economies for well over 30 years. According to the Wyoming Oil and Gas
Conservation Commission (WOGCC), Carbon County natural gas production increased from 75,851
million cubic feet (MMcf) in 1995 to 128,395 MMcf in 2009, or 69 percent. Production then declined by
4 percent, to 122,755 MMcf, in 2010. Carbon County oil production approached 1.82 million barrels
(bbls) in 2009, about 38 percent higher than the 1995 level of 1.3 million bbls, but then declined to 1.59
11

Mining employment for 2001 through 2004 was not reported by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis due to disclosure
restrictions. Mining employment may have fallen even lower in 2001; however the current natural gas expansion began in 2002.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

million bbls in 2010. During 2007, there were 1,620 total producing oil and gas wells in Carbon County,
and the county produced 5.9 percent of total gas produced in Wyoming and 3.4 percent of total oil. By
2010, the number of producing wells had climbed to 1,791, with another 425 wells idle. Annual oil
production had declined to about 1.6 million bbls. The production declines from 2009 to 2010 occurred in
part due to the sharp decline in new wells completed in 2009 (WOGCC 2011b).
Annual natural gas production in Sweetwater County decreased from 238,000 MMcf in 1995 to 192,000
MMcf in 2000, but subsequently increased to 235,316 MMcf in 2007. Sweetwater County production
accounted for about 12 percent of all natural gas produced in Wyoming and about 11 percent of all oil
during 2007. The county had 3,234 producing oil and gas wells in 2010, compared to 3,089 in 2007. Total
production of 240,144 MMcf of natural gas and 5.35 million bbls of oil occurred in Sweetwater County in
2010 (WOGCC 2011b).
The Sweetwater County economy is affected by oil and gas activity occurring beyond its borders. Over
the last decade, Rock Springs has emerged as a natural gas service center for southwestern Wyoming. A
number of oil and gas service companies that service the entire region have established major service
centers in the Rock Springs area. Halliburton, Schlumberger, and BJ Services have all established major
yards in the Rock Springs area and, according to the Sweetwater Economic Development Authority,
employed a total of 1,360 employees in early 2007 (SWEDA 2007a).
Historically, natural gas sales prices in Wyoming were substantially lower than prices received for gas in
other markets. This “price differential,” resulting from constraints in natural gas transmission capacity to
markets outside of Wyoming, was usually expressed as the difference between average Wyoming sales
prices, e.g., prices at the Opal Hub, Cheyenne Hub, or some combination of the two, and those at
Louisiana’s Henry Hub. The Henry Hub is one of several reference pricing points for natural gas.
Between January 2000 and December 2007, the price differential between Wyoming gas and national
averages ranged from just a few cents to $5.00 during the summer of 2007 (Wyoming Pipeline Authority
2008). The price differential effect fluctuated based on such factors as gas supply in Wyoming and
weather and other demand factors.
This price differential is important for state and local government because it affects revenues from ad
valorem and severance taxes and royalty payments and also affects gas company development decisions.
Extension of the Rockies Express Pipeline to Midwestern markets in 2008 and 2009 saw some
moderation of the price differential, and the completion of the Bison pipeline in northeastern Wyoming in
early 2011 also had an effect. Further narrowing of the price differential is expected as additional gas
transmission capacity comes online: the Ruby pipeline, which was completed in mid-2011 and transports
gas from the Opal hub to Oregon; and two expansions of the Kern River pipeline, also originating in
southwestern Wyoming, which were completed in April 2010 and October 2011 (Kern River 2012, Ruby
Pipeline LLC 2011, Wyoming Pipeline Authority 2010).
Travel and Tourism, Including Outdoor Recreation

Travel and tourism in the region, including non-residents engaged in outdoor recreation locally, generate
important contributions in the local economy. In addition to the economic benefits, outdoor recreation,
including hunting and fishing, is also an important contributor to the quality of life of many local
residents.
Much of the tourism and travel in Carbon and Sweetwater counties is traffic passing through the region
on I-80 which supports the lodging, dining, and entertainment sectors. These sectors also benefit from
energy workers residing in the area on a temporary basis. An economic analysis of travel in Wyoming in
2006 estimated annual tourism and travel spending by non-residents of $166.7 million and $142.6 million
in Sweetwater and Carbon counties, respectively. That spending supported an estimated 2,020 jobs in
Sweetwater County and 1,560 jobs in Carbon County (Dean Runyan Associates 2007). Travel and
tourism were also affected adversely by the economic recession. In 2009 estimated annual travel spending
by non-residents in Sweetwater County was more than $22 million lower than in 2006, with a

3-154

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

corresponding decline of 330 travel/tourism-related jobs. In Carbon County, the corresponding changes
were $12.6 million in lower spending and a loss of 300 jobs (Dean Runyan 2010).
Analysis of the seasonal variations in employment in the accommodations and food service sectors, and
the comparative growth in spending in recent years, indicate that a noteworthy portion of those totals
reflect travel in the I-80 corridor and the impacts of energy workers residing temporarily in the
communities, rather than more traditional destination-type tourism.12 Local observations about the
tourism and recreation economy in Carbon and Sweetwater counties help illuminate the findings of the
Dean Runyon studies. Sweetwater and Carbon counties do not have major tourism attractions such as
Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks that attract large numbers of destination visitors. Rather, the
visitor economy in Carbon and Sweetwater counties is based on outdoor recreation, including hunting and
fishing by non-residents, and non-local participation in local events such as historic/cultural celebrations,
competitions, conventions, and conferences (Radar 2007, Spicer 2008).
The strong pace of natural gas development in Carbon and Sweetwater counties between 2000 and 2008
had both beneficial and adverse effects on tourism and recreation-related businesses. In addition to the
general across-the-board increase in business, the beneficial effects of the gas expansion included
increases in customers and occupancy rates during the traditional winter and spring off-seasons, which
increased the year-round profitability of businesses catering to travelers. High demand also resulted in an
increase in the number of lodging and dining establishments, which in turn increased the lodging and
dining base for tourism and recreation visitors. High occupancy rates for lodging establishments also
resulted in a dramatic increase in lodging tax revenues; lodging tax revenues increased from $110,000 to
$362,000 between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2008 in Rawlins, and from $254,000 to $615,000 in
Rock Springs during the same period. Local tourism and recreation organizations have used these
revenues to develop promotional materials and to promote events that bring visitors to the area and
increase the average length of stay. Reductions in lodging tax revenues in the ensuing two years, to
$278,000 (-23 percent) in Carbon County and $422,000 (-31 percent) in Sweetwater County, provide
another measure of the recessionary effects on natural gas development and tourism in the area
(Wyoming Dept. of Administration and Information, various years).
Adverse effects of natural gas and other energy development on the travel and tourism industry included
the high energy-worker occupancy rates in lodging establishments, particularly during summer months,
which reduced lodging availability for recreationists, event attendees, and travelers on I-80. Travel and
tourism businesses, like most businesses in the study area, reported difficulty in recruiting and retaining
employees during the boom years (Radar 2007, Spicer 2008).
Energy Development Effects on Retirement Migration and Non-Location-Dependent
Businesses

Many communities view local economic diversification as a goal to help achieve economic stability.
Recently, some groups and organizations have highlighted the importance of retirees and other sources of
non-labor income, service and professional occupations, and non-location-dependent businesses as key to
economic diversification in western communities. A number of recent studies espouse the potential role
of amenity values, including those on public lands, in attracting retirement migration and non-location­
dependent businesses to rural communities in the West and serving as a foundation of overall economic
development strategy for rural western communities. Public comments during the scoping for this EIS
and on other natural-resource-development actions in the region have expressed concern about the
potential effects of energy development on the amenity values of public lands and the resultant

12

“Travel” for the purposes of that analysis includes both business and pleasure travel by residents and non-residents that was
more than 50 miles from the traveler’s home. In the study area this would include spending by all travelers on I-80, as well as that
by non-resident workers employed in the area on an extended basis but staying in local motels, hotels, and campgrounds.
Although not explicitly addressed in the Runyan Report, the spending estimates likely capture some spending by non-local
hunters and anglers.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

detrimental effects on retirement migration, non-location-specific business attraction, and
tourism/recreation visitation. Adverse effects on other sectors of the economy such as recreation and
grazing, effects on environmental amenities, and general boom conditions such as scarcity and high cost
of housing and labor shortages are also viewed as having the potential to dampen economic diversity in
communities within the study area.
Section 3.6 of the Baseline STR examines retiree migration, non-location-specific business attraction, and
tourism/recreation in Carbon and Sweetwater counties using an analytical framework combining
comparative cross-sectional and time series analysis involving 198 rural counties in six western states.13,14
Among the findings of this analysis are the following:
Retirees
 Per-capita personal income growth in Carbon and Sweetwater Counties outpaced that of the 198
rural western counties, climbing to 119 percent of the average in Carbon County in 2005; and from
126 percent to 146 percent of the overall average between 1990 and 2005.
 Dividends, interest, and rent (DIR) and personal current transfers (PCT)15 are two measures of nonearned income typically correlated with retirees. The growth in per-capita DIR in Carbon and
Sweetwater Counties between 1990 and 2005 substantially exceeded the rural western county
average and the growth in PCT generally paralleled the rural average during that period. The latter
is noteworthy given the high labor force participation in Sweetwater County and the large non­
working population in Carbon County associated with the Wyoming State Penitentiary, suggesting
that energy development did not prompt any relatively disproportionate out-migration of retirees or
deter in-migration of new retirees.
 Anecdotal information and census data suggest that absent energy development, relatively few
retirees would choose to relocate to the study area parts of Carbon and Sweetwater County from
outside these counties. Some retirees move from smaller communities and ranches within these
counties to Rawlins, Rock Springs, or Green River, and some retirees have accompanied family
members relocating for employment purposes, but most of the growth in the retirement sector in
these communities appears to be associated with the aging of the resident workforce (Ducker 2007,
Archer, 2007).
These trends suggest little or no adverse effects of energy development with respect to influencing
retirement income or migration within the study area when compared to all rural counties.
Non-Location-Dependent Businesses
 Carbon County has experienced more rapid growth in the number of non-farm proprietors and such
proprietors account for a larger share of employment when compared to the peer group of all rural
counties. Because of the presence of large trona and coal mines, soda-ash and fertilizer
manufacturing plants, and large electric-power generating plants, Sweetwater County has had
relatively fewer proprietors and has seen lower growth in the number of non-farm proprietors, a
substantially lower share of employment accounted for by such proprietors. Also, the recent location
of large oil and gas service companies in Rock Springs would contribute to the latter.
 Average annual income for non-farm proprietors in Carbon County, historically lower than the peer
group, is now on par. However, the average income for non-farm proprietors in Sweetwater County
is more than twice the average for all rural counties, and even higher than the averages for the urban
and resort counties. The differences may indicate a higher tendency for part-time proprietors in rural

13

There are 249 counties in the six states. Of these, 198 were considered rural for the analysis; 43 were excluded as urban counties
and eight were excluded as winter-resort communities that are fundamentally atypical from other counties in the region.

This analysis has not been revised since the original STR.

Personal current transfers (PCT) include unemployment, income maintenance, and retirement receipts.

areas as compared to Sweetwater County, or differences in the industries and activities in which
non-farm proprietors are active in Sweetwater County.
While the non-farm proprietor data reveal differences between Carbon and Sweetwater counties as
compared to the peer group, they are inconclusive with respect to whether or not energy development
stimulates or adversely affects the recruitment or operations of location-independent non-farm
proprietors.
Influence of Environmental Amenities

The project area is located some distance from the major population centers in both counties and has been
the site of ongoing oil and gas development for over 40 years. Much of the project area has been affected
by development, adversely affecting some outdoor amenities including wildlife and wildlife habitat,
scenic vistas, and areas that provide opportunities for solitude.
Although no major regional scenic and recreation attractions are located within the project area, scoping
comments indicate that several features within the area are important to some residents and non-residents
alike, including a sage-grouse lek complex southeast of Creston, a small portion of the Red Lake Dunes
Citizens’ Proposed Wilderness located in the northwestern part of the project area, and the Chain Lakes
WHMA located in the northeast portion of the project area. The importance of these and other
environmental amenities located within and adjacent to the project area for attraction of retirees and non­
location-dependent businesses to communities in the study area is not known. However, given the number
of more widely known scenic and recreation attractions within the region, the distance to major
communities, and the historic level of gas development activity and disturbance, the importance is likely
low. It is not known if existing development within the project area adds to the existing cumulative effects
on environmental amenities within the region and to the way the region is viewed by potentially
relocating retirees and non-location-dependent businesses.
3.15.2 Population and Demographics
Figure 3.15-5 displays population statistics for Carbon and Sweetwater counties between 1970 and 2010.
These statistics show the population effects of the mining and energy expansion, which began in the early
1970s, peaked in the early 1980s in both counties, and then began to decline. Carbon County population
increased 69 percent between 1970 and 1982 and Sweetwater County population increased 149 percent
during that period. Sweetwater County experienced a brief resurgence of the boom in the mid-1980s
during construction of the Exxon La Barge gas-sweetening plant, expansion of the Jim Bridger power
plant, construction of the Chevron Phosphate plant east of Rock Springs, and expansion of Western
Wyoming College.

Sweetwater County’s population climbed moderately in the 1990s in conjunction with a number of
construction projects and ongoing maintenance of mining and energy facilities. The county’s recent
natural gas-related growth surge began in 2004, though population in 2010 was still about 4 percent
below the 1982 peak, according to 2010 Census counts. Carbon County continued its downward trend for
much of the 1990s, and has fluctuated between 15,000 and 16,000 over the past decade.
Table 3.15-2 displays recent population estimates for selected communities in Carbon and Sweetwater
counties. As shown, most of the communities within the study area experienced substantial growth during
the past decade. Although Rawlins grew by 9 percent between 2005 and 2010, the net gain over the last
decade was 3 percent as a result of population loss earlier in the decade.

Sweetwater and Carbon County officials believe that U.S. Census population estimates do not fully
reflect the population growth during the energy expansion years. The Sweetwater Economic Development
Authority (SWEDA) developed population estimates for the county and its incorporated municipalities,
based on residential electric accounts and an average persons-per-household estimate (2.58) obtained
from the Wyoming Division of Economic Analysis. The SWEDA Sweetwater County population
estimate of 48,000 for 2007 was over 20 percent higher than the 2007 Census estimate and as much as
128 percent higher for Wamsutter (SWEDA 2007b). Although they did not prepare their own estimates,
Rawlins and Baggs officials also believed that the U.S. Census Bureau estimates during the 2006–2008
period substantially underestimated population in their communities, based on increases in utility hook­
ups and building permits (Derragon 2008, Corners 2007).
The components of population-change statistics show a net out-migration of approximately 400 residents
from Carbon County between 2000 and 2009, with a net in-migration of approximately 300 residents to
Sweetwater County during the same period (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). These statistics may not fully
capture the many temporary workers in both counties that accompanied the surge in natural gas
development.
Based on the 2010 Census, residents of Carbon County tended to be somewhat older than those in
Sweetwater County, but were similar in age to the population of the State of Wyoming and the United
States overall. In Carbon County, nearly one of eight residents was 65 years or older, as compared to
about one in 12 in Sweetwater County. The median age has stayed about the same in the last ten years in
Carbon County (38.9 years), while the median age in Sweetwater County has dropped from 34.2 to 32.8
(U.S. Census Bureau 2011).
The largest shares of population in both counties are working age adults aged 18 to 64 years. In Carbon
County, the number of persons aged 18 to 64 increased just slightly between 2000 and 2010, accounting
for 63.5 percent of all residents in 2010. In Sweetwater County, the number of persons aged 18 to 64
increased by more than 4,500 individuals (19.2 percent) from 2000 to 2010. The number of young
persons under age 17 and the number of persons 65 years and older in Sweetwater County also increased.
Increases in the number of working-age persons in these counties can be correlated to recent increases in
jobs, particularly in the mining sector, which attracts a high portion of working adults. Also consistent

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

with this pattern is the number of natural gas-related jobs attracting younger male workers who are
unmarried or married but not accompanied by school-age children. In addition, the number of miningsector jobs has increased noticeably in Sweetwater compared to Carbon County, which is also reflected in
the major increase in working-age adults in Sweetwater County as compared to Carbon County.
The racial and ethnic compositions of the local populations reflect the influences of historical settlement
patterns and economic factors, including substantial labor migration in response to the relative abundance
of economic opportunity. According to the 2010 Census, Carbon County’s resident population was 79.8
percent white and not Hispanic or Latino, with 20.2 percent of the population being made up of persons of
other races, multiple races, and/or of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The minority population in Carbon
County increased from 17.6 percent in 2000 to 20.2 percent in 2010. Sweetwater County has a larger
share of the population that is white and not Hispanic or Latino, with 80.9 percent of the population as
non-Hispanic white and 19.1 percent of the population being made up of persons of other races, multiple
races, and/or Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Though the percentage share of racial and ethnic minorities in
these two counties is higher than for the State of Wyoming as a whole, it is much lower than that for the
United States. The minority population in Sweetwater County has increased from 13.1 percent in 2000 to
19.1 percent in 2010. The largest racial and ethnic minority group in both counties is Hispanic and Latino,
making up 16.8 percent of the Carbon County population and 15.3 percent of the Sweetwater County
population.
The Economic Analysis Division of the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information
(WEAD) prepares population forecasts for Wyoming and its counties and municipalities. The current
forecasts, which pre-date the results of the 2010 Census, anticipated Carbon County’s population
increasing by about 5 percent over the next ten years, from 16,350 in 2011 to 17,230 in 2020 and then
decreasing slightly to 17,140 by 2025. The forecasts show Sweetwater County population trending
upward, increasing from 42,420 in 2011 to 47,220 in 2025—an increase of 11 percent during the 15-year
period (WEAD 2008).
3.15.3 Housing
This section provides information about conventional and temporary housing resources in the study area.
A shortage of housing during the boom period, particularly affordable housing, is a key issue routinely
cited by the local officials, service administrators, and local residents interviewed for this assessment.

3.15.3.1 Carbon County

According to 2010 Census housing counts, total Carbon County housing units increased from 8,307 units
to 8,576 units, or about 3 percent over the decade. The number of total housing units increased between
2000 and 2010 in every community in the study area except Dixon, which lost three units.
Carbon County’s housing stock expanded dramatically in the late 1970s and early 1980s in conjunction
with the previous economic expansion. Given the subsequent contraction, few permits for new residential
construction were issued until a brief surge in residential permits occurred in the mid to late 1990s. Strong
housing demand associated with the more recent local economic expansion prompted considerable new
residential construction over the past decade, particularly between 2004 and 2008. According to the
Wyoming Housing Database Partnership (WHDP), Carbon County issued 334 residential building
permits during the five years 2004 through 2008. Building permit applications fell sharply in Carbon
County during 2009 to 24 units, just 36 percent of the annual average for the previous five years, and to
18 in 2010 (WHDP 2011 and U.S. Census Bureau 2011). It is likely that the recession resulted in the
cancellation of construction of some units that had been planned and for which building permits had been
issued.
In recent years, several large, temporary living facilities were built for workers near the gas fields in
Carbon County. A temporary living facility was developed along WY 789 north of Dad for Devon Energy
which currently houses about 80 workers and can be expanded to house a total of 150 workers. A second
camp has been developed along WY 789 for Nabors Drilling and a third camp was also proposed.
City of Rawlins

The 2010 Census tallied 3,960 total housing units in Rawlins in 2010, a 3 percent increase over the
housing inventory in 2000. The net change understates the amount of traditional housing development
that occurred in the city because it reflects both demolitions (Mika 2007) and decreases in the number of
mobile homes during the past decade. Of the 2010 total of 3,443 occupied units, about 59 percent were
owner-occupied and the remaining 41 percent were renter-occupied.
Information about housing conditions in Rawlins during the recent natural gas expansion was obtained
from the 2007 Rawlins Housing Assessment (Kirkham & Associates LLC 2007). The housing assessment
was intended to assist city officials, community leaders, and developers in planning for infrastructure and
housing development in response to the growth that was occurring and anticipated at that time.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-161

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

Between 2001 and 2007, 106 single-family residential building permits and no multi-family permits were
issued in Rawlins. Rawlins has 11 apartment complexes with a total of 439 units. The newest of these is
an 85-unit complex built in 1997. The 2007 Housing Assessment estimated that the city needed 170
additional multi-family units, of which 100 should be rent-assisted.
At the time of the 2007 housing study, Rawlins had 19 mobile-home parks. In recent years, three mobilehome parks with a total of 146 pads were converted to lot ownership where the mobile-home owner also
owns the lot. The 2007 Housing Assessment projected demand for three new mobile-home parks in
Rawlins by 2010. During 2010 Rawlins had 16 mobile home parks with 639 pads (MHPS 2010).
Housing availability in Rawlins has been volatile in recent years. The 2007 Housing Assessment
estimated rental housing vacancies at less than 1 percent in December 2006. According to that
assessment, there were virtually no apartment vacancies in mid 2007 and most complexes had waiting
lists. Rental housing and apartment vacancies increased during 2008 and early 2009 due in part to the
reduction in the construction work force at the Sinclair refinery (Mika 2009). The WHDP estimated
overall vacancy rates at 16 percent during the second half of 2009 (WHDP 2010).
According to the Carbon County Visitors Council (CCVC) Rawlins has 23 motels with a total of over
1,252 rooms (CCVC 2010). Some motels offer weekly or monthly rates and typically host energy
industry and construction workers. Rawlins also has 3 recreational vehicle parks with a total of 303 pads,
although one RV park is not winterized (Stolns 2010). The CCVC conducted an informal telephone
survey of motels and RV parks during August 2010. The CCVC reported that the newer, nationally
affiliated motels in Rawlins averaged 95 to 98 percent occupancy, while the older and smaller motels,
which were more likely to accommodate construction and gas-field workers on a weekly or monthly
basis, averaged 75 to 80 percent occupancy. Local RV parks averaged 80 to 85 percent occupancy
(CCVC 2010).
Baggs

Total housing units in Baggs grew from 197 to 233 units between 2000 and 2010, an increase of 13
percent. During that period, Baggs approved a 16-lot subdivision and a 6-lot subdivision. Most housing in
the Baggs area is manufactured housing and mobile homes (Corners 2007). There is little available rental
housing and rents have increased substantially in recent years.
In the Baggs area, temporary housing resources include two motels with a total of 64 rooms and a 26­
space mobile home park equipped to accommodate RVs and mobile homes. Within the park there are
several mobile homes for rent, but these are rarely vacant. There are also two RV parks on WY 789 north
of town (CCVC 2010).
3.15.3.2 Sweetwater County

According to the 2010 Census, total housing units in Sweetwater County increased from 15,921 to
18,735, an 18 percent increase over the preceding decade. Much of that growth occurred between 2004
and 2008, when Sweetwater County issued 2,150 building permits (WEAD 2011). Sweetwater County
issued a total of 2,651 building permits from 2001 to 2010. Of those, 70 percent were issued during the
2003 to 2008 period. Building permits fell from the 2008 level of 321 to 160 in 2009, but have increased
to 213 in 2010. (Kot 2011).
As with Carbon County, the effects of the natural gas-related economic expansion and contraction are
evident in the housing statistics. The WHDP estimated rental housing vacancy rates below 1 percent in
Sweetwater County in December 2006. The tight housing market was reflected in rising rents; the average
apartment-rental rate rising from $512 in the second quarter of 2005 to $684 in the second quarter of
2006, an increase of almost 34 percent in one year. Average rental rates of detached single-family homes
increased approximately 21 percent during the same period while the average monthly rent for mobile
homes increased almost 13 percent and the average monthly rent for a mobile home lot rose by 11

3-162

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

percent. As elsewhere in southwestern Wyoming, the shortage and high cost of rental housing was a
constraining factor on employee relocation and on the ability of people on low or fixed incomes to
acquire and retain rental housing.
During 2009 and 2010, rental vacancy rates in Sweetwater County rose to between 5 and 7 percent.
Average monthly apartment rental costs fell from the second quarter 2009 high of $779 to $691 per
month in the second quarter of 2010, a decrease of 11 percent. Monthly rates for rental housing fell by
almost 18 percent between fourth quarter 2008 and fourth quarter 2010 (WHDP 2010).
During the height of the boom, ESS Support Services, under contract to BP, developed a 250-bed
temporary living facility with food service, housekeeping, and recreation facilities just north of
Wamsutter. The Wamsutter Base Camp was open to both BP employees and gas-field contractors. The
facility was permitted for 500 beds, providing flexibility to expand as demand emerged (Van Rensburg
2007). As yet another reflection of the curtailment in development activity during the recession, that
facility has now been closed and removed from the site.
City of Rock Springs

Rock Springs has seen dramatic changes in housing conditions in recent years, driven primarily by the
increase in demand associated with natural gas development. The 2010 Census counted 10,070 housing
units in Rock Springs, 20 percent more than the 2000 Census count of 8,359 units.
The City of Rock Springs issued a Final Housing Plan (Housing Plan) in September 2007 to inform the
community about anticipated housing needs and potential housing development opportunities in the city
(City of Rock Springs Housing and Community Development 2007). The Housing Plan identified 1,560
acres of land used for residential purposes and 8,899 housing units located within the city during January
of 2007. Table 3.15-4 displays the distribution of housing, by unit type, within the city at that time.
Single-family units were the predominant form of housing with 60 percent of all housing being singlefamily detached units.

The number of housing units in Rock Springs grew by about 8 percent, or 685 units, between 2004 and
January 2007 according to the Housing Plan. This generally coincides with the period of intensified
natural gas development in the region.
The City approved 33 new subdivisions between January 2004 and May of 2007. Of those, 25
subdivisions were for residential development with the potential to create over 2,000 residential lots. A
January 2007 inventory conducted for the Housing Plan identified 705 vacant residential lots, but noted
that not all of these lots were available for sale and development.
Residential development in Rock Springs continued during 2008 through early 2011, despite the
economic slowdown. A total of 1,235 residential occupancy permits were issued by the city between
January 2007 and April 15, 2011. Of the total occupancy permits issued, 40 percent were for singlefamily homes, 36 percent for apartments and 19 percent for duplexes. Rock Springs approved 14
residential subdivisions with a combined capacity for 399 units between January 2007 and April 15, 2011

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

and the Planning Department estimates that that there were 134 vacant residential lots within city limits as
of April 15, 2011 (McCarron 2011).
The average price of an improved residential property (a lot with a house) in Rock Springs during 2006
was $175,500, about 28 percent higher than the 2004 average of $137,500. The average price for
unimproved residential property (a vacant building lot) increased from $48,958 in 2004 to $160,989 in
2006, or 229 percent. According to the Housing Plan, these increases can largely be attributed to a
shortage in available housing inventory and strong housing demand from an incoming workforce. In
2010, the average sales price for residential properties was $174,257, virtually the same as 2006 (SWEDA
2011).
Although not establishing an affordable housing threshold, the Housing Plan suggested that given the
relatively high per-capita personal incomes in Rock Springs ($38,039 in 2005), many local workers in
Rock Springs could have afforded an average-priced home, if it were available.16 In addition, given the
relatively large number of two-income households (43 percent in 2000), many households with members
earning below-average incomes could have also afforded the average-priced home, if it were available.
The Housing Plan forecasted future demand for housing units for purchase based on the plan’s population
projections for the 2007–2017 period, the 2000 average household size of 2.48 persons per household,
and various assumptions concerning housing preferences. The Housing Plan forecasted demand for 1,539
new housing sales units and 1,100 new rental units by 2017. The Housing Plan also forecasted increased
demand for senior housing, housing for persons with disabilities, and low-income households. This
demand was based on a Rock Springs population forecast of 27,113 persons by 2017, contrasted with the
WEAD forecast of 21,474 persons by 2017 (Rocks Springs’ 2010 population was 23,036 according to the
2010 Census).
Rock Springs has a total of 1,638 motel rooms (Sweetwater County Joint Travel and Tourism Board
2009)
Green River

The U.S. Census Bureau counted 5,002 housing units in Green River in 2010, 13 percent more than the
2000 census count of 4,426 units. A total of 159 of the total housing units were constructed between 2000
and May of 2007. As of June 2011, there were only 39 available residential lots within Green River.
However, two subdivisions with a total of 224 units were nearing final approval at that time (Brown
2011).
Green River has a total of 256 motel rooms (Sweetwater County Joint Travel and Tourism Board 2009).
Wamsutter

According to the 2010 census, the housing inventory in Wamsutter has nearly doubled over the past
decade, growing from 148 units in 2000 to 286 units in 2010, an increase of 93 percent. Wamsutter had
no available rental units during the summer of 2007 and very few vacancies during the summer of 2010.
Temporary housing resources in Wamsutter include seven mobile home/RV parks with a total of
160 spaces. Some drilling and gas-service contractors have put dormitory units in these mobile home
parks. There are two motels in Wamsutter, one with 24 units, the other with 4 units, with a new 120-unit
motel in the planning stages (Colson 2007 and 2010).
3.15.4 Community Infrastructure and Services
This section describes community infrastructure and services likely to be directly affected by the
Proposed Action and alternatives. The following inventory identifies key public facilities and services

Housing affordability and the ability to qualify for home mortgages are subject to other criteria in addition to earnings.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

including law enforcement, emergency response (fire suppression and ambulance), hospitals, solid-waste
disposal, and water and wastewater systems (schools are addressed in a following section). These are the
services and facilities that have been and would be most immediately affected by energy development in
the project area and elsewhere in the study area. However, all county and municipal services are affected
by the demands associated with population growth.
The experiences of the past decade illustrate both the benefits and the challenges that oil and gas
development present for local government service delivery, particularly when that development is
regional in nature. Although oil and gas development has been ongoing in southwestern Wyoming for
decades, the advances in drilling in and producing from tight sands and other unconventional formations
led to a surge in development throughout southwestern Wyoming as well as nearby regions of Wyoming,
Colorado, and Utah during the early to middle years of the last decade.
Because oil and gas development typically involves multiple companies operating in multiple fields
across a region, growth in development activity, employment and, consequently, community population
and service demand occurs in a decentralized manner. Communities are uncertain regarding the
magnitude of growth and service demand that they may be facing, which hampers planning efforts. And
although large-scale oil and gas development generates substantial increases in state and local
government revenues, much of that revenue does not accrue until after the growth and increase in service
demand has been ongoing for sometime, and in the case of Wyoming, key revenue sources such as ad
valorem taxes on production are not available to municipalities, where much of the service demand
occurs. These factors, coupled with the previously described housing shortages and competition for labor,
contributed to challenging times for most of the local governments within the CD-C study area during the
energy expansion period of the last decade.
Then, when the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the ensuing global recession and other factors resulted in
falling natural gas prices in the latter part of the decade, industry activity and employment experienced a
corresponding decrease. Although a reduction in transient workers provided a respite from growth and
service demand, the corresponding drop in natural gas-related revenues presented a fiscal hardship for
communities that had added staff and begun infrastructure improvements to accommodate the growth.
Once oil and gas development reaches an equilibrium of relatively constant drilling and field development
activities and once development is completed and fields are producing, host counties and nearby
communities typically can prosper and use the incremental revenues to improve infrastructure and
services and accommodate the relatively stable population. However, the beginning and end of
development cycles and the surges and declines resulting from decreases in commodity prices and
demand are particularly challenging for affected local governments.
3.15.4.1 Law Enforcement

Law enforcement services are affected by natural gas development and production activities in the project
area in terms of demand for law enforcement agency response to accidents and law enforcement incidents
within and on highways providing access to the project area, as well as in terms of demand for services
from the workforce and population generated by drilling, field-development, and production activities.
Affected law enforcement agencies include the Carbon and Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Departments
and the Rawlins, Baggs, Rock Springs, and Green River Police Departments.17
During the boom years, energy development-related effects on law enforcement agencies included
difficulty in recruiting and retaining officers, due in some cases to the higher wages paid by the energy
industries and by larger law enforcement agencies, and due in part to the difficulty in finding affordable
housing. The time and cost to train and equip an inexperienced officer affected law enforcement agency
budgets, particularly when officer turnover was high. Most law enforcement agencies reported
17

Law enforcement services in Wamsutter are currently provided by the Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Department.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

substantially increased levels of certain types of offenses associated with the large, temporary, and
transient component of the drilling and field-development workforce, which included a high percentage of
single-status working-age males. Increases in traffic offenses, alcohol-related offenses and minor assaults
were typical. All agencies report substantial increases in drug-related offenses, particularly
methamphetamine (Carnes 2007, Claman 2007 and 2011, Colson 2009, Corners 2007, Jackson 2007,
Lowell 2007, Morris 2007 and 2010, Reed 2007, Steffen 2007).
The Carbon and Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Departments experienced increases in calls for service
related to industrial accidents, vehicle accidents, crime, and traffic infractions in remote parts of their
respective counties resulting from the intensification of drilling and field-development activities in
previously isolated and seldom-visited areas (Claman 2007 and 2011, Colson 2007 and 2010).
Criminal detention facilities in the two counties are operated by the respective Sheriff’s Departments. The
Sweetwater County Detention Facility has a design capacity of 208 inmates and was designed to allow
expansion on the same site while maximizing use of administrative facilities. In 2007, occupancy
averaged about 110 inmates and recent (summer 2011) occupancy was slightly higher (110 to 120), in
part because the detention facility has been housing inmates from other counties. The Carbon County
Detention Facility, which opened in 2004, has a design capacity of 78 beds. During the summer of 2009
the facility’s design capacity was exceeded a number of times. Consequently the detention facility
appears to have reached its capacity sooner than the 10–15 years anticipated when it was constructed.
Law enforcement and emergency-response dispatch services within the project area are provided by the
Carbon and Sweetwater County Sheriff’s Departments. The Sweetwater County 911 service is
administered by the Sweetwater County Emergency Management Agency, a division of the Sheriff’s
Department. The Rawlins, Rock Springs, and Green River police departments also provide dispatch
services (Carnes 2007, Claman 2007 and 2011, Colson 2009, Corners 2007, Jackson 2007, Lowell 2007,
Morris 2007 and 2010, Reed 2007, Steffen 2007).
3.15.4.2 Emergency Management and Response

Emergency management and response is coordinated in Carbon County by the Carbon County
Emergency Management Agency and in Sweetwater County by the Sweetwater County Emergency
Management Agency. Both of these agencies coordinate emergency management and response in their
respective portions of the project area and have recently established cooperative emergency-response
staging locations within the project area, which allows employees working in remote areas to meet
emergency responders at predetermined areas to guide them to remote accident locations.
Fire-suppression and emergency-response services in the Carbon County part of the project area are
provided by the Carbon County Fire Department (Rawlins and Baggs divisions) assisted as necessary by
the Rawlins Fire Department. Fire suppression services in the Sweetwater County part of the project area
are provided by the Sweetwater County Fire Department, aided by the Wamsutter Volunteer Fire
Department. Rawlins, Rock Springs and Green River also operate fire departments for their communities
and surrounding areas.
Ambulance service in the northern and western part of Carbon County including a portion of the project
area is provided by Memorial Hospital of Carbon County. In the southwestern part of the county,
ambulance services are provided by the Noyes Medical Clinic & Ambulance Service, which is located in
Baggs. The Wamsutter Volunteer Ambulance Service responds to calls along I-80 and to calls within
much of the central portion of the project area. Vase Emergency Medical Services provides ambulance
services in Rock Springs and along I-80. Castle Rock Ambulance Service provides ambulance services in

2007, Zabel 2007, Zeiger 2010).
The Rawlins Interagency Dispatch Center provides a central location for reporting all wildland fires in
southern Wyoming. Additionally, the BLM RFO and RSFO maintain trained and equipped fire crews that

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

respond to wildland fires on BLM surface and if needed will support other agencies on other federal,
state, and private lands.
3.15.4.3 Hospitals and Health Care

Hospital and emergency-room services in the study area are provided by Memorial Hospital of Carbon
County (MHCC) and Memorial Hospital of Sweetwater County (MHSC). MHCC is a 35-bed acute-care
facility located in Rawlins and designated as a Community Trauma Hospital by the state of Wyoming. A
Community Trauma Hospital must have a surgeon on staff. MHCC’s emergency room is staffed 24 hours
per day, seven days per week with an emergency-care physician, a registered nurse and emergency
medical technicians. Currently the hospital has staffing and facility capacity to serve substantially more
patients than are currently treated. During the summer of 2010, MHCC had eight active medical staff
physicians, over 35 courtesy (visiting) physicians and five locum tenens physicians who are hired on a
temporary, short-term basis to fill in when active medical staff are on leave (Jessop 2010).
MHSC is a non-profit, 99-bed, rural acute-care facility located in Rock Springs. As of 2010, MHSC had a
total staff of 363 and 112 physicians, including locum tenens and consulting physicians (MHSC 2011).
During the peak of the recent gas expansion in southwestern Wyoming, MHSC reported an average 20
percent occupancy rate during 2008 (Wyoming Healthcare Commission 2008). During that period MHSC
experienced an increased use of hospital emergency rooms for non-emergency care and increased
uncollected debt attributed to the large number of workers who did not have health insurance and an
increase in charity-care cases. The increase in emergency-room visits was largely attributed to non-local
workers who did not have primary-care physicians in the area (Hawk 2007).
There are medical clinics in Rawlins and Baggs and a number of clinics in the Rock Springs/Green River
area. Carbon County had 13 licensed practicing physicians during 2007 (the most recent year for which
physician data were published) or 0.85 physicians per thousand population, substantially below the
Wyoming and national averages of 1.94 and 2.81 per thousand, respectively. Sweetwater County had 39
physicians, or 1.01 per thousand, also below the Wyoming and national averages (Wyoming Healthcare
Commission 2008). A lack of affordable housing in the community during the height of the natural gas
boom added to the difficulty of recruiting physicians and staff. (Carter 2007, Hawk 2007, Jones 2007).
3.15.4.4 Solid Waste Management

In 2006 the Wyoming legislature passed a law requiring all operating landfills to prepare Integrated Solid
Waste Management (ISWM) plans to be submitted to the WDEQ by July 1, 2009. All entities in
communities affected by the Proposed Action and alternatives participated in the ISWM planning process.
Three special districts—Baggs Solid Waste and Sweetwater County Solid Waste Disposal Districts
(SCSWDD) # 1 and #2—are funded in part by mill levies on property within each district.
Rawlins operates its own landfill, which has a remaining life of several years at the current fill rates. The
City is currently seeking to obtain an additional section of land from the BLM to expand the landfill.
Rawlins, along with Casper, Douglas, and other east-central Wyoming communities, is a member of the
East Central Solid Waste Management Area As of February 2011, Rawlins ceased the disposal of
municipal solid waste at the Rawlins landfill and began transporting its solid waste to the Casper
Regional Landfill. Construction waste will continue to be accepted at the Rawlins Landfill through year
2016 when a permit extension will be considered. The need for cover material to continue current landfill
usage is an ongoing concern for the landfill operation. Disposal fees are designed to cover costs and some
construction waste is recycled (City of Rawlins 2011, Stolns 2007 and 2009).
The Baggs Solid Waste Disposal District operates the Baggs landfill, which has considerable capacity at
its existing site, but has recently opted to transport baled municipal solid waste and recycled materials to
the Casper Regional Landfill. Construction and demolition waste and animal carcasses will still be
accepted at the Baggs landfill (Good 2011).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-167

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

SCSWDD #1 oversees a landfill in Rock Springs, and monitors closed landfills in Reliance, Superior, and
Point of Rocks (SCSWDD#1 2007). The district is completing a permit process that will provide the Rock
Springs landfill with an estimated 30 years of remaining life at current fill rates and the district owns an
adjacent 320 acres, which could provide additional capacity when permitted (Herman 2011, Sugano
2007). SCSWDD #1 is part of the I-80 Solid Waste Management Planning Area along with SCSWDD #2
(Wamsutter/Bairoil), Baggs, Farson, Eden and Green River. The Rock Springs landfill is in the process of
becoming a regional landfill. The emerging plan will include the development and operation of transfer
stations in some other municipalities and transportation of solid waste to the Rock Springs landfill.
Currently the Sweetwater County communities of Farson and Eden transfer their waste to the Rock
Springs landfill.
Green River intends to close its currently operating landfill in approximately four or five years and begin
transferring solid waste to the Rock Springs landfill (Herman 2010, Nelson 2007).
SCSWDD #2 serves eastern Sweetwater County from the eastern border of the County to Point of Rocks,
including the towns of Bairoil and Wamsutter. District #2’s landfill fill rates more than doubled during
the boom years and the district’s landfill, located just south of Wamsutter, was within several months of
its maximum capacity. The district received authorization from DEQ to expand the existing landfill
vertically, which provided it five to eight additional years of use at current fill rates. The district has
applied for permits to develop a new landfill adjacent to the existing landfill on the remaining 20 acres of
the district’s 40-acre site, which will give the district an additional 25 years of capacity at current fill rates
(Rigano 2007 and 2011, Pilch 2011).
Disposal of solid waste from energy development has been of concern to community landfills and solid
waste districts in the past. Currently, most solid waste from energy development and operations
throughout the I-80 Solid Waste Management Planning Area is transferred to the Rock Springs landfill
for disposal. Disposal of waste from drilling reserve pits is a concern for some solid waste districts
(Herman 2011).
3.15.4.5 Water Treatment, Storage, and Distribution
Rawlins Water System

The Rawlins water system, which also provides treated water for the town of Sinclair, was developed in
the 1970s with a target capacity to serve about 17,000 residents. The system includes an 8-million-gallon­
per-day (MGD) treatment plant, which registered a 2006 peak daily usage of 4.45 MGD. Consequently,
the water-treatment plant could serve nearly double the current population at current usage rates. The
system includes four storage tanks, with a combined capacity of 6 million gallons for the city and a single
0.8-million-gallon tank for Sinclair. There also is a raw-water storage reservoir that feeds the treatment
plant. Rawlins has ample water rights in the North Platte River watershed and in springs and wells to
serve both current and anticipated future water needs (Stolns 2008).
Baggs Water System

The Baggs wastewater treatment system is comprised of a four-cell aerated lagoon, which has been in use
since 2006. The site includes a location for adding a fifth cell in the future. The system has capacity to
treat about 100,000 gallons per day (Corners 2008, O’Neil 2007). Recent wastewater system
improvements have included replacement of the pumps at the lagoon, nearly all of the vitrified clay pipes
in the collection system, and some damaged PVC wastewater collection mains, as well as up-sizing all
mains and installing two additional lift stations (Christopher 2011).
Rock Springs Water System

The Green River/Rock Springs/Sweetwater County Joint Powers Water Board supplies water to Rock
Springs. The water storage and distribution system could serve a population of about 35,000. Each year

3-168

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

the Rock Springs Public Services Department replaces and improves a portion of the water distribution
system in the older parts of the city. Water main extensions to neighborhoods on the perimeter of the city
are sized to accommodate additional growth (Walker 2007 and 2011).
Green River Water System

Green River obtains treated water from the Green River/Rock Springs/Sweetwater County Joint Powers
Water Board treatment plant, located in Green River. Although the system requires certain distribution
and treatment improvements, there is capacity to accommodate additional users (Nelson 2007, Michael
2011).
Wamsutter Water System

Wamsutter recently completed a series of improvements to the town’s water system; a 400,000-gallon
water-storage tank north of town (funded in part by $1,213,000 from capital facilities sales tax revenues),
construction of a water main connecting the industrial park to the town’s water system (funded by
$954,716 from the capital facilities sales tax), and installation of water meters (funded by a $538,000 loan
from the Wyoming State Revolving Loan Fund). A new well intended to be Wamsutter’s main water
source came online in November of 2007; the Town is completing a water-treatment project and has
received funding to study the siting of a new water source for the town. The town’s water system
improvements are designed to accommodate a target population of 1,200 (Colson 2007 and 2010).
3.15.4.6 Wastewater Collection and Treatment
Rawlins Wastewater System

The wastewater system for Rawlins was designed for a target population of 17,000; recent usage is about
half of maximum capacity. The system has three aerated lagoons, two settling lagoons, and two storage
lagoons. In order to achieve maximum capacity several lagoons would need to be cleaned and
restructured. It is possible that the wastewater treatment system would need to be upgraded to tertiary
treatment if substantial growth were to occur. There are currently over 65 miles of wastewater collection
lines within the city and recent expansions have extended the collection system to serve additional land
along I-80 (Stolns 2007, 2008 and 2010).
Baggs Wastewater System

The Baggs wastewater treatment system includes a four-cell aerated lagoon system and all cells have been
in use since 2006. The site includes a location for a fifth cell, but it has not yet been constructed. The
system has capacity to treat about 100,000 gallons per day (Corners 2008, O’Neil 2007). Recent
wastewater system improvements have included replacement of the pumps at the lagoon, replacement of
nearly all of the vitrified clay pipes in the collection system, replacing some damaged PVC wastewater
collection mains and up-sizing all mains and installing two additional lift stations (Christopher 2011).
Rock Springs Wastewater System

The Rock Springs wastewater treatment plant capacity was expanded to 4.2 MGD in 2007. During 2010,
the plant processed 2.3 to 2.45 MGD and served a population of about 25,000. The expanded plant has
planned treatment capacity for a population of about 50,000 and was designed to accommodate a second
plant on the same site, if required (Gaviotos 2007, Conner 2010). Work is currently underway to convert
the treatment plant back to an anaerobic system. The Rock Springs Public Services Department replaces
and upgrades portions of the wastewater collection system each year in older parts of the city and designs
collection system extensions to growth areas of the city to accommodate future growth (Walker 2007 and
2011).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-169

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

Green River Wastewater System

The Green River wastewater treatment plant has a 1.5-MGD treatment capacity and treated about 1.0
MGD during 2007. Although the plan has capacity to accommodate additional growth, a recent
wastewater master-plan study identified a number of areas in the wastewater-collection system requiring
improvement to accommodate new growth and more effectively move wastewater to the treatment plant
Michael 2011, Nelson 2007).
Wamsutter Wastewater System

Wamsutter recently completed construction of a wastewater-collection main to connect the industrial park
and other system improvements to the wastewater system, and conducted a capacity analysis of its
wastewater lagoon system to determine short- and long-term needs. The analysis was funded by a
$16,500 grant from BP America. The current system is designed to serve a population of about 1,200 and
Town staff believes that at peak, the system served about 850. The Town intends to expand and improve
the wastewater system to accommodate a population of 2,500. (Carnes 2007, Colson 2007 and 2010).
3.15.5 Local Government Fiscal Conditions
Natural gas development in the project area would affect certain local, state, and federal government
revenues and expenditures. Affected revenues would include ad valorem property tax revenues of Carbon
and Sweetwater counties; Carbon County School District #1, Sweetwater County School District #1 and
certain special districts; sales and use tax revenues of the State of Wyoming, the two counties, and their
municipalities; state severance taxes; and federal mineral royalties. The two counties and the affected
school districts, special districts, and municipalities would also see increases in expenditures to serve
development and associated population growth. This section describes existing conditions and trends in
the local government jurisdictions that are likely to be affected by the proposed CD-C project.
3.15.5.1 County Fiscal Conditions and Trends
Ad Valorem/Property Tax Trends

Ad valorem taxes, commonly known as property taxes, constitute an important share of the revenue base
of Carbon and Sweetwater Counties, and for local school districts. The basis for local property taxes in
Wyoming is the assessed valuation of real and personal property, utilities, and mineral production. Driven
largely by increases in mineral valuation, the ad valorem tax base has grown substantially over the past
decade, despite a sharp drop from 2009 to 2010 (see Figure 3.15-6). Sweetwater County total assessed
valuation exceeded $2.1 billion in 2010; nearly $900 million lower than in 2009 but still nearly double the
$1.1 billion recorded in 2000. Assessed valuation also climbed dramatically in Carbon County over the
past decade, from $337 million in 2000 to nearly $800 million in 2010. The net change in Carbon County
included jumps of more than $200 million from 2005 to 2006 and from 2008 to 2009, but a sharp decline
of more than $450 million from 2009 to 2010.

Valuation on oil and gas production has accounted for most of the changes in assessed value, more than
quadrupling between 2000 and 2009 in Carbon County and tripling in Sweetwater County. That growth
reflected both rising energy prices and increased production. As a result of that growth, the assessed value
on minerals currently accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total valuation in both counties.
However, as is readily apparent locally, these valuations are subject to substantial year-to-year volatility
due to the volatility in global energy prices. Between 2009 and 2010, the assessed value of mineral
production in these counties declined by nearly 50 percent in Carbon County and over 40 percent in
Sweetwater County.
Sales and Use Tax Conditions and Trends

Another key source of revenue for counties and incorporated communities are sales and use taxes
imposed by the state and, when approved by the local electorate, the counties themselves. The state sales
and use tax of 4 percent is collected based on the point of sale, a share of which is redistributed back to
local governments. The share returned to counties and incorporated municipalities (a statutorily
prescribed amount, currently 31 percent of statewide total receipts) is on a population-based formula,
irrespective of where the sales were generated. Counties can elect to impose a 1-percent general-purpose
local tax and a 1-percent specific-purpose tax for capital improvements. Carbon and Sweetwater Counties
currently each impose the general-purpose 1-percent levy and Carbon County imposes the 1-percent
special-purpose option tax. The state collects these taxes and distributes the local share based on the
above-referenced formula.
Figure 3.15-7 and Tables 3.15-5 and 3.15-6 summarize the sales, use, and lodging tax distributions by
the state to the two counties in recent years. The reported distributions include both the full distribution of
local-option taxes and the respective county’s proportional share of the state taxes. The tables also show
the total amount of sales and use tax receipts collected from each of the counties for activities occurring
within their respective boundaries, providing a comprehensive measure of the changes in taxable sales
activity over the period.
Figure 3.15-7 displays the general pattern of growth and then decline in recent years in response to the
level of natural gas development and related capital investment, for example, in compression and pipeline
transmission capacity. Declines of approximately 30 percent occurred in each county between 2009 and

2004–2010

As shown above and in Table 3.15-5, total sales and use tax revenues distributed to Carbon County,
largely reflecting the increase in natural gas development activity, more than doubled from 2004 to 2007,
then declined to just over $34 million in 2008 as a 1-percent specific-purpose local-option tax expired.
Continuing natural gas development activity, along with construction activities at the Sinclair refinery
supported a modest increase in receipts to $36 million in 2009. Completion of the major construction
activities at the refinery and the effects of the recession on the statewide and local economies took hold in
2010, resulting in a decline of more than $8 million. The significance of the local-option taxes is readily
apparent, generating more than $13.0 million in sales and use tax revenues for Carbon County in 2007.
The total local-option tax receipts declined to $9.0 million in 2010.

Sweetwater County sales and use taxes generated by local activity have increased sharply over time.
Much of the growth reflects the effects of economic expansion through 2009, although locally levied
specific-purpose local-option taxes have generated more than $20 million annually from 2007 to 2009.
Sales and use tax revenues declined by $39 million between 2009 and 2010, a 29 percent decline. The
high level of sales and use tax attributable to the mining sector in Sweetwater County reflects the trona
and coal-mining base within the county as well as oil and gas development (Table 3.15-6).

The mining industry is a major generator of state and local sales and use tax revenues in Carbon County
and changes in mining activity, including new oil and gas development, translate into differences in tax
receipts. The receipts yield fiscal benefits statewide through various redistribution formulas.
Sales and use tax collections reported by the mining industry for the five years immediately preceding the
recent economic recession exceeded $145 million, representing approximately 25 to 30 percent of the
total annual revenues generated by the state sales and use tax levies in the two counties during that period
(Table 3.15-7). These revenues are derived largely from oil and gas development, and of that total,
approximately 51 percent accrued to the state coffers or was distributed to other communities.

3.15.5.2 County Revenues and Expenditures

Property, sales, and use taxes combine to account for the major share of county revenues. However,
counties have many other revenue sources, ranging from fees for services to federal payment-in-lieu-of­
taxes, and distributions of severance tax and mineral royalties from the state. Historically, Carbon County
also has received various grants to address capital needs, but the amount and timing of such grants is
highly variable.
Table 3.15-8 shows total fund revenues and expenditures in several broad categories for Carbon County’s
general fund over the past three fiscal years. As shown, property tax receipts increased by $2.7 million
from 2009 to 2010 in response to increases in assessed valuation, driven primarily by mineral valuation.
Budgeted expenditures for selected departments that tend to be sensitive to growth increased from 2008 to
2009 and were budgeted to increase again in 2010. However, as described elsewhere, the economic
downturn and reduction in the pace of development had noticeable adverse effects on revenues; actual
revenues from sources other than property taxes were 40 percent below the budgeted sums. Consequently,
the County’s total general fund revenue was 22 percent below budget, requiring substantial reductions in
operating outlays, deferral of planned capital outlays, and use of reserve funds. While the recession may
have resulted in some reductions in service demand, the severity of the cutbacks resulted in diminished
levels of service for county residents.

Table 3.15-9 shows similar general-fund budget data for Sweetwater County. There too, the effects of the
recession are apparent in declines in revenues and general fund expenditures from fiscal year 2008 to
2009. Sweetwater County realized a net increase in tax revenues between 2009 and 2010, primarily
derived from property taxes on mineral production which more than offset declines in sales and use tax
receipts. Due to the lags between production and taxation on mineral valuation, a substantial reduction in
property tax revenues and further reductions in sales and use taxes are anticipated for the 2011 budget
year.

Figure 3.15-8 summarizes the total annual general fund revenues for Carbon and Sweetwater Counties
for fiscal years 2004 through 2010, illustrating the volatility in tax revenues associated with naturalresource development. Because the timing and magnitude of the changes are often not foreseeable and
can come about relatively quickly, the year-to-year changes in revenues, coupled with the subsequent
implications for budgeted expenditures, pose important challenges for local government The challenges
can be particularly acute with respect to planning and funding large-scale capital improvement projects
and to expanding current services during periods of rapid growth.

3.15.5.3 Municipal Fiscal Conditions and Trends
Property Taxes

Property taxes are a less significant, but still important revenue source, for municipalities than for
counties. Unlike county-wide valuations that rely heavily on mineral valuation, municipal valuations are
more heavily based on the real estate. The dependency on real estate reduces the volatility in year-to-year
valuations for municipalities, as compared to that for counties. Because of the latter factor, trends in
assessed valuation are important indicators of local economic growth.
As shown in Table 3.15-10, Green River, Rawlins, and Rock Springs have relatively large ad valorem tax
bases, while the three smaller communities have much smaller property tax bases. The most significant
trends disclosed by these data include the strong growth in valuations among the three large communities,
and the recent declines in Wamsutter’s property tax base following its peak of $5.4 million in 2006. Rock
Springs saw a 136-percent increase in assessed value between 2003 and 2010 due to its emergence as a
regional service center for natural gas development, resulting in an assessed value nearly four times that
of Rawlins and over twice that of Green River.

Sales and Use Tax Distributions

Sales and use taxes are typically the single largest source of general-fund revenue for municipalities. That
pattern applies to the affected municipalities in the project area. Table 3.15-11 shows the annual sales and
use tax distributions reported by the state to each of the six potentially affected communities from 2005
through 2010. The comparative distributions among the communities generally reflect their relative sizes,
as well as differences in the level of economic activity and growth associated with the natural gas
industry.

As shown above, the local municipalities experienced substantial declines in sales and use tax
distributions as the economic recession continued. In Rock Springs the total distribution dropped by $5.9
million, or 24 percent. Rawlins experienced a larger decline, in relative terms, of 35 percent. The

unforeseen magnitude of these declines necessitated mid-year revisions in budgets, which translated to
responses such as staff layoffs, deferral of planned hiring, cutbacks in services and programs, and
cancellation or deferral of capital-improvement spending.
Municipal Revenue and Expenditures

Summaries of municipal general-fund revenues and expenditures were developed from budget documents
of the selected cities and towns. These summary budgets are presented in Tables 3.15-12 through 3.1515. Although the organization of funds and level of detail provided in the municipal budgets varies among
the communities, the summary budgets attempt to present comparable information for each municipality
by assigning all revenues and expenditures to one of a broadly defined set of categories. Two conventions
should be noted. First, the income category of “taxes” includes sales and use taxes returned to the
municipalities by the state. Several of the source-document budgets listed such payments as
“intergovernmental revenue.” Conversely, some “taxes” such as severance tax and mineral royalties are
included in the summaries as “intergovernmental” even though some local budgets classified them under
the “tax” heading. Second, in preparing the expenditure summaries, multiple departments are grouped
into six categories with descriptive titles that do not necessarily mean only the department with a similar
name. For example “public works” in the table could include the Public Works department, but also
Streets, Engineering, Shops, Building Maintenance, and other physical facility and plant construction and
maintenance activities.
City of Rawlins
Table 3.15-12 summarizes general-fund budget data for three years of recent budgets for the City of
Rawlins. General fund revenues and expenses will effectively equalize over the long term, but there may
be variances in any one year due to inter-fund transfers, contributions to or from reserves, and varying
year-end cash balances. In Rawlins, budgeted revenue was anticipated to increase modestly over the
three-year period, with approximately half of the total revenue from taxes. On the expenditure side, public
safety accounts for the largest share of outlays.

Revenue shortfalls beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2010 necessitated amending the use of
reserves, and cutbacks of more than $1.1 million in city spending to address the resulting deficit. The
cutbacks included a reduction of 16 positions through attrition or layoffs.
The proposed budget for 2010-2011 calls for another $1.1 million reduction in expenditures, with periodic
reviews to monitor revenues, particularly sales and use tax proceeds. If necessary, the city may draw on
its reserve account to preserve essential services.
City of Rock Springs
The City of Rock Springs has an annual general-fund budget more than twice that of Rawlins, with taxes
again the largest single contributor to revenue (see Table 3.15-13). The City’s anticipated general
revenues exhibit substantial year-to-year revenue variability due to transfers and unexpected changes in
local economic activity.
The City’s total budgeted general-fund expenditures decreased by 28 percent over the past 3 years. Sharp
cutbacks in the budgets for public works and parks and recreation accounted for most of the reduction,
while the budget for administration increased by about $2.1 million.

Three school districts could be affected by the CD-C project:
 Carbon County School District #1 (CCSD #1)
 Sweetwater County School District #1 (SCSD #1)
 Sweetwater County School District #2 (SCSD #2)
Figure 3.15-9 displays 1991–2010 fall enrollment statistics for the three affected school districts. All
three districts had substantial enrollment declines through the 1990s and the first several years of the
following decade. Thereafter all three districts experienced enrollment gains in concert with population
growth associated with the increased pace of natural resource development. Enrollment gains continued in
CCSD #1 and SCSD #2 through 2007 and 2008, respectively, but stabilized somewhat in subsequent
years. Enrollment in SCSD #1 has grown steadily over the past seven years, gaining more than 960
students since 2003. Fall 2010 enrollment counts, covering kindergarten through grade 12, were 1,810 for
CCSD #1, 2,635 for SCSD #2, and 5,159 for SCSD #1.

All districts have historically had difficulty finding affordable housing for teachers. The districts have
also occasionally had difficulty in recruiting and retaining maintenance and custodial staff and bus drivers
during periods of economic expansion when labor shortage and the high wages paid in the energy
industry put the districts at a competitive disadvantage for labor (Grube 2007, Sanders 2007, Sorenson
2007).
3.15.6.1 Carbon County School District #1

CCSD #1 serves Rawlins, Sinclair, and the Little Snake River Valley (LSRV), including the communities
of Baggs and Dixon and the Sweetwater County community of Bairoil. Currently CCSD #1 operates two
elementary schools, a middle school, a high school, and a cooperative high school in Rawlins; elementary
schools in Sinclair and Bairoil; and a K–12 comprehensive school in Baggs that serves the entire LSRV.
Additionally the district operates a fine-arts center, a swimming pool, and a sports complex in Rawlins.
The Rawlins Elementary School opened in early 2011. It currently has two learning communities, (grades
2–3 and grades 4–5). The school is designed to allow the addition of a K–1 community. Currently,
kindergarten and first-grade students are housed in the adjacent Highland Hills Elementary School, which
is at capacity. Rawlins Elementary could accommodate an additional 100 students over the 2010–2011
school year enrollment. The Rawlins Middle School can accommodate an additional 50 to 75 students.
The Rawlins High School was designed to accommodate 1,100 to 1,200 students and fall enrollment was
455 students. The high school is an aging and outsized facility that is inefficient to operate. The Wyoming
School Facilities Commission has authorized construction of a new 500-student high school, but the
district believes it will need capacity for 600 students given pending energy projects in the area. Sinclair
elementary is approaching capacity and the Little Snake River K–12 school could accommodate an
additional 40 or more students (Terhune 2011).
3.15.6.2 Sweetwater County School District #1

SCSD #1 serves eastern and central Sweetwater County, including the communities of Rock Springs,
Farson, Eden, Superior, and Wamsutter. SCSD #1 has seven elementary schools, one junior high school,
and two high schools (one traditional and one alternative) in Rock Springs. The district opened the new
Pilot Butte Elementary, a 5–6 grade school, in the fall of 2011. SCSD #1 also operates a K–12 school in
Farson; and a K–8 school in Wamsutter. The district closed eight schools between 1991 and 2003 due to
declining enrollments.
SCSD #1 has proposed to build an additional 5–6 grade school and a new junior high school. Longer-term
plans include replacing the high school. School construction plans are subject to approval by the
Wyoming School Facilities Department.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-181

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

With new and planned facilities, SCSD #1 should be able to accommodate an additional 60 students per
grade in the elementary schools. The new junior high school will have additional capacity, but the high
school is currently near capacity with anticipated increases in enrollment in the coming years. The district
has a plan to relocate a portion of the school to a satellite facility. The Wamsutter K–8 school currently
has enrollment of about 8 to 12 students per classroom and could accommodate up to 23 students per
classroom (Lopiccolo 2011).
3.15.6.3 Sweetwater County School District #2

SCSD #2 serves the western half of Sweetwater County including the communities of Green River,
Granger, and McKinnon. SCSD #2 operates a high school (grades 9–12), an alternative high school
(grades 10–12), a middle school (grades 7–8), and an intermediate school (grades 5–6). The District also
maintains four K–4 elementary schools within the city limits and three rural elementary schools. The
district has closed two elementary schools since 1990 due to declining enrollment.
It is estimated that the four Green River K–4 elementary schools could accommodate a combined total of
an additional 110 students and the 5–6 elementary school could accommodate an additional 20 students.
There is some capacity to absorb new students in the middle school. The high school has a design
capacity of 1,200 to 1,500 students and currently serves about 700 students (Little-Kaumo 2011).

This section describes relevant social conditions and trends within in and near the CD-C project area.
Specific social conditions associated with other users of the project area (grazing operators and
recreationists) are also examined. Information for this section was obtained from over 60 interviews with
community officials, local government staff, business persons, and ranchers; from review of scoping
comments and newspaper articles; and from other secondary sources as cited.
Section 2 of the Baseline STR describes the human geography of the study area, discusses human
settlement of the area, characterizes the communities, and describes the economic influences that have
helped shaped the region and the individual communities. Although these communities share elements of
a common heritage and regional geography, each has its own distinct economic, demographic and social
setting.
3.15.7.1 Common Social Elements and Trends

Over the past decade, the communities in the study area experienced an economic expansion fueled by
energy development in the project area and elsewhere in the bi-county region and in much of southwest
Wyoming, and then a rapid contraction resulting from the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the ensuing global
recession, and falling energy prices. The social effects of the recent expansion and contraction provide
valuable insights into potential effects of the Proposed Action and alternatives on social conditions in the
area.
The recent expansion was the latest in a series of regional economic expansion and contraction cycles
dating back to the construction of the transcontinental railroad but more recently associated with mineral
and energy development. The larger communities in the study area have a somewhat economically
diverse population resulting from the influences of the ranching, energy, mining, and transportation
industries and federal and state government offices and facilities. Wamsutter, Baggs and the other smaller
communities are much less diverse economically. Wamsutter, although formerly a railroad and woolshipping center, has recently become dependent on the energy industry and I-80 commerce. Of the
communities in the study area, Baggs and the LSRV remain most closely tied to the ranching and outdoor
recreation (principally hunting) industries, although a number of residents of Baggs and the LSRV are
employed by or provide services to the energy industry and Devon Energy operates a field office in
Baggs.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

Even during the current (mid-2011) economic contraction there are reduced levels of energy development
activity and in- and out-migration associated with the energy and mining sectors. Communities in the
study area are familiar with energy industries and with the relatively constant stream of newcomers to
these communities. However, during the recent expansion, which began in 2002/2003 in Sweetwater
County and 2004/2005 in Carbon County, economic and population growth occurred at levels not seen
for more than two decades in these two counties. Local communities are in agreement that federal and
state population statistics did not reflect the magnitude of growth and there were no reliable estimates of
the number of energy workers who stayed in communities on a temporary basis.
As a result of the economic and population growth and the presence of relatively large numbers of
temporary and transient, predominantly male workers in these communities, social conditions in affected
communities were changing at a relatively rapid pace. Many of the “boom-town” phenomena (e.g.
housing shortages and escalating housing costs, workforce shortages, elevated rates of certain types of
crime) reported by researchers in the late 1970s and early 1980s once again emerged. Social settings
within the study area such as stores, restaurants, bars, and post offices were increasingly crowded and
from a local resident’s perspective, filled with strangers. Traffic on major streets and thoroughfares in
Rock Springs and Rawlins was often congested (relative to past years), housing prices increased
substantially, and local retail and service establishments had difficulty obtaining and keeping employees.
There were enthusiastic supporters of the boom and just-as-ardent detractors in all communities. But even
some of the supporters lamented the change in social conditions, e.g., “feeling the need to lock their
houses and take the keys out of their cars, entering a supermarket or restaurant and not seeing a familiar
face, having to wait for two stoplight cycles to cross an intersection.” For many, these inconveniences
were offset by the robust economy and the increase in employment and shopping options. Others,
including those who did not benefit from energy development and those on fixed incomes, were less
likely to be enthusiastic about the boom.
Many residents of Carbon and Sweetwater counties value clean air and water, wildlife, wildlife habitat,
and access to and the health of public lands (Blevins et al. 2004, Carbon County Board of Commissioners
and Carbon County Planning Commission 1998, Markert 2008). A key concern for many residents is the
effect of energy development on public lands, particularly lands with high resource values.
Two groups have been directly affected by natural gas development in the project area: ranchers/grazing
permittees and recreation users of the area.
3.15.7.2 Ranchers/Grazing Permittees

Information for this section was obtained in the spring of 2008 from individual and group interviews with
grazing permittees, the Rawlins-based UW Cooperative Extension Area Educator for Range
Management, and the RFO Range Resources Specialist assigned to the CD-C EIS. As discussed in
Section 3.18 Range Resources, 47 allotments are permitted for grazing within the project area. Many of
these allotments extend beyond the boundaries of the project area. The active allotments are permitted for
about 199,000 animal unit months (AUMs) of grazing per year used mostly by cattle, although sheep are
grazed on 11 allotments.
Many of the affected livestock operations that use the project area are locally owned, multi-generational
family ranches. A combination of long-term drought, high fuel and feed prices, unfavorable market
conditions, and the high level of existing natural gas development within the allotments has resulted in
challenging times for grazing permittees, causing some to substantially alter their methods of operation
and even consider relinquishing their allotments.
In the most active natural gas fields within the project area, the predominant land use has changed from
grazing/dispersed recreation to industrial. The project area contains roads with some of the highest traffic
volumes in Carbon and Sweetwater counties, including high volumes of heavy-truck traffic. The high

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-183

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

traffic volumes within the project area produce substantial amounts of dust on all but the major roads,
which have been treated with magnesium chloride.
Natural gas development can affect grazing operations in several ways. Effects include livestock
injury/mortality, reduced rates of weight gain in livestock, increased maintenance of range improvements,
and required changes in livestock management practices.
Heavy traffic during the drilling and field-development phase often results in conflict with livestock
operations. Vehicle/livestock collisions are not uncommon and, although some natural gas companies
compensate permittees for livestock mortality, accidents are not reported in many cases. Responsibility is
difficult to assign in areas used by multiple gas companies, and some service companies are less willing
to compensate livestock owners. Companies are, in general, unwilling to compensate grazing permittees
unless a driver accepts or is assigned responsibility for the accident. Gas-field traffic is of particular
concern during lambing and calving periods, when animals sometimes use the roads to give birth and
newborn animals are less able to move out of the way of oncoming traffic. In addition to animal losses
from accidents, livestock lose weight if they are frequently startled by traffic. Some permittees have
stopped trailing their herds along WY 789, the Wamsutter–Dad Road, and other major county and BLM
roads within the project area because of the high volumes of industrial traffic, resulting in higher costs to
move livestock by truck from pastures on one side of the road to the other.
High levels of gas-field traffic can increase damages to range improvements such as fences and cattle
guards, resulting in scattering of livestock from pastures and introduction of other livestock and wild
horses into pastures. During severe winters, when natural gas company contractors clear snow for some
distance on either side of road surfaces to remove heavy snow accumulations, damage to cattle guards and
sections of fence often occurs. As a result, some permittees are unable to use some pastures in the spring,
which has disrupted grazing patterns and resulted in unbudgeted costs to relocate livestock. Although in
most cases gas companies compensate grazing permittees for repairing fences and cattle guards, there are
sometimes disputes over the amount of compensation, the quality of the replacement fences and
structures, and the timeliness of compensation. It is again difficult to assign responsibility for damage in
areas where multiple gas and service companies are active; grazing permittees lose the use of the pastures
while awaiting repairs, which at times requires an extended period to locate and schedule contractors.
Another concern for livestock grazing permittees is that some gas companies do not notify them in
advance of starting new development within a federal grazing allotment. Consequently, affected grazing
permittees do not have advance opportunity to relocate herds to avoid conflict with development.
Although required by regulation, some drilling contractors do not adequately fence drilling facilities such
as reserve pits, resulting in livestock injury or mortality.
New and improved roads are at times beneficial for grazing permittees in that they allow better access to
pastures and livestock. However, new and improved roads also facilitate higher travel speeds for gas-field
traffic, increasing the risk of vehicle/livestock accidents. New and improved roads also allow more public
access into grazing allotments, increasing the potential for vandalism and disruption of grazing in
formerly remote areas. Some grazing permittees report reductions in vandalism in areas that are actively
being developed, however, which they attribute to the greater human presence.
An oft-cited effect of high levels of natural gas development is the reduction in forage associated with
surface disturbance and infestation of noxious and invasive species when reclamation is delayed or
unsuccessful. In areas where development is concentrated, reductions in forage can be substantial.
Although a portion of disturbance for well pads, pipelines, roads, and other ancillary facilities is required
to be reclaimed within a short period of time, a combination of the prolonged drought and ineffective
reclamation methods has resulted in drill pads, pipeline and road corridors, lay-down areas, and pads for
ancillary facilities remaining unreclaimed or in a weed-infested state for years. In addition to the direct
reductions in forage associated with unreclaimed or weed-infested areas, a substantially larger area is
often removed from productive use as a result of wind-blown dust from unreclaimed areas and roads

3-184

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

which accumulates on plants, reducing palatability and accelerating wear on livestock teeth. The location
of well pads, gathering lines, and roads may also alter surface-water flow patterns, resulting in erosion
and loss of vegetative cover and forage.
The combination of high levels of gas-development activity, reduced forage, and drought conditions
requires substantially higher levels of livestock management for grazing permittees, as they are required
to more frequently monitor livestock condition and movements, relocate livestock more frequently, and
round up livestock that have wandered from pastures when fences and cattle guards are down.
Sheepherders have been required to avoid grazing and trailing their flocks through certain areas and to
find new trails to avoid halogeton infestations, which can be toxic to sheep. Some grazing permittees who
formerly wintered cattle on allotments within the project area have had to truck their herds to other areas
or other states, in part because of periodic drought years but also in part to avoid natural gas activity
during winter months when herd management is more difficult.
Higher levels of livestock management result in higher fuel outlays and labor costs. Fuel costs for grazing
permittees in the project area can be substantial given the distance to the allotments from communities
and home ranches. Securing ranch hands in Carbon and Sweetwater counties during the boom years was
complicated by the regional labor shortage and competition for workers. Some grazing permittees had
difficulty competing for workers with the traditionally higher wages paid by the energy industry. More
active livestock management, including frequent movement of livestock from pasture to pasture or
between allotments to avoid disruptive activity can reduce weight gain in cattle.
All of the above factors result in higher cost, lower production, and reduced profitability for grazing
permittees. In addition, although their allotments are less productive because of activity, disturbance,
weed infestations and drought, their allotment lease fees are not reduced. The reduced profitability is
likely to change the nature of some CD-C area ranching operations and may result in others leaving the
ranching business. Grazing permittees interviewed for this assessment reported reductions in herd size,
potential selling off of herds, and potential relinquishment of BLM leases.
The ranching economy in Carbon and Sweetwater counties is substantially smaller than the energy
economy, but reductions in ranching operations would result in adverse changes in economic diversity in
these two counties. Reductions in ranching operations would also have social and cultural implications for
the study area. Ranching is an important element of the heritage and culture of Carbon and Sweetwater
counties and the State of Wyoming as a whole.
3.15.7.3 Recreation Users of the Area

Substantial changes in the recreation setting within the project area have already occurred. As noted
elsewhere in this assessment, an average of about 239 wells/year were drilled within the project area
during the 2000-2010 period and there were over 3738 producing wells in the area at the end of 2010.
As discussed in Section 3.12 Recreation, hunting—primarily by locals—is the dominant recreation use
of lands within the project area. Some pleasure driving to view wild horses or the Red Desert landscape
occurs near the specific resources and settings of interest. As noted in Section 3.12, the BLM makes
estimates of recreation usage at the field-office level only, so there are no available data on recreation
participation and recreation visitor days that are specific to the CD-C project area. Similarly, the WGFD’s
Hunt Areas extend beyond the boundaries of the project area and the WGFD does not collect statistics for
sub areas; it is therefore not possible to assign hunter activities specifically to the CD-C project area.
Consequently, data are not available to support the estimation of economic effects of hunting or other
recreation activities within the project area. Recreation use in the project area is low overall and seasonal,
with most occurring in the fall during the big game hunting seasons. The BLM generally considers the
project area to be a recreation resource that attracts some non-residents who have special interests (e.g.,
wild horses, historic trails, and the Red Desert) but is visited mainly by Wyoming residents, especially
those living nearby.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-185

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

A combination of local residents, residents from elsewhere in Wyoming, and non-residents has
historically hunted within the project area, although as noted above, locals are the dominant users and the
level of hunting use is relatively low. Adverse effects of existing natural gas development on hunting
have resulted from development activity, traffic, and changes in wildlife distribution and abundance.
Although the current presence of relatively widely spaced wells is not a deterrent for all hunters, safety
issues associated with hunting around natural gas facilities and the change in the recreational setting are
believed to be deterrents for many non-local and out-of-state hunters for whom a natural setting is a part
of the overall hunting experience. Displacement of hunters from the project area could result in increasing
hunting pressure in other areas. There is increasing concern among hunting and wildlife advocacy groups
that development in wide expanses of wildlife habitat and migration corridors will have an adverse effect
on wildlife populations within an area, which could result in a shift in hunting activity away from the
project area.
Some local and non-local groups and individuals value specific areas within and adjacent to the project
area including a sage-grouse lek complex southeast of Creston, the Red Lakes Dunes Citizens’ Proposed
Wilderness and the Chain Lakes WHMA. At the time of this assessment, one well has been drilled in the
Chain Lakes WHMA and several wells have been drilled near the part of the Red Lakes Dunes Citizens’
Proposed Wilderness and the sage-grouse lek east of Creston.
A growing concern is the increasing amount of big-game poaching occurring in remote areas now
accessible on roads improved for natural gas development and an increasing amount of both personal and
industrial litter along highways and county, BLM, and private roads. These effects represent a loss in
environmental amenity values for local residents, recreational users, and non-users alike.
Cumulative effects of energy development on recreation use of the area is discussed in Chapter 5 of this
EIS, but there is increasing concern among local public officials and residents regarding the direct and
indirect effects of the intensive level of current and ongoing energy-related development, including oil
and gas development, pipeline construction, and wind energy and transmission line development across
southwest Wyoming on the availability and quality of outdoor recreation opportunities and experiences.
The potential for adverse effects arise in conjunction with changes in recreational setting, visual character,
noise, dust, increased presence of other humans, changes in vegetation, water quality, and presence of
wildlife.
3.15.8 Environmental Justice
Environmental justice is defined as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless
of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and
enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies (USEPA 1998). EO 12898, Federal Actions
to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, published in the
Federal Register in 1994, tasks “each Federal agency [to] make achieving environmental justice part of its
mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high adverse human health and
environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income
populations.”
Implementation of EO 12898 for NEPA by agency directive involves the following steps (BLM 2002):




3-186

Identification of the presence of minority and low-income populations and Indian Tribes in areas
that may be affected by the action under consideration.
Determination of whether the action under consideration would have adverse human health,
environmental, or other effects on any population.
Determination of whether such environmental, human health, or other effects would be
disproportionately high and adverse on minority or low-income populations or Indian Tribes.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS


Providing opportunities for effective community participation in the NEPA process, including
identifying potential effects and mitigation measures in consultation with affected communities and
improving the accessibility of public meetings, crucial documents, and notices (CEQ 1998).

The BLM standard for identifying a low-income population is the poverty level used by the U.S. Census
Bureau. The standard for identifying minority populations is either: 1) the minority population of the
affected area exceeds 50 percent, or 2) the minority population percentage of the affected area is
“meaningfully greater” than the minority population percentage in the general population or other
appropriate unit of geographic analysis. For environmental justice compliance, the relevant minority
population is the total minority population comprising all persons of a minority racial identity plus
persons of Hispanic-origin and Latinos (BLM 2002).
The minority and low-income status of populations within the socioeconomic study area are described in
the following section.
3.15.8.1 Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations

The overwhelming majority of the project area is extremely rural and sparsely settled due to the
“checkerboard” pattern of alternating sections of public and private land ownership. There are few
permanently occupied residences within the project area outside of the town of Wamsutter, although some
ranch facilities and a few rural cabins and privately-owned lots are occupied on a seasonal basis. There
are no American Indian Reservations, Colonies, or Tribal trust lands in or near the project area.
Table 3.15-16 compares the percentage of minority residents in the project area, based on data from the
2010 Census, with that for two counties in which it is located, the state of Wyoming and the nation as a
whole. The percentages of minorities in Carbon County and Sweetwater County are higher, but not
meaningfully higher, than the statewide average. Minorities were an estimated 18.7 percent of the
population in an area that encompasses the project area, essentially the same as the local county averages
(Carbon County at 20.2 percent and Sweetwater County as 19.1 percent), slightly higher than the
statewide average, but considerably lower than the national average. The Hispanic or Latino population is
the single largest minority group, locally as well as across the state.

The project area estimate is based on data for several rural census tracts in western Carbon County and eastern
Sweetwater Counties, including the town of Wamsutter, but excluding Baggs.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010.

When expressed as a share of the total population, the Hispanic population has grown across these two
counties over the past decade, climbing from 13.8 percent to 16.8 percent of the Carbon County
population and from 9.4 percent to 15.3 percent of the Sweetwater County population. The analysis area
does not exactly match the project area boundaries, but has similar demographic characteristics to the
project area.
Wamsutter had a 2010 census population of 451, 25.3 percent of whom were identified as racial or ethnic
minorities. The town exists in large part due to the substantial presence of the energy industry and
ongoing oil and gas development activity has been largely responsible for the recent population growth.
Thus, the relatively high share of minorities and the increase in minority population in recent years is
indicative of growth attracted by economic opportunity, rather than the presence of a minority population
rising to the BLM standards for consideration from an environmental justice perspective.
3.15.8.2 Persons in Poverty

Table 3.15-17 summarizes the prevalence of poverty in the project area and two host counties that
encompass the project area. For the analysis of low-income population for the year 2000, the local area
that includes the project area is slightly larger than that for the analysis of minority populations because
the level of aggregation of income data available from the U.S. Census Bureau is larger than that for
racial and ethnic characteristics.
Based upon 2000 Census data, persons with incomes below the poverty level represent 10.6 percent of the
population in the analysis area that includes the project area, 1.8 percent lower than the 11.4 percent of
the population with incomes below the poverty level for the State of Wyoming. In comparison countywide poverty in Carbon County was slightly above the national average, while that in Sweetwater County
was approximately 25 percent lower. In part the latter reflects the strong industrial base of Sweetwater

3-188

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—SOCIOECONOMICS

County, while the former is influenced by the location of a relatively large inmate population at the
Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins.
Detailed poverty data are not yet available from the 2010 Census. However, poverty estimates prepared
by the Census Bureau for 2009 indicate a reduction in poverty rates in Wyoming and Carbon and
Sweetwater counties, as compared to those for 2000. Meanwhile, poverty rates rose at the national level
for the same two points in time. The median household income for Carbon and Sweetwater counties also
exceeded the national average, with that for Sweetwater ranking among the top 5 percent within the
nation. Estimates for 2009 are not available for Wamsutter, but the relatively high rates of employment—
much of it in energy-related jobs—that characterize the community are thought to be unlikely to result in
poverty rates substantially higher than the statewide or national averages.

The communities of Rawlins, Rock Springs, Green River, Baggs, Sinclair, and other small settlements are
outside the project area, spatially separated from the project by topography. Consequently, these
communities are not considered likely to be affected from an environmental justice perspective.
The foregoing analysis supports the finding that the low-income population in the project area does not
rise to the BLM standards for consideration from an environmental justice perspective.

3.16

TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS

The primary transportation access to and within the CD-C project area is via highway, although the Union
Pacific mainline railroad across southern Wyoming passes through the project area on a generally eastwest route. General aviation and commercial service-capable airports are located in Rock Springs and
Rawlins, with several other general aviation and private airfields in the surrounding region.
Interstate Highway 80 (I-80) and WY 789 provide primary highway access to the project area. Most
traffic destined for the project area originates in Rock Springs, Rawlins, Wamsutter, or Baggs, making I­
80 and WY 789 the most direct and commonly used highway access routes. Highway access routes are
shown in Map 3.16-1. I-80 bisects the project area and provides access to a number of county and BLM
roads that in turn access both the north and south parts of the project area. WY 789 provides access to the
existing gas fields to the east and west of the highway and has seen substantial increases in traffic during
the last several years attributable to natural gas development and interstate pipeline construction.
Although it is possible to reach the project area from US 287 to the east, this route is seldom used because
of the distance and the connecting roads; these roads are not as direct and are not maintained for gas-field
traffic. US 287 provides access to I-80 for gas-field traffic coming from Casper and other points of origin
north of the project area.
Access within the project area is provided by an established network of Sweetwater and Carbon County
numbered and maintained roads, improved and unimproved BLM roads, and private roads. The BLM

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS

categorizes roads based on existing use or anticipated traffic volumes, seasonal or year-round use, design
vehicle (types of vehicles most frequently using the road), soil types, weather conditions, topography,
construction costs, compatibility with other resource values, and safety (USDOI and USDA 2006). BLM
road types include the following:






Collector roads serve large land areas and are the major access routes into development areas with
high average daily traffic rates. They are usually double-lane, graded, drained and surfaced, with a
20- to- 24-foot travelway. They usually connect with public highways or other arterials to form an
integrated network of primary travel routes and are operated for long-term land and resource
management purposes and constant service. The locations and standards are often determined by a
demand for maximum mobility and travel efficiency rather than a specific resource management
service.
Local roads provide access to large areas and for various uses. They collect traffic from resource or
local roads or terminal facilities and are connected to arterial roads or public highways. The location
and standards for these roads are based on both long-term resource needs and travel efficiency.
Local collector roads may be single-lane or double-lane with travelways 12 to 24 feet in width and
‘intervisible turnouts,’ where approaching drivers have a clear view of the section of road between
the two turnouts and can pull off to the side to let the approaching driver pass. They are normally
graded, drained, and surfaced and are capable of carrying highway loads. They may be operated for
either constant or intermittent service, depending on land use and resource management objectives
for the area being served.
Resource roads are low-volume, single-lane roads. They normally have a 12- to14-foot travelway
with intervisible turnouts, as appropriate. They are usually used for dry weather, but may be
surfaced, drained, and maintained for all-weather use. These roads connect terminal facilities, such
as a well site, to collector, local, arterial, or other higher-class roads. They serve low average annual
daily traffic (AADT) and are located on the basis of the specific resource activity need rather than
travel efficiency.

Within the project area, an existing network of collector and local roads has been developed or improved
to accommodate the already high level of natural gas development and operations-related travel, which is
the dominant use of these roads. In several cases Carbon and Sweetwater county roads serve the function
of collector roads and have been improved by the respective county to accommodate that use. Within the
project area, Sweetwater County Road (SCR) 23S/Carbon County Road (CCR) 701—known as the
Wamsutter/Dad Road—serves as a collector road for the portion of the field south of I-80; SCR 23N,
SCR 67, and BLM Road 3207 serve as collector roads for the part of the field located north of I-80.

3.16.1 Current Government-Industry Transportation Planning Efforts for the Project
Area
Currently, a transportation plan (TP) and transportation planning committee (TPC) are in place for the
Continental Divide portion of the project area; there is no TP or TPC for the Creston portion of the project
area.
The BLM, the WYDOT, Carbon and Sweetwater Counties, and a number of companies operating within
the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II Oil and Gas project area developed a Memorandum of
Understanding (BLM MOU NO. WY 951-99-06-102) to establish a process for dealing with road issues.
The MOU was intended to:
“…establish a process through which governmental agencies, oil and gas companies, private
landowners and other interested parties can meet together to discuss road-related concerns resulting
from project development, to identify potential solutions to problems, and to develop
implementation strategies for transportation. The primary focus of this MOU centers on issues
related to transportation planning including road use, development, maintenance and reclamation.”
The MOU and the recommendations of the Transportation Planning Technical Support Document for the
Continental Divide/Wamsutter II Natural Gas Project (BLM 1999a) resulted in the formation of a TPC for
the CD/WII project area. Since the signing of the MOU in late 1998 and early 1999, the TPC has held
semi-annual meetings to address transportation issues. Recently the scope of these meetings has been
expanded to include operators in other areas of the RFO and cover other issues such as reclamation.
3.16.2 Highway Access to the Project Area
As noted above, two highways provide access to the project area: I-80 and WY 789 (see Map 3.16-1). I­
80 bisects the project area horizontally and provides access to a number of county and BLM roads that in
turn access both the north and south parts of the project area. WY 789 provides access to the existing gas
fields to the east and west of the highway and has seen substantial increases in traffic during the last
several years attributable to natural gas development and interstate pipeline construction. US 287 travels
north from Rawlins at some distance from the project area and at present is used for access to I-80 rather
than direct access to the project area.
WYDOT limits access to state highways to every one-half mile and encourages industrial developers to
use main access points where possible. WYDOT also requires roads accessing state highways to be paved
to the limits of the highway right-of-way and encourages developers to gravel roads for one-half mile
before their intersection with state highways to allow trucks to shed mud from tires before entering the
highway. WYDOT is currently monitoring traffic volumes on WY 789 to determine whether turn-lanes
are needed at major gas-field road intersections.
The underpasses associated with off-ramps at the I-80 interchanges through the project area were not
designed to accommodate over-height or over-width loads. Over-height/over-width loads traveling on I­
80 that need to access areas on the opposite side of the highway must travel beyond the desired off-ramp,
cross the median, and return in the opposite direction to the desired off-ramp. This maneuver requires
three Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers to provide traffic safety services. As many as 13 over-height
vehicles required use of this maneuver on one day during 2007, the peak year for drilling activity,
effectively requiring a detail of three Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers for a full day (Griesbach 2007).
WYDOT measures AADT (annual average daily traffic) and collects accident statistics on federal and
state highways. Table 3.16-1 displays AADT data for segments of I-80 that provide access to the project

3-192

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS

area for 1999 and 2009 and WYDOT’s AADT forecasts for 2020 and 2030 based on extrapolations of
long-term trends. Included in the 2009 AADT is an estimated project area-related AADT of 1,060
(including an AADT of 299 trucks) associated with the drilling of 244 wells in 2009 and operations
activities associated with 3,738 producing wells in that year.
During the 10-year period between 1999 and 2009, increases in total AADT on the I-80 segment between
Rawlins and Rock Springs (both directions) ranged from 8 percent on the east side of Rock Springs to 16
percent at the west side of Rawlins. Increases in total truck AADT during the 10-year period were more
modest, ranging from 2 percent on the west side of Rawlins to 5 percent at Wamsutter.
AADT increased substantially on WY 789 from I-80 at Creston Junction south to Baggs. South of the
WY 789/I-80 junction, the combined AADT traveling in both directions increased by 49 percent and
truck AADT increased by 98 percent during the during the 1999 to 2009 period. Just north of Baggs at the
junction of WY 789 with CCR 700, which provides access to the Creston part of the project area, overall
AADT increased by 86 percent and truck AADT increased by 167 percent over the 10-year period.
As noted, US 287 connects Rawlins and I-80 with Casper and I-25. Total AADT on US 287 north from
Rawlins to Lamont increased during the 1999–2009 period; total traffic at the US 287 bypass on the north
side of Rawlins increased by 106 percent but truck AADT increased by a more modest 6 percent. AADT
south of Lamont increased by 9 percent and truck AADT decreased by 6 percent during the 10-year
period.
Although 2009 was chosen to show most-recently available traffic statistics on the affected highways,
traffic increases on a particular highway segment can be more dramatic as a result of industrial activities.
For example, increases on WY 789 were more substantial between 1997 and 2007, the peak development
year; ranging from an increase in total AADT of 76 percent and an increase in truck AADT of 156
percent south of Creston Junction and an increase in total AADT of 199 percent and an increase in truck
AADT of 225 percent north of Baggs at the junction with CCR 700. The high level of traffic in this area
during 2007 was attributed in part to interstate pipeline construction traffic
WYDOT assigns level of service (LOS) ratings to highways in the state system. LOS A through LOS F
are assigned based on qualitative measures (speed, travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions,
comfort and convenience) that characterize the operational conditions within traffic streams and the
perceptions of those conditions by motorists. LOS A represents the best, or free-flowing, travel conditions
and LOS F represents the worst, or total stoppage of traffic flows. During 2008, the most recent year for
which LOS ratings were calculated, I-80 through the project area operated at a LOS rating of A and WY
789 operated at a LOS rating of B, except for the intersection with Carbon County Road 700 West, which
operated at a LOS rating of C. US 287/WY 220 north from Rawlins to Casper operated at LOS B or LOS
C, depending on the highway segment.
WYDOT forecasts for 2030 indicate that traffic conditions on I-80 from Rawlins west to Rock Springs
will remain at LOS A, except for the segment around the intersection with WY 789 at Creston Junction,
which will fall to a LOS B. Conditions on WY 789 from Creston Junction south to Baggs will remain at
LOS B except for the intersection with Carbon County Road 700 West, which will remain at LOS C. US
287/WY 220 north to Casper is forecast to operate at LOS C for its entire length in 2030 (Brown 2011).
As shown in Table 3.16-1, traffic is forecast to increase substantially on all highways providing access to
the project area by 2020 and 2030, with the exception of US 287 at the Rawlins bypass, where total
AADT is forecast to decline in both 2020 and 2030 and on WY 789 at the junction with CR 700, where
truck traffic is forecast to decline.

3.16.3 Motor Vehicle Crash Statistics on Highways Providing Access to the Project Area
Figures 3.16-1 and 3.16-2 display data for crashes on highway segments providing access to the project
area. As shown in Figure 3.16-1, crashes on I-80 between Rawlins and Rock Springs averaged between
300 and 400 per year between 1998 and 2004, decreasing to 263 in 2005 and then more than doubling to
529 in 2006 and 536 in 2008 before decreasing to 343 in 2010. An average number of 370 crashes per
year were reported in the 13-year period from 1998–2010. Until recently, WYDOT calculated crash rates
for highways based on a formula that considered the type of highway, number of crashes and vehicle
miles on the highway.18 The 13-year average crash rate for the segment of I-80 between Rawlins and
Rock Springs was 0.83, which was lower than the 1998–2007 statewide average for crashes on all
Functional Class 1–Rural Interstate highways (1.10).

Source: WYDOT/Carpenter 2007and 2008.

Figure 3.16-2 displays annual crashes for the 1998–2010 period on WY 789 and on US 287 north of
Rawlins. The number of annual crashes on WY 789 was generally 20 to 30 for the 13-year period except
during 2006–2008 when the level increased to about 40 crashes. The 13-year average crash rate for WY
789 was 1.43, slightly below the 1998–2007 statewide crash rate for all Functional Class 6–Minor
Arterial Highways (1.64).
The annual number of crashes on US 287 between Rawlins and Lamont ranged from 17 to 33 between
1998 and 2006, climbing to 42 in 2007 and 2008. The number of crashes then dropped to 8 in 2010. The
13-year average crash rate for the segment of US 287 between Rawlins and Lamont was 1.21, lower than
the 1998–2007 statewide average for all Functional Class 02–Principal Arterial Highways (1.31).

During the course of this assessment, WYDOT changed to a safety index that uses injury severity and fatal crashes as part of the
weighting. Consequently the statewide crash rates for 2008 – 2010 highway functional classes were not calculated.

3.16.4 County Roads
Numbered and maintained Carbon and Sweetwater County roads that provide access to and within the
project area are shown in Map 3.16-1. Other roads that are not numbered or maintained but which may
fall under the definition of Public Roads as defined by U.S Revised Satute R.S. 2477—commonly known
as R.S. 2477—are not specifically identified on the map. Most of the numbered and maintained county
roads displayed on the map were originally developed for grazing and recreational uses but have evolved
to become primarily natural gas industry access roads. This change in use, both in terms of volume and
load, has resulted in substantial investments of time, equipment, materials, and funds by the counties to
substantially reconstruct and maintain the affected roads.
3.16.4.1 Carbon County

Carbon County maintains about 1,000 miles of county roads. Only one Carbon County road is located
within the project area: CCR 701, the Wamsutter–Dad Road.
CCR 701 (Wamsutter–Dad Road) provides access to the project area from WY 789 at Dad. Traveling
north, the road becomes SCR 23S at the Sweetwater County line and provides access to the Town of
Wamsutter and I-80 to the north. CCR 701 is by far the busiest road in Carbon County. The road is a
19.5-mile-long crowned-and-ditched, two-lane gravel road with a 24-foot-wide driving surface. Initially
developed to serve ranching and grazing operations in the area, the road has been improved to
accommodate the 24-hour/day, 365-day/year industrial level of use that it now receives. CCR 701 is in a
constant state of maintenance, repair, and improvement. During 2006, the Carbon County Road and
Bridge Department (CCRBD) completed a $1.2 million reconstruction of the road including 6–8 inches of
gravel and one-half gallon of magnesium chloride dust-suppressant per square yard of gravel. Given the
constant, high level of heavy and overweight vehicle use on CCR 701, portions of the road must be
reconstructed every year. In 2008, the CCRBD applied additional gravel to the road along with one-

3-196

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS

quarter gallon of magnesium chloride per square yard of gravel. This process was repeated in 2009 along
with reclamation of gravel pushed to the roadside during the preceding two years. According to the
CCRBD Superintendent, the benefits of the annual gravel/magnesium chloride applications are becoming
evident as the program proceeds (Nation 2007).
The lack of a nearby source of suitable gravel with the proper mixture of rock and binder, high fuel costs,
and the need for water for construction, road stabilization, and dust suppression are among the challenges
that the CCRBD faces in constructing and maintaining county roads. In some cases, the Operators and
landowners have cooperated with the county to provide gravel and water for road reconstruction and
maintenance.
Vehicle travel speed, particularly that associated with heavy trucks, is a key issue for road maintenance
and safety on county roads. During 2007, the CCRBD and Sheriff’s Department conducted a speed index
survey on CCR 701. As a result of the survey, the Sheriff’s Department established a speed limit of 45
miles per hour (mph) on the road and 30 mph for some curves. The Sheriff’s department monitors speed
on CCR 701 and issues summons for speed-limit violations (Morris 2007).
3.16.4.2 Sweetwater County Roads

Sweetwater County maintains about 1,200 miles of roads and 23 bridges. Sweetwater County roads
providing access to and within the project area include SCR 23, 20, 67, 80, and 55. These and all
Sweetwater County roads that serve oil and gas industry activities are under a continuous maintenance
program that includes grading and spot gravel replacement and accounts for about 77 percent of the
Sweetwater County Road and Bridge Department’s (SCRBD) annual budget (Gibbons 2007, Radosevich
2007).

SCR 23S (Wamsutter–Crooks Gap Road South) is an 8.2-mile, 24-foot-wide gravel and nativematerial road that provides access from I-80 and Wamsutter to the north and connects with CCR
701 to the south to form a continuous road to WY 789 at Dad. SCR 23S is a heavily traveled
industrial road. During 2007, SCRBD conducted a traffic study at a point 0.5 miles south of the
Wamsutter overpass on SCR 23S and counted a total of 11,729 vehicles during a 72-hour period,
which averages about 3,910 trips/day for those three days. The SCRBD overlaid six miles of the
road with gravel and magnesium chloride during 2007 and the remainder of the road in 2008.
SCR 23 N (Wamsutter–Crooks Gap Road North) is a 44.5-mile, 24-foot-wide gravel and nativematerial road that travels north from I-80 and Wamsutter to the Sweetwater County line. The road is
paved for the first half-mile north of Wamsutter. The 2007 SCRBD traffic study counted 2,792
vehicles in a 72-hour period on the road or a daily average of 931 trips for the three-day period.
SCR 67 (Tipton North Road) is a 24-foot-wide gravel and native-material road that travels north
from I-80 at Tipton to a point north of Luman Butte, just outside the northwest corner of the project
area. This route is divided into two segments. The first segment travels 25 miles north from I-80 to
SCR 20, merges with SCR 20 (Luman Road) and travels west for about one mile, and then travels
about 10 miles north of SCR 20.
SCR 20 (Luman Road) is a 28.3-mile, 20-foot-wide native-material road that travels west from
SCR 23 at about mile 13 near Denison Gap, crosses SCR 67 at mile 25.5 and proceeds westward to
connect with SCR 21 about 3.5 miles west of the project area boundary.
SCR 46 travels west from WY 789 about one mile south of I-80 for approximately 2 miles,
paralleling the Union Pacific railroad right-of-way to the former Creston Siding.
SCR 80 (Tipton Station Road) is a 0.8-mile, 15-foot-wide native-material road that travels south
from I-80 at Tipton and connects with an unnamed BLM road that provides access to lands along
the southwestern boundary of the project area.
SCR 55 (Table Rock Road) is a 4.6-mile, 20-foot-wide native-material road that provides access
from I-80 to a small portion of land at the extreme western border of the project area.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS

3.16.5 BLM Roads
A number of BLM-designated roads provide access within the project area (Map 3.16-2). BLM has rightof-way agreements for all private lands crossed by three of the roads; other BLM numbered roads within
the project area do not have right-of-way agreements in place for all the private lands crossed. Operators
who need to use these roads to access leases must obtain their own right-of-way agreements with private
landowners. Agency maintenance of BLM roads is relatively minimal; the RFO has one road-grader for
1,700 miles of roads in the RFO area. In some cases the operators maintain heavily used segments of
BLM roads.
Most of the BLM-designated roads used to access natural gas development and production areas within
the project area were not designed or constructed to accommodate heavy truck traffic and continuous allweather use. As noted above, operators often improve and maintain roads that access development and
production areas and some have developed agreements with private landowners for road improvement
and maintenance. Dust, excessive speed, conflicts with livestock, and damage to grazing improvements
such as fences, gates, and cattle guards are frequent problems within the project area (Miller 2007).
3.16.5.1 BLM Roads with Right-of-Way Agreements




BLM Road 3207 (Red Desert Road) provides access to the north-central portion of the project
area from I-80 at Red Desert. The road extends about 18 miles north towards the Lost Creek Basin.
BLM Road 3316 (Robbers Gulch Road) travels west from WY 789, providing access into and
across the southern portion of the project area about 15 miles north of Baggs.
BLM Road 3321 (Little Robber Road) travels west from WY 789 for about five miles and
provides access into the southern portion of the project area about 11 miles north of Baggs.

BLM Road 3202 (Stratton Road) traverses the northeast corner of the project area for about 9
miles, connecting with BLM Road 3203 to the west and exiting the project area to the east.
BLM Road 3203 (Riner Road) provides access to the northeast side of the project area from I-80
at Riner, about 14 miles east of Rawlins. The road extends about 10 miles to the northwest from I­
80 before it enters the project area and then travels another 15 miles to the northwest before exiting
the project area. Currently the road is not heavily used by gas industry traffic; rather it primarily
provides access for ranchers, grazing operators, and recreation users of the area.
BLM Road 3205 (Continental Divide Road) travels northwest from I-80 at Continental Divide,
intersecting with SCR 23N near the northern boundary of the project area. BLM 3205 also intersects
with BLM 3239 about 10 miles from its beginning.
BLM Road 3206 (Mineral X Road) provides access east from SCR 23N to the Monument Lake
area of the north-central project area, connecting with BLM 3205.
BLM Road 3208 (Lost Lake Road) travels northeast from its origin on SCR 20 in the
northwestern portion of the project area for about five miles to its intersection with BLM 3237,
which then exits the project area.
BLM Road 3209 (Tipton Road) connects SCR 20 to SCR 67 just below Horseshoe Bend in the
northwestern part of the project area, a distance of about 3 miles.
BLM Road 3210 (Eagle’s Nest Road) connects SCR 23N with BLM Road 3219 in the
northwestern portion of the project area. For most of its length, BLM 3210 is outside the northern
boundary of the project area.

3.16.6 2007 Drilling and Production Traffic
Based on the per-well drilling/field-development and production operations factors used for the
transportation assessment (Section 4.16), it is estimated that during 2009, a total AADT of 1,525
(including an AADT of 629 trucks) was generated by natural gas drilling and production activities within
the project area. As noted in Section 3.16.3, an estimated total AADT of 1,060 traveled on highways
providing access to the project area and the remainder occurred on county, BLM, and private roads within
the project area.

NOISE

The common measure of noise in the United States is the A-weighted sound pressure level that measures
noise in decibels (dBA). The EPA-established standard for acceptable environmental noise is 55 dBA.
Noise levels greater than 55 dBA may disturb local residents and recreationists and could displace area
wildlife. The degree of disturbance depends on the receptor’s distance from the source, noise intensity
and duration, as well as the sensitivity of the receptor.
The human ear is more sensitive to sound in the frequency range 1 to 4 kilohertz (kHz) than to sound at
very low or high frequencies (EngineeringToolBox.com 2011). An A-weighting filter de-emphasizes low
frequencies or pitches and therefore is less sensitive to very high and very low frequencies. Very high
sound levels are more appropriately measured using the C scale. Measurements made on this scale are
expressed as dBC (University of New South Wales 2011); C filters are seldom used (EngineeringTool­
Box.com 2011). Animals tend to hear sound at frequencies that humans cannot; the C-weighted decibel
scale may be appropriate for evaluating effects of some sounds on other species. For example, dogs hear
noises up to 45 kHz, while humans only hear sounds up to about 23 kHz. This means that they could be
hearing and responding to sounds that humans cannot hear at all. Cats can hear sounds as high as 64 kHz,
bats up to 110 kHz, and porpoises up to 150 kHz (DOE 2011).
Median noise levels for the project area likely range from 20 to 40 dBA in the morning and evening and
from 50 to 60 dBA in the afternoon when wind speeds are typically greatest. These levels correspond to
noise levels of a soft whisper (30 dBA), a library (40 dBA), a quiet office (50 dBA), a small town (40–50
dBA), and a normal conversation (60 dBA). Additional noise comes from aircraft, traffic on county roads
and state highways, operation of the existing gas compression stations, natural gas drilling and production
areas, and transportation (railroad and interstate highway) corridors. Existing noise levels within the
project area are for the most part representative of rural conditions and are expected to be between 35 and
45 dBA (Harris 1991), except near county roads and compressor stations where noise levels may be as
high as 65 dBA. Noise may exceed 70 dBA in close proximity to specific pieces of equipment or
operations (Table 3.17.1).
The BLM measured various aspects of development operations in the Jonah Field in western Wyoming
and found flaring activities to be the loudest source of noise followed by drilling operations and
compression. At 0.25 miles from the activity, noise was reduced to below the 55 dBA level (BLM
2006b). Mitigation measures such as hospital-grade mufflers on compressors and flowback separators on
high-intensity flaring operations aid in reducing noise to acceptable levels. Noise levels from traffic along
the interstate typically average greater than 70 dBA (BLM 2005d). Blickley and Patricelli (2010) provide
the following insight relative to noise generated by human activities: “Most anthropogenic noise sources
have energy concentrated in low frequencies (<250 Hz), which can travel long distances with relatively
little energy loss. Such noise is also more difficult to control using traditional noise-abatement structures,
such as noise reflecting or absorbing walls along highways or surrounding other fixed noise sources, such
as industrial sites.”
The 2009 Pinedale Anticline project area noise study (KC Harvey 2009) found noise levels at various
sage-grouse lek locations in the Pinedale natural gas field to be in general compliance with the BLM

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-201

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—RANGE RESOURCES

stipulation requirements, as follows: “Average measured noise levels are all below the 10 dBA above
background threshold level of 49 dBA. Two locations had noise levels below baseline, and the highest
level was 47.4 dBA. Median noise levels are also below 49 dBA level at all measured locations.” Their
observations continued, “Field personnel maintaining the noise meters noticed that windy conditions
increased noise levels noticeably, sometimes to greater than 50 dBA. Since windy conditions are common
in the area, wind noise may contribute significantly to the background noise levels (KC Harvey 2009).” It
can be anticipated that the project area could have similar wind conditions.
The majority of the compressor stations in the CD-C project area may already meet the recommended 55
dBA (with an average day/night noise level of 49 dBA) for noise impacts to sensitive receptors at 0.25
mile (1,320 feet) from the source (Schomer 2005). This standard is commonly applied by the BLM to
compressor stations within oil and gas development projects (BLM 2003).

The project area is sparsely populated and rural in nature with a few small towns scattered along I-80 as
well as a few temporary “man camps” in association with gas development activity in the area. Noisesensitive areas would include private residences, greater sage-grouse habitats used during breeding and
nesting seasons, mountain plover nesting areas, and occupied raptor nests. No noise standards have been
established by the State of Wyoming or the affected counties.
Research into the effects of noise generated by oil and gas drilling and operations on sensitive wildlife
species has not yet been completed.

MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT
RANGE RESOURCES

3.18.1 Introduction
There are 47 allotments permitted for grazing use on public lands in the project area; their locations and
boundaries are shown in Map 3.18-1. An allotment is defined as an area of land designated and managed
for the grazing of livestock by one or more livestock operators. An allotment usually consists of public
lands, but may include parcels of private and other federal or state-owned lands. Allotment size within the
CD-C project area ranges from 120,536 acres (Cyclone Rim Allotment, 10103) to 118 acres for the
Adam’s Ranch Allotment, 10501. Two of the larger allotments (Cyclone Rim and Monument Lake
00711) make up approximately 23 percent of the total land surface area of the project area (Table 3.18-1).
Historical cattle use in this area began in 1871 when Noah Reader brought 2,000 head that were turned
out at the mouth of Savery Creek south of the project area. Later in 1873, George Baggs brought 2,000
head into the valley near the vicinity of the town bearing his name (Baggs, WY). Livestock numbers
increased rapidly until the disastrous winter of 1886–87 which ended the open-range industry in
Wyoming when an estimated 65 percent of the state’s cattle died in a series of extreme blizzards
accompanied by unprecedented frigid temperatures (Bennett 1999, Larson 1942). In the absence of cattle
sheep soon became the dominant livestock in the area and were dominant from the 1890s through the
1950s. The peak in sheep numbers in Wyoming occurred in 1909 when a total of 6,023,000 animals was
recorded (Wyoming Agricultural Statistics Service [WASS] 1995). The total inventory of sheep in
Carbon County has steadily decreased over the years to about 14,000 head recorded in 2006 (NASS
2008). Cattle numbers have slowly risen through the years, with many sheep allotments converting back
to cattle use in the 1960s through the 1980s. The peak number of cattle (all cattle) in Wyoming occurred
in 1975 at 1,690,000 head, compared to 1,430,000 head in 2007. The most recent cattle inventory in
Carbon County was 97,000 head, including 58,000 head of beef cows (NASS 2008).
The affected grazing allotments in relation to the major land cover types within their boundaries are
shown in Map 3.18-1. These allotments, which overlap portions of the CD-C project area, total 1,616,637
acres; approximately 1,050,200 acres (65.0 percent) are located within the CD-C project area. In the
extreme western portion of the project area, the Rock Springs Field Office manages three small grazing
allotment inclusions, totaling about 1,289 acres. A total of five “non-allotments” are located within the
project area with a composite total of about 19,942 acres. The largest non-allotment is located in the area
north of the Red Desert/I-80 exit and mainly consists of numerous private ranchettes.
The 47 grazing allotments (Table 3.18-1) are permitted for a total of approximately 191,746 animal unit
months (AUMs), of which an estimated 123,910 would be available from within the CD-C. An AUM is
defined in the Rawlins RMP FEIS as “a standardized unit of measurement of the amount of forage
necessary for the sustenance of one animal unit for 1 month.” (BLM 2008a). For fee calculation, an AUM
is defined in the Rawlins RMP FEIS as “a unit of measurement that represents the privilege of grazing
one animal unit for 1 month” (BLM 2008a).
Cattle operations are primarily cow/calf pairs. Cattle use occurs during all seasons, including winter use
both south and north of I-80. Winter use depends mainly on the location of the allotment and the
requirements of each individual livestock operation. Each allotment is usually used for one season, or
longer if use is rotated between pastures. Most cattle operators using the project area calve on the range
versus their homeplace.

The establishment and rapid spread of halogeton—a plant toxic to sheep, cattle, and herbivorous
wildlife—in the project area has adversely affected livestock operations, especially sheep. Sheep losses
due to halogeton are estimated to range between 150 to 200 head per year (Calton 2008). Cattle and
domestic horses can also be poisoned by ingesting halogeton. Most livestock losses occur when hungry
animals are allowed to graze in heavy infestations of halogeton. The toxic effect of ingesting halogeton is
due to the high level of toxic sodium oxalates that occur in the plant, especially in the leaves. Halogeton is
toxic at all growth stages but toxicity increases as the plants mature. Herbivorous wildlife have been
observed to consume halogeton but it is believed their highly varied grass/forb/shrub diet prevents the
animals from ingesting a lethal dose (Pfister 2012). Although undocumented, this probably applies to
wild horses as well.
According to grazing regulations that became effective on August 12, 1995, the State Director of the
Wyoming Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is required to develop and implement standards for
healthy rangelands and guidelines for grazing management (Standards for Healthy Rangelands &
Guidelines for Livestock Grazing Management for the Public Lands Administered by the BLM in the
State of Wyoming at: < http://www.blm.gov/wy/st/en/programs/grazing/standards_and_guidelines/­
standards.html>). Standards apply to all uses of BLM-administered public lands in Wyoming and
represent the minimum acceptable conditions for public rangelands. The guidelines apply only to
livestock grazing. The Wyoming standards and guidelines were submitted to the Secretary of the Interior
in July 1997 and were approved August 12, 1997.
The RFO continues to implement or refine Best Management Practices (BMPs) for livestock grazing,
which promote perennial vegetation to stabilize stream banks and improve cover and litter on uplands.
Season, duration, and distribution of livestock are the principal factors in considering management
changes to meet desired resource objectives for both riparian and upland habitats. Specific dates or times
must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Methods to achieve this include, but are not limited to: herding,
pasture fencing, water developments, and vegetation treatments. Vegetation treatments are designed to
restore plant communities with diverse species, age classes, and cover types. The ultimate goal of these
rangeland management tools is to improve watershed cover, riparian habitat, and upland plant
communities to ensure that long-term range quality and national and Wyoming BLM Standards for
Healthy Rangelands are being met.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—RANGE RESOURCES

These standards are the basis for assessing and monitoring rangeland conditions and trends. The
assessments evaluate the standards and are conducted by an interdisciplinary team with participation from
permittees and other interested parties. Assessments are only conducted on BLM-administered public
land; however, interpretation of watershed health and water quality may reflect on all land ownerships
within the area of analysis. The six standards are as follows:







Standard 1 – Watershed Health
Standard 2 – Riparian/Wetland Health
Standard 3 – Upland Vegetation Health
Standard 4 – Wildlife/Threatened and Endangered Species Habitat Health, Fisheries, Weeds
Standard 5 – Water Quality
Standard 6 – Air Quality

In the RFO, rangeland standards were assessed on an allotment basis from 1998 through 2001 (BLM
2001a). The allotments that did not meet Standards due to livestock grazing include the Cyclone Rim
(10103) and Jawbone (00709) allotments. Neither of these allotments met Standard # 2
(Riparian/Wetland Health) (BLM 2001a, pp. 119-120). Other grazing allotments within the project area
that failed to meet one or more of the six standards due to other causes such as weeds, oil and gas
development, and other factors, include Red Desert (00705), G.L (00706), Monument Draw (00710),
Monument Lake (00711), North Creston-West (00713), Latham (00714), North Tipton (00715), North
Wamsutter (00716), Coal Bank Wash (10604), Echo Springs (10607), Fillmore (10609), Riner (10615),
Ruby Knolls (00717), South Red Desert (10619), Tipton (10621), Lazy Y S Ranch (10626), and Chain
Lakes (10722). In most instances, the specific areas that prevented the allotment from meeting a
Standard were small compared to the total land surface area of the allotment and do not represent
conditions over the total allotment.
The recent extensive drought in this area of Wyoming has affected livestock operations in several ways,
including (1) the low soil-moisture levels associated with drought which limit plant growth and reduce
forage yields; (2) the low soil moisture which limits root growth and makes it more difficult for range
plants to reach scarce soil moisture; (3) low germination rates which hamper successful revegetation
efforts; (4) over a series of drought or dry years, a shift in plant species to weedy, less-productive
species (e.g., desert alyssum, halogeton, etc.); and (5) increased livestock medical costs associated with
respiratory diseases attributable to dry ranges and increased dust levels (see 3.6.4, Fugitive Dust
Effects on Vegetation).
3.18.2 Existing Allotment Disturbance
GIS analysis of the project surface area was performed to estimate the total area of existing disturbance
by allotment. The disturbance terminology was standardized to conform to that of Bargsten (2005) with
the exception that all existing roads, pipeline disturbances, gas-compression facilities, storage-tank
complexes, man-camps, construction/pipe yards, etc., were included in the HWA GIS analysis, regardless
of whether or not they serviced an individual well or several. Bargsten (2005) defines short- and longterm disturbance as follows.
Short-term disturbance area: the maximum areal extent of ground disturbance associated with
construction, drilling, and completion of an individual natural gas well, including the well pad, reserve
pit, spoils pile(s), topsoil stockpile(s), and access road authorized to serve that individual well. The
concept is referred to elsewhere in this document as initial disturbance.
Long-term disturbance area: the areal extent of un-reclaimed disturbance after interim reclamation
occurs at an individual natural gas well. This is equal to the “life-of-project” disturbance area and
represents the area, when interim reclamation is complete, that will remain in a disturbed state until the

well is plugged and abandoned. This includes the production facilities, dehydrator, separator, wellhead,
production tanks, and access road area that is surfaced and/or maintained free of vegetation.
The existing initial and long-term disturbance acres of the 47 CD-C allotments are shown in Table 3.182. The disturbance acreage in the five “non-allotments” and the three partial Rock Springs Field Office
allotments was calculated but not used for AUM calculation results. The disturbance percentages
represent the part of the allotment that is within the CD-C project area.

OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

Mineral resources within the CD-C project area include deposits of base and precious metals, bentonite,
gypsum, limestone, uranium, zeolite, gravel, and klinker, as well as oil, gas, coal, and coalbed methane
(CBM) (BLM 2003b). Federal mineral management organizes minerals into three categories: locatable,
leasable, and mineral materials.
Locatable minerals are all minerals subject to exploration, development, and production under the
provisions of the Mining Law of 1872. Locatable minerals include both metallic minerals (gold, silver,
lead, etc.) and nonmetallic minerals (such as fluorspar, asbestos, mica, and gemstones.). Mining claims
can be located for such minerals pursuant to 43 CFR Part 3830. Originally, all minerals except coal were
obtained under the Mining Law of 1872; however, Congress has removed certain minerals from the
operation of the Mining Law. Since 1920, the federal government has leased energy fuels and certain
other minerals. Since 1947, the federal government has sold common varieties of sand, gravel, stone,
pumice, pumicite, cinders, and ordinary clay. Leasables and salables are described below.
Leasable minerals are subdivided into two classes, fluid and solid.




Fluid minerals include oil and gas; geothermal resources and associated by-products; and oil shale,
native asphalt, oil impregnated sands, and any other material in which oil is recoverable only by
special treatment after the deposit is mined or quarried.
Solid leasable minerals are those leased under the mineral leasing acts and those hardrock minerals
leased under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946 (acquired lands), such as coal and phosphates.

Leasable minerals are managed under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended and supplemented.
Mineral materials, also termed “salable” minerals, include common varieties of sand, stone, gravel,
pumice, pumicite, cinders and clay, which are generally put to use in building and construction. BLM
disposes of mineral materials via contract sales where the material is sold by the ton or cubic yard at fair
market value, or provides them to governmental entities or nonprofit organizations under free use permit
pursuant to the regulations at 43 CFR Part 3600.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-209

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

3.19.1 Locatable Minerals
The most important locatable mineral found in the CD-C project area is uranium. The Wyoming State
Geological Survey's Uranium Map of Wyoming (WSGS 2010) shows four uranium mining districts in or
near the CD-C project area. The Great Divide Basin Mining District is the largest and the only one within
the CD-C project area, overlapping the upper third of the project area. Uranium-bearing prospects there
occur in arkoses of the Battle Spring Formation (Pipiringos 1961) that is exposed just west of the project
boundary; in coals of the main body of the Wasatch Formation, north of Wamsutter (Masursky 1962); and
around the towns of Creston and Latham (Harris et al. 1985, Harris and King 1993). The only notable site
of mining claims for locatable minerals in the CD-C project area is located within the Great Divide Basin
sedimentary uranium deposits. Over 80 mining claims have been filed in sections 3, 10, 12-15, 24, and
35, T23 N:R94W in the north central portion of the project area, along the Crooks Gap Road (available at:
http://www.blm.gov/landandresourcesreports/rptapp/criteria_select.cfm?rptId=19&APPCD=2&).
The Poison Basin (Baggs) Mining District lies just west of the town of Baggs and about five miles outside
the CD-C project’s southern boundary. The Ketchum Buttes District lies about 15 miles east of the project
area in T15N:R89W. A fourth district, the Crooks Gap-Green Mountain Minding District, is located about
20 miles north of the project area boundary.
No uranium development activity has taken place within the CD-C project area, but historic activity has
occurred in all four of the described districts and the Great Divide Basin and Crooks Gap-Green Mountain
districts contain several proposed new developments. One, the Lost Creek Uranium In-Situ Recovery
Project, is located several miles north of the CD-C project’s northern boundary in sections 16–20, T25
N:R92W and sections 13, 24, and 25, T25N:R93W. The proposed mine is expected to be in operation for
about 12 years.
3.19.2 Leasable Minerals
Coal and CBM occur in Tertiary and Cretaceous-age geologic formations, and oil and gas occur in
geologic formations of Tertiary, Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, and Pennsylvanian age underlying the
project area. Oil shale resources occur within the Green River Formation in the Washakie Basin;
however, the most geologically prospective oil shale resources of the Washakie Basin occur to the
southwest of the CD-C project area (2012 Oil Shale and Tar Sands Draft Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement, posted at http://ostseis.anl.gov/documents/peis2012/) and so this resource will not be
discussed further in this document. Other leasable minerals that occur within the CD-C project area are
phosphate and sodium. The 2003 Mineral Occurrence and Development Potential Report, prepared for
the RFO RMP (BLM 2003), indicates that the potential for development of phosphate is low. The report
also concluded that the nature of the sodium deposits within the RFO (including the CD-C project area),
in conjunction with the available domestic production capacity, suggests that there is little potential for
commercial exploitation of the RFO’s phosphate deposits. Because the potential for development is low,
phosphate and sodium will not be discussed further in this document.
3.19.2.1 Coal and Coalbed Methane
Fort Union Formation

The Fort Union Formation of south and southwest Wyoming constitutes an enormous, largely untapped
reserve of coal. Coals occur throughout the formation, but are thickest and most continuous in its lower
part (the lower coal-bearing unit) (Smith et al. 1972, Sanders 1974 and 1975, Beaumont 1979, Edson
1979, Hettinger and Brown 1979, Honey and Roberts 1989, Honey and Hettinger 1989, Honey 1990,
Jones 1991, Hettinger et al. 1991).

3-210

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

Within and adjacent to the project area, coal seams of the Fort Union Formation comprise the CrestonCherokee and Green River coals. These coals are best developed along the east side of WY 789 in
T19N:R92W and include about 20,364 leasable acres.
Studies of the Fort Union Formation coals in the project area and adjacent areas have been conducted by
Sanders (1974, 1975), Edson (1979), Honey and Hettinger (1989), Honey and Roberts (1989), and Honey
(1990). As many as ten coal seams have been mapped in the subsurface with individual seams averaging
10 to 20 feet thick, but thickening to as much as 40 feet. Net coal thickness increases in the subsurface
southward toward the Baggs area where it may reach a maximum of about 75 feet. Thicker Fort Union
coals have been interpreted to have accumulated in flood plains above and on the flanks of major
Paleocene-age, south/north-oriented river systems. Thinner coal seams accumulated away from these
main trunk streams.
The Fort Union Formation is a primary CBM target in the southeastern Greater Green River Basin, but
the formation crops out at the surface only in the easternmost part of the project area, so few if any of the
coalbeds that dip westward are buried deep enough to be candidates for development. Deeper buried
coalbeds west and south of the area have ash-free gas contents generally less than 100 standard cubic feet
per ton (scf/ton), but ranging from 9 to 561 scf/ton. Scott et al. (1994) estimated coal gas reserves in the
western and southwestern parts of Carbon County underlying the project area to be less than 2 billion
cubic feet (Bcf) per square mile (mi2) near the eastern margins of its subcrop, to 6–8 Bcf/mi2 in deeper
buried areas north and west of Baggs. These values may be enhanced by migration of gases into the area
from deeper parts of the basin. Based on vitrinite reflectance percentages from wells in the Sand Wash
Basin, Fort Union coals rank as sub-bituminous high volatile C bituminous and high volatile B
bituminous.
Lance Formation

Coals occur discontinuously in outcrops in the Lance Formation from I-80 south for about 25 miles.
Averaging about five feet in thickness, but ranging from a few inches to 22 feet thick, these coals are
thicker, more abundant, and laterally extensive in the lower part of the formation. The coals have limited
lateral extent and usually cannot be traced more than a few hundred to several thousand feet. Lance
Formation coalbeds are minor CBM targets (Scott et al. 1994).
Mesaverde Group

Coal occurs in outcrops in the Mesaverde Group in several places along the western edge of the Sierra
Madre, and exists in the subsurface within the project area. These coals are best developed high in the
Mesaverde Group near its contact with the overlying Lewis Shale in exposures east of the project area,
along the eastern edge of the project area (Atlantic Rim and Green River Coal Fields) and in T15­
16N:R90-91W (an unnamed coal field). These fields include about 230,400 leasable acres. Coals are also
developed sporadically lower in the Mesaverde Group (Allen Ridge Sandstone) but these coals are thin
and discontinuous. Based on vitrinite reflectance percentages from wells in the Sand Wash Basin, the
Mesaverde coals underlying the project area rank as high volatile C bituminous, high volatile B
bituminous and high volatile A bituminous.
Coals in the Ericson Sandstone (a/k/a Pine Ridge Sandstone or Williams Fork Formation) include the
thickest and most extensive coals of the Upper Cretaceous in the Greater Green River Basin and are the
basin’s prime CBM targets. The maximum net coal thickness of about 220 feet, contained in 40
individual coalbeds, occurs near Craig, Colorado. The coalbeds thin in a westerly and northerly direction,
so that in the southeastern part of Carbon County, underlying the project area, net coal thicknesses range
from 40 to 90 feet. These coals are interpreted to have accumulated in coastal plain environments and
fluvial-dominated, wave-modified deltas, along a southwest/northeast-oriented strand (beach) line that
faced southeastward into the Cretaceous epicontinental seaway.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-211

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

Gas content values for coals developed in the Ericson Sandstone (a/k/a Pine Ridge Sandstone or Williams
Fork Formation) range from less than 1 to more than 540 scf/ton, but are generally less than 200 scf/ton.
Based on gas content values, Scott et al. (1994) estimated coal gas reserves in the western and
southwestern parts of Carbon County underlying the project area to be less than or equal to 10 Bcf/mi2
near the eastern margins of its subcrop and 8 to 40 Bcf/mi2 in the extreme southwestern corner of the
county.
Coals in the Rock Springs Formation (a/k/a Allen Ridge Sandstone or Iles Formation) are thinner and not
as well-developed as those in the Pine Ridge and the formation is considered a minor coal-bearing unit
and CBM target. A maximum net coal thickness of 32 feet occurs in the easternmost part of the Great
Divide Basin, but in most other places it is typically less than 15 feet. These coals are interpreted to have
accumulated in a variety of swampy environments above shoreline sandstones and in floodplains adjacent
to delta river channels.
Based on samples from wells primarily in the Rock Springs Uplift, gas content values in the Rock Springs
Formation (a/k/a Allen Ridge Sandstone or Iles Formation) range from zero to more than 650 scf/ton. No
estimates of total coal gas reserves are available for this unit.
3.19.2.2 Oil and Gas

The region within which the CD-C project is located has produced substantial quantities of oil and natural
gas, principally from Cretaceous rocks, but with additional notable resources derived from the Tertiary
Wasatch and Fort Union Formations, and from the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Sandstone.
Developed oil and gas fields within the area are listed in Table 3.19-1. Most of these fields produce
principally from stratigraphic traps in sandstones of the Tertiary and upper Cretaceous formations
(DeBruin, 1996); a few produce from structural traps.
The Oil and Gas Fields Symposium Committee (1957, 1979, 1992), Gregory and DeBruin (1991),
DeBruin and Boyd (1991), and DeBruin (1996) report oil and gas from wells penetrating the Cretaceous
Niobrara, Lance, Shannon Sandstone, and Mesaverde formations in the region surrounding the towns of
Dixon and Savery (east of the southern part of this study area), as well as some shows there from the
Tensleep Formation. The Baggs South Oil and Gas Field and the West Side Canal Oil and Gas Field
(Cronoble 1969; DeBruin 1993; Kaiser et al. 1994) produce oil and gas (largely gas) from combined
stratigraphic and faulted structural traps in the lower Eocene Wasatch, the Paleocene Fort Union, and the
Upper Cretaceous Lance, Fox Hills, Almond, and Lewis Shale (sandstone facies) in T12–13 N:R90–93
W, in the southern part of the adjacent Atlantic Rim CBM area.
Regionally, Colson (1969) reported Tertiary oil and gas production from all Tertiary stratigraphic units
from the Tipton Tongue of the Green River Formation (within the report’s study area), down to the level
of the Cretaceous/Tertiary (Lance/Fort Union) unconformity. In the South Baggs Field in T12 N:R92 W
(south of this study area), oil and gas are concentrated at the crest of a structural high (probably a faulted
anticline) in the Fort Union Formation. Farther east, production in the West Side Canal Field (T12N:R
91–92W) is from the lower sandy interval of the Paleocene Fort Union Formation, also in a structural trap
on a faulted anticline.

3.19.3 Mineral Materials
Mineral materials, also termed “salable” minerals, include common varieties of sand, stone, gravel,
pumice, pumicite, cinders and clay, which are generally put to use in building and construction. Salable
minerals disposition is addressed under the Materials Act of July 31, 1947, as amended by the Acts of
July 23, 1955 and September 28, 1962 (BLM 2003b). The BLM disposes of mineral materials via
contract sales where the material is sold by the ton or cubic yard at fair market value, or provides them to
governmental entities or nonprofit organizations under free-use permit pursuant to 43 CFR Part 3600
regulations. Potential purchasers or permittees may conduct pre-application sampling and testing of a
mineral material deposit per 43 CFR 3601.30 (BLM 2012d).
The most significant salable mineral within the RFO—and within the CD-C project area—is aggregates,
or sand and gravel, occurring in the project area typically as terrace and alluvial sand and gravel deposits
and as windblown (dune) deposits. Mapped occurrences of sand and gravel deposits are found at the
following general locations in and near the project area (2003b):

Also present within the project area are pumice and scoria, near Creston Junction, and baked and fused
shale (known locally as “scoria” or “klinker” but not technically a true volcanic scoria), with several large
deposits in the area stretching from Creston Junction to Baggs. Both are important local sources of
aggregate. Some of these deposits have been developed as gravel pits. Sources on BLM-administered land
are located near Wamsutter (T19N:R95W), Creston Junction (T20N:R91W), and along the Little Snake
River (T12-13N:R90-91W) (BLM 2003b). Several sites on private lands also provide mineral materials.

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—HEALTH AND SAFETY

3.20

HEALTH AND SAFETY

Existing health and safety concerns in and adjacent to the project area include occupational hazards
associated with natural gas exploration and operations, the operation of vehicles on improved and
unimproved roads, natural gas pipeline operations, winter driving and working conditions, hunting-related
firearms accidents, collisions with livestock and big game, and low-probability natural hazards associated
with events such as landslides, flash-floods, range fires, or winter blizzards.
3.20.1 Worker Safety
Health and safety concerns within the existing project area are primarily the occupational hazards
associated with oil and gas development and production activities. Operators and service companies
working within the field are governed by the State of Wyoming Department of Employment Workers
Occupational Health and Safety (WOSHA) program. WOSHA has adopted the federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) general construction program rules and regulations and has
special rules for oil and gas well drilling, well servicing, and special servicing operations.
The project workforce can be divided into two groups: those associated with drilling and completion
activities and those involved in production operations. Drilling services employment categories had a
non-fatal accident rate of 6.8 per 100 employees in 2004 compared to the operations support category
non-fatal accident rate of 2.7 in the same year (U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA 2007). Due to the high
level of accidents (greater than three lost work-day injuries and illness, or LWDII) experienced in these
occupations, oil and gas well drilling is one of the OSHA target industries in a cooperative effort between
OSHA and industry partners to reduce accident and fatality rates. By 2009, these accident levels had
dropped to 1.9 and 2.2, respectively (OSHA Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009). By comparison, all private
industry workplaces reported a LWDII injury rate of 4.0 per 100 employees in 2009 (Bureau of Labor
Statistics 2009).
Natural gas gathering, compression, stabilization, and transmission operations currently take place in the
project area. Most natural gas transmission and gathering pipeline operations are regulated by the U.S.
Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS). In 2006 there were 133 onshore
natural gas transmission and gathering line accidents reported nationwide, resulting in three fatalities and
four injuries; in 2010 there were 92 such accidents including eight fatalities in the transmission line
system (USDOT OPS 2011). The OPS regulations require stringent system maintenance programs,
emergency response planning, risk management planning, and individual personnel operations and
maintenance training for each natural gas pipeline system.
3.20.2 Public Health and Safety
The project area is attractive to local residents as a recreation area for such pursuits as bird and big game
hunting, rock-hounding, and seeking solitude. The area is also home for scattered rural families and their
ranching operations.
The roads within the project area see a wide variety of use. BLM and county roads have historically been
built to the appropriate standards for the anticipated use, as have the private roads in the area. Single-lane
dirt roads provide access to individual well sites and are used primarily by site workers but may be used
by bird and big game hunters. In an effort to protect their employees, as well as the public, the Operators
have safe driving policies in place. The project area is intersected by I-80. This very high-volume
interstate highway provides access to the project area for contractors, drilling crews, production
personnel, and the general public. This topic is more fully discussed in Section 3.16 Transportation.
The OPS regulates some aspects of gas-gathering and transmission pipelines operated in the field and
beyond. USDOT regulations also address the safe transportation of hazardous materials (i.e. condensate,
crude oil, methanol, drilling mud chemicals) on the national roads and highways. The gas produced in the

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-217

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—HEALTH AND SAFETY

project area is generally “sweet,” meaning it does not contain hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and therefore it
does not pose a H2S hazard to the general public or to site workers.
Fire-prevention measures for pipeline and site construction are in place during the summer construction
season. These include using equipment with spark arrestors, welding in cleared areas only, and the ready
availability of fire extinguishers or water trucks in the event fire occurs. The BLM requires extra
precautions in the event of drought or high fire danger.
Local and state emergency responders are annually provided information regarding the location and
nature of hazardous materials that are held in quantities in excess of their regulatory threshold planning
quantity (TPQ) or 10,000 pounds, as appropriate. All Operators and their contractors are required to
supply this information under the Community Right-to Know Laws (40 CFR 355 and 370, as amended).
Each Operator has an Emergency Action Response Plan as well as access to the trained personnel and
equipment needed to respond to releases of hazardous materials or other hazardous conditions in the
project area.
3.20.3 Other Risks and Hazards
Any firearm-related accidents would occur primarily during hunting season. No data were available to
estimate or discuss the likelihood of risk for gas-field workers to be injured by hunters. Risk of humancaused fire in the project area is low.

3.21

WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT

Numerous companies operate within the project area; all Operators and their contractors are responsible
for compliance with all local, state, and federal regulations applicable to their operations for
environmental protection. Different companies have different compliance philosophies, ranging from
minimal compliance to compliance programs that exceed regulatory requirements.
3.21.1 Waste Management
The management of non-exempt hazardous and non-hazardous (solid) wastes is regulated under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (40 CFR Part 260-268) while the management of
releases of hazardous materials into the environment is regulated under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liabilities Act (CERCLA) (40 CFR Part 300-374). Oil and
gas exploration, production, gas-gathering, processing wastes, and releases of hazardous materials into the
environment are generally considered to be RCRA-exempt and are regulated by the WOGCC or WDEQ
and the BLM. All wastes are to be treated or disposed of in an approved manner consistent with existing
laws and regulations (Gold Book, BLM 2007b). Non-exempt wastes will not be mixed with exempt
wastes. BLM Wyoming has established policy regarding the management of exploration and production
wastes (WY 2012-007, November 15, 2011), and the applicable standards from the IM will be considered
and evaluated at the time APDs or Sundry Notices are reviewed by the BLM.
A number of permitted solid or hazardous waste sites in the project area are identified in the WDEQ Solid
and Hazardous Waste Division database. These range from the historic Wamsutter landfill to active
disposal facilities for specific gas-field operational areas.
Non-hazardous solid waste typically includes oil and gas exploration, production, and gas-gathering, as
well as processing wastes and releases of hazardous materials into the environment, and is considered
RCRA-exempt. These materials are variously regulated by WDEQ, WOGCC, and the BLM. Buried
materials may also be present in association with historic homestead locations. Non-hazardous solid
wastes generated from operations are hauled to municipal landfills in Wamsutter, Rock Springs, and
Rawlins.

3-218

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Hazardous wastes are generated in association with some gas-processing operations in the CD-C project
area. These wastes and disposal sites are permitted and managed in compliance with the WDEQ
hazardous waste program regulations.
Non-hazardous trash and debris are collected in dumpsters or trash cages at the individual well sites,
compressor stations, construction sites, and man camps. Trash is also collected in individual containers or
bags for off-site disposal. These waste materials are disposed of in accordance with state standards as
imposed by the county sanitarian.
Drilling Mud – Portions of the project area have been producing natural gas and oil since at least 1958.
Regulations and industry standards for the management of wastes have changed substantially since that
time. Until the 1980s waste materials generated during drilling, production, and processing operations
would typically have been buried near the point of generation within the field area. Reserve pit contents
may have been buried at older producing or plugged-and-abandoned well sites. The disposal of these
materials is now regulated and approved by the WOGCC and the BLM. More recently some of the
Operators have recycled drilling mud between wells for re-use. This practice reduces the volume of
material to be disposed of. Historically, the BLM required drilling pits to be fenced upon rig release and
backfilled within six months of well completion. If a liner has been used in the reserve pit, any liner
material must be removed to below ground-level before being covered. Completion fluids are also
recycled to the extent possible to minimize waste disposal but are generally produced to an open pit onsite
for disposal. Reserve-pit and well-completion wastes are generally classified by the EPA as “exempt non­
hazardous” and are not regulated by the RCRA (40 CFR 261.4).
In the event flaring or venting of natural gas is required to facilitate safe operations, Operators must
comply with the notification provisions of BLM Notice to Lessee (NTL)-4A, which allows the flaring of
gas in emergencies for up to 30 days or 50 MMcf. Longer duration or higher-volume flaring events would
require subsequent BLM approval. Operators must also follow WDEQ Air Quality and WOGCC rules.
Produced water within the project area is currently managed through the use of private and
commercially permitted evaporation ponds and injection/disposal wells. These facilities have been
permitted by the WOGCC, WDEQ, and the BLM as applicable. The specific permitting mechanism
depends on facility ownership, source of produced water, and location. Historically, water may have been
allowed to evaporate onsite using individual produced-water disposal pits; this practice is no longer
common.
Sanitary wastes are disposed of in permitted septic systems for permanent and long-term temporary
facilities such as offices and man camps. Portable toilets are provided for long-term construction, drilling,
and completion operations; these wastes are hauled to municipal sewage-treatment plants for disposal.
3.21.2 Hazardous Materials Management
The affected environment for releases of wastes or hazardous materials includes air, water, soil, and
biological resources that may be impacted by the release in the course of transportation, use, or storage of
the material in construction or field operations. Areas that are particularly vulnerable to the release of
such materials include wetlands, water bodies, areas of shallow groundwater and areas where wildlife and
humans could be directly impacted.
Hazardous materials are used in drilling, field development, construction, completion, and production
operations. BLM requires that NEPA documents list and describe any materials categorized as Hazardous
or Extremely Hazardous that would be produced, used, stored, transported, or disposed of as a result of a
proposed project (IM 1994-081, WY Information Bulletin 1997-011 and IM WY-94-059). This
compilation for the CD-C project can be found in Appendix K, Hazardous Materials Management
Summary. Operators are encouraged to substitute less-toxic yet equally effective products when

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

3-219

CHAPTER 3—AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT—WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

available (BLM 2007b) in all phases of operations. Substitutions are not always available; therefore, it is
acknowledged that hazardous materials may be used in the project area.
Numerous companies operate within the project area; each has a responsibility to comply with the state
and federal regulations applicable to its operations. Different companies have different compliance
philosophies, ranging from minimal compliance to compliance programs that exceed regulatory
requirements. Each company is required to provide the RFO with an Emergency Response Plan that
covers its operations within the RFO. These documents serve two purposes: to ensure that company
personnel are aware of the need to notify the RFO in the event of an emergency involving hazardous
substances, produced water, and/or hydrocarbons; and to verify that contingency planning for such an
emergency is in place. Company documents regarding spill-response planning, Community Right-toKnow reports, Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, and documents containing
other relevant information, are maintained by the individual Operators.
3.21.3 Hazardous Materials Releases and Spill Response
The Operators have trained personnel and/or contractors as well as the equipment needed to respond to
releases of hazardous materials in the project area. Wells in the project area are completed in a number of
different hydrocarbon reservoirs and produce a variety of fluids including condensate and oil in addition
to natural gas and water. There is potential for these produced fluids as well as materials brought in for
operations such as fuel, lube oils, mud products, and completion fluids to be released into the
environment. Releases of materials are reported to state and federal regulators as required. BLM NTL-3A
is the appropriate mechanism for reporting spills (of hydrocarbons, produced water, or other hazardous
materials), accidents, blowouts, or other undesirable events that occur from federal minerals or on BLMmanaged surface; otherwise, spills of hydrocarbon, produced water, and/or hazardous materials are
reported to WDEQ (Section 4 of Chapter 4 of WDEQ Wyoming Water Quality Rules and Regulations)
and WOGCC (Section 3 of Chapter 4 of WOGCC Rules). Remediation of contaminated soils or off-site
disposal of contaminated material is approved by BLM prior to the management action. Operators must
comply with the applicable provisions of the EPA’s SPCC regulations found at 40 CFR 112. These
regulations require secondary containment for mobile and non-mobile equipment as well as some
transportation-related activities that contain oil in volumes greater than 1,320 gallons that could impact
navigable waters of the U.S. in the event the material is released. This rule applies to compressor stations,
drilling and production operations, as well as other activities within the project area. Most Operators in
the project area have prepared contingency plans that will be activated should there be an emergency or
hazardous materials release.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
4.0.1

Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to assess and disclose the environmental effects of the Continental DivideCreston Natural Gas Development Project. The analysis is guided by the regulations set forth by the
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which call for analysis of the direct, indirect, and cumulative
effects of the Proposed Action and the alternatives (40 CFR 1500-1508). Direct effects are those caused
by an action and occurring at the same time and place as the action—for example, the surface disturbance
that occurs when a well pad is constructed. Indirect effects are caused by the action but “are later in time
or farther removed in distance”—for example, the effects on watersheds if a well pad is not successfully
reclaimed. Cumulative impacts are those that result from the incremental impact of an action when added
to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Direct and indirect impacts of the CD-C
project are described in this chapter; cumulative impacts are described in Chapter 5. Throughout the EIS,
the words impact and effect are used interchangeably.
The CEQ regulations also call for a discussion of the significance of the impacts. Significance requires
considerations of both context and intensity. Significance can vary dependent on the setting in which the
Proposed Action and the alternatives are to take place. Each resource section in this chapter includes a
brief description of the considerations made in determining the significance of the environmental effects
for the resource under discussion.
The regulations also direct the resource specialist to describe ways in which adverse environmental
impacts may be mitigated. For the Proposed Action and all of the alternatives, a broad set of discretionary
mitigation measures would be applied when appropriate as a matter of course by the BLM. These
measures are frequently referred to as Best Management Practices (BMPs) and are often applied by the
BLM as Conditions of Approval (COAs) on natural gas Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs). BMPs
that may be applicable to the CD-C project and the standard set of oil and gas COAs applied by the
Rawlins Field Office (RFO) are described in Appendix C. The Rawlins Resource Management Plan
(RMP) also contains descriptions of BMPs that could be applied by the BLM as necessary. Each resource
section may contain additional recommended mitigation measures if the resource specialist determines
that mitigation measures in the standard suite of BMPs would not be sufficient.
The Proposed Action and five alternatives are considered in this document. The requirements of each of
the alternatives apply only to public lands administered by the BLM and to federal mineral estate.






The Proposed Action. The Operators propose to drill up to 8,950 additional natural gas wells
throughout the CD-C project area, on public and private mineral estate, over 15 years, with a project
life of up to 55 years. About 42 percent of the 8,950 new wells would be directional wells from
multiple-well pads. One result of directional drilling is reduced surface disturbance per well bore.
Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling. This alternative (and all the other action
alternatives) would also include up to 8,950 additional wells in the project area. However, it is
assumed that directional drilling would not be used at all―that there would be no multiple-well
pads―and that consequently project surface-disturbance would be greater than for the Proposed
Action.
Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection. The Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative
requires protections and mitigation beyond the measures ordinarily applied for certain resources that
are of high value or may be at greater risk of adverse impacts, such as pronghorn and mule deer
crucial winter range. The alternative also describes surface disturbance and species population
thresholds that, if crossed, would signal the need for still more protections and mitigation and
outlines the additional measures that may be needed.







Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap—High and Low Density Development Areas. This
alternative places a cap of 60 acres per section on the amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance on
public land in those parts of the CD-C project area that have had high-density development. For the
remainder of the project area—the low-density development areas—the cap on surface disturbance
would be 30 acres per section. All prior surface disturbance committed to long-term use for roads or
on-pad production facilities and all disturbance that had not been successfully reclaimed would
count against the cap. Acreage that had successfully undergone interim reclamation would not count
against the cap.
Alternative D: Directional Drilling. This alternative requires that all future natural gas wells on
federal mineral estate be drilled from multi-well pads, which would require the use of directional
drilling technology to reach targeted downhole locations. One new multi-well pad per section (or
per lease if the lease area is less than a section) would be permitted. In sections that have already
had oil and gas development, the enlargement of one existing well pad would be permitted as the
multi-well pad for all future drilling in that section. No new roads or pipeline routes would be
permitted. In sections that have not had oil and gas development at all, one new well pad would be
permitted for all future development. One road and pipeline corridor per well pad would be
permitted. Under certain conditions, Operators may request that an APD be excepted from the
general rule.
Alternative E: No Action. Under the No Action Alternative, it is assumed that none of the natural
gas development activities proposed by the CD-C Operators would occur. The analysis of the No
Action alternative assumes that previously authorized activities would continue but that no new
development would take place under this proposal.

The Proposed Action and alternatives are described in more detail in Chapter 2, Alternatives Including
the Proposed Action. None of the alternatives is designated as the BLM’s preferred alternative. The
BLM NEPA Handbook (H-1790-1) calls for expression of the BLM’s preferred alternative in the Draft
EIS if one exists (BLM 2008c). The BLM does not have a preferred alternative for the CD-C Natural Gas
Development Project at this time. The BLM believes that the Proposed Action and the action alternatives
all have elements that would address the project purpose and need and will review public comment on the
Draft EIS before determining a preferred alternative. A preferred alternative will be designated in the
Final EIS.
4.0.2

Historic and Future Impacts

The CD-C natural gas development project is an in-fill project. This means that future natural gas
development in the project area would be a continuation of activity that has been ongoing there for some
time. Natural gas exploration and development in the Continental Divide-Creston area began in the 1950s.
The Wamsutter field was the first field established in the area, in 1958, followed by the Creston field in
1960, the Continental Divide field in 1964, and the Blue Gap field in 1974. Since initiation of drilling,
about 4,400 natural-gas wells have been drilled in the project area. Map 4.0-1 displays the locations of
those wells. The annual rate of development increased from the late 1990s until 2008 when 304 gas wells
were drilled. Since then, drilling has proceeded at a rate of about 200 wells per year.
This previous natural gas development has generated substantial surface disturbance. As shown in Table
4.0-1, oil and gas development in the project area prior to 2006 had resulted in the disturbance of an
estimated 49,218 acres, of which 8,472 acres remain unvegetated and in use for facilities such as well pad
access roads, well-production facilities, and pipeline facilities. The many pipelines that cross the area
contributed about half the historic surface disturbance—over 26,500 acres. Wamsutter is a major pipeline
hub that serves many natural gas pipelines, all of which cross the CD-C project area. An additional 10,958
acres were disturbed for purposes other than oil and gas development, principally federal, state, and
county highways and roads, but also ranching and agricultural activities. Taken together, these figures
indicate that 5.6 percent of the surface of the CD-C project area’s 1.1 million acres has been disturbed at

some time in the past. Depending on the success of reclamation efforts, about 42,500 acres of that initial
disturbance are in various stages of ecological restoration.
Map 4.0-1 displays the spread and the density of the past natural gas surface disturbance. Individual
sections are color-coded from dark green to red according to the amount of surface disturbance that has
occurred in the section. Dark green represents a section that has seen no disturbance at all; red represents
a section that has had more than 75 acres of disturbance (12 percent or more of the surface area of the
section).
For the most part, the greatest disturbance is located in the same areas with the greatest amount of
drilling. The exceptions are those sections that have major industrial facilities. The past development and
the disturbance have primarily been located in the central part of the project area, along either side of the
Wamsutter Road, south of I-80, and on either side of the Crooks Gap Road, north of I-80. Large areas in
the northeast and the western parts of the project area have seen relatively little development.
Table 4.0-1 also shows the additional disturbance that would be generated by the Proposed Action and
each alternative. Displayed immediately below the figures for the initial and long-term disturbance that
would be produced by each alternative are the comparable figures for the combined initial disturbance
(Combined IN) and the combined long-term disturbance (Combined LT) of previous actions and those of
the alternative.
Adding the estimated 47,200-acre disturbance associated with the Proposed Action to the 60,176 acres
previously disturbed would mean that ten percent of the project area―107,376 acres―would be disturbed
by the time the Proposed Action is completed. To the extent that past reclamation efforts have been
successful and that future reclamation is also successful, a minimum of 3.4 percent―36,524 acres―of the
lands within the project area would remain in an unvegetated state on a long-term basis (the Combined LT
disturbance).
The CD-C project area is managed under the provisions of Federal Land Policy and Management Act for
multiple use. Range, minerals, recreation, wild horses, wildlife, and other resources and uses are
considered in the BLM’s management of the federal lands and balance is sought between them.
Rangeland health assessments are guided by the “Standards for Healthy Rangelands and Guidelines for
Livestock Grazing Management for the Public Lands” (Standards and Guidelines) (BLM 2001a). The
Standards apply to all resource uses for public lands including oil and gas development. Guidelines
provide for, and guide the development and implementation of, reasonable, responsible, and cost-effective
management practices at the grazing allotment and watershed level.
There are two primary watersheds within the CD-C area. If a watershed assessment reveals that a
Standard(s) is not being met, factors contributing to the non-attainment are identified and management
recommendations are developed so the Standard(s) may be attained. When a Standard(s) is failed,
corrective action must be taken by whatever permitted entity is causing the failure. During the CD-C
implementation period, any failures to attain Standards may be due to ranching practices, oil and gas
development activities, other activities that have been permitted, or a combination of many factors. If oil
and gas operators are found to be causing or contributing to non-attainment of a standard, the BLM will
require their participation and contribution to corrective actions that may be required. Further monitoring
and adaptive management may be required from any parties contributing to the problem. This provision
applies to all rangelands/habitat found within the project area. Close cooperation between the BLM, range
permittees, oil and gas companies, and perhaps others may be required to successfully attain any
Standards that are not being met. The environmental effects assessed in this chapter take into account
compliance with the Standards and Guidelines and related periodicmonitoring of rangelands.

Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling, would result in the greatest surface disturbance—61,696
acres—a 31 percent increase over the Proposed Action. When combined with previous disturbance, 11.4
percent of the project area―121,872 acres―would be disturbed by the time Alternative A is
implemented. A minimum of 3.9 percent―36,524 acres―of the lands within the project area, the
Combined LT disturbance, would remain in an unvegetated state on a long-term basis. The remaining
action alternatives, Alternatives B through D, would each produce successively less surface disturbance
than either the Proposed Action or Alternative A. Alternative B, Enhanced Resource Protection, would
generate an estimated initial disturbance of 45,516 acres, 3.6 percent less than the Proposed Action.
Alternative C, Cap on Surface Disturbance, would generate an estimated initial disturbance of 42,955
acres, 9.0 percent less than the Proposed Action. Alternative D, Directional Drilling, would produce the
lowest initial surface disturbance—an estimated 36,499 acres—and a 22.8 percent reduction from the
Proposed Action. It would also produce the lowest combined initial disturbance—96,625 acres—and the
lowest combined long-term disturbance—32,615 acres. Alternative E, No Action, would produce no new
disturbance and thus no addition to the previous totals.
Another indicator of the degree of disturbance that an alternative would generate is the number of well
pads likely to be used to implement the Operators’ drilling plans. The Proposed Action and all the action
alternatives would each permit the drilling of the proposed 8,950 wells but the requirements of the
alternatives would alter the degree to which directional drilling is used and therefore the number of
wellpads. As indicated earlier, the Proposed Action assumes that about 42 percent of the 8,950 wells
would be drilled using directional techniques from multi-well pads. A total of 6,126 well pads is implied.
Table 4.0-2 shows the estimated number of well pads that would be used in each of the alternatives.
Alternative A assumes only vertical drilling would apply so the number of well pads is the same as the
number of wells: 8,950. Under Alternative D, it is estimated that virtually all wells drilled to federal
mineral estate would be drilled from a multi-well pad, with the construction of an estimated 4,032 well
pads, a 34.2 percent reduction from the Proposed Action. The relative distribution of vertical and
directional wells on private and state minerals would remain unchanged.

The amount of surface disturbance generated by the project is an important indicator of the overall level
of direct impacts that would be produced. This figure is directly related to the soils, watershed, and
vegetation impacts that would result from the project. The number of well pads used to drill out the
project is also an important indicator, not only because it is a major determinant of the amount of surface
disturbance needed, but also because it indicates the number of sites that will be disturbed and the degree
to which the landscape would be fragmented by the well sites and the access roads to them. Each
disturbance site is also the focal point of impacts that extend outward from the site and the fewer the
number of sites, the less these impacts would be felt. The presence of industrial facilities, in particular the
noise and the regular human activity associated with the sites, alters the way that the surrounding
landscape serves as wildlife habitat. For example, not only is browse and forage removed by construction
of a well pad, but access to forage may be inhibited by the noise, activity, and dust produced around a
well pad. The impact may differ for each species. In terms of wildlife impacts, the effect is generally
captured by the term “habitat fragmentation.” It is not just a wildlife phenomenon, however, as the same

factors apply to visual and recreation resources, grazing management, watershed management, and other
resources.
Past disturbance is a direct indicator of the degree to which environmental and human resources in the
project area have already been affected. It represents changes to the visual environment, wildlife habitat,
transportation system, recreation, and other resources that are already in place. Unlike analyses of other
projects where there has been little or no prior development, the impact analysis of future development in
the CD-C project area must be described in the context of the substantial impacts that have already
occurred.
Two examples illustrate the ways in which the analysis of future impacts can be altered by impacts that
have already taken place.


Visual impacts are generally discussed in terms of the degree to which a proposal would alter the
natural visual environment. In the case of the CD-C project area, past development has already
introduced a substantial industrial element into many viewsheds in the area. This is reflected in the
Rawlins RMP’s current classification of its visual resources and therefore the level of landscape
change future actions would be allowed to have. The Rawlins RMP’s current land classifications
(expressed as Visual Resource Management, or VRM, classes) are the basis for the visual resources
analysis presented in this chapter (see Section 3.11.3).
The transportation system and the traffic it carries is often a major cause of environmental impacts
produced by a natural gas development project. In the CD-C project area, most of the collector and
arterial roads and many of the local roads that would be needed for full-field development have
already been constructed and are in use. This means that the disturbance associated with future road
construction would be substantially less than if the infrastructure were not already in place. On the
other hand, the wildlife habitat fragmentation and disturbance associated with natural-gas access
roads and traffic is already a fact in much of the area. The analysis of impacts on wildlife reflects
this existing state.
Distribution and Density of Future Impacts

The Proposed Action does not define the specific locations of any natural gas wells or associated facilities
proposed for the CD-C project area. The analysis of impacts described in this chapter assumes that facility
construction and well-drilling could occur anywhere within the project area and that all parts of the area
would be affected. However, the historic development in the project area provides an indicator as to the
likely spatial distribution and density of future development.
Map 4.0-2 shows the locations of natural gas wells drilled to date in the CD-C project area and the
current well spacing designated by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC)
throughout the project area. Spacing refers to the spatial density of wells per section (640 acres)
producing from the same reservoir, usually stated in terms of acres. It is a formal designation that has
been approved by the WOGCC. In Map 4.0-2, the currently approved spacing in the yellow areas is 160
acres, meaning one well is permitted in each 160-acre parcel. Currently approved spacing in the orange
areas is 80 acres (one well per 80 acres) and in the red areas is 40 acres, with a variant in some parcels—
pink—that is about 60 acres.
Spacing designations refer not to the number of surface locations of the wells (well pads) but to the
number of down-hole (bottom-of-hole) locations. Thus, an 80-acre spacing that allowed for eight wells
per section could result in as many as eight well pads or as few as one, if all wells were drilled from the
same pad. If all wells in this example were drilled from their own individual pad, 50 or more acres of
surface disturbance could result (at 6.3 acres of disturbance per well pad). However, with application of
directional drilling techniques, perhaps only one or two surface locations (well pads) per section would be
needed, and the resultant surface disturbance could be 20 acres or less. A central feature of Alternatives C

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—INTRODUCTION

and D is the effort to constrain the number of surface locations used to achieve the down-hole locations
rather than the number of down-hole well locations.
Generally, spacing units reflect the judgment of the Operators—with WOGCC concurrence—as to the
number of wells that would be required to efficiently develop and recover the natural gas resource in an
area. It is not uncommon to begin development of a field with relatively low well spacing, e.g., one well
per 160 acres, and then seek approval from WOGCC for “tighter” spacing to 80 acres, 40 acres, or less, as
production occurs and more is learned about the gas reservoir. As the map shows, the “tightest” spacing is
in the areas with the greatest number of wells. As the CD-C’s natural gas resource was developed over the
last six decades, operators determined that more wells would be needed to fully recover the gas and so
more dense spacing was sought by the operators and approved by the WOGCC.
The analysis of impacts in the CD-C project area assumes that the spacing units depicted in Map 4.0-2
would likely be realized as the area’s natural gas resource is developed. That means that at full
development, in areas with 40-acre spacing, there would be one well every 40 acres, or 16 wells per
section. Areas with 80-acre spacing would have eight wells per section and areas with 160-acre spacing
would have four wells per section. In general terms, that would result in the most intense future
development occurring on either side of the Wamsutter and Crooks Gap Roads in the central part of the
CD-C project area as those areas that have seen the most development to date are “filled in.” The areas
surrounding this area of intense development would also be “filled-in” but with lower density: eight wells
per section. The remainder of the project area would see less-intense development with its 160-acre
spacing, or potentially four wells per section.
The analysis assumption anticipates that, as development proceeds, some operators are likely to conclude
that full development of the natural gas resource in certain parts of the CD-C project area requires tighter
spacing. In those cases, they would request a reduction from 160-acre spacing to 80-acre spacing, or from
80-acre to 40-acre spacing, with well densities increasing from four to eight wells per section or from
eight to 16 wells per section. The areas where this might occur cannot be predicted but such increases in
density are within the scope of the analysis.
While the same number of wells is proposed for the Proposed Action and Alternatives A through D, the
disturbance area for each would vary according to the degree to which directional drilling is pursued.
Directional drilling allows more than one well to be drilled at a location, resulting in an estimated average
initial disturbance of 2.45 acres per well bore, including both an allowance for the well pad and for the
access road to the location. For a vertically drilled well, the estimated initial disturbance would be 6.3
acres per well, including well pad and access road. The total estimated disturbance for each alternative is
shown in Table 4.0-1. Since Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling, has no directional drilling, it
has the highest total surface disturbance, an estimated 61,696 acres. The Proposed Action, with an
estimated 42-percent directional drilling component, would produce an initial surface disturbance of
47,200 acres. Alternatives B through D have successively less surface disturbance as the amount of
directional drilling increases with each. Alternative E, No Action, would have no drilling and no surface
disturbance at all.

PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

4.1
4.1.1

GEOLOGY
Introduction

Of the geological features described in Section 3.1 Geology, the surface environment would be impacted
by the Proposed Action and the action alternatives, affecting the geology of the CD-C project area and
causing mass movement, a geological hazard. Removing vegetation and soils could lead to altered
hydrology, decreased infiltration rates, and increased overland flow rates. Unmitigated, accelerated
erosion could cause gullying in some areas and rapid deposition or siltation in other areas with associated
erosion effects. Mass movements, including landslides, could be triggered in areas that become oversteepened by erosional removal of slope-supporting material. Altering existing topography, particularly
by steepening slopes, could also trigger mass movements and accelerated erosion.
The magnitude of impacts to the geology and associated geological hazards in the project area would be
reduced by the implementation of mitigation measures for geology, soils, vegetation, and water resources
as described in Appendix C.
4.1.2

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes no management objectives or significance criteria for
geology.
The following significance criterion for geology was adapted from the Atlantic Rim Field Development
Natural Gas Development Project Final EIS (BLM 2006a):
1. Impacts to geology would be significant if project implementation results in increased runoff and
erosion that leads to mass movement (including landsliding), subsidence, flooding, or increased
deposition or siltation that alters the landscape.
4.1.3
4.1.3.1

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Impacts Common to All Action Alternatives

Impacts could occur to the geologic environment caused by project implementation and operation (e.g.,
alteration of existing topography, initiation of mass movements, including landslides). Impacts could
occur to project facilities as a result of inherent geologic hazards. The likelihood of these impacts
occurring as a result of project implementation is remote, particularly with adoption of the mitigation
measures for geology, soils, vegetation, and water resources described in Appendix C and adherence to
Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ) and WOGCC requirements. The potential for
impacts depends on where surface disturbance occurs and the total amount and distribution of disturbance
both spatial and temporally.
4.1.3.2

Proposed Action and Alternatives

Impacts to the geological environment would be more likely with alternatives that have the greatest
amount of concentrated (spatially and temporally) surface disturbance. The Proposed Action and the
Alternatives would result in differing amounts of initial and long-term ground disturbance, largely
because of varying numbers of wells drilled directionally from multiple-well pads. The Proposed Action,
with mixed vertical and directional drilling, would produce 47,200 acres of disturbance. Alternative A has
only vertical drilling and consequently would result in an estimated 61,696 acres of disturbance, a 30­
percent increase (Table 4.0-1). Because surface disturbance would be greater, Alternative A would have a
greater chance of impacting the geological environment. Alternatives B, C, and D would each have

4-10

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—GEOLOGY

decreasing levels of surface disturbance and hence decreasing risks of impact. Alternative E, No Action,
would have no potential for impacts. With application of appropriate mitigation measures, the
significance criterion would not be met.
4.1.4

Impact Summary

While the likelihood of geological impacts occurring as a result of project implementation is remote, the
Proposed Action and all of the alternatives have the potential for direct and indirect impacts to geology to
the extent that the ground is disturbed by development activities. Successful application of mitigation
measures described in Appendix C would minimize the risk of those impacts occurring and remove the
likelihood of meeting the significance criterion.
4.1.5

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Mitigation measures for geology, soils, vegetation, and water resources described in Appendix C would
avoid or minimize impacts to the surface geologic environment and lessen the possibility of mass
movement and flooding; therefore, no additional mitigation measures are necessary.

4.2
4.2.1

PALEONTOLOGIC RESOURCES
Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes the following management objectives associated with
paleontology:


Identify paleontological resources by defining priority inventory areas based on probability of
occurrence of high-value resources.
 Assess the need for project or site-specific treatment plans or other protective measures in areas of
high risk for development or at high risk for adverse effects.
 Develop, maintain, and encourage opportunities for scientific research of paleontological resources.
 Provide educational opportunities and public outreach programs.
 Develop and maintain interpretation of paleontological resources in areas of high public interest and
access.
Impacts to paleontological resources would be considered significant if the following were to occur:
1. An action or development causes substantial direct or indirect damage or destruction to important
paleontological resources.
4.2.2
4.2.2.1

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Impacts Common to All Action Alternatives

Excavation of pipeline trenches and construction of well pads, access roads, and ancillary facilities
associated with the Proposed Action or its alternatives could result in the exposure and possible
destruction of paleontological resources (frequently referred to here as fossils or fossil resources), either
directly as a consequence of construction or indirectly as a result of increased erosion rates. Increased
access resulting from development may increase the visibility of fossil resources and lead to increased
illegal fossil collection. The potential for impacts increases in areas where geological formations rated as
having a moderate to very high PFYC (3, 4, or 5) are exposed at the surface or shallow enough to be
affected by excavation. The CD-C project area is underlain by geological units that have a moderate to
very high potential of producing scientifically important fossils. These units (with their PFYC in
parentheses) include the Battle Spring (3), Fort Union (3), Green River (5) and Wasatch (5) formations.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-11

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—GEOLOGY

Excavation of pipelines and construction of other project facilities could also result in the discovery of
new paleontological resources. If these newly discovered resources are properly recovered and catalogued
into the collections of a museum repository, the Proposed Action and its alternatives could result in a
better understanding and knowledge of this resource. In addition, increased access would allow easier
access by professional, permitted paleontologists and geologists, who hope to make scientifically
significant discoveries.
Implementation of mitigation measures described in Appendix C would lessen the chance that
scientifically important fossils would be damaged or destroyed directly or indirectly. The Paleontological
Resource Preservation Act (PRPA) described in Section 3.2.1 broadened the guidance for surveying for
paleontological resources and mitigating potential impacts. That guidance is captured in BLM Instruction
Memorandum [IM] No. 2009-011, Assessment and Mitigation of Potential Impacts to Paleontological
Resources (BLM 2008d). The IM is summarized here and is included in its entirety in Appendix D,
Paleontological Resources Program Guidance.
IM 2009-011 calls for the BLM to assess the possible effects on paleontological resources of all
proposed surface-disturbing activities on public lands or split-estate lands. If the assessment indicates
“(a) the presence or high probability of occurrence of vertebrate fossils or uncommon nonvertebrate
fossils (PFYC Class 4 or 5), or that the probability is unknown (Class 3), in the area of a proposed
federal action or transfer of title, and (b) a reasonable probability that those resources will be
adversely affected by the proposed action,” then measures such as a field survey, onsite monitoring,
special stipulations, avoidance, or other mitigation may be required.

The preferred mitigation technique is to change the project location based on the results of the field
survey. Monitoring may be required as part of overall mitigation for a project, arising out of the
NEPA process, or upon the discovery of paleontological resources during project activities. The
purpose of onsite monitoring is to assess and collect any previously unknown fossil material
uncovered during the project activities or soon after surface-disturbing actions.
4.2.2.2

Proposed Action and Alternatives

Impacts to paleontological resources would be more likely with alternatives that have the greatest amount
of concentrated surface disturbance, both spatially and temporally. The Proposed Action and the
alternatives would result in differing amounts of initial and long-term ground disturbance, largely because
of varying numbers of wells drilled directionally from multiple-well pads. The Proposed Action, with
mixed vertical and directional drilling, would produce 47,200 acres of disturbance. Alternative A would
have only vertical drilling and consequently would result in an estimated 61,696 acres of disturbance, a
30-percent increase (Table 4.0-1). Alternatives B, C, and D would each have decreasing levels of surface
disturbance—with 45,516 acres, 42,955 acres, and 36,449 acres respectively—and hence decreasing risks
of impact. Because surface disturbance would be greater, Alternative A would have the greatest chance of
impacting paleontological resources. Under Alternative E, No Action, no paleontological impacts would
occur in the CD-C project area. With application of appropriate mitigation measures, the significance
criterion would not be met.
4.2.3

Impact Summary

Implementation of the Proposed Action or the alternatives has the potential to impact paleontological
resources to the extent that the ground is disturbed by development activities. Successful application of
mitigation measures described in Appendix C and Appendix D would minimize and mitigate these
impacts and remove the possibility of causing substantial direct or indirect damage or destruction to
important paleontological resources. The significance criterion would not be met.

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Because the potential for substantial adverse impacts on important paleontological resources would be
minimized by the mitigation measures described in Appendix C and in Appendix K, no additional
mitigation measures would be necessary.

4.3.1

SOILS
Introduction

Impacts to the soil resource resulting from construction and installation of well pads and wells, access
roads, pipelines, and compressor stations include the removal of vegetation and soil, exposure of soil, soil
compaction, and undesirable mixing of soil horizons. In addition, saline and/or sodic soil conditions could
be created from the release of fracturing fluids, drilling fluids, or produced water. These impacts could
subsequently result in a loss of soil productivity, increased susceptibility of the soil to wind and water
erosion, increased surface runoff, increased sedimentation and elevated salt loads within project area
water resources, and the spread of invasive/noxious plants.
4.3.2

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) lists the following management objectives associated with the soil
resource:



Soils should be stable and allow for water infiltration to provide for optimal plant growth and
minimal surface runoff.
Soil productivity should be maintained.

The following criteria serve as a basis to assess the intensity, duration, and magnitude of soil impacts
associated with implementation of the Proposed Action and action alternatives. Soil impacts would be
considered significant if:
Soil productivity is reduced to a level that prevents the disturbed area from recovering to predisturbance soil/vegetation productivity levels;
2. Reclamation monitoring does not indicate a trajectory towards success within two to five years of
reclamation; or
3. Disturbed areas are not adequately stabilized to reduce soil erosion, surface runoff, and associated
impacts to water quality.

4.3.3

Direct and Indirect Impacts

Impacts to the soil resource under the Proposed Action and all alternatives include removal of vegetation
and soil, exposure of soil, soil compaction, undesirable mixing of soil horizons, and the creation of saline
and/or sodic soil conditions.
Removal of Vegetation and Soil Resulting in Exposure of Soil. Removal of vegetation and soil during
construction and production activities, and the subsequent exposure of the soil, can lead to increased
susceptibility to erosion and loss of soil productivity. Soils are more susceptible to erosion if they are not
protected by vegetation cover or are left exposed to wind or water flow. This is exacerbated during
intensive storm events, floods, or drought conditions. Removal of vegetation and litter from the
construction/production sites removes organic material that eventually could become soil organic matter.
Loss of topsoil, from removal during construction or production activities or from erosion, can result in
the loss or reduction of soil organisms, viable seed-bank, and soil nutrients. Finally, exposed soils are
more susceptible to invasive plant establishment. The effects of vegetation and soil removal and exposed
soils can be minimized through the implementation of proper soil-salvaging techniques and prompt

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOILS

attention to soil stabilization (see the Rawlins RMP Record of Decision (ROD), Appendix 36 [BLM
2008b]).
Soil Compaction. Soil compaction from construction and production activities on the disturbed areas can
reduce soil productivity and increase surface runoff. Soil compaction affects soil structure and reduces
pore size. Excessive compaction can lead to reduced water infiltration into the soil and reduced
permeability of water through the soil; reduced diffusion of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other gases into
and out of the soil; reduced plant-root penetration; and reduced plant growth and production. The effects
of compaction can be reduced at the time of reclamation through sound site-preparation practices,
including ripping.
Undesirable Mixing of Soil Horizons. Loss of soil productivity could result when construction and
production activities disturb the soil resource. The mixing of soil horizons, where subsurface soil horizons
are brought to the surface and mix with or replace surface-soil horizons, can result in less biologically
productive surface soils. Soil-horizon mixing can result in elevated soil pH, increased soil salinity, higher
sodium and calcium carbonate concentrations, decreased levels of soil nutrients and organic matter, and
altered soil structure, texture, and rock content. The effects of soil mixing can be minimized or eliminated
through proper soil salvaging (see the Rawlins RMP ROD, Appendix 36 [BLM 2008b]).
Creation of Saline/Sodic Soil Conditions. Spilled fracturing fluids, drilling fluids, and produced water
could lead to loss of soil productivity through the creation of saline/sodic soil conditions at production
facilities during construction and production activities. Depending on the size and type of spill, the effect
on soils would vary considerably. Saline soils can interfere with plant germination and growth, and sodic
soils can become hard and crusted with effects similar to those of compacted soils. The effects of spilled
fracturing fluids, drilling fluids, and produced water can be minimized through proper implementation of
the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan, and the use of approved disposal
methods for produced water.
While the types of soil impacts would be similar for the Proposed Action and the action alternatives, the
impacts of each alternative would vary according to the amount of surface disturbance and the
effectiveness of reclamation efforts. Impacts to soils are assumed to be proportional to the amount of new
surface disturbance for each alternative (i.e., increased disturbance would result in a proportionate
increase in adverse impacts to soils). To a great extent, the amount of surface disturbance is directly
correlated with the degree to which directional drilling is pursued in an alternative, since directional
drilling results in an estimated average initial disturbance of 2.45 acres per well bore, including well pad
and access road, while the average vertical well produces 6.3 acres of initial disturbance. Section 4.0.2,
Historic and Future Impacts, in Table 4.0-1, provides detailed information on the estimated disturbance
by alternative. Section 4.0.2 also describes the extent of past surface disturbance in the CD-C project area.
Historic disturbance in the area amounts to an estimated 60,176 acres, almost 82 percent—49,218 acres—
of which is related to historic oil and gas development. All of the surface disturbance and soil impacts
described in the subsections below would be in addition to those that have already occurred.
In general, the extent of impacts to the soil resource would be greatly influenced by the success of
mitigation and reclamation efforts. Emphasis would be placed on the stabilization of disturbed soils,
particularly via the establishment of vegetative ground-cover during the first growing season following
disturbance. Reclamation potential of soils in the CD-C project area is primarily poor with major
limitations being saline/sodic soil conditions and either clayey or sandy soil textures (Table 3.3-1). In
addition to these soil limitations, low annual precipitation of 10–14 inches in conjunction with erosion by
wind and water could make successful reclamation more difficult to attain. Revegetation may be
challenging on the estimated 75 percent of the project area indicated as possessing fair or poor
reclamation potential (Table 3.3-1). However, current technology exists to stabilize disturbances,
minimize erosion, and increase reclamation success provided that construction, maintenance, and

4-14

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOILS

operation of well pads and associated disturbances are in accordance with planned mitigation measures
and reclamation.
For the Proposed Action and Alternatives, strict adherence to the Rawlins RMP and required Conditions
of Approval and Best Management Practices (Appendix C) is vital to minimize impacts to sensitive soils.
Included in the RMP guidance are Appendix 1 – Wyoming Bureau of Land Management Mitigation
Guidelines for Surface Disturbing and Disruptive Activities, Appendix 13 – Reducing Nonpoint Source
Pollution with Best Management Practices, Appendix 15 – Best Management Practices for Reducing
Surface Disturbance and Disruptive Activities, and Appendix 36 – Reclamation Plan (BLM 2008b). In
accordance with RMP Appendix 36, each Operator will be required to develop and submit to the BLM for
approval a site specific reclamation plan for each well location that describes how the Operator will
achieve the following goals for interim and final reclamation (found in Instruction Memorandum No.
WYD-03-2011-002):






Protection of existing native vegetation;
Minimal disturbance of existing environment;
Soil stabilization through establishment of ground cover;
Establishment of native vegetation consistent with land use planning; and
Monitoring and management of the reclamation sites to evaluate reclamation success.

Full and successful implementation of the above measures would insure that none of the three
significance criteria would be exceeded. Soil productivity would not be reduced such that pre-disturbance
conditions could not be recovered, the reclamation trajectory would be toward success, and disturbed
areas would be adequately stabilized. Failure to successfully implement the required measures could
produce significant impacts.
4.3.3.1

Proposed Action

The Proposed Action would result in adverse soil impacts including the removal of vegetation and soil
resulting in exposure to erosion, soil compaction, undesirable mixing of soil horizons, and creation of
saline/sodic soil conditions, directly related to the amount of surface disturbance that would occur. Initial
(short-term) soil disturbance associated with the construction and operation of 8,950 natural gas wells,
associated access roads and related facilities is estimated at 47,200 acres (Table 4.0-1). This disturbance
comprises 4.4 percent of the total project area. Combined with the historic disturbance of 60,176 acres, 10
percent of the surface of the CD-C project area would be affected. The initial CD-C project-related
disturbance is considered temporary, as successful interim reclamation is expected to reduce the average
drill-pad size (including access road) to approximately 40 percent of the initial disturbance area.
Therefore, during the life of the project (45 to 55 years), the long-term disturbance area is expected to
decrease to 18,861 acres, or 1.8 percent of the total project area.
The soils assessment described in Chapter 3 ranked the project area soil limitations related to wind
erosion, water erosion, runoff potential, road construction potential, and reclamation success (Table 3.31). The current number of wells drilled in each of the rating class areas for each limitation was also
summarized in the table.
The distribution of soil limitations for the Proposed Action, assuming that future drilling would occur at
the same spatial distribution as current wells drilled, is provided in Table 4.3-1. For the 47,200 acres of
initial disturbance for the Proposed Action, this translates to 34,343 acres with a slight limitation for
water erosion, 36,656 acres with a moderate limitatiofor wind erosion, 16,775 acres with a moderate
limitation for runoff potential, 30,115 acres with a moderate limitation for road construction, and 27,095
acres with a poor reclamation potential.

Information from two soil surveys completed by the BLM was used to assess the potential limitations of the CD-C project area soils (Texas Resource Consultants, 1981; Wells et al.,
1981). Information from individual soil map units was used to evaluate the soil limitations. If multiple soil series existed within a single map unit, rankings were assigned based on the
soil series that comprised the greatest acreage within the unit.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOILS

Although the extent of areas with soil limitations makes it likely that implementation of the Proposed
Action would occur on soils that possess severe limitations, total avoidance of these areas would not be
feasible. Adherence to the Rawlins RMP and required Conditions of Approval (COAs) and Best
Management Practices (BMPs) (Appendix C) would ensure that disturbed areas are stabilized to reduce
soil erosion, surface runoff, and associated impacts to water quality, and would minimize the reduction of
soil productivity. Annual monitoring and adaptation of reclamation practices would be used to establish a
trajectory to successful reclamation.
4.3.3.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Adverse soil impacts under Alternative A would be similar to the Proposed Action but the extent and the
degree of the impacts would be greater because the amount of surface disturbance would be greater. The
construction of 8,950 natural gas wells using only vertical drilling techniques, together with associated
access roads and related facilities, would produce initial (short-term) soil disturbance estimated at 61,696
acres, 30.7 percent greater than the Proposed Action. This disturbance would comprise approximately 5.8
percent of the total project area. Combined with the historic disturbance of 60,176 acres, over 11 percent
of the surface of the CD-C project area would be affected. The initial CD-C project disturbance is
considered temporary, as successful interim reclamation is expected to reduce the average drill-pad size
(including access road) from 6.3 acres to approximately 2.6 acres, reducing the long-term surface
disturbance to approximately 40 percent of the initial disturbance area. During the life of the project (45
to 55 years), the long-term disturbance area is expected to decrease to 24,133 acres, or 2.3 percent of the
total project area.
While the same number of wells is proposed for both the Proposed Action and Alternative A, the
disturbance area would be 14,496 acres (30.7 percent) greater for Alternative A because all of the wells
would be drilled using vertical drilling techniques. With the use of vertical drilling techniques, only one
well can be drilled at a single location, resulting in approximately 6.3 acres of initial disturbance per well.
For a directionally drilled well, the initial disturbance would be 2.45 acres per well bore.
The distribution of soil limitations for Alternative A, assuming that future drilling would occur at the
same spatial distribution as current wells drilled, is provided in Table 4.3-1. For the 61,696 acres of initial
disturbance for Alternative A, this translates to 44,890 acres with a slight risk for water erosion, 47,913
acres with a moderate risk for wind erosion, 21,926 acres with a moderate runoff potential, 39,364 acres
with a moderate limitation to road construction, and 35,416 acres with a poor reclamation potential
(Table 4.3-1).
Although the extent of areas with soil limitations makes it likely that implementation of Alternative A
would occur on soils that have severe limitations, total avoidance of these areas would not be feasible,
especially given the increased surface disturbance under this alternative. Adherence to the Rawlins RMP
and required COAs and BMPs (Appendix C) would ensure that disturbed areas are adequately stabilized
to reduce soil erosion, surface runoff, and associated impacts to water quality and would minimize the
reduction of soil productivity. Annual monitoring and adaptation of reclamation practices would be used
to establish a trajectory to successful reclamation.
4.3.3.3

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Adverse soil impacts under Alternative B would be similar to the Proposed Action but the extent and the
degree of the impacts would be less because the amount of surface disturbance would be less. The
construction of 8,950 natural gas wells using a combination of vertical and directional drilling techniques,
together with associated access roads and related facilities, under the terms of Alternative B would
produce initial (short-term) soil disturbance estimated at 45,516 acres, 3.6 percent less than the Proposed
Action. This disturbance would comprise 4.3 percent of the total project area. Combined with the historic
disturbance of 60,176 acres, almost 10 percent of the surface of the CD-C project area would be affected.
The initial project disturbance is considered temporary, as successful interim reclamation is expected to

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-17

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOILS

reduce the average drill-pad size (including access road) to approximately 40 percent of the short-term
disturbance area. Reclamation of pipeline right-of-way disturbances would be initiated immediately upon
completion of construction. Therefore, during the life of the project (45 to 55 years), the long-term
disturbance area is expected to decrease to 18,249 acres, or 1.7 percent of the total project area. While the
same number of wells is proposed for both the Proposed Action and Alternative B, the total disturbance
area would be 1,684 acres (3.6 percent) less for Alternative B. Alternative B would disturb less area than
the Proposed Action since more directional wells would be drilled—an estimated 438 more—resulting in
less disturbance per well.
The distribution of soil limitations for the 8,950 wells included under Alternative B, assuming that future
drilling would occur at the same spatial distribution as current wells drilled, is projected to follow the
distribution of wells in each rating class as provided in Table 4.3-1. For the 45,516 acres of initial
disturbance for Alternative B, this translates to 33,118 acres with a slight risk for water erosion, 35,348
acres with a moderate risk for wind erosion, 16,176 acres with a moderate runoff potential, 29,040 acres
with a moderate limitation to road construction, and 26,128 acres with a poor reclamation potential
(Table 4.3-1).
Although the extent of areas with soil limitations makes it likely that implementation of Alternative B
would occur on soils that have severe limitations, total avoidance of these areas would not be feasible,
although the risk of adverse impacts would be reduced slightly because of the slightly reduced
disturbance (3.6 percent). Adherence to the Rawlins RMP and required Conditions of Approval and Best
Management Practices (Appendix C) would ensure that disturbed areas are adequately stabilized to
reduce soil erosion, surface runoff, and potential impacts to water quality and would minimize the
reduction of soil productivity. Annual monitoring and adaptation of reclamation practices would be used
to establish a trajectory to successful reclamation.
4.3.3.4

Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance for High and Low Density Development
Areas

Adverse soil impacts under Alternative C would be similar to the Proposed Action but the extent and the
degree of the impacts would be less because the amount of surface disturbance would be less. The
construction of 8,950 natural gas wells using a combination of vertical and directional drilling techniques
under the terms of Alternative C, together with associated access roads and related facilities, would
produce initial (short-term) soil disturbance estimated at 42,955 acres, 9.0 percent less than the Proposed
Action. This disturbance would comprise 4.0 percent of the total project area. Combined with the historic
disturbance of 60,176 acres, almost 10 percent of the surface of the CD-C project area would be affected.
The initial CD-C project disturbance is considered temporary, as successful interim reclamation is
expected to reduce the average drill-pad size (including access road) to approximately 40 percent of the
initial disturbance area. Reclamation of pipeline right-of-way disturbances would be initiated
immediately upon completion of construction. Therefore, during the life of the project (45 to 55 years),
the long-term disturbance area is expected to decrease to 17,318 acres, or 1.6 percent of the total project
area. While the same number of wells is proposed for both the Proposed Action and Alternative C, the
total disturbance area would be 4,245 acres (9 percent) less for Alternative C. Alternative C would have
less total disturbance than the Proposed Alternative since additional directional wells would be drilled—
an estimated 1,103 more—resulting in less disturbance per well.
The distribution of soil limitations for the 8,950 wells included under Alternative C, assuming that future
drilling would result in the same spatial distribution as current wells in the project area, is projected to
follow the distribution of wells in each rating class as provided in Table 4.3-1. For the 42,955 acres of
initial disturbance for Alternative C, this translates to 31,254 acres with a slight risk for water erosion,
33,359 acres with a moderate risk for wind erosion, 15,266 acres with a moderate runoff potential, 27,406
acres with a moderate limitation to road construction, and 24,658 acres with a poor reclamation potential
(Table 4.3-1).

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOILS

Although the extent of areas with soil limitations makes it likely that implementation of Alternative C
would occur on soils that have severe limitations, total avoidance of these areas would not be feasible.
However, the risk of adverse impacts would be reduced because of the reduced disturbance under this
alternative (9.0 percent). Adherence to the Rawlins RMP and required COAs and BMPs (Appendix C)
would ensure that disturbed areas are adequately stabilized to reduce soil erosion, surface runoff, and
associated impacts to water quality and would minimize the reduction of soil productivity. Annual
monitoring and adaptation of reclamation practices would be used to establish a trajectory to successful
reclamation.
4.3.3.5

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Adverse soil impacts under Alternative D would be similar to the Proposed Action but the extent and the
degree of the impacts would be less because the amount of surface disturbance would be less. The
construction of 8,950 natural gas wells using a combination of vertical and directional drilling techniques
under the terms of Alternative D, together with associated access roads and related facilities, would
produce initial (short-term) soil disturbance estimated at 36,449 acres, 22.8 percent less than the Proposed
Action. This disturbance would comprise 3.4 percent of the total project area. Combined with the historic
disturbance of 60,176 acres, 9 percent of the surface of the CD-C project area would be affected. The
initial CD-C project disturbance is considered temporary, as successful interim reclamation is expected to
reduce the average drill-pad size (including access road) to approximately 40 percent of the initial
disturbance area. Reclamation of pipeline right-of-way disturbances would be initiated immediately upon
completion of construction. Therefore, during the life of the project (45 to 55 years), the long-term
disturbance area is expected to decrease to 14,952 acres, or 1.4 percent of the total project area. While the
same number of wells is proposed for both the Proposed Action and Alternative D, the total disturbance
area would be 10,751 acres (22.8 percent) less for Alternative D. Alternative D would have less total
disturbance than the Proposed Alternative since additional directional wells would be drilled—an
estimated 2,793 more—resulting in less disturbance per well.
The distribution of potential soil limitations for the 8,950 wells included under Alternative D, assuming
that future drilling would result in the same spatial distribution as current wells in the project area, is
projected to follow the distribution of wells in each rating class as provided in Table 4.3-1. For the
36,449 acres of initial disturbance for Alternative D, this translates to 26,520 acres with a slight risk for
water erosion, 28,306 acres with a moderate risk for wind erosion, 12,954 acres with a moderate runoff
potential, 23,255 acres with a moderate limitation to road construction, and 20,923 acres with a poor
reclamation potential (Table 4.3-1).
Although the extent of areas with soil limitations makes it likely that implementation of Alternative D
would occur on soils that have severe limitations, total avoidance of these areas would not be feasible.
However, the risk of adverse impacts would be reduced because of the reduced disturbance under this
alternative (22.8 percent less). Adherence to the Rawlins RMP and required COAs and BMPs (Appendix
C) would ensure that disturbed areas are adequately stabilized to reduce soil erosion, surface runoff, and
associated impacts to water quality, and would minimize the reduction of soil productivity. Annual
monitoring and adaptation of reclamation practices would be used to establish a trajectory to successful
reclamation.
4.3.3.6

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, it is assumed that no new natural gas drilling would occur. Adverse soil
impacts would be limited to those related to historical disturbance in the project area. The No Action
Alternative assumes that previously authorized activities would continue but that no new programmatic
development would occur under this proposal. Historic development has resulted in the disturbance of
60,176 acres, about 5.6 percent of the surface of the CD-C project area. This disturbance level would not
increase under the No Action Alternative. The historic disturbance is considered temporary, because it is

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOILS

assumed that successful interim reclamation would reduce the average unvegetated disturbance to
approximately 30 percent of the initial disturbance area. Therefore, the long-term historic disturbance area
is expected to decrease to 17,663 acres, or 1.7 percent of the total project area.
For the No Action Alternative, no new impact to the soil resource would occur. Soil impact would be
greatly reduced since no new disturbance would occur under this alternative (47,200 acres less than the
Proposed Action).
4.3.3.7

Impacts Summary

For the Proposed Action, the total area of disturbance is estimated to be 47,200 acres, which would
comprise approximately 4.4 percent of the project area. For Alternative A, the total area of disturbance is
estimated to be 61,696 acres, which would comprise approximately 5.8 percent of the project area;
Alternative A would result in a 30.7 percent increase over the disturbance anticipated for the Proposed
Action. Alternative B would have a total disturbance area of 45,516 acres, which would comprise 4.3
percent of the project area; Alternative B would result in a 3.6percent decrease from the disturbance
anticipated for the Proposed Action. Alternative C would have a total disturbance of 42,955 acres, which
consists of 4.0 percent of the project area; Alternative C would result in a 9percent decrease from the
disturbance anticipated for the Proposed Action. Alternative D would have a total disturbance of 36,449
acres, which consists of 3.4 percent of the project area; Alternative D would result in a 22.8percent
decrease from the disturbance anticipated for the Proposed Action. Finally, for Alternative E, the No
Action Alternative, no new surface disturbance would occur.
Full and successful implementation of the required mitigation measures and BMPs would ensure that
none of the three significance criteria would be exceeded. Soil productivity would not be reduced such
that pre-disturbance conditions could not be recovered, the reclamation trajectory would be toward
success, and disturbed areas would be adequately stabilized. Failure to successfully implement the
required measures could result in significant impacts.
4.3.3.8

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

The Proposed Action and alternatives would result in adverse soil impacts including the removal of
vegetation and soil resulting in exposure to erosion, soil compaction, and undesirable mixing of
subsurface soil horizons with potential saline/sodic soil conditions. However, full and successful
implementation of the required mitigation measures as set forth in the Rawlins RMP and CD-C required
Conditions of Approval and BMPs would ensure that none of the three significance criteria would be
exceeded.
No additional mitigation measures would be required.

WATER RESOURCES
Introduction

Authorization of the proposed project would require full compliance with the Rawlins RMP, the Federal
Clean Water Act (CWA), EO 11990 (wetlands protection), and EO 11988 (floodplain protection). These
regulations require that certain permits/authorizations be obtained from the State of Wyoming (WDEQ­
WQD and WOGCC) and the BLM and other federal agencies. Permits are required from WDEQ-WQD or
WOGCC for disposal of produced water. State and federal approval is required for Applications for
Permit to Drill (APDs); Federal Lease Obligations; development of surface runoff, erosion, and sediment
control plans; injection-well permitting; oil-spill containment and contingency plans; Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plans; Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plans; and CWA Section 404
permits.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

For the purposes of this analysis, the evaluation of the Proposed Action and alternatives assumes
adherence to these plans, permits, leases, and regulations for the protection of water resources. Many
impacts associated with natural gas development are common to all alternatives and therefore are
analyzed for general impacts in Section 4.4.3. The magnitude of impacts varies by alternative, so the
magnitude of impacts is discussed as they relate to each alternative.
Up to 500 of the 8,950 proposed wells could be coalbed natural gas (CBNG) wells. The volume of water
produced in CBNG development is much greater than for conventional natural gas production. During
initial coal-seam depressurization, CBNG wells can produce from 500–1,000 bbls/day of produced water
compared to the average of 18 bbls/day for a conventional well. The actual volumes produced and the
methods by which the produced water would be managed are greatly dependent on the site-specific
development proposals. For that reason, this document does not contain any description of producedwater disposal for CBNG development and does not analyze the impacts of such development. Should the
BLM receive site-specific CBNG proposals in the project area, the proposals, including the treatment of
produced water, will be analyzed in a separate NEPA document at that time.
4.4.2

Assumptions for Analysis

Under all alternatives, the following would be adhered to: Operator-committed measures, required BMPs,
including BMPs for Non-Point Source Pollution as applicable, as well as the regulations and plans
described in Section 4.4.1. Per NEPA guidance, this analysis will be based on the premise that standard
operating procedures including these BMPs and regulations would be followed under each alternative.
Appendix C includes a summary description of the BMPs and APD Conditions of Approval typically
used by the BLM in the Rawlins Field Office to implement the federal laws, regulations and policy aimed
at mitigating environmental impacts.
4.4.2.1

Surface Water Analysis Assumptions

The analysis for surface water is based on the following specific assumptions:










Disturbance to soil and vegetation, including compaction of soil, would increase water runoff and
downstream sediment loads and lower soil productivity, thereby degrading water quality, channel
structure, and overall watershed health.
The degree of impact attributed to any one disturbance or series of disturbances is influenced by
several factors including location within the watershed, time and degree of disturbance, existing
vegetation, soil characteristics, type of disturbance, and precipitation.
Increased pollutants in surface waters would degrade habitat used by aquatic life and would affect
other uses (e.g., stock-watering, irrigation, and drinking-water supplies).
The BLM would continue to develop and maintain water sources in upland areas to reduce impacts
on wetland/riparian areas and provide a resource for livestock grazing.
Access roads would follow standard construction practices. However, even properly designed roads
would still alter hillslope hydrology and concentrate overland flow, increasing erosion in some
areas. In areas with steep topography, roads are expected to be longer, resulting in greater impacts to
surface-water resources.
Fine-textured soils are more susceptible to water erosion and compaction when wet than mediumor coarse-textured soils; coarse-textured soils are more susceptible to wind erosion.

4.4.2.2

Groundwater Analysis Assumptions

Groundwater would be affected during construction of wells or by other subsurface project-development
activities. The most likely pathway for groundwater contamination would be undetected spills and
leachate from leaking produced-water facilities or mud pits. Additionally, undetected defects in either

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-21

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

casing installation or cementing would be the most likely scenario for groundwater contamination to
occur from actual gas well drilling and completion activities. Leakage from freshwater storage pits (used
in fracturing operations) or other storage pits needed for well completion has the potential to leach salts
from soils and impact shallow groundwater. Chemicals used for production drilling could cause local
contamination of soils and groundwater if not managed properly. By design, the BLM approves APDs
and associated drilling plans to protect potentially potable/usable groundwater intervals. Construction of
well pads, proper disposal practices, proper well casing and cementing, and recycling of drilling fluids
would be in accordance with BLM guidelines and should minimize adverse effects on groundwater
quality. Withdrawal of produced water during production activities would impact target aquifers as would
injection of the produced water.
4.4.3

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes the following management objectives associated with water
resources (cited appendices are in the Rawlins RMP ROD, BLM 2008b):











Maintain or improve water quality by managing surface land use and groundwater resources, where
practical and within the scope of the BLM’s authority, according to the State of Wyoming Water
Quality Rules and Regulations (Appendix 11).
Maintain the hydrologic and water-quality conditions needed to support riparian/wetland areas;
minimize flood and sediment damage to water resources from human and natural causes; analyze
and, where possible, minimize levels of salt-loading in watersheds; and protect water resources used
by the public (including impoundments, reservoirs, pipelines, and irrigation ditches) and by federal,
state, and local agencies for fisheries, wildlife, wild horses, livestock, agricultural, recreational,
municipal, and industrial uses.
Address all accidental spills of environmental pollutants on federal lands according to Appendix 32.
Implement intensive management of surface-disturbing activities (Appendix 13) in watersheds
contributing to water bodies listed on the Wyoming 303(d) list of water bodies with water-quality
impairments or threats, within the BLM’s authority.
Maintain or improve wetland/riparian areas as required by the Wyoming Standards for Healthy
Rangelands (BLM 1997).
Avoid playas when locating infrastructure due to poor soils and potential flooding.
Ensure that activities that would cause water depletion within the Colorado River system or the
North Platte River system comply with existing agreements, decrees, rules, and regulations
(Appendix 11).

Significance criteria are developed to gauge the magnitude of an impact on the human and natural
environment. An impact on water resources as a result of project actions would be considered significant
if its magnitude is such that mitigation measures discussed in Appendix C are insufficient and additional
mitigation measures are warranted or if it were to persist indefinitely.
4.4.3.1

Surface-Water Significance Criteria

Impacts to surface water supplies would be considered significant if any of the following were to occur:
1. Degradation of water quality beyond the designated use of the receiving water body, or other
violations of federal or state water-quality standards, or negatively impacting a water body listed on
the State 303(d) list of Impaired or Threatened Waterbodies.
2. Project activities that elevate salt-loading to the Colorado River system above background
conditions.
3. Unmitigated loss of wetlands or wetland function (EO 11990 and 11988).

4-22

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

4. Project-related activities that degrade wetland/riparian areas such that, as a minimum physical state,
Standards for Healthy Rangelands (BLM 1997) are not being maintained.
5. Streamflow characteristics of intermittent drainages or perennial streams are altered such that
established uses are affected.
6. Alteration of stream-channel geometry or gradient by accelerated runoff and erosion (e.g.,
undesirable aggradation, degradation, or side-cutting) beyond what would be expected by natural
processes.
7. Contamination of surface water from spilled fracking fluids, drilling fluids, and produced water.
8. Soil loss greater than 2 tons per acre per year in areas attributed to surface disturbance.
4.4.3.2

Groundwater Significance Criteria

Impacts to groundwater resources or springs caused by project activities would be considered significant
if any of the following were to occur:
1. Interruption of the natural flow or level of groundwater to existing local springs, seeps, or flowing
artesian wells, regardless of use or non-use.
2. Degradation of groundwater quality in any aquifer such that it can no longer meet its classified
current use(s). This includes impacts to underground sources of drinking water (USDW) or sole
source aquifers (SSAs).
3. Spills or releases of fuels, liquids, chemicals, or hazardous materials (including but not limited to
fracking fluids, drilling fluids, and produced water) that affect the quality of groundwater.
4.4.4

Direct and Indirect Impacts

The following impact discussions consider whether project impacts will result in the exceedance of one or
more of the water resources significance criteria detailed above. The potential for an impact meeting or
exceeding one or more of the significance criteria listed above is based on legal requirements (i.e.,
government regulatory standards), public perception, available scientific and environmental
documentation, and professional judgment of resource specialists, as specified in 40 CFR 1508.27. The
evaluation assumes successful implementation of BMPs and COAs.
4.4.4.1

Impacts Common to the Proposed Action and All Alternatives

The project area encompasses approximately 1.1 million acres. Existing development in the project area
has resulted in 56,647 acres of surface disturbance, of which 13,706 acres remain unvegetated (Table 4.01). The project area contains several active gas fields. To date, over 4,800 wells have been drilled in the
project area; about 3,000 are still active producing natural-gas wells with accompanying productionrelated facilities, roads, and pipelines. Impacts to Muddy Creek have already occurred and two portions of
Muddy Creek are now listed on the State 303(d) list of Impaired or Threatened Waterbodies due to habitat
degradation (WDEQ 2012). According to WDEQ, the impairment to the middle portion of Muddy Creek
is primarily due to livestock grazing, exacerbated by accelerated erosion associated with oil and gas
activities (WDEQ 2010). The impairment to the lower portion of Muddy Creek is primarily due to
exceedances of the chloride and selenium criteria (WDEQ 2012). Watershed restoration projects in the
Muddy Creek sub-basin have also been implemented through the Grizzly Wildlife Habitat Management
Area (WHMA), which includes the upper Littlefield Creek drainage and other portions of the upper
Muddy Creek drainage (BLM 2008a). Under all action alternatives, revised and newly implemented
BMPs and COAs, as outlined in Appendix C, would be attached to individual APDs. Given that there
could be up to 30 companies operating within the project area, each with a unique approach to
environmental protection measures, implementation of the BMPs and COAs will not be uniform.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-23

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

Variability in approaches will lead to differences in the level of environmental protection afforded. While
these BMPs and COAs would not completely eliminate the potential for significant impacts, they would
become the basis for enhanced environmental protection and offer a level of safeguard throughout the
project area not present in earlier phases of development. Per NEPA guidance, this analysis is based on
the premise that standard operating procedures including these BMPs, COAs, and regulations would be
followed under each alternative and by each individual operator.
Since specific locations for well sites or areas of concentrated development have not been identified in the
Proposed Action or alternatives, this analysis will consider general project impacts. The Proposed Action
and all action alternatives assume the construction of up to 8,950 wells and associated roads and pipelines
over the course of 15 years. As discussed in Section 4.0.3, the well spacing would vary by area and
includes: 40- to 60-acre spacing (12 to 16 wells per section), 80-acre spacing (eight wells per section),
and 160-acre spacing (four wells per section) (Map 4.0-2). The areas of proposed dense (40- to 60-acre)
well spacing are generally associated with active gas fields. Overall, approximately 60 percent of the
project area may not undergo concentrated development (i.e. 40 to 60 or 80-acre well spacing). The extent
of the unused (or less-used) portion of the project area would be defined by the suitability of production
of natural gas and may or may not be continuous. Those areas without concentrated well locations would
potentially experience surface disturbance from roads and pipelines to access wells and could also include
areas of less-dense conventional well development. The Operators have indicated that they would vary
well spacing when geology, permeability, and other conditions allow, but such areas have not yet been
defined.
Approximately 30 injection wells for produced-water disposal would be utilized for the project. Both
injection and natural gas wells could share pads, although specific locations cannot be predicted. A very
small percentage of the conventional well locations would be unsuccessful and would be plugged,
abandoned, and reclaimed.
Surface Water Impacts Common to All Alternatives
The differing amounts of surface disturbance by alternative result from the varying number of well pads
and the extent of required access roads and pipelines needed for resource development. The magnitude of
impacts to surface water versus the acres of surface disturbance is not a one-to-one ratio. Roads and well
pads will impact surface hydrology beyond their initial disturbance footprint. For the purposes of this
impacts analysis, a change (increase or decrease) in the amount of surface disturbance generally translates
to a corresponding change in the magnitude of impacts to surface water.
The main impacts to surface-water resources from this project are brought about by contamination of
surface water from the authorized discharge of hydrostatic test water and the accidental discharge (spill)
of fracking fluids, drilling fluids, and produced water, and the impacts (including sediment loading) from
surface disturbance related to project development/maintenance.
Discharge/Spills. The authorized discharge of hydrostatic test water (water used to test the integrity of
pipelines) and the accidental surface discharge of fracking fluids, drilling fluids, and produced water
would impact nearby surface-water quality by degrading water quality (related to Criteria 1 and 7), which
could in turn impact wetlands (related to Criteria 3 and 4) and increase salinity levels (related to Criterion
2). There would be no authorized surface discharge of produced water as a result of the action
alternatives. The magnitude of any impact would depend on the quality and quantity of the hydrostatic
test water and any fluids accidentally discharged and the distance of the discharge/spill from a regulated
water body (e.g. wetland, riparian area, and ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial stream). The following
considers whether project impacts will result in the exceedance of water resources significance criteria
based on discharge/spill impacts.
Use or discharge of hydrostatic test water would be accomplished in a manner that should not affect soils,
stream channels, surface water, and groundwater quality. After testing operations are completed, the

4-24

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

water would be pumped into water-hauling trucks and transported to drilling locations within the project
area to be used in conjunction with drilling operations or reused for other aspects of the construction
and/or production process. However, if such water is not reused it must be disposed of in such a manner
that soil-scouring and water-quality impairment would not result. Hydrostatic test water would be
evaluated for compliance with state water-quality standards and no test water would be discharged unless
such water meets these standards. Test water not utilized for drilling operations that meets water-quality
standards would be disposed of onto undisturbed land having vegetative cover or into an established
drainage channel in a manner that would not cause erosion (appropriate erosion control measures would
be utilized). Furthermore, use and disposal of hydrostatic test water would comply with the mandatory
right-of-way stipulation for hydrostatic testing, as well as the CWA required plan of development and the
Wyoming Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (WYPDES) permit that would be required for the
proposed project. The quantity of test water discharged would be dependent on the length of the pipelines
needed for the handling of produced water (the longer the pipeline segment the more water is needed for
testing).
Spills of oil from production facilities would be controlled with the site-specific implementation of Spill
Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans, which would be developed by the Operators in
accordance with 40 CFR Part 112. Each Operator would maintain a complete copy of the SPCC plan at
the facility or at the nearest field office and have the plan available to the Regional Administrator for
onsite review. BLM Notice NTL-3A requires the reporting of spills, accidents, blowouts, or other
undesirable events that occur from federal minerals or on BLM-managed surface and IM WY-2009-21
provides guidance and standards for spills and cleanup criteria for on-lease spills; otherwise, spills of
hydrocarbon and hazardous materials meeting the requirements outlined in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of
WDEQ Wyoming Water Quality Rules and Regulations would be reported to WDEQ-WQD.
Surface Disturbance/Sediment Loading. Project development could result in up to approximately
61,700 acres (Alternative A) of new surface disturbance related to road, pipeline, well pad, and facilities
construction. These activities would result in a loss of vegetation and subsequent increased soil-surface
exposure (related to Criteria 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8); mixing of soil horizons (related to Criteria 2 and 8); soil
compaction resulting in decreased infiltration capacity (related to Criteria 5, 6, and 8); loss of topsoil
productivity (related to Criteria 5, 6, and 8); an increased susceptibility of the soil to water erosion
(related to Criteria 2, 5, and 6); and off-site sedimentation that would cause channel instability and
degradation of surface-water quality (related to Criteria 1, 2, 5, and 6). The magnitude of any impact
would depend on the amount and type of disturbance and will be discussed by alternative.
Matherne (2006) noted increased sediment production from well pad locations and confirmed that roads
and well pads can provide conditions for focusing runoff and locally increasing erosion. Based on field
observations, Matherne found that roads on sideslopes facilitate the erosional process in three ways: (1)
they cut across and collect runoff from previously established drainages; (2) where they are cut into
hillsides or into the land surface, roads provide focal points for the initiation of erosion; and (3) they
provide conduits for sediment transport. Once mobilized, a portion of this sediment (resulting from these
erosional processes) would move into channels in pulses that occur in relation to storm events. Some of
this sediment would be temporarily stored in drainage bottoms and on hillslopes and a portion would be
stabilized by vegetation and not travel to nearby drainages. Soil loss to water erosion is discussed in detail
in Section 3.3.2.1.
As described in Section 3.3 Soils, the project area contains many soils that are saline or sodic. These
soils, when eroded as a result of surface disturbance, will make salt available to surface waters. Table
3.3-1 summarizes the soil limitations within the project area for the following five categories: water
erosion, wind erosion, runoff potential, road construction, and reclamation potential. Overall the risk of
water erosion is slight (69.9 percent of the total project area has a slight water erosion potential). Only 4.3
percent of the project area contains soils rated as having severe water-erosion potential. Soil
characteristics such as depth, permeability, runoff rate, water capacity, and susceptibility to erosion vary

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-25

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

widely. The diversity of soil parameters would require a broad spectrum of reclamation techniques. In
addition, low annual precipitation and wind and water erosion would make successful reclamation in the
project area difficult to attain. Therefore, the overall potential for successful reclamation is poor to fair.
Revegetation would likely be difficult in a large portion of the project area due to the high concentration
of salts in the soils. Salt concentrations are exacerbated by surface-disturbing activities. Due to the
scarcity of wetland/riparian sites in the project area, the probability of well pads, roads, pipelines, and
ancillary facilities directly impacting these resources is low. Impacts to wetland/riparian sites would occur
as a result of sediment transported down drainages but the extent of impacts to wetland/riparian sites
would be influenced by the distance of the disturbance from the wetland/riparian sites and the success of
mitigation and reclamation efforts. Revegetation may be challenging on the estimated 75 percent of the
project area indicated as possessing fair or poor reclamation potential (84 percent of area with historic
disturbance) (Table 3.3-1). Current technology exists to stabilize disturbances, minimize erosion, and
increase reclamation success provided that construction, maintenance, and operation of well pads and
associated disturbances are in accordance with planned mitigation measures and reclamation. The
Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) specifies that a buffer of 500 feet be maintained around perennial waters,
springs, wells, wetlands and a buffer of 100 feet be maintained around the inner gorge of ephemeral
channels. Formal wetland delineations have not been confirmed by the USACE for the entire project area.
Wetlands have been confirmed along Muddy Creek, which is a Waters of the U.S. A relevant Nationwide
Permit as authorized by Section 404 of the CWA would be required from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) Wyoming Regulatory Office for any disturbance activities in wetlands or Waters of
the U.S. Additional BMPs and COAs that would protect wetland/riparian sites are included in Appendix
C.
Reclamation Success and Surface Water Impacts. Successful reclamation does not necessarily return
an area to its previous hydrologic function. For example, re-establishing 80 percent of pre-disturbance
ground-cover in 5 years would be considered successful (BLM 2008b). Perennial forbs, brush, and trees
generally are more effective at reducing rain splash and can provide structure on the soil surface that can
reduce surface runoff energy, but are generally not required for reclamation. Anderson (1975), in a study
of 23 watersheds, found that conversion of steep forest and brush-lands to a grassland increased sediment
yields by five times. Although this is an extreme case, it points out that not all vegetation functions the
same at reducing surface runoff. Where interim reclamation has been successful, sagebrush and other
shrub reestablishment would occur within the project life; however, many areas would not return to predisturbance function until 30 to 50 years after final reclamation.
Surface Water Use. One of the management objectives included in the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a)
associated with water resources prescribes that activities that would cause water depletion within the
Colorado River system or the North Platte River system comply with existing agreements, decrees, rules,
and regulations (Appendix 11). No surface water would be utilized to satisfy water demand, as the water
needed for drilling and completion activities would come from new and existing State Engineer’s Office
(SEO)-approved local water wells.
Summary. An estimated 60,176 acres of surface disturbance has already occurred within the project area,
a majority prior to stringent regulatory oversight, which may have resulted in the exceedance of some of
the surface-water significance criteria listed above. As such, surface water impacts from the proposed
project could exacerbate the magnitude of existing deteriorated conditions. The magnitude of any project
related impacts and the potential to meet or exceed the significance criteria would depend on the
disturbance associated with each alternative and will be discussed by alternative. Successfully utilizing
BMPs and COAs listed in Appendix C to stabilize disturbance, minimize erosion, and increase
reclamation success would reduce the potential for adding to the magnitude of existing impacts.

4-26

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

Groundwater Impacts Common to All Alternatives
All of the action alternatives would result in the same number of new wells drilled (8,950 natural gas and
30 injection), with the difference being the number of well pads and the extent of required access roads
and pipelines needed for resource development. Because the action alternatives adjust the number of well
pads, the alternative with the lowest number of pads would minimize risk of contamination of the
groundwater resource; a lower number of well pads would reduce the probability of a pad being near a
water well or above a shallow aquifer, which could then be impacted by development activity. Also,
fewer pads would require fewer roads; both factors would reduce the amount of groundwater use for
construction and dust suppression.
Groundwater impacts would occur during the removal of groundwater for drilling, extraction of natural
gas, and dust abatement; from improper drilling operations, especially poor casing and cementing of the
well bore; from accidental releases of fluids (spills) associated with drilling and fracking operations,
produced water, and other hazardous liquids to soils and surface-water systems; and through subsurface
disposal (injection) of produced water.
Groundwater Removal. Impacts from groundwater removal are associated with impacts to groundwater
quantity and the potential to impact springs and flowing wells. There are no significance criteria related to
impacts to groundwater quantity from groundwater removal. Criterion 1 is related to impacts to springs,
seeps and flowing wells from groundwater removal.
In terms of subsurface impacts, the development in the proposed project area would consist of natural gas
wells completed primarily in the Almond Formation, a member of the late Cretaceous Mesaverde Group.
There is no current practical beneficial use for water in this stratum due to the high level of total dissolved
solids (TDS), the presence of hydrocarbons, and the availability of higher quality water from shallower
aquifers. Secondary natural gas reserves may also be encountered in other formations. There are 288
existing non-energy related/non-industrial domestic, municipal, or stock wells within the project area or 1
mile adjacent to it (SEO 2011). Only four of these wells are completed at depths that would include
aquifers of the Mesaverde Group and, depending on their location respective to the deeper natural gas
development, could be affected by groundwater withdrawals relating to conventional oil and gas
production. Due to the low density of non-energy related water wells in the project area, impacts related
to groundwater removal would not be considered significant.
While the number of natural gas wells proposed remains the same, each alternative results in a different
number of well pads. As such, there would be a slight difference between alternatives based on the
quantity of water needed for road and well pad construction and dust suppression and this difference is
reflected in the per-well range of water needed discussed below. Applying the expected per-well water
volume of 24,000 to 42,000 bbls/well needed for drilling and completion and well pad and road
construction and assuming 600 wells/year, the water demand for the proposed action and the action
alternatives would be between 1,856 ac-ft (14.3 million bbls) and 3,248 ac-ft (25.1 million bbls) per year
(based on information provided in Section 2.2.1.2 Drilling and Completion). The total water demand
over the 15 years required for well drilling would be between 27,840 ac-ft (214.1 million bbls) and 48,720
ac-ft (375.9 million bbls). This total amount of water needed for drilling and completion activities would
come from new and existing SEO-approved local water wells. While estimates of available water in all
aquifers beneath the project area are not available, using estimates of the volume of producible
groundwater from Cleary et al. (2010), the volume of groundwater above 1,000 feet in the Tertiary age
aquifers under the project area alone is approximately 9.67 million ac-ft. Therefore, the total for all water
needed for well development and pad and road construction represents between 0.3 and 0.5 percent of the
available water in the Tertiary age aquifers under the project area. As discussed in Section 3.4.3.1,
available water is also found in Quaternary, Upper and Lower Cretaceous, and Jurassic age aquifers. Fisk
(1967) estimated that the volume of moderately good-quality groundwater within the Great Divide
Structural Basin was 500 million ac-ft and 300 million ac-ft within the Washakie Structural Basin. The

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-27

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

combined annual recharge for the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins was estimated at 11,300
ac-ft (Fisk 1967), which is well above the estimated annual 1,856 ac-ft to 3,248 ac-ft water demand for
the CD-C project.
Due to technological difficulties and regulatory constraints related to water quality, relatively little
produced water can be beneficially used at this time (based on information provided by the Operators).
Reuse of drilling mud is currently being employed and is reducing the water demands. As described in
Section 3.4.3.2 Groundwater Use, there are presently 1,081 groundwater wells (including the 288 nonenergy related wells referenced above) permitted within 1 mile of the project area. The total water
demand would not likely adversely affect the existing surface-water or groundwater rights in the project
area, provided full coordination is implemented with the SEO and the BLM. The total water demand
would not cause significant adverse impacts on the groundwater resources within the project area.
The project area contains springs and flowing wells that are important local water sources for livestock,
wildlife, and wild horses. The springs in the area occur south of I-80 in the Green River Formation and
north of I-80 in the Wasatch and Battle Springs Formations (Mason and Miller 2005; Bartos et al. 2006).
Impacts related to groundwater removal would not be considered significant for Criterion 1 resulting from
the Proposed Action or any action alternatives, as the source aquifers are stratigraphically higher than the
natural gas exploration targets. Groundwater withdrawals from water wells have the potential to interrupt
flowing wells only if supply wells are completed in the same aquifer as the flowing well and close enough
to this flowing well to cause interference.
One of the management objectives associated with water resources that is included in the Rawlins RMP
(BLM 2008a) prescribes that activities that would cause water depletion within the Colorado River
system comply with existing agreements, decrees, rules, and regulations. Water needed for drilling and
completion activities would come from new and existing State Engineer’s Office (SEO)-approved local
water wells; most (96 percent) SEO-approved wells are completed in Tertiary age aquifers, particularly
the Wasatch Formation. According to Mason and Miller (2005), the Wasatch Formation has the potential
to lose groundwater to the southeast and ultimately to the Colorado River system. Roughly 20 percent of
the Wasatch Formation within the CD-C project area is within that portion of the Washakie Structural
Basin that loses groundwater to the southeast toward the Little Snake River, a tributary of the Colorado
River. As such, an interruption of this groundwater flow could lead to depletions to the Colorado River
system, although the proportion of flow in the Little Snake River that comes from groundwater discharge
from the Wasatch Formation has not been quantified. The most important agreement affected by
depletions in the project area is the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program, a
partnership working to recover the endangered fish of the Upper Colorado River Basin. Under the
Recovery and Implementation Program (RIP) for Endangered Fish Species in the Upper Colorado River
Basin, “any water depletions from tributary waters within the Colorado River drainage are considered as
jeopardizing the continued existence of these fish.” Section 4.9.3.1 includes a brief description of the
Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program and how depletion fees defined under the RIP
are calculated.
The magnitude of depletions is difficult to determine at this time since the specific locations of the drill
pads and associated roads and pipelines are not known, but the estimated annual freshwater use within the
CD-C project area would range from 1,856 to 3,248 ac-ft /yr and would average 2,552 ac-ft /yr. Assuming
that CD-C project groundwater use from the Wasatch Formation is evenly distributed across the project
area, approximately 20 percent of the groundwater would come from that portion of the Wasatch
Formation that could contribute water to the Little Snake River. Therefore, an average of 510 ac-ft/yr of
groundwater would be removed from the Wasatch Formation in this area. Fisk (1967) estimated that the
Wasatch Formation within the Washakie Structural Basin holds some 300,000,000 ac-ft of groundwater
in storage. In light of this volume of groundwater in storage, the 510 ac-ft/yr withdrawn from the Wasatch
Formation within the Washakie Structural Basin would likely have no measurable effect on Colorado
River Flows. If, however, it is determined that groundwater withdrawals result in a depletion in the

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

Colorado River, an agreement would be reached prior to operation between the BLM and the USFWS as
to how much each Operator would contribute to the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery
Program for water depletions.
Drilling Operations. Well-drilling, completion, and operation activities would impact groundwater
resources (related to Criteria 2 and 3). Construction of well pads, disposal practices, well casing and
cementing, and recycling of drilling fluids would be in accordance with BLM guidelines and should
minimize the risk of degrading groundwater quality.
Well-drilling and completion activities are not likely to impact existing groundwater quality if the project
is in compliance with the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2. These guidelines specify the
following:
…proposed casing and cementing programs shall be conducted as approved to protect or
isolate all usable water zones, potentially productive zones, lost-circulation zones,
abnormally pressured zones, and any prospectively valuable deposits of minerals. Any
isolating medium other than cement shall receive approval prior to use (BLM 1988).
The BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 defines “usable water” as groundwater with TDS of 10,000
parts per million or less encountered at any depth. This definition of useable water corresponds to the
EPA’s definition of a USDW. To comply with the order, wells must be completed using state-of-the-art
techniques, such as cementing and other proven technologies, such that usable water and unusable water
do not mix. Assuming compliance with this order, no contamination of usable groundwater would likely
occur. Well-drilling and completion as proposed in Chapter 2 Proposed Action and Alternatives
complies with Onshore Order No. 2. However, improper drilling and completion techniques, especially
poor casing and cementing of the well bore, would result in degradation of groundwater quality due to the
potential release of drilling fluids and hydrocarbons and the mixing of variable-quality waters from
different water-bearing strata that are pierced by the borehole.
A central feature of the well completion process is hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which involves
injecting fracturing fluids into the target formation at a force exceeding the parting pressure of the rock,
thus inducing a network of fractures through which oil or natural gas can flow to the wellbore. The
fractures are filled with sand or other porous materials which serve as proppants to facilitate recovery of
natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing has been used for decades in the CD-C area. It is currently excluded
from Underground Injection Control regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) except when
diesel fuel is used as a component of the fracking fluid.
The EPA is currently conducting an industry-wide study that seeks to understand any relationships
between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. As part of that study, the EPA issued information
requests to leading national and regional hydraulic fracturing service providers. The EPA is seeking
information on the chemical composition of fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process, data on the
impacts of the chemicals on human health and the environment, standard operating procedures at
hydraulic fracturing sites and the locations of sites where fracking has been conducted (EPA 2010a). No
studies related to impacts from hydraulic fracturing have been conducted in the CD-C project area and no
occurrences of drinking water contaminated by fracking have been recorded.
Newly adopted WOGCC regulations require Operators to provide the Commission with the exact
chemical content of their fracking fluid. While the information may be held as proprietary, the
Commission will be able to provide WDEQ with the chemical composition of the fracking fluid if there is
ever a question of aquifer contamination. The BLM has issued a proposed rule governing “Oil and Gas;
Well Stimulation, Including Hydraulic Fracturing, on Federal and Indian Lands.” As proposed, this rule
would (1) provide disclosure to the public of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on public land and
Indian land, (2) strengthen regulations related to well bore integrity, and (3) address issues related to
flowback water (BLM 2012e).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-29

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

The BLM is also proposing a rule to ensure that fracturing operations conducted on the public mineral
estate (including split estate where the federal government owns the subsurface mineral estate) follow
certain best practices, including the public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations
on federal lands, confirmation that wells used in fracturing operations meet appropriate construction
standards, and a requirement that operators put in place appropriate plans for managing flowback waters
from fracturing operations (Federal Register 2012b).
It is expected that fracking effects would not extend beyond 500 feet from the well bore (EPA 2002).
Accordingly, the potential for contamination of groundwater by the fracking fluids would be limited to
this distance from each well over the production interval. Because fracking would be conducted at
considerable depths (8,000 to 12,000 feet below ground surface), groundwater resources near the surface,
such as springs, the shallow alluvium, and domestic wells would not be affected.
Due to the use of state-of-the-art drilling and well-completion techniques, including techniques
incorporated in the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2, and if BMPs and COAs related to drilling
are implemented, impacts related to degradation of groundwater quality would not be considered
significant for Criteria 1, 2 and 3. In addition, the likelihood of mixing, which could occur during the
relatively short period of time during drilling, would be low and impacts would not be considered
significant for Criterion 2.
Spills. Reserve pits would be used to contain drilling fluids, cuttings, and wastewater produced from the
well-drilling operations (related to Criterion 3). The reserve pits would be constructed with an
impermeable liner to prevent seepage and possible contamination of surface and groundwater. Likewise,
the storage of fresh water, either in lined pits, tanks, or storage pits would be in accordance with WOGCC
rules on private and state mineral estate and with BLM’s IM WY-2012-007 on public minerals. Reserve
and storage pits on federal mineral estate are evaluated and approved by the BLM through the APD, rightof-way grant, or Sundry Notice permitting processes.
Spills could also occur from water and condensate gathering pipelines. State-of-the-art pipeline
construction techniques, including hydrostatic pressure testing, would limit the impacts from the project
and impacts from spills would not be considered significant for Criterion 3.
Accidental spills of oil from production facilities would be addressed through implementation of SPCC
Plans, which would be developed by the Operators in accordance with 40 CFR Part 112. Each Operator
would maintain a complete copy of the SPCC plan at the facility or at the nearest company field office
and have the plan available to the Regional Administrator for onsite review. BLM Notice NTL-3A
requires the reporting of spills, accidents, blowouts, or other undesirable events that occur from federal
minerals or on BLM-managed surface and IM WY-2009-21 provides guidance and standards for spills
and cleanup criteria for on-lease spills; otherwise, spills of hydrocarbon and hazardous materials meeting
the requirements outlined in Section 4 of Chapter 4 of WDEQ Wyoming Water Quality Rules and
Regulations would be reported to WDEQ-WQD.
If state-of-the-art pit construction techniques are used, if Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan
and SPCC Plans are implemented, and with the implementation of BMPs and COAs related to handling
of fluids, the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of spills would be limited and the
impacts would not be considered significant for Criterion 3.
Subsurface Disposal. Groundwater aquifers would be affected during disposal of produced water from
oil and gas activities (related to significance Criterion 2). Produced water would be transported by truck
to approved water-disposal injection wells or evaporation ponds, or by pipeline to treatment facilities. A
majority of the produced water would likely be injected with a smaller portion disposed of via water
treatment facilities/surface evaporative pits (based on information provided by the Operators). Subsurface
water disposal methods are administered by the EPA under the underground injection control (UIC)
program (40 CFR 144). The UIC program ensures that injection wells meet appropriate performance

4-30

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

criteria for protecting USDWs. There are five classes of injection wells permitted under the UIC program
based on similarity in the fluids injected, activities, construction, injection depth, design, and operating
techniques. Class II and Class V injection wells would likely be used to dispose of produced water
resulting from the CD-C project. Class II injection well permits are issued by the WOGCC for injection
of fluids associated with oil and conventional natural gas production by an individual operator (EPA
2011a). Class V injection wells are permitted through WDEQ-WQD and cover wells not included in
Classes I-IV. In general, Class V wells inject non-hazardous fluids into or above USDWs and are
typically shallow, onsite disposal systems, such as septic systems and for disposal of CBM produced
water. An average of 98 percent of produced water from natural gas wells in the vicinity of the project
area is disposed of by injection, based on 2010 production and injection rates for wastewater from eight
local gas production fields (WOGCC 2011a).
During the period of full production for the Proposed Action and action alternatives, there would be
approximately 7,600 ac-ft of water produced per year that would require disposal, based on an average of
18 bbls/day/well for each of the 8,950 wells. Lesser amounts would be produced each year prior to and
following the period of peak water production. Using the current 98 percent average rate of injection of
produced water, approximately 7,500 ac-ft/year of the CD-C produced water would be injected during the
height of the CD-C project under the action alternatives.
The construction of an estimated 30 additional injection wells and 20 other water handling facilities is
planned in order to dispose of produced water related to the action alternatives. The Operators have not
identified the anticipated well class or reservoirs capable of taking injected water at the volumes needed
by the production rates projected in the area. The minimum and maximum volumes currently permitted
for injection into existing disposal wells in the area range between 1,000 bbls/day (47 ac-ft/year) and
33,000 bbls/day (1,552 ac-ft/year) per well, respectively, depending on the hydraulic properties of the
target aquifer (WOGCC 2011a). If all of the project-related produced water were to be injected, the
average per-well volume of injected water for the 30 additional injection wells would need to be
approximately 252 ac-ft /year (to achieve the approximate 7,500 ac-ft/year needed for well disposal). This
is well within the range of permitted injection volumes of existing disposal wells.
There are currently 22 permitted oil and gas related wastewater disposal facilities within 20 miles of the
project area (not including subsurface disposal wells) (WDEQ 2011). A majority of these facilities utilize
some variation on evaporation. Other forms of disposal include a variety of separation methods (reverse
osmosis or ion exchange). It is expected that these facilities would continue to be utilized to the extent
possible. Project plans include an estimated 20 additional produced water handling facilities. According
to Boysen et al. (2002), individual facility evaporation rates of 30 gallons per minute (48 ac-ft/year) at
wastewater disposal facilities utilizing misting towers are achievable. Given the proposed 20 additional
wastewater disposal facilities, the capacity is more than adequate to dispose of produced wastewater that
is not injected (100 ac-ft/year).
If disposal wells are installed according to EPA and WDEQ requirements and if BMPs and COAs related
to handling of fluids are implemented, the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of water
disposal would be limited and the impacts related to Criterion 3 would not be considered significant.
Groundwater Impacts Summary. Impacts from groundwater removal are associated with impacts to
groundwater quantity and the potential to impact springs and flowing wells. Groundwater removal by the
project is expected to be well below the annual recharge of the structural basins underlying the project
area. The likelihood of these withdrawals interrupting flowing wells is low. The 510 ac-ft/yr withdrawn
from the Wasatch Formation within the Washakie Structural Basin would likely have no measurable
effect on Colorado River flows.
Drilling and completion would result in degradation of groundwater quality if drilling fluids,
hydrocarbons, or variable-quality water from different strata are released into water-bearing strata that are
pierced by the borehole. With use of state-of-the-art drilling and well-completion techniques, including

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-31

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

proper casing and cementing of the well bore, and implementation of drilling BMPs and COAs, impacts
related to drilling of natural gas wells would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2, or 3.
If state-of-the-art pit construction techniques are used, if Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan
and SPCC Plans are implemented, and if BMPs and COAs related to handling of fluids are implemented,
the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of spills would be limited and the impacts would
not be considered significant for Criterion 3.
If disposal wells are installed according to EPA and WDEQ requirements and if BMPs and COAs related
to handling of fluids are implemented, the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of
subsurface disposal of produced water disposal would be limited and the impacts related to Criterion 3
would not be considered significant.
4.4.4.2

Impacts Associated with the Proposed Action

The types of impacts would be the same as those discussed in Section 4.4.4.1 Impacts Common to the
Proposed Action and All Alternatives, but would vary in magnitude when compared to the other
alternatives. Under the Proposed Action, 6,126 pads would be required for the 8,950 wells. Total
construction-phase surface disturbance would be 47,200 acres (approximately 4.4 percent of the project
area). With successful reclamation during the life of the project (45 to 55 years), total disturbances would
be reduced to about 19,000 acres (about 1.8 percent of the project area). The construction disturbance
would not be uniformly distributed across the project area, but rather, project facilities would be located
where the efficiency and feasibility of extracting the natural gas would be the highest. As described
earlier, most of the project area has fair/poor reclamation potential, which is considered difficult to
reclaim. Where sagebrush, juniper, or other vegetation that is difficult to reestablish is disturbed, the
location would not return to pre-disturbance hydrologic function until 30 to 50 years after the end of the
project in some locations, as described in Section 4.4.4.1.
Surface Water. As with all following action alternatives, the magnitude of the surface water impacts
would be primarily related to the amount of sediment mobilization resulting from disturbance (the number
and size of the drill pads, the distance and width of the roads, and the distance and width of the pipeline
corridors). The quality and quantity of the hydrostatic test water discharged, the quality and quantity of
any fluids accidentally discharged, and the distance of the discharge/spill from a water body or water
course (e.g. wetland, riparian area, and ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial stream) would also be of
concern. No test water would be discharged unless such water meets State water-quality standards. The
quantity of test water discharged would be dependent on the length of the pipelines needed to manage
produced water (volume related to pipe length) and the amount of test water not reused for other
purposes.
Impacts related to disturbance/sediment would be considered significant (depending on the amount of
disturbance) for surface water Criteria 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 as a result of the fair/poor reclamation potential for
a majority of the project area. Impacts related to disturbance/sediment loading would not be considered
significant for Criteria 3 and 4.
Impacts related to the discharge/spill of water would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 7. The State water quality standards regulating discharge of test water, the BMPs and COAs for
construction and maintenance of pipelines and reserve pits, and the Hazardous Materials Management and
Release Contingency Plans and SPCC Plans would minimize effects of spills.
Groundwater. The magnitude of the groundwater impacts from the Proposed Action (and all following
action alternatives) would be related to the number of wells and well pads proposed and the extent of
required access roads and pipelines needed for resource development. Groundwater impacts would occur
during the removal of groundwater (Criterion 1), from improper drilling operations, especially poor well
casing and cementing practices (Criteria 1, 2, and 3), through subsurface disposal (injection) of produced
water (Criterion 2), and from accidental releases of fluids [spills] (Criteria 2 and 3).

4-32

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

Impacts related to groundwater removal would not be considered significant for Criterion 1 since the
source aquifers for the springs and seeps are stratigraphically higher than the natural gas exploration
targets.
Impacts related to improper drilling techniques would be not be considered significant for groundwater
Criteria 1, 2 and 3 due to the use of state-of-the-art drilling and well-completion techniques included in
the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 and the implementation of drilling BMPs and COAs.
4.4.4.3

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

The types of impacts for Alternative A would be the same as those described in Section 4.4.4.1, but the
disturbance (initial and long-term) would increase when compared to the Proposed Action. This
alternative assumes that no wells would be drilled using directional-drilling techniques. Under Alternative
A, 8,950 pads would be required for the 8,950 wells. Total construction-phase surface disturbance would
be 61,696 acres, 56,400 acres related to well pads and roads. This is 31 percent more than the Proposed
Action.
Surface Water. Impacts from both authorized and accidental surface discharge of fluids related to
surface water Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 would be greater than the Proposed Action. Considering the
significant increase in the amount of surface disturbance, impacts would be considered significant related
to discharge/spill of water, depending on the locations of the drill pads and associated roads and pipelines.
Impacts related to disturbance/sediment loading would be considered significant for surface water Criteria
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8, primarily as a result of the significantly greater amount of surface disturbance.
Groundwater. Under Alternative A, the per-well water use would be skewed toward the maximum of
42,000 bbls/well due to the additional water needed for road and pad construction and dust abatement.
Because produced water cannot be used for dust abatement and since this alternative has the greatest
amount of surface disturbance, Alternative A would likely place the greatest demand on the aquifers
targeted for water supplies. Because this alternative increases the number of well pads, the risk of
contamination of the groundwater resource would increase due to the greater probability of a pad being
near a water well or above a shallow aquifer, which, by proximity, raises the chance of contamination
resulting from leaks, spills, or improper drilling techniques, especially poor well casing and cementing
practices.
The potential to meet or exceed groundwater Criterion 1 from impacts related to groundwater removal
would be greater than the Proposed Action because of increased water demands for hydrostatic testing
and dust suppression but the impacts would not be considered significant since the source aquifers for the
springs or seeps are stratigraphically higher than the natural gas exploration targets and the areas in the
vicinity of flowing wells can be avoided when and if new water supply wells are developed. Due to the
amount of available groundwater in storage, groundwater removal resulting from Alternative A would not
significantly impact groundwater quantities. Impacts from degradation of groundwater from disposal
wells would not be considered significant for Criterion 2 since disposal wells would be installed
according to EPA and WDEQ requirements and since BMPs and COAs related to handling of fluids
would be implemented. State-of-the-art pit and pipeline construction techniques, including the use of pit
liners and hydrostatic pressure testing, would protect the groundwater resource and the impacts from
spills resulting from Alternative A would not be considered significant for Criterion 3.
4.4.4.4

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

The types of impacts for Alternative B would the same as those described in Section 4.4.4.1, but the
short- and long-term disturbance would decrease when compared to the Proposed Action. Under
Alternative B, 5,798 pads would be required for the drilling of 8,950 wells. Total construction-phase
surface disturbance would be 45,516 acres, 4 percent less than the Proposed Action. This alternative
identifies the resources that may be more at risk from natural gas development and the enhanced resource

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-33

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

protections that would be implemented for these resources, which include enhanced protections and
mitigation. The alternative also recognizes that future development may be more intensive than currently
expected or may have unintended consequences, resulting in impacts to wildlife habitats and populations
in areas that were not anticipated or impacts that occur at a faster pace than anticipated. Under Alternative
B, RMP development restrictions would be expanded near perennial waters, springs, wells, and wetlands
from 500 feet to 0.25 mile and the avoidance distance within the Muddy Creek/Red Wash sensitive fish
habitat area would be expanded to 0.5 mile. Water quality monitoring on upper Muddy Creek would be
extended to lower Muddy Creek within the CD-C area, which has been designated a 305(b) threatened
stream. Although this alternative describes protections and mitigations for specifically identified
resources, the overall purpose of the alternative would be to maintain healthy ecosystem function at the
landscape level over the entire project area. In so doing, the alternative thus strives to ensure that the
Wyoming Standards for Healthy Rangelands will be satisfied, as well as State water quality state
standards.
Surface Water. Impacts to the surface-water resource would be less in magnitude than those for the
Proposed Action due to the reduced amount of surface disturbance and the enhanced protection of the
specific resources and habitats (particularly along Muddy Creek and its tributaries, where setback
distances on federal minerals and surface would be increased from 500 feet to 0.25 mile or even 0.5 mile
in some cases), which would reduce surface-water impacts. While this alternative does not significantly
reduce the acres of disturbance compared to the Proposed Action and impacts would still occur, it does
identify surface disturbance and population thresholds that, if exceeded, would signal the need for still
more protections and mitigation and then outlines the additional measures that may be required.
Impacts from both authorized and accidental surface discharge of fluids related to surface water Criteria
1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 would be less than the Proposed Action. Impacts related to the discharge/spill of water
would not be considered significant considering the decrease in the amount of surface disturbance and the
increased buffers around surface-water features.
Impacts related to the disturbance/sediment loading would be considered significant for Criterion 6,
depending on the locations of the drill pads and associated roads and pipelines. Impacts related to
disturbance/sediment loading would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Even
though this alternative is directed primarily at habitat protection, it would reduce the potential for creating
impacts that exceed surface-water Criteria 2 and 8 compared to the Proposed Action, given the reduced
number of well pads, reduced surface disturbance, and increased setback distances from specified high
value water resources.
Groundwater. Because this alternative reduces the number of well pads, the risk of contamination of the
groundwater resource would decrease compared to the Proposed Action due to the decreased probability
of a pad being near a water well or above a shallow aquifer, which, by proximity, lowers the chance of
contamination resulting from leaks, spills, or improper drilling techniques, especially poor well casing
and cementing practices.
Impacts related to groundwater removal would not be considered significant for Criterion 1 since the
source aquifers for the springs and seeps are stratigraphically higher than the natural gas exploration
targets and the areas in the vicinity of flowing wells can be avoided when and if new water supply wells
are developed. Due to the amount of available groundwater in storage, groundwater removal resulting
from Alternative B would not significantly impact groundwater quantities. Impacts related to improper
drilling techniques would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2 and 3 due to the use of state-of­
the-art drilling and well-completion techniques included in the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2
and the BMPs and COAs related to drilling that would be implemented. Disposal wells are installed
according to EPA and WDEQ requirements and BMPs and COAs related to handling of fluids would be
implemented so the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of water disposal would be
limited and impacts would not be considered significant for Criterion 2. State-of-the-art pit and pipeline

4-34

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

construction techniques, including the use of pit liners and hydrostatic pressure testing, would protect the
groundwater resource and the impacts from spills resulting from Alternative B would not be considered
significant for Criteria 2 and 3.
4.4.4.5

Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap—60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section

The types of impacts for Alternative C would be the same as those described in Section 4.4.4.1, but
would be reduced in magnitude when compared to the Proposed Action because of the decrease in
disturbance (initial and long-term). Under Alternative C, 5,299 pads would be required for the drilling of
8,950 wells. Total construction-phase surface disturbance would be 42,955 acres, 9 percent less than the
Proposed Action. This alternative designates parts of the project area as “high-density” areas—those areas
that have undergone the greatest natural gas development to date. Within the high-density areas, a 60-acre
cap would be placed on the amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance at any one time per section of
public land. For the remainder of the project area—the low-density areas—the disturbance cap would be
30 acres per section. All prior surface disturbances related to long-term use for roads or on-pad
production facilities and all disturbances that had not been successfully reclaimed would count against the
cap. Acreage that had successfully undergone interim reclamation would not count against the cap. The
aim of this alternative is to encourage better reclamation and reduced surface disturbance, primarily
through increased directional drilling.
Surface Water. Impacts to surface water from Alternative C would be less in magnitude than those for
the Proposed Action due to the capping of disturbance within a 640-acre section of public land. The
disturbance cap in place under this alternative would be closely related to the density of existing
disturbance and the amount of existing reclamation in the project area and would incentivize successful
reclamation.
Impacts related to the discharge/spill of water would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 7 considering the decrease in the amount of surface disturbance.
Impacts related to disturbance/sediment loading would be considered significant for Criteria 2 and 6.
Impacts related to the disturbance/sediment loading would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 3,
4, 5, and 8. This is primarily due to the large reduction in surface disturbance compared to the Proposed
Action.
Groundwater. Because this alternative reduces the number of well pads, the risk of contamination of the
groundwater resource would decrease compared to the Proposed Action due to the decreased probability
of a pad being near a water well or above a shallow aquifer, which, by proximity, lowers the chance of
contamination resulting from leaks, spills, or improper drilling techniques, especially poor well casing
and cementing practices.
Impacts related to groundwater removal would not be considered significant for Criterion 1 since the
source aquifers for the springs and seeps are stratigraphically higher than the natural gas exploration
targets and the areas in the vicinity of flowing wells can be avoided when and if new water supply wells
are developed. Due to the amount of available groundwater in storage, groundwater removal resulting
from Alternative C would not significantly impact groundwater quantities. Impacts related to improper
drilling techniques would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2 and 3 due to the use of state-of­
the-art drilling and well-completion techniques included in the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2
and the BMPs and COAs related to drilling that would be implemented. If disposal wells are installed
according to EPA and WDEQ requirements and if BMPs and COAs related to handling of fluids are
implemented, the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of water disposal would be limited
and impacts would not be considered significant for Criterion 2. State-of-the-art pit and pipeline
construction techniques, including the use of pit liners and hydrostatic pressure testing, would protect the
groundwater resource and impacts from spills resulting from Alternative C would not be considered
significant for Criteria 2 and 3.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

4.4.4.6

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

The types of impacts for Alternative D would be the same as those described in Section 4.4.4.1, but
would be reduced in magnitude when compared to the Proposed Action because of the decrease in initial
and long-term disturbance. Under Alternative D, 4,032 pads would be required for the drilling of 8,950
wells. Total construction-phase surface disturbance would be 36,449 acres, 23 percent less than the
Proposed Action. All natural gas wells on public lands and federal mineral estate would be drilled from
multi-well pads. In sections that have not had oil and gas development at all, one new well pad would be
permitted for all future development. No numerical disturbance caps, no rollover credits, and no new
requirements on reclamation are part of this alternative.
Surface Water. Impacts to surface water would be less in magnitude than those for the Proposed Action
due to the significant reduction in the amount of surface disturbance. Alternative D has the least amount
of surface disturbance of the action alternatives.
Impacts from both authorized and accidental surface discharge of fluids related to surface water would
not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 considering the decrease in the amount of
surface disturbance.
Impacts related to disturbance/sediment loading would be considered significant for Criteria 2 and 6.
Impacts related to the disturbance/sediment loading would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 3,
4, 5, and 8. This is largely the result of reduced disturbance acreage compared with the Proposed Action.
Groundwater. Because this alternative reduces the number of well pads, the risk of contamination of the
groundwater resource would decrease compared to the Proposed Action due to the decreased probability
of a pad being near a water well or above a shallow aquifer, which, by proximity, raises the chance of
contamination resulting from leaks, spills, or improper drilling techniques, especially poor well casing
and cementing practices.
Impacts related to groundwater removal would not be considered significant for Criterion 1 since the
source aquifers for the springs and seeps are stratigraphically higher than the natural gas exploration
targets and the areas in the vicinity of flowing wells can be avoided when and if new water supply wells
are developed. Due to the amount of available groundwater in storage, groundwater removal resulting
from Alternative D would not significantly impact groundwater quantities. Impacts related to improper
drilling techniques would not be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2 and 3 due to the use of state-of­
the-art drilling and well-completion techniques included in the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2
and the BMPs and COAs related to drilling that would be implemented. If disposal wells are installed
according to EPA and WDEQ requirements and if BMPs and COAs related to handling of fluids are
implemented, the likelihood of degradation of groundwater as a result of water disposal would be limited
and the potential of meeting or exceeding Criterion 2 would be low. State-of-the-art pit and pipeline
construction techniques, including the use of pit liners and hydrostatic pressure testing, would protect the
groundwater resource and impacts from spills resulting from Alternative D would not be considered
significant for Criteria 2 and 3.
4.4.4.7

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative (Section 2.2.6), there would be no new surface water or groundwater
impacts.
4.4.5

Summary of Impacts

All action alternatives would result in increased natural gas development in the CD-C project area, with
the principal difference between the alternatives being the amount of surface disturbance. Surface water
impacts resulting from drill pad, access road, facility site, and pipeline right-of-way disturbance would

include: increased sediment loads due to removal of vegetation; exposure of the soil; mixing of soil
horizons; soil compaction; and changes in water quality, channel geometry, and channel stability.
Groundwater impacts would result from the removal of groundwater and subsurface disposal (injection)
of produced water. Impacts to groundwater could also be caused by improper drilling operations—
especially poor well casing and cementing practices—and by accidental releases of fluids associated with
drilling operations, produced water, and other hazardous liquids to soils and surface-water systems. The
following discussion reviews impacts by alternative and discusses the potential to meet or exceed
significance criteria for surface water and groundwater for each action alternative. The evaluation
assumes successful implementation of state-of-the-art drilling and well-completion techniques included in
the BLM’s Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 and the BMPs and COAs included in Appendix C. Table
4.4-1 summarizes the impacts discussion.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

Under the Proposed Action, 6,126 pads would be required for 8,950 wells. The primary surface water
impacts of the Proposed Action would be brought about by contamination from the authorized and
accidental discharge of fluids and the impacts from surface disturbance related to project development
and maintenance. Groundwater impacts would occur during the removal of groundwater and through
subsurface disposal (injection) of produced water. Impacts to groundwater could also be caused by
improper drilling operations and from accidental releases of fluids (spills). Impacts to surface water
would be considered significant for Criteria 1, 2, 6, and 8, depending on the locations of the drill pads and
associated roads and pipelines. Impacts would not be considered significant for groundwater.
Alternative A (100-Percent Vertical Drilling) assumes that all of the wells would be drilled vertically,
resulting in an increase in the number of pads (to 8,950) and associated roads and pipelines. Alternative A
would increase the amount of construction-phase surface disturbance by 31 percent compared to the
Proposed Action. The types of surface water and groundwater impacts would be the same as for the
Proposed Action but the magnitude of the impacts would increase. Impacts to surface water would be
considered significant for all eight criteria. Impacts would not be considered significant for groundwater.
Alternative B (Enhanced Resource Protection) would reduce the number of pads (to 5,798) and reduce the
amount of construction-phase surface disturbance by nearly 4 percent compared to the Proposed Action.
The magnitude of surface water impacts would decrease when compared to the Proposed Action as a
result of the reduced number of well pads—and hence the amount of surface disturbance—and
specifically from the enhanced protection of the Muddy Creek watershed. Impacts to surface water would
be considered significant for Criterion 6. Impacts would not be considered significant for groundwater.
Alternative C (Surface Disturbance Cap—60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section) would reduce the number
of pads (to 5,229) and thus reduce the amount of surface disturbance by 9 percent compared to the
Proposed Action, which would reduce the magnitude of surface-water impacts. In addition to the
reduction of surface disturbance, the aim of this alternative is to encourage improved reclamation success,
primarily through increased directional drilling. Impacts to surface water would be considered significant
for Criteria 2 and 6. Impacts would not be considered significant for groundwater.
Alternative D (Directional Drilling) would reduce the amount of construction-phase surface disturbance
by 23 percent compared to the Proposed Action, which would reduce the magnitude of surface-water
impacts. This alternative reduces surface disturbance primarily through increased directional drilling,
which would reduce the number of pads (to 4,032) and associated roads, pipelines, and other facilities.
This alternative has the least amount of surface disturbance of the action alternatives. Impacts to surface
water would be considered significant for Criteria 2 and 6. Impacts would not be considered significant
for groundwater.
Under Alternative E (No Action Alternative), it is assumed that the development activities proposed by
the CD-C Operators would not occur and there would be no new surface water or groundwater impacts.
4.4.6

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Surface Water. All of the impacts defined in the eight surface water significance criteria (Section
4.4.3.1) would be mitigated to some extent by the measures found in the BMPs and COAs in Appendix C
and by the measures found in state and federal law and regulation. Some of the impacts would be further
mitigated by provisions of the different alternatives. For the most part, loss of wetland function and
degradation of wetland/riparian areas (Criteria 3 and 4), alteration of streamflow characteristics (Criterion
5), and contamination from spilled industrial fluids and produced water (Criterion 7) would be addressed
by these existing protections and mitigations. The exception is Alternative A where surface disturbance
would be at such a level that impacts would not be adequately mitigated.
Total surface disturbance also contributes to the exceedance of significance criteria related to degradation
of water quality and potential soil loss (Criteria 1 and 8). Under the Proposed Action and Alternative A,

4-38

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WATER RESOURCES

total surface disturbance would be great enough that existing protection and mitigation measures would
not necessarily prevent exceedance of significance levels for these criteria. Alternative B specifies an
increase in set-back distances within the Muddy Creek watershed, from 500 feet to 0.25 mile for springs,
wells, and wetlands and to 0.5 mile from perennial streams. This increased set-back would ensure that
Criteria 1 and 8 are not exceeded if state and private lands are included in the set-back. The reduction in
surface disturbance brought about by Alternatives C and D (9 and 23 percent, respectively) combined
with existing mitigation measures would reduce the likelihood of these alternatives exceeding Criteria 1
and 8.
Alternative B would also avoid exceedance of Criterion 2—salt loading—because of the increased set­
back. The Proposed Action and Alternatives A, C, and D would exceed Criterion 2.
Criterion 6—alteration of stream-channel geometry or gradient by accelerated runoff and erosion—would
be exceeded by the Proposed Action and all action alternatives.
Impacts could be reduced for the Proposed Action and Alternatives A, C, and D with the application of
features found in Alternative B. Increased set-back distances would decrease impacts with regard to
Criteria 1 through 4. Such a measure would be most effective if private and state lands were included in
the setback. Implementation of preconstruction planning and design activities that emphasize proper
placement, construction, and maintenance of roads, culverts, drainage ditches would also reduce impacts.
Alternatives C and D would have reduced impacts with regard to all the significance criteria because they
are structured to decrease both the number of well pads—disturbance sites—as well as the total acreage of
disturbance. Any measures applied to the Proposed Action or Alternatives A and B that decrease the
number of disturbance sites and the amount of surface disturbance would also reduce the risk of those
alternatives exceeding the significance criteria.
Groundwater. Groundwater resources would not incur significant adverse impacts with the appropriate
application of protections and mitigation measures found in Appendix C and in state and federal laws
and regulations. No additional mitigation measures would be necessary.

AIR QUALITY
Introduction

The air quality analysis addresses the potential impacts on ambient air quality and Air Quality Related
Values (AQRVs) from air emissions due to the Proposed Action and alternatives and from other regional
emissions sources within a defined study area. Potential ambient air quality impacts were quantified and
compared to applicable state and Federal ambient air quality standards and Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) increments, hazardous air pollutant (HAP) thresholds, and AQRV impacts (impacts
on visibility, atmospheric deposition, and potential increases in acidification to acid-sensitive lakes) were
determined and compared to applicable thresholds.
A near-field ambient air quality impact assessment was performed to evaluate maximum pollutant
impacts within and adjacent to the CD-C project area resulting from project-related development and
production emissions. The EPA's Guideline (EPA, 2005) model, AERMOD (version 11353), was used to
assess these near-field impacts. The near-field criteria pollutant assessment was performed to estimate
maximum impacts of CO, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 from project emissions
sources that are likely to operate during the development and production phases of the Proposed Action
and alternatives. Near-field HAP (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, n-hexane and formaldehyde)
concentrations were calculated for assessing impacts both in the immediate vicinity of project area
emission sources for short-term (acute) exposure assessment and for calculation of long-term risk.
A far-field ambient air quality impact assessment was carried out to quantify potential air quality impacts
to both ambient air concentrations and AQRVs from air pollutant emissions of CO, NOx, SO2, PM10,

Continental Divide-Creston Natural gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—AIR QUALITY

PM2.5, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) expected to result from the development of the CD-C
project as well as the combined effects of the CD-C project and other new sources of emissions in the
region.
The far-field analysis described in this document differs significantly from previous natural gas
development EIS air quality analyses performed for the BLM in Wyoming. Previous BLM analyses used
the CALPUFF dispersion model to assess AQRV impacts in nearby PSD Class I Areas and sensitive PSD
Class II Wilderness Areas from project and cumulative source emissions. For the CD-C impact analysis,
the BLM and Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality Air Quality Division (WDEQ-AQD)
elected to use the CAMx (Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions; ENVIRON 2010)
photochemical grid model (PGM), which is a type of computer model that simulates the formation,
transport, and fate of ozone and other pollutants in the atmosphere. PGMs represent the “state of the
science” in tools and methods for both air quality (including ozone) and AQRV analyses. CAMx was
used to predict maximum potential ambient air quality and AQRV impacts at mandatory federal PSD
Class I and other sensitive PSD Class II areas, as well as designated acid-sensitive lakes. The CAMx
analysis includes mid-field analyses which quantify impacts within the CD-C project area. Mid-field air
quality impacts are compared to applicable ambient air quality standards.
The far-field modeling approach was determined by ozone air quality levels in Wyoming. Recent high
levels of observed ozone dictated the choice of far-field modeling tools and methods. Ozone (O3) is an
important component of photochemical smog. Ozone is not emitted directly into the atmosphere, but is
formed from photochemical reactions of precursor species in the presence of sunlight. The most important
precursors are NOx and VOCs. High ozone episodes occur most typically in urban areas during summer.
Under these conditions, there is an abundance of ozone precursors from human activities and the high
angle of the summer sun means there is sufficient sunlight available to drive the photochemical reactions
which produce ozone. High summer temperatures enhance VOC emissions and speed the chemical
reactions which produce ozone from its precursors.
In 2005, high ozone was measured in Sublette County, WY during winter. The phenomenon of winter
high ozone under conditions with low sun angles and cold temperatures was novel, particularly because
Sublette County is a relatively rural area whose main source of emissions is oil and gas exploration and
production. High ozone levels were recorded again in Sublette County in 2006, 2008, and 2011. High
winter ozone has also been measured in the Uinta Basin region in rural eastern Utah in recent years. Oil
and gas production also occurs in the Uinta Basin.
In March 2009 the Governor of Wyoming recommended to the EPA that Sublette County and parts of
northeastern Lincoln and northwestern Sweetwater Counties be designated ozone non-attainment areas
under the 2008 75 parts per billion (ppb) ozone standard. Because of the importance of ozone as an air
quality issue in Wyoming, the CD-C air quality impact analysis included evaluation of the effects of
emissions from the Proposed Action on ozone throughout the study area (Map 3.5-1)..
The CD-C project area is located in eastern Sweetwater and western Carbon Counties. Although the
project does not lie within the area proposed for non-attainment designation, the CD-C impact analysis
evaluated potential ozone impacts from the Proposed Action emissions on ozone in Sublette, northeastern
Lincoln, and northwestern Sweetwater Counties as well as the rest of the study area.
An emission inventory was developed for the Proposed Action and alternatives for each year over the
expected life of the project. This emission inventory was used in the near-field, mid-field and far-field
analyses. Emission inventories for all regional emissions sources from human activities and natural
sources (e.g. wildfires) were compiled for use in the far-field modeling. In the following sections, the
emission inventory development is described. Next, the modeling approaches for both near- and far-field
analyses are detailed, and finally, the results of the analyses are given.

frames established within the State of Wyoming’s Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP).
4. Reduce atmospheric deposition pollutants to levels below generally accepted Levels of Concern and
Limits of Acceptable Change.
Significance Criteria
If and when specific activities are proposed at the implementation stage requiring quantitative analysis,
impacts to air quality would be compared to the following significance criteria:



Emission Inventory Development
CD-C Project Alternative Emission Inventory Development

Emission inventories for CD-C project area development and production activities were compiled for the
air quality impact assessment for all existing sources and for all new sources associated with the Proposed
Action and alternatives.
There are two different types of activities (field development and production) associated with the CD-C
project for which emission inventories were compiled. Emission-generating activities during field
development include well pad and access road construction, drilling, fracking/completion, vehicle travel
during the drilling and completion phase, and construction and vehicle travel during installation of
gathering and sales pipeline systems. Production emissions were calculated for dehydration units,
separators, gathering pipelines, blowdown tanks, and water/condensate storage tanks. Ancillary facilities
included new compressor engines at current and proposed sites as well as central gas processing facilities.
The specific components of field development and production emissions and total field-wide emissions
are discussed in the Air Quality Technical Support Document (AQTSD) and its Appendices (available on
the CD-C Natural Gas Development Project EIS website).
The CD-C project emission inventory was developed using data from the CD-C Operators as the primary
source of information. The inventory accounted for all applicable emissions controls such as New Source
Performance Standards (NSPS) and new Tier standards for non-road engines. The most important of these
emissions controls are those specifically targeted at Wyoming oil and gas sources.
The WDEQ-AQD regulates emissions from oil and gas sources through the Oil and Gas Permitting
Guidance (WDEQ-AQD, 2010). Different regulations apply in different regions of the state, with the
most stringent level of controls applied to the areas with highest measured ambient ozone concentrations

that occur in the Jonah-Pinedale Anticline Development (JPAD) area shown in Figure 4.5-1. The CD-C
project lies within a region of intensive oil and gas development known as the Concentrated Development
Area (CDA). Under the WDEQ-AQD 2010 guidance, emissions controls are required in the CDA for the
following source categories:

The field-wide emissions for the Proposed Action and alternatives are summarized in Table 4.5-2. The
first column shows emissions for existing project area sources in the year 2008. The second column
shows emissions from these 2008 sources within the project area forecast to the year 2022. These
emissions represent the No Action Alternative in which the CD-C project is not developed. The Proposed
Action column shows emissions from Proposed Action sources in the year 2022, and the total project area
emissions in year 2022 gives the sum of emissions from existing sources and Proposed Action sources
within the CD-C project area. The column furthest to the right shows the difference in emissions between
the total CD-C field wide emissions in 2022 and year 2008 field-wide emissions. Year 2022 emissions are
shown since the peak emissions for the Proposed Action alternative are estimated to occur during 2022.

Greenhouse Gases

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases
(GHGs) such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act;
however, there are currently no ambient air quality standards for GHGs, nor are there currently any
emissions limits on GHGs that would apply to sources developed under the Proposed Action and
alternatives. There are, however, applicable reporting requirements under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas
Reporting Program. These GHG emission reporting requirements, finalized in 2010 under 40 CFR Part
98, will require the CD-C project proponents to develop and report annual methane and CO2 emissions
from equipment leaks and venting, and emissions of CO2, methane and nitrous oxide from flaring,
onshore production stationary and portable combustion emissions, and combustion emissions from
stationary equipment. At present, there are no rules related to GHG emissions or impacts that would affect
development of the Proposed Action and action alternatives, besides these GHG reporting requirements.
Both the exploration/construction and production phases of the Proposed Action and the development
alternatives will cause emissions of GHGs. Methane comprises much of the chemical composition of
natural gas, and nitrous oxide, CO2, and methane are emitted by engines used for drill rigs, compressor
engines, etc. As part of the development of the CD-C project emission inventory, an inventory of CO2,
methane, and nitrous oxide was prepared for all emissions source categories. GHGs were not modeled in
either the near-field or far-field impact analyses, but the GHG inventory is presented here for
informational purposes and is compared to other U.S. GHG emission inventories in order to provide
context for the CD-C project GHG emissions. This inventory is presented in the AQTSD, Section 2.1.6.
In the CD-C project emission inventory, emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O from new
and existing sources are quantified in terms of CO2 equivalents. Measuring emissions in terms of CO2
equivalents allows for the comparison of emissions from different GHGs based on their Global Warming
Potential (GWP). GWP is defined as the cumulative radiative forcing of a gas over a specified time
horizon relative to a reference gas resulting from the emission of a unit mass of gas. The reference gas is
taken to be CO2. The CO2 equivalent emissions for a greenhouse gas are derived by multiplying the
emissions of the gas by the associated GWP. The GWPs for the inventoried GHGs are CO2:1, CH4:21,
N2O:310 (EPA, 2011). Details of the greenhouse gas emissions calculations are provided in the AQTSD
(greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the project are shown in AQTSD Figure 2-13.) The CD-C
project’s peak CO2 equivalent emissions year will be 2022. Field-wide GHG emissions for the existing
project in year 2008, the existing 2008 project projected for year 2022 (No Action Alternative), the CD-C
Proposed Action in year 2022, the total project area emissions in year 2022 (existing sources taken
together with the Proposed Action), and the difference in emissions between the total CD-C field
emissions (including the Proposed Action emissions) and year 2008 field-wide emissions are summarized
in Table 4.5-3.

Regional Emission Inventory Development

In addition to the CD-C project emissions, emission inventories for other regional existing and proposed
emissions sources within a continental-scale modeling domain (Map 4.5-1) were constructed and used for
cumulative modeling analyses. Emission inventories prepared by the Western Regional Air Partnership
(WRAP), Carter Lake, and BP and other Operators formed the basis for the regional emission inventories
for the CD-C project far-field air quality impact analysis. Sources of PM10, PM2.5, NOx, CO, SO2, and
VOC emissions within the study area were inventoried. Emission inventories and projections from
various state and federal agencies were used to update the WRAP analyses as appropriate for each of the
years modeled. Three categories of regional emissions inventories were compiled: two base case years
(2005-6), a baseline year (2008), and a future year (2022). These inventories are described in detail in the
AQTSD and its Appendices. The project and regional emissions were used in air quality modeling
analysis of near-field and far-field impacts.

Air Quality Modeling
Near-Field Modeling

A near-field ambient air quality impact assessment was performed to evaluate maximum pollutant
impacts within and adjacent to the CD-C project area resulting from the Proposed Action and alternative
development and production emissions. AERMOD (version 11353), combined with three years (2008­
2010) of hourly meteorological data collected near Wamsutter, Wyoming were used in the analysis to
assess these near-field impacts. The near-field criteria pollutant assessment was performed to estimate
maximum potential impacts of CO, NOx, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 from project emissions sources that are
likely to operate during the development and production phases of the Proposed Action and action
alternatives. Production activities include well production, expanded field compression and a new gas
processing facility. Well field development activities that were modeled included well pad and access
road construction, and well drilling. Modeling scenarios were also developed that included wells in
production in close proximity to well pads where well drilling operations are occurring.
For 1-hour NO2 NAAQS compliance demonstrations, where 1-hour NAAQS is defined as the 3-year
average of the 98th percentile of the yearly distribution of 1-hour daily maximum concentrations, all
modeled impacts presented represent the 3-year average of the eighth-highest daily maximum 1-hour
concentrations. For scenarios where drilling operations were modeled, drilling operations were assumed
to occur for a maximum of 2 years during the 3-year averaging period. Since drill rigs move to different
locations during field development, it is not likely that a drilling operation would occur over 3
consecutive years in the same location.
For all criteria pollutant modeling scenarios, two model receptor grids were used for disclosing modeled
impacts: one assuming a 100-meter distance from project sources, and another using a 250-meter distance
from project sources. Representative background pollutant concentrations were added to modeled impacts
and the total impacts compared to applicable Wyoming and National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(WAAQS and NAAQS). Direct modeled pollutant impacts from project emission were compared with
applicable PSD Class II increments. The comparisons to the PSD Class II increments are intended to
evaluate a threshold of concern for potential impacts and do not represent a regulatory PSD increment
comparison.
Near-field HAP (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, n-hexane and formaldehyde) concentrations
were calculated for assessing impacts both in the immediate vicinity of project alternative sources for
short-term (acute) exposure assessment and for calculation of long-term risk. Short-term (1-hour) HAP
concentrations were compared to acute Reference Exposure Levels (RELs). Long-term exposures to
HAPs emitted by project alternative sources were compared to Reference Concentrations for Chronic
Inhalation (RfCs), and were evaluated based on estimates of the increased latent cancer risk over a 70­
year lifetime. Two estimates of cancer risk were made: one that corresponds to a most-likely-exposure
(MLE) over a national residency average of 9 years with some time spent away from home, and one
reflective of the maximally-exposed-individual (MEI) residing at one location for a lifetime with no time
spent away from home. The cancer risks for all constituents were then summed to provide an estimate of
the total inhalation cancer risk.
For all HAP modeling scenarios, 100-meter and 250-meter receptor distances from project sources were
used. In addition, for risk assessments the distance from a source where the cancer risk is expected to fall

Far-Field Modeling

The purpose of the far-field modeling was to quantify potential air quality impacts to both ambient air
concentrations and AQRVs from air pollutant emissions of NOx, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, VOC, and CO
expected to result from the development of the CD-C project as well as the combined effects of the CD-C

project and other new sources of emissions in the region. The CAMx model was used to estimate impacts
throughout the study area shown in the right-hand panel of Map 4.5-1. Impacts were estimated using two
meteorological modeling years (2005 and 2006). Wind fields for these two meteorology years were
developed using the PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5; Anthes and Warner 1978; Dudhia
1993).
The PSD Class I areas and sensitive PSD Class II areas analyzed in the far-field analyses include the
following:

The CAMx model was used to estimate ambient air quality impacts of CO, NO2, SO2, O3, PM10, and
PM2.5 throughout the study area, and to estimate nitrogen and sulfur deposition at the Class I and sensitive
Class II areas. CAMx concentration estimates were used to calculate visibility impacts at the Class I and
sensitive Class II areas. Impacts to potential sensitive lake acidification were calculated using CAMx
estimated sulfur and nitrogen deposition values.
The impact analysis includes an assessment of CD-C project source contributions to regional ozone
formation, comparisons of modeled criteria pollutant impacts to applicable Class I and Class II
increments at the Class I and sensitive Class Il areas, and assessments of project impacts to AQRVs
(visibility, atmospheric deposition, and sensitive lake acidification) at the Class I and sensitive Class II
areas compared with applicable threshold values. The far-field analysis includes mid-field criteria
pollutant analyses which compare CAMx-estimated criteria pollutant levels within the CD-C project area
to applicable ambient air quality standards.
Far-Field Modeling Approach
The basic modeling strategy used in any analysis that employs a photochemical grid model, such as
CAMx, is to first evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce ambient observations of trace pollutants
during a recent historical episode (the “current year” or “base case year”); then, once confidence in the
model is established, a future year case can be run and the potential impacts of the project evaluated.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—AIR QUALITY

A current year base case is simulated using a comprehensive regional emission inventory of actual
emissions from all sources (including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas exploration and
production sources, biogenic sources, etc.). It is preferable to run the model for more than one year so that
as many different meteorological regimes as possible are simulated. Pollutants emitted from project
sources may only influence a particular sensitive receptor under certain conditions (wind direction,
atmospheric stability) and a conservative estimate of AQ and AQRV impacts requires that those
conditions be simulated. While it is not possible to ensure that all possible meteorological conditions that
might lead to transport of pollutants from project sources to sensitive receptors are simulated, modeling
two full years increases the likelihood that the relevant conditions would occur.
The base case simulation is evaluated with respect to ambient air quality measurements. If the base case
simulation reproduces concentrations of observed species with reasonable accuracy, then the model can
be used in the future year impact assessment. The next step is to prepare a baseline model for use in future
year projections. The only difference between the base case model and the baseline model is that the
baseline model uses typical emissions while the base case model uses actual emissions. An example of an
emissions source category for which the base case and baseline emissions are different is electrical
generating units (EGUs). The base case emission inventory uses hourly EGU emissions derived from
continuous emissions monitoring (CEM) data because the base case model is evaluated against concurrent
observations to determine whether the model provides a realistic simulation of atmospheric processes.
The purpose of the baseline model, on the other hand, is to serve as the base year from which future year
projections are made. The baseline EGU emissions are used to represent typical conditions (no shutdowns
for maintenance, for example) in order to be consistent with the future year emissions, which also
represent typical conditions. The baseline emission inventory, therefore, is usually identical to the base
case emission inventory, except for the difference in emissions from EGUs and other source categories
with large variability in time, such as drill rigs.
The future year modeling involves development of a future year project emission inventory as well as a
future year regional emission inventory. In the future year regional emission inventory, the emissions
from human activities are projected from the base year to the future year and changes such as population
growth and planned emissions controls (such as controls on motor vehicle emissions) are accounted for.
Emissions that are not controllable, such as biogenics and wildfire emissions, are held fixed. The project
emissions are included in the future year emission inventory. The model is run using the future year
regional emission inventory with the rest of the model (meteorological fields, boundary conditions, model
settings, etc.) in the same configuration as in the base case. If multiple years were simulated in the base
case, then the meteorological conditions for those same years are used together with the future year
emissions scenario in the future year modeling. Project AQ and AQRV impacts are determined from the
future year simulations.
In the CD-C analysis, CAMx was used to perform modeling of the base case years (2005-6), the baseline
year (2008), and the future year (2022).

Direct and Indirect Impacts

Direct, indirect, and cumulative air quality impacts were analyzed to predict maximum potential nearfield (surrounding the CD-C project area), mid-field (within the CD-C project area) and far-field (regional
and PSD Class I and sensitive PSD Class II areas) ambient air pollutant concentrations, as well as
maximum impacts to visibility (regional haze), and atmospheric deposition (acid rain) impacts. Analyses
were also performed to predict maximum mid-field (within the CDC-project area) pollutant
concentrations. Summaries of the impacts for each of the Proposed Action and alternatives are provided
below.

4.5.7.1

Proposed Action

The Proposed Action includes the construction and operation of 8,950 natural gas wells, associated roads
and production facilities, including compression and gas processing facilities. The proposed natural gas
wells would be drilled either conventionally (with a single vertical well bore on each well pad) or with
multiple directional well bores from a single pad.
Near-Field Modeling
Near-field modeling analyses were performed for the Proposed Action production and well field
development activities. Criteria pollutant impacts were evaluated for both production and construction
activities; however, HAP pollutant impacts were evaluated for only production activities since HAP
emissions result primarily from well production activities. Production activities include well production,
expanded field compression and a new gas processing facility. Well field development activities that were
modeled included well pad and access road construction, and well drilling. Modeling scenarios were also
developed that included wells in production in close proximity to well pads where well drilling operations
are occurring, including a case where four drill rigs are operating within one land section. Two model
receptor grids were used for disclosing modeled impacts; one assuming a 100-meter distance from project
sources, and another using a 250-meter distance from project sources.
For 1-hour NO2 NAAQS compliance demonstrations, all modeled impacts represent the 3-year average of
the eighth-highest daily maximum 1-hour concentrations. For scenarios where drilling operations were
modeled, drilling operations were assumed to occur for a maximum of 2 years during the 3-year
averaging period. Since drill rigs move to different locations during field development, it is not likely that
a drilling operation would occur over 3 consecutive years in the same location. The yearly maximum
eighth-highest daily maximum 1-hour NO2 concentrations for all modeled scenarios are provided in
Appendix L of the AQTSD.
For 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS compliance demonstrations from well pad and access road construction, all
modeled impacts represent the 3-year average of the maximum 24-hour concentrations from three
separate activities, assuming well pad and access road construction occurs over 1 year, drilling operations
occur for 1 year and well production activities occur for 1 year. Since well pad and access road
construction would be temporary (occurring over a 5 –7 day period) and in isolation, this scenario
represents a conservative estimate of PM2.5 concentrations in the vicinity of a well pad. The yearly
maximum 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations for all modeled scenarios are provided in Appendix L of the
AQTSD.
The maximum modeled criteria pollutant impacts from any of the production activities associated with the
Proposed Action are shown in Tables 4.5-4a and 4.5-4b. Table 4.5-4a presents the model results at the
100-meter distance from project sources and Table 4.5-4b presents the results for the 250-meter receptor
distance. As indicated in Tables 4.5-4a and 4.5-4b, impacts from Proposed Action production sources
would be below the NAAQS or WAAQS, and would not exceed the PSD Class II increments.

distances from project sources. As described earlier in this section, the 1-hour NO2 and the 24-hour PM2.5
results are calculated as a three-year average based on modeling the Proposed Action field development
and field production sources of air emissions. The scenarios modeled for determining air quality impacts
from NOx emission sources included Tier 2 drill rig operation and multi-well pads with 16 wells in
production. For PM2.5 emission sources, the scenario modeled includes the emissions from 4 single well
pads and access roads under construction, 4 Tier 2 drill rigs operating, and 4 single wells in production.
As indicated in Tables 4.5-5a and 4.5-5b the Proposed Action field development source emissions would
not result in any exceedances of the NAAQS or WAAQS at the 250-meter distance. However, modeled
impacts for the 100-meter receptor distance case did result in short-term concentrations that were
predicted to be above the 1-hour NO2 NAAQS, the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10
WAAQS.
Tables providing the individual annual modeled 8th highest daily maximum 1-hour NO2 concentrations
and the individual annual modeled maximum 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations predicted for all modeling
scenarios are presented in Appendix L of the AQTSD, and the results are discussed in AQTSD Section
3.5.4.
In order to demonstrate compliance with the NAAQS and WAAQS additional mitigation measures will
be required through the application of one or more emission control measures, such as those described in
Section 4.5.9 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation could be implemented.
Note that the emissions from field development activities would be temporary and would not consume
PSD increment, and as a result are excluded from increment comparisons.
Additional details on the near-field criteria pollutant modeling impact assessment are provided in Section
3.5 of the AQTSD.

Two estimates of cancer risk were made: one that corresponds to most-likely-exposure (MLE) over a
national residency average of 9 years with some time spent away from home, and one reflective of the
maximally-exposed-individual (MEI) residing at one location for a lifetime with no time spent away from
home. The cancer risks for all constituents were then summed to provide an estimate of the total
inhalation cancer risk.
Near-field modeling was also performed to estimate the long-term risk, for both the most-likely-exposure
(MLE) and maximally-exposed-individual (MEI) scenarios, from benzene, ethyl benzene, and
formaldehyde emissions resulting from production activities. Table 4.5-8 presents the cancer risk

estimates for the proposed compression and gas plant facilities, for both the 100-meter and 250-meter
receptor cases, and at the distance required to be below a one-in-one-million cancer risk level for either
the MLE or MEI analysis. The modeling results indicate that for the MLE analysis the cancer risk is
below one-in-one-million at the 100-meter distance for both the proposed compression and gas plant
facilities. For the MEI analysis the distance where the cancer risk would fall below a one-in-one-million
cancer risk level is 0.25 miles for the proposed compression facility, and 1.0 miles for the proposed gas
plant. Note that the risk estimates for the compression and gas plant facilities only considered
formaldehyde emissions, since benzene and ethyl benzene emissions for these facilities would be
negligible.

Table 4.5-9 presents the cancer risk estimates for a multi-well pad, with 16 wells in production, for both
the 100-meter and 250-meter receptor cases, and at the distance required to be below a one-in-one-million
cancer risk level for either the MLE or MEI analysis. The modeling results indicate that for the MLE
analysis the cancer risk is one-in-one-million at the 250-meter distance. For the MEI analysis the distance
where the cancer risk would fall below a one-in-one-million cancer risk level is 1.25 miles. Mitigation
measures for NOx emissions that will be required to demonstrate compliance with the 1-hour NO2
NAAQS will also decrease the predicted cancer risk impact for formaldehyde (see Section 4.5.9
Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation).
Additional details on the near-field HAP modeling impact assessment are provided in Section 3.6 of the

Total risk is calculated here; however, the additive effects of multiple chemicals are not fully understood and this should be taken
into account when viewing these results.

Far-Field Modeling
Far-field modeling using the CAMx model was performed to quantify potential air quality impacts to both
ambient air concentrations and AQRVs from air pollutant emissions of NOx, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, VOC, and
CO expected to result from the development of the Proposed Action as well as the combined effects of the
CD-C project and other new sources of emissions in the region. Key results of the analysis of the air
quality and AQRV impacts of the Proposed Action are described below. Additional detail is provided in
Section 4.5 of the AQTSD.
Criteria Pollutants Including Ozone
The results of the far-field modeling showed that the Proposed Action would make no significant
contribution to modeled exceedances of the NAAQS, WAAQS or Colorado Ambient Air Quality
Standards (CAAQS) for ozone (see AQTSD Section 4.5.4) or any other criteria pollutant (see AQTSD
Section 4.5.3).
The Proposed Action source contribution to future year ozone formation was assessed using two methods:
the EPA’s Modeled Attainment Test Software (MATS; Abt, 2009) and absolute modeled concentrations.
The MATS-estimated Proposed Action maximum impact on future year 8-hour average ozone
concentrations would be less than or equal to 0.8 ppb. The two-year approximation to future-year 8-hour
average ozone concentrations estimated using absolute CAMx model concentrations shows the Proposed

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-55

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—AIR QUALITY

Action maximum ozone impact would be 1.6 ppb or less. For both the absolute modeled concentration
and MATS results, the largest ozone impacts due to the Proposed Action emissions were in the vicinity of
the CD-C project area. In Sublette County, where the only MATS-projected exceedances of the 75 ppb
NAAQS within the study area would occur, ozone impacts due to the Proposed Action were extremely
small, and were less than or equal to 0.04 ppb. The highest CD-C ozone contributions to ozone in the
study area occurred on days when regional 8-hour ozone would be low (<60ppb).
PSD increments were not exceeded at any Class I or sensitive Class II area within the study area.
Mid-Field Impacts
CAMx estimated criteria pollutant impacts from Proposed Action sources and from Proposed Action
sources and regional sources, within and near the CD-C project area are shown in Table 4.5-10. As
indicated in Table 4.5-10 the cumulative impacts resulting from project and regional sources would be
below the applicable ambient air quality standards and the direct project impacts would be below the PSD
Class II Increments.

AQRV Impacts
Visibility Impacts. Visibility impacts estimated using the FLAG 2010 method at Class I and sensitive
Class II areas resulting from Proposed Action source emissions are shown in Table 4.5-11. An additional
method (BLM method) was used to evaluate visibility impacts and the results are presented in the
AQTSD, Section 4.6.1.
The visibility analysis indicated a maximum of 5 days with CD-C project emissions resulting in impacts
greater than the 0.5 delta-deciviews (Δdv) threshold at any of the Class I and sensitive Class II areas
analyzed for both the 2005 and 2006 meteorological data. Using the 98th percentile or eighth-highest
value as a threshold (as recommended in the FLAG 2010 document) there would be zero days above the
0.5 Δdv threshold at any of the Class I or sensitive Class II areas.

Deposition Impacts
Modeling results for Proposed Action source emissions indicated that there were no nitrogen or sulfur
deposition impacts that exceeded the BLM critical load values at any Class I/sensitive Class II area;
however, the deposition analysis threshold (DAT) for nitrogen was exceeded at several Class I areas
near/downwind of CD-C project area. Deposition impacts are summarized in Section 4.6.2 of the
AQTSD.
Acidification at Sensitive Lakes. Modeling results for Proposed Action sources indicated that there would
be no ANC changes at any of the 12 analyzed lakes that exceeded the 10-percent threshold or the
ΔANC<1 µeq/L threshold for the two extremely sensitive lakes. Lake ANC impacts are summarized in
Section 4.6.3 of the AQTSD.
Regional Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The current scientific consensus is that the warming of the climate system is “unequivocal” and
“continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and induce
many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than
those observed during the 20th century.” (IPCC, 2007). Specific regional effects of climate change are
highly uncertain (see section 3.5 Air Quality), but may include extreme weather, adverse health impacts
due to increased intensity and duration of heat waves, and seasonally decreasing water supplies that
exacerbate competition for over-allocated water resources. As discussed in Chapter 3, it is not possible to
attribute emissions of GHGs from any particular source as having a specific climate impact, globally or
regionally, due to the longevity of GHGs in the atmosphere. GHG emissions from all sources contribute
to increased incremental concentrations in the earth’s atmosphere and to the global climate response.
The maximum greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the Proposed Action source emissions are
estimated at 5.2 tg/yr of CO2 equivalent emissions. The CD-C project’s peak CO2 equivalent emissions
year is 2022, in which the combined emissions from new Proposed Action sources and existing sources
would be approximately 10 tg/year. To place the CD-C project’s GHG emissions in context, the GHG
emissions from the top four emitting coal-fired power plants in Wyoming range from 3-15 tg/year (data
from <http://epa.gov/-climatechange/emissions/ghgdata/2010data.html>). CD-C project GHGs would be
comparable to the total GHG emissions from the City of San Francisco (10 tg/year;
<http://www.sfenvironment.org/-downloads/library/climateactionplan.pdf>) during the year 2000).
4.5.7.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A includes the construction and operation of 8,950 natural gas wells, associated roads, and
production facilities, including compression and gas processing facilities. All the proposed natural gas
wells would be drilled conventionally, with a single vertical well bore on each well pad.

Near-Field Modeling
The maximum modeled criteria pollutant impacts from any of the production activities associated with
Alternative A production facilities would be similar to the Proposed Action; however, pollutant impacts
from individual well sites would be less given the wells would be drilled on single well pads. The impacts
for Alternative A production facilities are shown in Tables 4.5-12a and 4.5-12b. As indicated in these
tables, impacts from Alternative A production sources would be below the NAAQS or WAAQS, and
would not exceed the PSD Class II increments.

The maximum modeled criteria pollutant impacts from well development activities associated with
Alternative A would differ slightly from the Proposed Action, given Alternative A is a vertical well
drilling alternative. The maximum modeled criteria pollutant impacts from well development activities
are shown in Tables 4.5-13a and 4.5-13b for both the 100-meter and 250-meter receptor distances from
project sources. As described in Section 4.5.7,1 the 1-hour NO2 and the 24-hour PM2.5 results are
calculated as a three-year average based on modeling Alternative A field development and field
production sources of air emissions. The scenarios used for modeling air quality impacts from NOx
emission sources included Tier 2 drill rig operation and single wells in production. For PM2.5 emission
sources, the scenario modeled includes the emissions from a 4 single-well pads and access roads under
construction, 4 Tier 2 drill rigs operating, and 4 single wells in production. As indicated in Tables 4.5-13a
and 4.5-13b, Alternative A field development source emissions would not result in any exceedances of
the NAAQS or WAAQS at the 250-meter distance. However, modeled impacts for the 100-meter receptor
distance case did result in short-term concentrations that were predicted to be above the 1-hour NO2
NAAQS, the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10 WAAQS.
Tables providing the individual annual modeled 8th highest daily maximum 1-hour NO2 concentrations
and the individual annual modeled maximum 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations predicted for all modeling
scenarios are presented in Appendix L of the AQTSD, and the results are discussed in AQTSD Section
3.5.4.
In order to demonstrate compliance with the NAAQS and WAAQS, additional mitigation measures will
be required through application of one or more emission control measures, such as those described in
Section 4.5.9 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation.
Note that the emissions from field development activities are temporary and do not consume PSD
increment, and as a result are excluded from increment comparisons.

The maximum predicted acute and chronic (long-term) HAP impacts from well site production would be
less than the impacts presented in Section 4.5.4 for the Proposed Action since there would be no multiwell pads developed. HAP impacts for the proposed compression and gas plant facilities would be the
same as the Proposed Action. HAP impacts under Alternative A would be below all applicable REL and
RfC exposure thresholds. For the suspected carcinogens (benzene, ethyl benzene, and formaldehyde) the
maximum distance required to be below a one-in-one-million cancer risk level for production activities
for either the MLE or MEI analysis would be 1.0 miles as a result of the gas plant emissions. Mitigation
measures for NOx emissions that will be required to demonstrate compliance with the 1-hour NO2
NAAQS will also decrease the predicted cancer risk impact associated with formaldehyde (see Section
4.5.9 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation).

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B includes the construction and operation of 8,950 natural gas wells, associated roads and
production facilities, including compression and gas processing facilities. The proposed natural gas wells
would be drilled using a combination of vertical and directional drilling techniques.

Near-field modeling impacts for Alternative B would be similar to those presented in Section 4.5.4 for the
Proposed Action. Impacts from Alternative B production sources would be below the NAAQS or
WAAQS, and would not exceed the PSD Class II increments.
Alternative B field development source emissions would not result in any exceedances of the NAAQS or
WAAQS at the 250-meter distance; however, modeled impacts for the 100-meter receptor distance case
did result in short-term concentrations that were predicted to be above the 1-hour NO2 NAAQS, the 24­
hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10 WAAQS. In order to demonstrate compliance with the
NAAQS and WAAQS, additional mitigation measures will be required through application of one or
more emission control measures, such as those described in Section 4.5.9 Additional Mitigation.
The maximum predicted acute and chronic (long-term) HAP impacts from well site production would be
similar to the impacts for the Proposed Action. HAP impacts under Alternative B would be below all
applicable REL and RfC exposure thresholds. For the suspected carcinogens (benzene, ethyl benzene, and
formaldehyde) the maximum distance required to be below a one-in-one-million cancer risk level for
production activities for either the MLE or the MEI analysis would be 1.25 miles as a result of the
emissions for a single well pad with 16 wells in production. Mitigation measures for NOx emissions that

Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance for High and Low-Density Development
Areas

Alternative C includes the construction and operation of 8,950 natural gas wells, associated roads, and
production facilities, including compression and gas processing facilities. The proposed natural gas wells
would be drilled using a combination of vertical and directional drilling techniques.
Near-Field Modeling
Near-field modeling impacts for Alternative C would be similar to those presented in Section 4.5.4 for the

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Alternative D includes the construction and operation of 8,950 natural gas wells, associated roads, and
production facilities, including compression and gas processing facilities. The proposed natural gas wells
would be drilled either conventionally, with a single vertical well bore on each well pad, or with multiple
directional well bores from a single pad; however, the majority of the wells would be directional.
Near-Field Modeling
Near-field modeling impacts for Alternative D production facilities would be similar to those presented in
Section 4.5.4.1 (Tables 4.5-4a and 4.5-4b) for the Proposed Action. Impacts from Alternative D
production sources would below the NAAQS or WAAQS, and would not exceed the PSD Class II
increments.
The maximum modeled criteria pollutant impacts from well development activities associated with
Alternative D would be similar to the Proposed Action; however, given that Alternative D is mainly a
directional well drilling alternative, additional modeling scenarios are presented in this section for only
multi-well cases. The maximum modeled criteria pollutant impacts from well development activities are
shown in Tables 4.5-14a and 4.5-14b for both the 100-meter and 250-meter receptor distances from
project sources.
As described earlier in Section 4.5.7.1, the 1-hour NO2 and the 24-hour PM2.5 results are calculated as a
three-year average based on modeling Alterative D field development and field production sources of air
emissions. The scenarios modeled for determining air quality impacts from NOx emission sources
included Tier 2 drill rig operation and multi-well pads with 16 wells in production. For PM2.5 emission

4-64

sources, the scenario modeled includes the emissions from 4 multi-well pads and access roads under
construction, 4 Tier 2 drill rigs operating, and 4, 4-well pads in production. As indicated in Tables 4.514a and 4.5-14b Alternative D field development source emissions would not result in any exceedances
of the NAAQS or WAAQS at the 250-meter distance. However, modeled impacts for the 100-meter
receptor distance case did result in short-term concentrations that were predicted to be above the 1-hour
NO2 NAAQS, the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10 WAAQS.
Tables providing the individual annual modeled 8th highest daily maximum 1-hour NO2 concentrations
and the individual annual modeled maximum 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations predicted for all modeling
scenarios are presented in Appendix L of the AQTSD, and the results are discussed in AQTSD Section
3.5.4.
In order to demonstrate compliance with the NAAQS and WAAQS additional mitigation measures will
be required through application of one or more emission control measures, such as those described in
Section 4.5.9 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation.
Note that the emissions from field development activities would be temporary and would not consume
PSD increment, and as a result are excluded from increment comparisons.
Additional detail on near-field modeling methods and results is provided in Section 3.5 of the AQTSD.

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, it is assumed that no new natural gas wells would be developed. Air
pollutant concentration impacts would remain near current levels as a result of existing development.
Near-Field Modeling
There would be no new development under Alternative E (No Action). Therefore there would be no
increase in ambient air concentrations and the existing project impacts would be below the NAAQS,
WAAQS, and PSD Class II increments. There would be no change in current criteria pollutant and HAP
concentrations impacts resulting from existing project area sources.
Far-Field Modeling
Criteria Pollutants Including Ozone. Criteria pollutant impacts would be less than the impacts presented
in Section 4.5.4 for the Proposed Action, since there would be no new sources proposed under
Alternative E. The existing CD-C project area sources would not contribute to modeled exceedances of
the NAAQS, WAAQS, or CAAQS for ozone or any other criteria pollutant. PSD increments would not be
exceeded at any Class I or sensitive Class II areas.
Mid-Field Impacts
Alternative E criteria pollutant impacts from existing project sources and regional sources within and near
the CD-C project area are shown in Table 4.5-15. The cumulative impacts resulting from existing CD-C
project and regional sources would be below the applicable ambient air quality standards and the direct
project impacts would be below the PSD Class II increments.

AQRV Impacts
Visibility Impacts. Visibility impacts for Alternative E source emissions, estimated using both the FLAG
2010 and BLM methods, would be below the 0.5 Δdv threshold at all of the Class I and sensitive Class II
areas analyzed for both the 2005 and 2006 meteorological data. Visibility results are summarized in
Section 4.6.1 of the AQTSD.
Deposition Impacts. Modeling results for Alternative E source emissions indicated that there would be no
nitrogen or sulfur deposition impacts that exceeded the BLM critical load values at any Class I or
sensitive Class II area. Deposition impacts would be below the DAT for all Class I and sensitive Class II
areas, with the exception of the Savage Run Wilderness Area, where impacts are above the DAT for
nitrogen. Deposition impacts are summarized in Section 4.6.2 of the AQTSD.
Acidification at Sensitive Lakes. Modeling results for Alternative E sources indicated that there would be
no ANC changes at any of the 12 analyzed lakes that exceed the 10-percent threshold or the ΔANC<1
µeq/L threshold for the two extremely sensitive lakes. Lake ANC impacts are summarized in Section
4.6.3 of the AQTSD.
Regional Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The maximum greenhouse gas emissions resulting from Alternative E source emissions in year 2022 (the
peak emissions year for the Proposed Action and for any of the action alternatives) are estimated at 4.8
tg/yr of CO2 equivalent emissions. This represents a 0.5 tg/yr reduction in GHG emissions from year 2008
CD-C existing project emissions levels. To place the Alternative E GHG emissions in context, the GHG
emissions from the top five emitting coal-fired power plants in Wyoming range from 3 to 15 tg/year (data
from <http://epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ghgdata/-2010data.html>).

Impact Summary
Summary of Near-Field Modeling Results

Air pollutant impacts resulting from production activities associated with any of the CD-C Project
alternatives over the life of the project would be below the NAAQS and WAAQS, and would not exceed
the PSD Class II Increments.
Well field development activities from the Proposed Action and project development alternatives
(Alternatives A through D) including well pad construction and well drilling would not result in any
exceedances of the NAAQS or WAAQS at the 250-meter distance; however, modeled impacts for the
100-meter receptor distance case did result in short-term concentrations that were predicted to be above
the 1-hour NO2 NAAQS, the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10 WAAQS. In order to
demonstrate compliance with the NAAQS and WAAQS additional mitigation measures will be required
through the application of one or more emission control measures, such as those described in Section
4.5.9 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation.
There would be no new development under Alternative E (No Action). Therefore there would be no
increase in ambient air concentrations and the existing project impacts would be below the NAAQS,
WAAQS, and PSD Class II Increments.
The maximum predicted acute and chronic (long-term) HAP impacts from well field production for all
project alternatives would be below all applicable REL and RfC exposure thresholds. For the suspected
carcinogens (benzene, ethyl benzene, and formaldehyde) the maximum distance required to be below a
one-in-one-million cancer risk level for production activities for either the MLE or the MEI analysis
would be 1.25 miles as a result of the emissions for a single well pad with 16 wells in production.
Mitigation measures for NOx emissions that will be required to demonstrate compliance with the 1-hour
NO2 NAAQS will also decrease the predicted cancer risk impact for formaldehyde (see Section 4.5.9
Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation).
4.5.8.2

Summary of Far-Field Modeling Results

Air pollutant emissions resulting from any of the CD-C project alternatives would make no significant
contribution to modeled exceedances of the NAAQS, WAAQS, or CAAQS for ozone or any other criteria
pollutant in the 2022 future year. The PSD increments would not be exceeded at any Class I or sensitive
Class II area within the 4-km domain.
The far-field assessment was performed using the Proposed Action emissions. The impacts resulting from
all project development alternatives (Alternatives A through D) would be similar to impacts of the
Proposed Action. Under Alternative E (No Action Alternative) there would be no additional impacts to air
quality or AQRVs.
For all pollutants except ozone, the modeling results show attainment throughout the 4-km domain except
in the immediate vicinity of point sources unrelated to the CD-C project sources. Modeled exceedances of
the CO, PM10 and PM2.5 standards are the result of impacts from a 2005 fire in Lincoln County, and the
lone SO2 exceedance is highly localized and due to emissions from a Fremont County source. An ozone
exceedance occurs at Boulder, Colorado, where CD-C has no significant contribution to ozone
concentrations.
Examination of the spatial scale and magnitude of the CD-C project contribution to criteria pollutant
concentrations within the 4-km grid shows that exceedances of the ambient air quality standards in the
2022 future year modeling would not be related to emissions from the CD-C project.
The MATS-estimated maximum impact of the CD-C project on the 2022 future year 8-hour ozone Design
Value is less than or equal to 0.8 ppb for both meteorological years. The two-year approximation to a
2022 design value obtained using absolute model concentrations shows the CD-C project maximum

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-69

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—AIR QUALITY

ozone impact would be 1.6 ppb. For both the absolute modeled concentration and MATS results, the
largest ozone impacts due to the CD-C project emissions would be in the vicinity of the project area. In
Sublette County, where the only modeled exceedances of the 75 ppb NAAQS occurred, ozone impacts
due to the CD-C project would be less than or equal to 0.04 ppb. The highest CD-C ozone contributions
to ozone at Southwest Wyoming monitors would occur on days when modeled regional 8-hour ozone was
low (<60 ppb).
The visibility analysis showed 1 to 5 days with CD-C project visibility impacts greater than 0.5 dv at
Class I and sensitive Class II areas over the course of the 2-year simulation of the future year emissions
scenario. The simulation showed 1 day with CD-C project visibility impacts >1.0 dv during this period.
The largest visibility impacts would occur at the Savage Run, Dinosaur, and Mount Zirkel areas. No other
Class I or sensitive Class II areas had any day with visibility impacts >0.5 dv as a result of the CD-C
project emissions.
There would be no nitrogen or sulfur deposition impacts from any of the CD-C project alternatives
exceeding BLM critical load values at any Class I/sensitive Class II areas; however, the DAT for nitrogen
could be exceeded at several Class I areas near or downwind of the project area under the Proposed
Action and action alternatives.
There would be no ANC changes exceeding the 10-percent threshold or sensitive lake impacts where
ΔANC<1 µeq/L due to emissions from any of the CD-C project alternatives.
4.5.9

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Substantial mitigation of air quality impacts from CD-C project NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, VOC, and HAP
emissions would be achieved by the uniform application of WDEQ BACT and the Presumptive BACT
permitting requirements following the WDEQ Oil and Gas Permitting Guidance. The Operators’
commitment to use only Tier 2 or better drill rigs (Section 2.2.1.7 Operator-Committed Practices)
would further mitigate project impacts, reducing emissions of NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and VOCs.
Additional mitigation of predicted air quality impacts could be implemented by the following control
measures:






Use of Tier 4 or equivalent drill rig engines, reducing NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and VOC emissions.
Use of Tier 2 or better construction equipment, reducing NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and VOC
emissions.
Application of chemical suppressant on unpaved roads and additional watering during construction
activities to minimize fugitive dust, reducing particulate (PM10 and PM2.5) impacts.
Centralization of well pad production facilities (e.g., heaters, flares, dehydration units), reducing
NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, VOC, and HAP emissions and reducing truck traffic.
Field electrification, reducing NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and VOC emissions.

These and other mitigation options or control measures may already be in practice in the CD-C project
area to varying degrees. The reduction in emissions brought about by application of any of these measures
could be estimated with additional modeling based on more detailed descriptions of the actual drilling and
production processes used by the Operators. However, additional and more detailed information related to
those practices would be needed from the Operators. This information will be gathered, and additional
modeling analyses will be performed, during preparation of the FEIS. The results of the revised modeling
analyses based on the selection of mitigation measures will be presented in the FEIS. Mitigation measures
determined to be necessary to demonstrate compliance with the applicable NAAQS and WAAQS, as
predicted in the revised modeling analyses, will be a required condition in the Record of Decision.

BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
VEGETATION
Introduction

Direct impacts to existing native shrub/grassland communities on the CD-C project area resulting from
project implementation include a short-term reduction of herbaceous vegetation and a long-term loss of
shrubs due to soil disturbance and related construction activities. Indirect impacts to the vegetation
resource may occur as a result of damage to biological soil crusts (BSCs); soil compaction; mixing of soil
horizons; loss of topsoil productivity; increased soil-surface exposure; soil loss due to wind and water
erosion; short- to long-term increased potential for invasive weed introduction and establishment; shifts in
plant species composition and density; a potential reduction of livestock, wild-horse, and wildlife habitat
quantity and/or quality; and changes in visual aesthetics.
4.6.2

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes management objectives associated with vegetation. Those
applicable to the CD-C project are:
1. Maintain, restore, and enhance vegetation communities to facilitate a healthy mix of successional
stages (identified in activity plans) that incorporate age class, structure, and species composition
into each vegetation type, consistent with site potential.
2. Control the introduction and proliferation of noxious and invasive species and reduce established
populations to acceptable levels determined through cooperation, consultation, and coordination
with local, state, other federal plans, policies, and agency agreements.
3. Maintain, restore, and enhance the health and diversity of plant communities through the use of
management prescriptions (such as prescribed natural fire, burning, planting, seeding, and chemical,
mechanical, biological, and grazing treatments or other treatments) in coordination with local, state,
and federal management plans and policies.
4. Maintain, restore, and enhance riparian, wetland, and upland vegetation to meet the Wyoming
Standards for Healthy Rangelands.

5. Maintain, restore, and enhance Special Status Plant Species (Threatened, Endangered, and BLM
State Sensitive plant species) and unique plant communities.
6. Utilize inventory and monitoring data to support vegetation management.
7. Maintain connectivity between large, contiguous blocks of federal land by minimizing
fragmentation of vegetative communities.
The following criteria were considered in the assessment of impacts associated with the Proposed Action
and alternatives and are the same as those contained in the Rawlins RMP FEIS (BLM 2008b). The impact
on vegetation would be considered significant if any of the following were to occur:
1. Any action or event that would remove a community’s unique attributes or ability to support other
resource values within the planning period, or corrective actions that were beyond the scope of this
document.
2. The viability of protected plant species is jeopardized, with little likelihood of reestablishment after
disturbance, or actions result in the need to list a species under the ESA.
3. Actions that have the potential to remove sensitive plant species or substantially alter the habitat’s
ability to support the species.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-71

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VEGETATION

4. Reclaimed areas do not attain adequate vegetation groundcover and species composition to stabilize
the site within five years from disturbance, or there is invasion and establishment of noxious or
invasive weeds that contribute to unsuccessful reclamation.
5. Introduction of noxious and invasive weeds into areas considered weed-free, or an increase in weeds
where they already exist.
4.6.3

Direct and Indirect Impacts

Direct impacts to the vegetation resource would principally occur during the construction phase of the
proposed project and would include removal of existing native vegetation and removal of topsoil and
BSCs. To some extent, these impacts could be mitigated by successful implementation of reclamation
practices, but about 40 percent of the disturbance would remain in an unvegetated state for the life of the
project—30 to 50 years at each individual well site—while in use for access roads and well pad facilities.
The remaining 60 percent would have reduced productivity while reclamation is in progress and would
have an altered species composition and density for the life of the project and beyond, including a longterm loss of shrubs.
Vegetation could be impacted indirectly as a result of soil and BSC compaction, mixing of soil horizons,
loss of topsoil productivity, and increased soil-surface exposure resulting in soil loss due to wind and
water erosion. Other indirect impacts could occur as a result of altered runoff hydrology due to roads,
well pads, and other facilities, particularly on moderate to steep slopes. These sites reduce natural runoff
to downslope locations and increase channelization of flows and gullying, which results in desertification
effects including a lower water table, lower productivity and cover, and altered species composition
below these facilities.
Additional indirect impacts would occur due to deposition of dust on vegetation near roads and
construction sites, reducing plant productivity and vitality. The increased surface disturbance as a result of
project implementation would also provide opportunities for invasive plant species to establish and spread
(See Section 4.7 Invasive, Non-Native Plant Species).
4.6.3.1

Proposed Action

Under the Proposed Action (Section 2.2.1), 8,950 new natural gas wells and construction of required
ancillary facilities would be anticipated over the course of 15 years (development phase) within the
project area. It is assumed that 42 percent of the wells (3,765) would be drilled from directional drilling
pads. Over the estimated 10- to 15-year development phase, the Proposed Action is estimated to initially
disturb a total of 47,200 surface acres (Table 4.0-1), which represents about 4.4 percent of the total land
surface of the project area. During the projected 45- to 55-year life of the project, the initial 47,200 acres
of disturbance would be reduced to about 18,861 acres depending upon time required for successful
reclamation, future land uses, and future climatic conditions. Construction and installation of well pads,
access roads, and ancillary facilities (compressors, pipelines, and other required features.) would directly
reduce the extent of vegetation cover types.
In addition to the 47,200 acres initially disturbed by implementation of the Proposed Action, an estimated
60,176 historic disturbance acres already exist within the project area (Table 4.0-1). The addition of
historic disturbance to Proposed Action disturbance would result in a grand total of 107,376 acres or
about 10 percent of the total project area. Much of that earlier disturbance remains unvegetated and in
use, an estimated 17,663 acres. Together with long-term disturbance from the Proposed Action, up to
36,524 acres, or about 3.4 percent of the total project area would remain in an unvegetated state.
The time required to achieve successful reclamation of disturbed areas is largely dependent upon Operator
commitment, compliance with BLM reclamation guidelines and recommendations, future land uses, and
environmental variables, especially the timing and amount of precipitation events. This would hold true
for reclamation of herbaceous species, but not necessarily for native shrub establishment, especially in the

4-72

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VEGETATION

more xeric portions of the project area—approximately 590,272 acres, representing about 55 percent of
the project’s land surface area—where Wyoming big sagebrush and saltbush flats and fans are the
primary cover types (Table 3.6-1).
The majority of development would likely occur in the Wyoming big sagebrush, greasewood flats and
fans, and saltbush flats and fans primary cover types, which collectively occupy about 78 percent (Table
3.6-1) of the project’s land surface area. Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities typically occur on
sites with low precipitation and poor soil development, which increases the difficulty of reclamation and
makes it likely that only initial shrub re-establishment would occupy disturbed sites during the estimated
45- to 55-year life of the project. Greasewood communities occupy about 246,000 acres (Table 3.6-1)
within the project area. They are primarily located within the Muddy Creek drainage in the southern
portion of the project area and within several large greasewood-dominated flats in the Red Desert Basin
area in the northern portion of the project area. These flats usually have clayey soils with a high salt
content which increases the difficulty of reclamation. The saltbush flats and fans cover type occupies
about 173,000 acres within the project area. This primary cover type is found on saline soils in small to
large openings or can occur as “stringer” inclusions within the ATW or greasewood primary cover types.
These saltbush stands are sparsely vegetated and bare soil often exceeds 60 percent of the total ground
cover. Reclamation of saltbush/mixed desert-shrub cover type habitats can be difficult and the use of seed
mixes with appropriate native, saline, and drought-tolerant plant species is mandatory. The ability to re­
establish native vegetation on sensitive soil types (i.e., clayey, sandy, saline/sodic) is not welldocumented in this area of Wyoming. Although current technology exists to stabilize these areas and
minimize soil erosion as revegetation is being carried out, there is currently a lack of local seed sources
for native forb and shrub species, and the recovery rate to restore native shrubs such as saltbush and
shadscale to their pre-existing condition is unknown.
Due to the scarcity of wetland/riparian sites in the project area, the probability of well pads, roads,
pipelines, and ancillary facilities impacting these resources is low. The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a)
specifies that a 500-foot buffer be maintained around perennial waters, springs, wells, wetlands, and areas
within 100 feet of the inner gorge of ephemeral channels be avoided. These restrictions not only protect
perennial water sources and wetland/riparian sites, but basin big sagebrush sites which are often located in
or adjacent to ephemeral drainages that provide pygmy rabbit habitat and serve as mid-summer Greater
sage-grouse foraging areas. In addition, an applicable Nationwide Permit as authorized by Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act would be required from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wyoming Regulatory
Office, for any disturbance activities in wetlands or Waters of the U.S. The probability of removing
wetland vegetation or disturbing any Waters of the U.S. is low due to their low occurrence within the
project area and existing stringent federal and state laws and regulations providing for their protection.
In general, in addition to the initial area of disturbance, the extent of impacts to all vegetation cover types
would be influenced by the success of mitigation and reclamation efforts and the time period required for
disturbed areas to return to pre-existing conditions. Reclamation success depends, in part, on the quality
of topsoil salvaged, stockpile/redistribution methods in disturbed areas, precipitation, appropriate seed
mixes, soil type(s), and soil pre-seeding preparation and moisture availability.
In March 2011, the RFO issued reclamation guidelines for its management area (Instruction
Memorandum [IM] WYD-03-2011-002). The guidelines provide direction for implementing the
reclamation requirements of the Rawlins RMP and the Wyoming BLM Reclamation Policy (IM WY­
2009-022). The reclamation requirements of the RMP are found in Appendix 36 of that document and
essentially require a site-specific reclamation plan for any surface-disturbing activity and annual
monitoring and reporting of reclamation status. A full description of the new RFO reclamation guidelines
and recommendations can be found in Appendix E and at <http://www.blm.gov/wy/st/en/field_offices/
Rawlins/reclamation.html>.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-73

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VEGETATION

Indirect impacts to vegetation due to dust from unpaved roads would be variable throughout the project
area, depending upon the primary factors cited in Section 3.6.4, Fugitive Dust Effects on Vegetation
Health.
Project operations could result in increased traffic in the project area with an increased potential to create
fugitive dust that could affect vegetation quality and quantity as well as general plant health. Specific
plant communities would experience varying degrees of impact depending on location, general
abundance, browse use, topography, site reclamation potential, soil type, and precipitation regime.
Recommendations to mitigate dust impacts to vegetation and long-term loss of sagebrush habitat would
include constructing roads to a 95-percent compaction rating, and instituting an effective dust-suppression
program using water and/or periodic applications of BLM-approved dust-suppression chemicals to more
heavily traveled roads.
4.6.3.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A (Section 2.2.2) is similar to the Proposed Action except this alternative assumes that no
wells would be drilled using directional drilling rigs. Impacts to the vegetation resource resulting from
implementation of Alternative A would be similar to the Proposed Action with the notable exception that
the total amount of initial disturbance would increase from 47,200 acres to 61,696 acres, or 31 percent.
Long-term disturbance following successful reclamation would increase from a total of 18,861 acres to
24,133 acres. Combined with the present historic disturbed acres, the grand total of disturbance as a result
of Alternative A would be 121,872 acres of initial disturbance and 41,796 long-term acres, assuming
successful reclamation.
Implementation of Alternative A would affect a greater proportion of the vegetation resource due to the
larger area of surface disturbance associated with additional well pads and their associated access road
and pipeline rights-of-way. In addition, construction activities, increased soil-surface disturbance, and
higher traffic volumes associated with Alternative A would likely increase the potential for the
introduction and spread of invasive weed species and increase the total fugitive dust load within the
project area.
4.6.3.3

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B (Section 2.2.3) identifies those resources that may be more at risk from natural gas
development and provides enhanced protections and mitigations for those resources. Alternative B also
recognizes that development may be more intensive than currently expected and may result in impacts
that occur faster than anticipated. This alternative would combine a prescriptive and adaptive
management approach, which includes assessing the specific issue, designing and implementing a
response, monitoring and evaluating results, and adjusting the management response when needed on a
case-by-case basis. The enhanced resource protections would go into effect immediately and be applied to
all future APDs.
Under Alternative B, the types of impacts to the vegetation resource would be similar to those described
for the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but the initial disturbance would encompass 45,516 acres, an
approximate 4-percent reduction from the Proposed Action, due largely to an increase in the amount of
directional drilling. Assuming successful reclamation efforts, long-term disturbance would decrease to
18,249 acres, a reduction of 612 acres compared to the Proposed Action. Factoring in the existing historic
disturbance with future disturbance results in a grand total of 105,692 acres of initial disturbance and
35,912 acres of long-term disturbance.
Although no vegetation communities are specifically targeted in Alternative B, measures that are aimed at
protecting wildlife, riparian, and aquatic habitats and minimizing surface disturbance and dust produced
by project activity would all benefit vegetation communities. Indirect effects of fugitive dust on sensitive
vegetation in or near riparian areas and aquatic habitats are anticipated to be low to none. Avoidance of

4-74

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VEGETATION

riparian and aquatic sites (including playas) is an RMP requirement (BLM 2008b). Consequently, most
roads and permanent ancillary structures would be constructed outside the 500-foot perennial water buffer
and/or the 100-foot ephemeral drainage buffer previously discussed, thus reducing the fugitive dust load
in/near these habitats.
4.6.3.4

Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance, 60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section

Under Alternative C (Section 2.2.4), the types of impacts to the vegetation resource would be similar to
those described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1). For this alternative, the scope and intensity of
the impacts would be less widespread because of the surface-disturbance caps on unreclaimed areas.
Maximum surface disturbance for this alternative would represent a decrease of 4,245 acres of initial
disturbance and 1,543 acres of long-term disturbance (4 percent and 1.6 percent of the project area,
respectively) compared to the Proposed Action.
Under Alternative C, fewer well locations (approximately 5,300) would be developed. Therefore, fewer
access roads would be developed and habitat fragmentation would be less extensive than under the
Proposed Action. If development were to occur in the majority of undeveloped areas according to current
spacing orders (160-acre well spacing, or four wells per section), then vegetation impacts in these areas
that support large tracts of continuous shrub-steppe habitat types would be less than the Proposed Action.
If, on the other hand, future development in these areas were to occur at greater densities (80- or 40-acre
well spacing), then effects on vegetation would be greater than under the Proposed Action (Section
4.6.3.1).
4.6.3.5

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Under Alternative D (Section 2.2.5), the types of impacts to the vegetation resource would be similar to
those described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but the scope and intensity of the impacts
would be less widespread because of the expected reduction in surface disturbance. Estimated initial
surface disturbance for this alternative would be approximately 36,449 acres, a decrease of 10,751 acres
(23 percent) from the Proposed Action (Table 2.4-1). The estimated 14,952 acres of long-term
disturbance would be 3,909 acres less than the Proposed Action. The implementation of Alternative D
would reduce the number of well locations developed to an estimated 4,032 compared to the estimated
6,126 for the Proposed Action. In addition to not disturbing almost 11,000 acres of native herbaceous and
woody vegetation, the 35-percent reduction in well locations associated with this alternative would likely
lead to similar reductions in the number of access roads and road miles which would reduce the total
fugitive dust load on nearby forage thus increasing its palatability to wildlife and livestock (depending
upon the primary factors cited in Section 3.6.4, Fugitive Dust Effects on Vegetation Health). Healthy,
undisturbed rangeland vegetation is recognized by range managers as the best natural defense against
invasive-plant establishment and soil loss due to wind and water erosion.
4.6.3.6

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no new disturbance to the vegetation resource.
4.6.4

Impact Summary

Direct impacts to existing native shrub/grassland communities within the CD-C project area would be
similar under the Proposed Action and all alternatives—an initial reduction of herbaceous vegetation and
a long-term loss of shrubs due to soil disturbance and related construction activities. Indirect impacts to
the vegetation resource would also be similar under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives. The
principal difference in impacts for each alternative is related to the amount of surface disturbance that
would occur for each. The Proposed Action would initially disturb 47,200 acres. Alternative A would
increase surface disturbance by 31 percent to 61,696 acres. Alternatives B, C, and D would each decrease
surface disturbance and hence impacts to vegetation communities: Alternative B by about 4 percent to

45,516 acres, Alternative C by 9 percent to 42,955 acres, and Alternative D by 23 percent to 36,449 acres.
Alternative E, because it would have no new development, would not add to surface disturbance. Surface
disturbance for the Proposed Action and each alternative would be in addition to 60,176 acres of historic
surface disturbance in the project area. Table 4.0-1 shows in detail the historic and anticipated surface
disturbance figures for the Proposed Action and the alternatives.
After initial disturbance, approximately 40 percent of the disturbance would remain in an unvegetated
state for the life of the project and the other 60 percent would undergo interim reclamation. Long-term
disturbance by action alternative ranges from a high of 24,133 acres for Alternative A to a low of 14,952
acres for Alternative D. The degree of long-term impact on vegetation by any of the alternatives would
depend on the success of reclamation. That in turn would depend upon compliance with current BLM
reclamation guidelines and recommendations, future land uses, and future climatic conditions. This would
be true for reclamation of the faster-growing herbaceous species, but not necessarily for slow-growing
shrubs such as Wyoming big sagebrush and Gardner’s saltbush that are located in the more xeric portions
of the project area. Appendix E describes the process by which the BLM intends to direct reclamation
efforts and monitor the progress of reclamation.
Initial impacts to the vegetation resource from the action alternatives would include removal of native
shrub species and associated understory herbaceous cover, thus decreasing abundance of these native
species. Long-term impacts would be positive, assuming successful revegetation of BLM-approved seed
mixes which would provide a younger, more vigorous and nutritious food source for wildlife, livestock,
and wild horses on reclaimed areas.
4.6.5

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Vegetation cover would be unavoidably lost on a short-term basis as a result of the surface disturbance
related to construction of well sites and associated facilities on public, state, and private lands within the
CD-C project area. The losses would be in addition to historical losses of vegetation from prior surface
disturbance, together representing 10 percent or more of the surface of the CD-C project area. For the
intermediate to long term, grasses and other herbaceous vegetation would recover with the successful
implementation of the BLM reclamation guidelines and recommendations described in Appendix E.
Because of the extended time needed for the recovery of shrubs and other woody vegetation, a long-term
loss of such vegetation is unavoidable. No additional mitigation measures beyond those described in
Appendix C and Appendix E would mitigate these impacts to the vegetation resource. Those alternatives
that most reduce surface disturbance—Alternatives C and D—would minimize both the short- and longterm loss of vegetation. Project operations could result in increased traffic in the project area with an
increased potential to create fugitive dust that could affect vegetation quality and quantity as well as
general plant health. Recommendations to mitigate dust impacts to vegetation would include constructing
roads to a 95-percent compaction rating, and instituting an effective dust-suppression program using
water and/or periodic applications of BLM-approved dust-suppression chemicals to more heavily traveled
roads.

INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES
Introduction

Impacts to vegetation and rangeland resources due to the infestation and establishment of invasive weeds
would result with the implementation of all alternatives. Impacts would be the greatest during the
development phase of the action alternatives but would occur throughout the life of the project due to
vegetation and soil disturbance associated with energy-related activities such as road construction and
maintenance, pipeline installation, and installation of ancillary facilities.

4.7.2

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes management objectives associated with vegetation (Section
4.6.2). Objective 2 applies specifically to invasive, non-native plant species:
1. Control the introduction and proliferation of noxious and invasive species and reduce established
populations to acceptable levels determined through cooperation, consultation, and coordination
with local, state, other federal plans, policies, and agency agreements.
Impacts due to invasive weed species would be considered significant if the following were to occur:
1. Introduction of invasive weeds into areas considered weed-free, or an increase in invasive weed
density where infestations already exist, to include both upland and wetland/riparian sites.
2. An increase in invasive weeds in any grazing allotment that reduces or eliminates the opportunity to
run the livestock of choice.
3. The criteria for Wyoming BLM Standards for Healthy Rangelands cannot be met in any grazing
allotment due to invasive weed infestations.
4. Non-compliance with long-term reclamation standards and goals for energy-related disturbed sites.
5. Non-compliance with current BLM reclamation guidelines and recommendations (Appendix E), or
Appendix 36 of the Rawlins RMP (2008b) due to establishment of and failure to control invasive
weeds that contribute to non-attainment of these long-term standards and goals.
4.7.3

Direct and Indirect Impacts

Impacts to vegetation and range resources would occur on public lands under the Proposed Action and all
action alternatives due to an increase in surface disturbance, which could provide more suitable habitat for
invasive weed infestations.
The existing infestation of halogeton and other invasive species described in Section 3.7 may be
increased by project activities. Vehicles and equipment traveling from weed-infested areas, within and
outside the project area, could facilitate the spread of invasive weeds into previously weed-free areas in
addition to facilitating the spread of seeds of existing invasive populations. Additional surface-disturbing
activities would increase the potential for infestation and spread of invasive plant species. Invasive weed
species usually thrive on newly disturbed surfaces and out-compete native plant species. Creation of new
sites for weed infestations may occur in proximity to roads where fugitive-dust deposition on roadside
plants reduces their density due to chronic diseases in photosynthesis and growth, thus providing a
suitable habitat for invasive plants to establish.
Annual production of livestock/wildlife forage could also be impacted through the spread of invasive
weeds. The introduction, establishment, and spread of these species would reduce rangeland and forage
quantity and quality by replacing preferred forage species, leading to a reduction in grazing capacity, and
could lead to a greater amount of RFO rangeland acreage not meeting the national and Wyoming BLM
Standards and Guidelines for Healthy Rangelands (BLM 1997).
Without proper management and control, invasive plant species may cause widespread infestations.
Additionally, some invasive species such as halogeton, black henbane, and houndstongue are poisonous
and can kill or impair livestock if ingested.
The continued establishment and spread of halogeton, an invasive, poisonous plant, due to energy-related
activities, could lead to an increase in livestock (especially sheep) mortality. This could result in the
reduction or elimination of the opportunity to run the livestock of choice, which would be a significant
impact. Project implementation would increase the potential for increased invasive plant density in the
project area as a result of increased surface disturbance. The potential for increased invasive weed
infestation would be the greatest on project-related disturbances but would also likely occur on the 56,647

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-77

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES

historic existing disturbed acres due to natural dissemination of seeds, whether by wind, humans, wildlife,
or livestock.
As detailed in the Rawlins RMP, Appendix 36 (2008b), the Operators would be responsible for the
management and control of all invasive weed species on or related to project-related surface disturbances
during the life of the project and would follow an approved BLM Pesticide Use Proposal (PUP) and
reporting requirements.
4.7.3.1

Proposed Action

Implementation of the Proposed Action (Section 2.2.1) would increase the potential for increased
invasive plant density on the project area as a direct result of increased surface disturbance. Construction
and installation of well pads, access roads, and ancillary facilities (compressors, pipelines, and other
infrastructure) would remove soil and vegetation. Invasive weed species usually thrive on newly disturbed
surfaces such as road and pipeline rights-of-way and out-compete the more desirable native plant species.
Under the Proposed Action, 8,950 new natural gas wells and construction of required ancillary facilities
would be anticipated over the course of 15 years (development phase) within the project area. It is
assumed that 42 percent of the wells (3,765) would be drilled from directional drilling pads. Over the
estimated 10- to 15-year development phase, the Proposed Action is estimated to initially disturb a total
of 47,200 surface acres, which represents about 4.4 percent of the total land surface of the project area.
During the projected 45- to 55-year life of the project, the initial 47,200 acres of disturbance would be
reduced to about 18,861 acres depending upon time required for successful reclamation, future land uses,
and future climatic conditions.
In addition to the 47,200 acres initially disturbed by implementation of the Proposed Action, an estimated
60,176 acres of historic initial disturbance already exist within the project area (Table 4.0-1). The
addition of this historic disturbance to new disturbance from the Proposed Action would result in a grand
total of 107,376 acres of initial disturbance, or about 10 percent of the total project area. Much of that
earlier disturbance (an estimated 17,663 acres) remains unvegetated and in use. Together with the CD-C
project long-term disturbance, up to 36,524 acres, or about 3.4 percent of the total land surface of the
project area, would remain in an unvegetated state.
The potential for increased invasive weed infestations would be the greatest on project-related
disturbances but would also likely occur on the 60,176 acres of historic existing disturbance due to natural
dissemination of seeds by wind, humans, wildlife, or livestock.
4.7.3.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A (Section 2.2.2) is similar to the Proposed Action except this alternative assumes that no
wells would be drilled using directional drilling rigs. Impacts to the vegetation resource resulting from
implementation of Alternative A would be similar to the Proposed Action with the notable exception that
the total amount of short-term disturbed acres would increase from a total of 47,200 acres (Proposed
Action) to 61,696 acres (Alternative A) and the long-term disturbed acres following successful
reclamation would increase from a total of 18,861 acres (Proposed Action) to 24,133 acres (Alternative
A). Combined with the present historic disturbed acres, the grand total of disturbed acres as a result of
Alternative A would be 121,872 acres of initial disturbance and 41,796 acres of long-term disturbance,
assuming successful reclamation.
Impacts on the spread of invasive plant species would be similar to the Proposed Action but Alternative A
would be more likely to affect a greater proportion of the vegetation resource due to the larger area of
surface disturbance from additional well pads and their associated access road and pipeline rights-of-way.
In addition, construction activities, increased soil-surface disturbance, and higher traffic volumes
associated with Alternative A would increase the potential for introduction and spread of invasive weed
species within the project area.

4.7.3.3

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B (Section 2.2.3) identifies those resources that may be more at risk from natural gas
development and provides enhanced protections and mitigations for those resources. Alternative B also
recognizes that development may be more intensive than currently expected and may result in impacts
that occur faster than anticipated. This alternative would combine a prescriptive and adaptive
management approach, which includes assessing the specific issue, designing and implementing a
response, monitoring and evaluating results, and adjusting the management response when needed on a
case-by-case basis. The enhanced resource protections would go into effect immediately and be applied to
all future APDs.
Under Alternative B, impacts from the spread of invasive plant species would be similar to the Proposed
Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but the alternative would create slightly less risk of infestation due to the
diminished area of surface disturbance associated with a slight increase in directional drilling. The shortterm disturbance acres would be 45,516 acres, an approximate 4 percent reduction from the Proposed
Action, due largely to an increase in the amount of directional drilling. Assuming successful reclamation
efforts, the long-term disturbance would decrease to 18,249 acres, a reduction of 612 acres. Factoring in
the existing historic disturbance acres with future short-term disturbance results in a grand total of
105,692 acres of initial disturbance and 35,912 acres of long-term disturbance.
4.7.3.4

Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance, 60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section

Under Alternative C (Section 2.2.4), impacts on the spread of invasive plant species would be similar to
the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but implementation of the alternative would affect a smaller
proportion of the project area due to the reduced surface disturbance associated with the anticipated
increase in directional drilling. The scope and intensity of the impacts would be less widespread because
of the surface-disturbance caps on unreclaimed areas. Maximum surface disturbance for this alternative
would be decreased initially by 4,245 acres and 1,543 acres in the long term (4 percent and 1.6 percent of
the project area, respectively) when compared to the Proposed Action.
With this alternative, fewer well locations (approximately 5,300) would be developed. Therefore fewer
access roads would be developed and habitat fragmentation would be less extensive than the Proposed
Action. If development were to occur in the majority of undeveloped areas according to current spacing
orders (160-acre well spacing, or 4 wells per section), then invasive weed impacts in these areas would be
less than the Proposed Action. If on the other hand, future development in these areas were to occur at
greater densities (80- or 40-acre well spacing), then effects of invasive weeds would be greater than the
Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1).
4.7.3.5

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Under Alternative D (Section 2.2.5), impacts from the spread of invasive plant species would be similar
to the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but implementation of this alternative would affect a smaller
proportion of the project area due to the reduced surface disturbance associated with the anticipated
increase in directional drilling (Table 2.4-1). The scope and intensity of the impacts would be less
widespread because of the reduced density of new surface-disturbing activities per section.
Estimated initial surface disturbance for this alternative would be approximately 36,449 acres, a decrease
of 10,751 acres (23 percent) from the Proposed Action. With this alternative there would be fewer well
locations developed—an estimated 4,032 compared to the 6,126 estimated for the Proposed Action.
Compared to the Proposed Action, this alternative would reduce surface disturbance by almost 11,000
acres (17 sections) of potential new habitat for invasive plants. The 35-percent reduction in well locations
associated with this alternative would likely lead to similar reductions in the number of access roads and
road miles which often serve as primary dispersal corridors for invasive plant seeds. The reduction of
road miles would also decrease total fugitive dust load to roadside vegetation which would be beneficial

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE PLANT SPECIES

to the prevention of weedy annual establishment (see Section 3.6.4, Fugitive Dust Effects on Vegetation
Health).
4.7.3.6

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no new disturbance except where APDs have been
approved by the BLM for previously authorized activities. There would be no risk of direct infestation by
invasive plant species as a result of this project, but infestations could still occur because of existing
infestations.
4.7.4

Impact Summary

The risk of the infestation and spread of invasive plant species within the CD-C project area would be
similar under the Proposed Action and all alternatives as initial surface disturbance would create
opportunities for invasive species and development activity would increase the degree to which such
species spread throughout the project area. The principal difference in impacts for each action alternative
is related to the amount of surface disturbance that would initially occur for each. The Proposed Action
would initially disturb 47,200 acres. Alternative A would increase surface disturbance by 31 percent to
61,696 acres. Alternatives B, C, and D would each decrease surface disturbance and hence impacts from
the spread of invasive species: Alternative B by approximately 4 percent to 45,516 acres, Alternative C by
9 percent to 42,955 acres, and Alternative D by 23 percent to 36,449 acres. Surface disturbance for the
Proposed Action and each alternative would be in addition to the 60,176 acres of historic surface
disturbance in the project area. Table 4.0-1 shows in detail the historic and anticipated surface
disturbance figures for the Proposed Action and the alternatives.
After initial disturbance, approximately 40 percent of the disturbance would remain in an unvegetated
state for the life of the project and the other 60 percent would undergo interim reclamation. Long-term
disturbance by alternative ranges from a high of 24,133 acres for Alternative A to a low of 14,952 acres
for Alternative D. The degree of long-term impact on vegetation by any of the alternatives would depend
on the success of timely reclamation which in turn would depend upon compliance with current RFO
reclamation guidelines and recommendations, future land uses, and future climatic conditions. As
discussed in the RMP, Appendix 36 (2008a), the Operators would be responsible for the management and
control of all invasive weed species related to project-related surface disturbances during the life of the
project and would follow an approved BLM Pesticide Use Proposal (PUP) and reporting requirements.
Chenoweth et al. (2010) recently completed a cost analysis for Pioneer Natural Resources in the Raton
Basin (Trinidad, CO) and Encana Oil and Gas (Piceance Basin, CO) and concluded that estimated costs of
proper site reclamation techniques between the two companies averaged about $16,125 to $22,589 per
acre depending upon slope steepness. They also concluded that direct and indirect costs for reclamation
failures varied between $20,070 and $43,000 per acre. It is evident that cost on reclamation failure sites
can be more than twice the cost of initial proper reclamation, depending on severity of site degradation. It
is imperative that Operators understand the importance of minimizing initial surface disturbance and re­
establishing a competitive grass/forb cover as soon as feasible after disturbance to prevent successful
establishment of invasive weeds at the site.
4.7.5

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Assuming construction, maintenance, and operation of well sites and associated disturbances on public,
state, and private lands within the CD-C project area are in accordance with the BMPs and COAs
described in Appendix C and assuming successful implementation of BLM reclamation guidelines and
recommendations described in Appendix E, the infestation and spread of invasive plant species would be
contained and there would be no long-term adverse impacts. Only one additional mitigation measure may
be warranted:

To prevent the inadvertent introduction of invasive weeds, the Operators and their sub-contractors
would thoroughly power-wash all field vehicles, particularly their undercarriages, before entering
the project area.

WILDLIFE
Introduction

The primary wildlife impacts likely to result from the Proposed Action or alternatives include (1) direct
and indirect loss of wildlife habitats, (2) displacement of some wildlife species because of increased
human access and activity, (3) an increase in the potential for collisions between wildlife and motor
vehicles, (4) an increase in stress to wildlife and (5) disruption of life-history requirements of a species or
population segment.
The primary wildlife resources of interest within the project area include big game CWRs; big game
migration routes; overlapping crucial habitats (multiple species); raptor nests; small mammals and
neotropical birds; and upland game birds. A number of wildlife species, such as sage-grouse and
mountain plover, are discussed in Section 4.9, Special Status Species.
4.8.2

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008b) prescribes the following management objectives associated with
wildlife and fisheries resources (including Special Status Species):








Maintain, restore, or enhance wildlife habitat in coordination and consultation with other local,
state, and federal agencies and consistent with other agency plans, policies, and agreements. A full
range of mitigation options will be considered when developing mitigation for project-level
activities for wildlife and Special Status Species habitats.
Maintain, restore, or enhance T&E species habitat, in coordination and consultation with the
USFWS and other local, state, and federal agencies and consistent with other agency plans, policies,
and agreements.
Maintain, restore, or enhance designated BLM State Sensitive Species habitat to prevent listing
under the ESA, in coordination and consultation with other local, state, and federal agencies and
consistent with other agency plans, policies, and agreements.
Maintain, restore, or enhance habitat function in crucial winter range.

The following criteria were considered in the assessment of impacts associated with the Proposed Action
and alternatives and are from the Rawlins RMP FEIS (BLM 2008a). Impacts to wildlife and fish would
be considered significant if any of the following were to occur:
Substantial loss of the biological integrity and habitat function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
that would make a species eligible for listing under the ESA.
2. Management actions that result in substantial disruption or irreplaceable loss of vital and high-value
habitats as defined in the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission Mitigation Policy (WGFD 2010a).
The policy classifies big game crucial ranges as vital habitat and recommends that habitat function
be maintained so that the location, essential features, and species supported by the habitat are
unchanged. The policy also defines Moderate, High, and Extreme impact thresholds, of which High
and Extreme impacts will be judged significant.
1.

Additionally, the RFO has determined that the following significance criterion should be included for this
project:
3. Any effect, whether direct or indirect, that results in long-term decreases in recruitment and/or
survival rates for fish populations.

4.8.3
4.8.3.1

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action

The proposed natural gas development would disturb and alter approximately 47,200 acres of wildlife
habitat over the next 15 years, in addition to the 60,176 acres previously disturbed by natural gas and
other development. Reclamation of disturbed habitats would commence immediately and continue
throughout the 15-year construction period, resulting in recovery of 18,861 acres of grass-dominated
habitat (in one to several years, depending on precipitation and effectiveness of reclamation efforts).
Recovery of shrubs to pre-disturbance levels would not occur during the life of the project. As indicated
in Section 4.0.3, future project surface disturbance is most likely to occur in areas with already moderate
to high development as previously developed areas are “filled-in” to the expected 40-acre spacing (16
wells per section). However, some amount of development and surface disturbance can be expected
throughout the project area. Depending on the well-spacing orders in an area and the degree to which
directional drilling is used, disturbance per section could vary from as low as ten acres (four wells per
section, all directionally drilled from one pad) to as high as 100 acres (16 wells, all vertically drilled from
individual pads). The 160-acre well spacing orders designated for the undeveloped areas of the project
area indicate an expectation of disturbance at the lower end of that spectrum. However, if spacing were to
be reduced in any of those areas, the amount of disturbance per section would increase.
Standard environmental protection measures prescribed as Conditions of Approval or used as BMPs
(Appendix C) would be implemented under the Proposed Action and all alternatives. The Wildlife
Monitoring and Protection Plan (Appendix I) would be followed to prevent, reduce, and detect impacts to
wildlife and fish species throughout the life of the project. This plan serves two purposes: one is to
describe the protocols to monitor wildlife responses, habitats, behavioral shifts, etc.; the other is to
provide protocols to protect wildlife species and track the effectiveness of the monitoring and mitigation
plan. BMPs implemented for other resource concerns may provide indirect protection for a variety of
wildlife species.
Wildlife habitats directly affected by the proposed project include areas that are physically disturbed by
the construction of well pads, roads, pipelines, and production facilities; wildlife habitats indirectly
disturbed include areas surrounding directly impacted habitats. Direct habitat loss from construction of
the Proposed Action, equal to approximately 4.4 percent of the project area, would be in addition to the
5.6 percent of the project area that has previously been disturbed.
The long-term loss/reduced usability of shrub habitat within a portion of the project area could lead to an
increase in use on remaining shrub habitats. This localized increase of use could lead to a long-term
reduction of shrub habitats outside of immediate project disturbance areas. Currently, areas dominated by
large and continuous stands of shrub communities have relatively low well densities or occur in sections
with the lowest (160-acre) well-spacing orders or allowable well density. Timely reclamation of well
pads, pipelines, and rights-of-way would provide grass and forb forage within one to several years
depending on precipitation and effectiveness of reclamation efforts, while sagebrush and other important
shrub species would require longer for re-establishment to pre-disturbance levels. Consequently, the total
acres disturbed would constitute a long-term loss of shrubs and would not be fully usable by shrubdependent species for forage or shelter for over 20 years, although early seral stage shrubs would provide
forage and/or shelter for various species in a shorter period of time.
Disturbance during construction and production, such as human presence, dust, and noise may displace or
preclude wildlife use during all seasons. Prohibiting construction, drilling, and other activities potentially
disruptive to wildlife during sensitive time-periods (e.g. winter, breeding, or nesting) would reduce the
probability of displacement during these critical times. The extent of displacement would be related to the
duration, magnitude, and visual prominence of the activity, as well as the extent of construction and
operational noise levels above existing background levels. Displacement could result in local reductions

4-82

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

in wildlife populations if adjacent, undisturbed habitats are at carrying capacity. In this situation animals
are either forced into less-optimal habitats or they compete with other animals that already occupy
unaffected habitats. Possible consequences of such displacement are lower survival, lower reproductive
success, lower recruitment, and ultimately lower carrying capacity and reduced populations (WGFD
2010a).
The extent of wildlife displacement is impossible to predict for most species since the response to
disturbance varies from species to species and can even vary between different individuals of the same
species. After initial avoidance, some species may acclimate to the activity and begin to reoccupy areas
previously avoided (Kuck et al. 1985). This acclimation and reoccupation may occur following
construction and drilling operations when the project moves into the production phases where less noise
and human activities would take place. However, there is no guarantee of acclimation, or reoccupation, if
the number of roads or level of human activity exceeds tolerance thresholds of the individual animal.
Human-caused surface disturbances such as well pads and roads can reduce use of surrounding habitat by
wildlife. There is generally a zone of decreased use surrounding these sites due to the increased human
activity. On average this zone extends to approximately 0.7 miles from development for big game species
(Hebblewhite 2008). The area of aversion generally is the least for pronghorn and increases for elk and
mule deer (Powell 2003, Berger 2006, Sawyer et al. 2006a). Consequently, development impacts to
wildlife can extend beyond the physically disturbed area.
Habitat fragmentation and isolation are difficult to determine and vary species to species, but they could
occur as a result of gas-field developments, which typically are configured as point and linear
disturbances scattered throughout broader areas. Although these types of disturbances do not usually
create physical barriers to wildlife movement (although in the winter, high snow berms resulting from
plowing along multiple access roads may disrupt some wildlife movement), the effective use of adjacent
undisturbed habitats could diminish as densities of well pads, ancillary facilities, and roads increase. An
increase in habitat fragmentation is not as readily apparent in areas with existing disturbance as in
previously undisturbed areas, but adverse effects can be compounded when infill disturbance further
reduces available habitat between existing disturbances, effectively eliminating areas of relatively
undisturbed habitat to the point that animals are displaced from the general area.
In addition, road/traffic-related dust would likely directly and indirectly impact 24.3 percent of the project
area, which may result in some habitat avoidance (Section 3.6.4). Indirectly, this may increase inter- and
intra-species competition for forage and thermal cover. In areas already at carrying capacity, individuals
may be further displaced, possibly outside of the project area. Some animals may be displaced into lowerquality habitats which may lead to a reduction in reproductive rates or an increase in predation. In
addition, roads provide access to the general public into areas that were previously undisturbed/
undeveloped. Human encroachment in the form of casual backcountry recreation, hunting, and poaching
could occur at higher rates resulting in effects such as disturbance during sensitive periods, displacement,
or increased mortality.
Following drilling and well-completion operations, noise levels, vehicle traffic, and human activity would
be reduced. As a result, species might acclimate to the well-pad production facilities and use habitats
adjacent to such sites, particularly at night when facilities-maintenance activities do not occur (Thompson
et al. 1998, Dzialak et al. 2011a; 2011b, Webb et al. 2011).
The reaction of individual animals to noise and human presence varies depending on the intensity of the
noise source and whether it is continuous or intermittent. Transient loud noises would provoke alarm
responses; however, many animals habituate to more constant, lower-level noise sources that are not
associated with negative visual stimuli or experiences such as being chased or hunted (reviewed in Busnel
and Fletcher 1978; Weisenberger et al. 1996). Increased traffic levels on new and existing roads could
increase the potential for wildlife/vehicle collisions for the life of the project.

Pronghorn. The impacts with the potential for the greatest negative effects to pronghorn populations
would occur in CWR. Pronghorn CWR encompasses 90,310 acres across the central and southeastern
portion of the project area (Map 3.8-2). Based on habitat assessments conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2010
at seven sites within the project area (Map 3.8-2; Table 3.8-3), pronghorn CWR is in largely fair
condition (BLM unpublished data). Existing long-term disturbance and post-reclamation early-seral-state
communities comprise approximately 2.6 percent of pronghorn CWR within the project area (Table 4.81). Based on current well-spacing orders, as many as 1,232 new wells could be drilled within pronghorn
CWR. Initially, an additional 3.6 percent of pronghorn CWR within the project area would be directly
impacted by development of well pads and access roads under the Proposed Action. Assuming successful
interim reclamation, as much as 6.2 percent of pronghorn CWR within the project area would remain
disturbed for the life of the project.

Designated CWR within the project area (WGFD 2011b).
Based on HWA 2008b.
Because the most important constituent vegetation communities within crucial winter ranges would not return
to functional condition for the life of the project, anticipated initial disturbance acres are used to represent the
effective direct impact on these crucial winter ranges.
The combined existing long-term and proposed project initial disturbance represents the worst case scenario
for anticipated crucial winter range habitat disturbance.

The direct loss/reduced usability of sagebrush communities would increase use on remaining shrubs,
potentially resulting in shrub health decline outside of the immediate project disturbances. This would
have an impact on pronghorn due to their heavy use of sagebrush during winter. Over time, pronghorn
habituate to certain disturbances, depending on the spatial relationship (i.e., distance) between these areas
of disturbance to available forage, water, and thermal cover; however, Easterly (1991) found that
pronghorn density was consistently higher in areas outside of developed areas. Standard mitigations
prohibiting construction, drilling, and other activities potentially disruptive to pronghorn within CWR
from November 15 to April 30 would reduce the probability of displacement during this critical time of
the year. During the production phase, the application of BMPs identified in Appendix 15 of the RMP, if
applied, would work to alleviate impacts to the species. This would likely serve to reduce stress, help
maintain animal condition, and improve winter survival as the animals travel farther or are displaced to
lower-quality range.
Within the project area, pronghorn in the Red Desert herd generally migrate from north to south to CWRs
along I-80. Pronghorn in the Bitter Creek and Baggs herds migrate from higher elevations to CWR along
Muddy Creek and WY 789. I-80 presents a formidable barrier to north-south migration movements
between the Red Desert herd and the Bitter Creek and Baggs herds (Map 3.8-1). In addition, fences along

4-84

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

WY 789 create a migration barrier that impedes pronghorn movement across the highway. Pronghorn
found east of the highway are generally restricted to crucial winter habitat found along Muddy Creek and
against WY 789, creating a trap to animal movement similar to I-80. WGFD (2011) reported, “Direct loss
of winter habitat can cause a major impact because of the high sensitivity of pronghorn to wildlife
unfriendly fencing, thus possibly causing a situation where pronghorn are trapped on unsuitable habitat
increasing winter kill.” This situation occurred during the winter of 2007-2008 in the Baggs Herd Unit,
when pronghorn were migrating over fences along WY 789. Numerous rangeland fences throughout the
project area also impede the movement of individuals to suitable winter habitat. Fences can prevent the
animals from escaping human disturbance associated with field-development activity. For example,
animals may have to follow migration barriers such as fences for great distances before finding a way
through towards better winter habitat (J. Gregson, pers. com. 2012). Development of the project would
compound the impacts of barriers to migrations. The inability to move through the area may force
individuals to use less-suitable winter habitats, increase physiological stress, increase potential for
starvation, and increase mortality and an overall decline in population size. Surface-disturbing and
disruptive activities in big game migration and transitional ranges would be managed on a case-by-case
basis, while new fences in migration corridors would only be allowed if they meet BLM standards
(Rawlins RMP, p. 2-54).
Increased traffic levels on new and existing roads could increase the potential for wildlife/vehicle
collisions. New roads also provide access to the general public into areas that were previously
undisturbed/ undeveloped. Human encroachment in the form of casual backcountry recreation, hunting,
and poaching could occur at higher rates resulting in effects such as disturbance during sensitive periods,
displacement, or increased mortality.
The level of development within pronghorn CWR and migration corridors that would occur as a result of
the Proposed Action is expected to exceed the significance criteria and to meet or exceed the WGFD
(2010) definition of “High Impact” to pronghorn in crucial seasonal habitats, as follows: “Impairment of
habitat function increases – the impact will be more difficult or at times impossible to effectively mitigate
within the project area. The impact can be reduced but probably not eliminated through seasonal use
restrictions and more intensive management and mitigation practices.” Implementation of the Proposed
Action, compounded by the current condition of the crucial winter habitat, along with the additional stress
and displacement of pronghorn during development (and to a lesser degree during production) would
likely exceed impact Criterion 2 (substantial disruption or irreplaceable loss of vital habitat).
Mule Deer. The impacts with the potential for the greatest negative effects to mule deer populations
would occur in CWRs. Mule deer CWRs encompass 17,849 acres within the southeastern part of the
project area (Map 3.8-4). Based on habitat assessments conducted in 2007, 2008, and 2010 at two sites
within the project area (Map 3.8-4; Table 3.8-4), the condition of mule deer CWR appears to have
declined, possibly as a result of the severe winter of 2007–2008 (BLM unpublished data, WGFD 2011).
Existing long-term disturbance and post-reclamation early-seral-state communities comprise less than 2.3
percent of mule deer CWR within the project area (Table 4.8-2). Based on current well-spacing orders, as
many as 298 new wells could be drilled within mule deer CWR. Initially, an additional 4.5 percent of
mule deer CWR within the project area would be directly impacted by development of well pads and
access roads under the Proposed Action. Assuming successful interim reclamation, as much as 6.8 percent
of mule deer CWR within the project area would remain disturbed for the life of the project.
The impacts of habitat disruption common to all big game species are discussed in detail earlier in this
section. Reduction in winter range size and quality of available habitat may decrease the carrying capacity
of the overall winter range (Sawyer et al. 2006b). In addition to the direct removal of habitat due to the
development of pads and associated ancillary facilities, disturbances from drilling activities and traffic
would affect the use of the habitat immediately adjacent to these areas. Indirect habitat loss can be
substantially greater than the direct loss of habitat to roads and well-pad construction. Sawyer et al.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

(2006b) found that winter mule-deer habitat selection and distribution patterns have been affected by
development, specifically road networks and well pads; mule deer had a higher probability of use in areas
farther away from well pads as development progressed. Predictive maps also suggest that some habitats
considered “high probability of use” areas prior to development, changed to “low probability of use”
areas as development progressed, and vice-versa (Sawyer et al. 2006b).

condition for the life of the project, anticipated initial disturbance acres are used to represent the effective direct impact on these
crucial habitats.
4 The combined existing long-term and proposed project initial disturbance represents the worst case scenario for anticipated
crucial winter range habitat disturbance.

As discussed above (Pronghorn), prohibiting construction, drilling, and other activities potentially
disruptive to mule deer within CWR from November 15 to April 30 would reduce the probability of
displacement during this critical time of the year. During the production phase, the application of BMPs
identified in Appendix 15 of the RMP would help alleviate impacts to the species. This would likely help
reduce stress, maintain animal condition, and improve winter survival of the animals as they travel farther
or are displaced to lower-quality range. Over time, mule deer habituate to certain disturbances, depending
on the spatial relationship (i.e., distance) between these areas of disturbance to available forage, water,
and thermal cover; however, Sawyer et al. (2006a) found that areas within 2.3 miles of well pads have
lower predicted probabilities of use compared to undeveloped areas. Mule deer are adaptable and may
adjust to non-threatening, predictable human activity (Irby et al. 1988).
Recent research has identified migration routes used by mule deer adjacent to the project area (Sawyer
2007). Mule deer appear to move between the higher elevations of the Atlantic Rim in the east to lower
elevations along Red Creek Rim to the southwest, skirting the eastern edge of The Bluffs, a prominent
geographic feature in the extreme southern portion of the project area (Sawyer 2007). Research into mule
deer migration routes will continue to better inform and refine mapping. Numerous rangeland fences
throughout the project area impede the movement of individuals to suitable winter habitat. Fences also
prevent the animals from escaping human disturbance associated with field-development activity. For
example, animals may have to follow migration barriers such as fences for great distances before finding
a way through towards better winter habitat (J. Gregson, pers. com. January 2012). Development of the
project would compound the impacts of barriers to migration. The inability to move through the area may
force individuals to use less-suitable winter habitats, increase physiological stress, increase potential for
starvation, and increase mortality and an overall decline in population size. Surface-disturbing and

disruptive activities in big game migration and transitional ranges would be managed on a case-by-case
basis, while new fences in migration corridors would only be allowed if they met BLM standards
(Rawlins RMP, p. 2-54).
Increased traffic levels on new and existing roads would increase the potential for wildlife/vehicle
collisions.
The level of development within mule deer CWR and migration corridors that would occur as a result of
the Proposed Action is expected to exceed the significance criteria and to meet or exceed the WGFD
(2010) definition of “High Impact” to mule deer in crucial seasonal habitats: “Impairment of habitat
function increases – the impact will be more difficult or at times impossible to effectively mitigate within
the project area. The impact can be reduced but probably not eliminated through seasonal use restrictions
and more intensive management and mitigation practices.” Implementation of the Proposed Action,
compounded by the current condition of the crucial winter habitat, along with the additional stress and
displacement of the mule deer during development, and to a lesser degree during production, would likely
exceed impact significance Criterion 2 (substantial disruption or irreplaceable loss of vital habitat).
Application of the same additional mitigation measures described for pronghorn could work toward
reducing the impacts of the Proposed Action on mule deer.
Elk. No elk CWR has been identified within the project area (Map 3.8-6), and migration routes have not
been identified and documented. The majority of the project area is classified as “limited/no importance”
and “undetermined/ undocumented” for elk use (WGFD 2010a). Small portions of the area are classified
as “yearlong” and “winter” elk habitat (Map 3.8-6). Therefore, this project is not expected to alter or
block elk movements. However, elk are generally believed to be more sensitive to human activities than
pronghorn or mule deer, and they may be displaced in construction areas from 0.6 to 1.2 miles depending
on the season (Powell 2003). Elk would likely habituate to the physical presence of gas wells (Van Dyke
and Klein 1996); however, elk rarely adjust to the continued human presence required during the
production phase of the project (Morrison et al. 1995). Following drilling and well-completion
operations, noise levels, vehicle traffic, and human activity would be reduced. As a result, species might
acclimate to the well-pad production facilities and use habitats adjacent to such sites, particularly at night
when facilities-maintenance activities do not occur (Thompson et al. 1998, Dzialak et al. 2011a and
2011b, Webb et al. 2011).
With the increase in roads and potential recreational access to the area, displacement of elk in the limited
areas of known elk use is likely during all phases of development. That said, and unless future studies
demonstrate otherwise, impacts to elk populations due to habitat removal or modification; displacement,
stress, or migration disruption; and increased vehicular collisions are not expected to exceed the impact
significance criteria because high-value habitat (CWR and migratory routes) within the project area is
very limited.
Application of the same additional mitigation measures described for pronghorn and mule deer would
work to reduce the impacts of the Proposed Action on elk.
Overlapping Big Game Crucial Winter Range. Areas of overlapping big game CWR and sage-grouse
core population areas are of greater importance because they provide crucial habitat for more than one
species (WGFD 2010a); such areas occur within the project area (Map 3.8-7). Thirty-eight percent of
overlapping big game CWR is on private and state lands where there are no protections against
disturbance of animals during crucial time-periods (November 15 – April 30). Indirectly, this may
increase inter- and intra-species competition (between different species and among individuals of the
same species) for forage and thermal cover. This may force animals to use lower-quality habitats, which
may lead to a reduction in reproductive rates or an increase in predation and/or mortality. The level of
development of the Proposed Action within big game CWR, compounded by the current condition of the

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-87

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

crucial winter habitat (Tables 3.8-3 and 3.8-4), would likely exceed impact significance Criterion 2 and
meet the WGFD (2010) definition of “High Impact.”
Consistent with the WGFD oil and gas development recommendations (WGFD 2010a), the mitigation
measures listed for pronghorn and mule deer in the previous narratives would apply as well to the
overlapping big game CWR.
Raptors. The impacts with the potential for the greatest negative effects to raptor populations include
nest-abandonment and failure due to increased human disturbance, loss of nesting and feeding habitat,
and potential for increased vehicle collisions. There are 938 raptor nest sites (known to date) located in or
within one mile of the project area. The BLM places year-round buffers around active raptor nest sites,
precluding well locations, roads, ancillary facilities, and other surface structures requiring repeated human
presence and applies a larger buffer during the nesting period (BLM 2008a). The size of buffers around
active nests varies by species, with the largest buffers being one mile for bald eagles, golden eagles, and
ferruginous hawks. Surface-disturbing activities would be prohibited from as early as February 1 (e.g.
Great Horned Owl) to as late as September 15 (e.g. Burrowing Owl), depending on species. The amount
of short-term change in prey-base populations created by construction is expected to be small in
comparison to the overall level of small-mammal populations. While prey populations on the project area
would likely sustain some reduction during the development phase of the project, most prey species
would be expected to rebound to pre-disturbance levels following initial reclamation. Once reclaimed,
these areas would likely promote an increased density and biomass of small mammals that is comparable
to those of undisturbed areas (Hingtgen and Clark 1984).
Some raptors feed on carrion on and along the roads, while others (owls) may attempt to capture small
rodents and insects that are illuminated in headlights. These raptor behaviors put them in the path of
oncoming vehicles where they are in danger of being struck and killed.
Because of the buffers and restriction on activity around raptor nests and the fact that most of the prey
utilize habitat that can be reclaimed in a timely fashion, the impact from the Proposed Action is not
expected to exceed the significance criteria.
Mitigation could be imposed to reduce the chance of collisions between vehicles and raptors by requiring
that drivers undergo training that describes the circumstances under which vehicular collisions are likely
to occur and measures that can be taken to minimize them.
Small Mammals and Neotropical Songbirds. Construction disturbances would reduce habitat
availability for a variety of small bird and mammal species. The temporary disturbances that would occur
during the 15-year construction period would tend to favor early-succession wildlife species such as
horned larks and ground squirrels, and would tend to adversely impact mid-to-late-succession species,
such as loggerhead shrikes and voles. The long-term disturbance would have a minor effect on wildlife
species not dependent upon shrubs. In addition to the direct-disturbance acreage, dust would directly and
indirectly impact 24.3 percent of the project area (Section 3.6.4). These impacts would include habitat
avoidance by birds and small mammals. Indirectly, this could increase inter- and intra-specific
competition for nesting and foraging areas. In areas already fully occupied, density-dependent species
would be further displaced, possibly outside of the project area.
A variety of shrub-dependent songbirds could be displaced by the reduction in habitat. Although there is
no way to accurately quantify these changes, the displacement would be long-term. Birds are highly
mobile and would disperse into surrounding areas and use suitable habitats to the extent that they are
available. Standard mitigation measures would indirectly help songbirds during critical time-periods, and
impacts to nesting and foraging habitats are expected to be minimal. Therefore, impacts from this
alternative are not likely to significantly reduce populations within the project area due to the abundance
of undisturbed habitat that would remain.

4-88

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

The primary small mammals found in the project area include, but are not limited to, cottontail rabbits,
various mouse and vole species, northern pocket gophers, white-tailed jackrabbits, and ground squirrels.
The initial phases of surface disturbance would result in some direct mortality and displacement of small
mammals from construction sites. Quantifying these changes is not possible because population data are
lacking. However, the impact is likely to be minor, and the relatively high reproductive rate of these small
mammals would enable populations to quickly repopulate the area following interim reclamation. Most of
these species would benefit from an increase in grass-dominated vegetation resulting from reclamation
activities.
Development of the project could result in some unintentional, direct mortality of small birds and small
mammals from vehicle collisions; however, this mortality is expected to be negligible and is not likely to
significantly reduce populations within the project area. Overall, if standard prescribed environmental
protection measures and BMPs (Appendix C) and the Wildlife Monitoring and Protection Plan
(Appendix I) are implemented under the Proposed Action, the impacts on songbird and small-mammal
populations are not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
Upland Game Birds. Greater sage-grouse, Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, and mourning doves occur or
potentially occur within the project area and may be impacted to varying degrees by the project.
Mourning doves are highly adaptable habitat generalists; impacts would be negligible and not affect their
long-term viability within the project area. Greater sage-grouse is designated as a candidate for listing
under the ESA and is discussed in Section 4.9 Special Status Species.
Fish. About 10 game-fish species and 20 non-game fish species may occur in the CD-C project area or
adjacent to the project area, or in streams upstream or downstream of the project area (Table 3.8-6 ) Of
these, 14 species, including six native species, are likely to be present within the project area. Of these 14
species, four are BLM Sensitive Species. All of the 10 species that are not BLM Sensitive Species will be
subject to the same types of impacts described in Section 4.9.3.1, Sensitive Fish Species. All of the 10
species that are not BLM Sensitive Species, however, have a wide distribution within Wyoming (Baxter
and Stone 1995); consequently, the project area and other human activities within the Muddy Creek and
Great Basin watersheds may have localized population impacts, but these impacts should not impact their
status range-wide. Only one reservoir in the project area has a recreational fishery, and no impacts to that
fishery are anticipated.
Part of Muddy Creek within the project area is listed as threatened by WDEQ for water quality (Section
3.4.2.4); however, no segments listed as impaired are present within the project area. If any segments
were to be classified as impaired, one of the requirements in the RMP is for intensive management of
303(d) listed segments to address the problem.
Refer to Section 4.9.3.1 for impacts to sensitive fish species.
4.8.3.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A would proceed with development across the project area similar to the Proposed Action, but
would produce greater surface-disturbance due to an increase in the number of well pads, access roads,
and pipelines. Initial facility construction within the project area would disturb and alter an estimated
61,696 acres of wildlife habitat over the next 15 years, in addition to the 60,176 acres previously
disturbed by natural gas and other development. This would be an increase of approximately 31 percent
relative to the Proposed Action, and would mean that over 11 percent of the project area surface had been
disturbed. Reclamation of disturbed habitats would commence immediately and continue throughout the
15-year construction period, resulting in recovery (in one to several years, depending on precipitation and
effectiveness of reclamation efforts) of 24,133 acres of grass-dominated habitat. Recovery of shrubs to
pre-disturbance levels would not occur during the life of the project.
The overall increase in the number of well pads and roads and the acreage initially disturbed would
substantially increase habitat fragmentation. This would increase the overall habitat loss and displacement

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-89

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

effects to wildlife species, as well as increase impediments within movement corridors. An increase in
disturbance of wildlife habitat would impact all species and increase the time required, long-term, to
return the functionality of the habitat in the project area. The degree of impact would vary by species.
Impacts would be the same for all species as identified in Section 4.8.3.1 above, except as discussed
below.
Pronghorn. Initially, an additional 8.6 percent of pronghorn CWR would be directly impacted by
development of well pads and access roads under Alternative A (Table 4.8-1). Even assuming successful
interim reclamation, 11.2 percent of pronghorn CWR would remain disturbed for the life of the project.
The direct loss/reduced usability of big sagebrush communities (Wyoming and mountain) would increase
use on remaining shrubs, resulting in shrub health decline outside of the immediate project disturbances.
This would have the greatest impact on pronghorn due to their reliance upon sagebrush habitats during
winter. This level of development within pronghorn CWR and migratory routes (half again as much as the
Proposed Action), compounded by the current condition of the crucial winter habitat, along with the
additional stress and displacement during the production phase, would exceed impact significance
Criterion 2 and the WGFD definition of “Extreme Impact,” even if standard mitigations are applied.
Mule Deer. Initially, an additional 10.5 percent of mule deer CWR would be directly impacted by
development of well pads and access roads under Alternative A (Table 4.8-2). Assuming successful
interim reclamation, as much as 12.8 percent of mule deer CWR, including migration routes, within the
project area would remain disturbed for the life of the project. This level of development within mule deer
CWR (almost twice that of the Proposed Action), compounded by the current condition of CWR forage,
along with the additional stress and displacement during the production phase, would exceed Criterion 2
and the WGFD definition of “Extreme Impact.”
Elk. No elk CWR exists in the project area; therefore, impacts to elk populations, although higher than
the Proposed Action, are not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
Overlapping Big Game Crucial Winter Range. This alternative would impact additional acreage of
overlapping CWR and correspondingly increase the likelihood of exceeding Criterion 2 and the WGFD
definition of “Extreme Impact.”
Raptors. With the application of the RMP (BLM 2008a) required avoidance and mitigation measures
(Section 4.8.3.1), impacts are not expected to exceed the significance criteria.
Small Mammals and Neotropical Songbirds. Under this alternative, an expansion of total acres of
disturbance would increase direct and indirect impacts to small birds and mammals relative to the
Proposed Action. However, if standard prescribed environmental protection measures and BMPs
(Appendix C) and the Wildlife Monitoring and Protection Plan (Appendix I) are implemented, and
surface-disturbing and disruptive activities are intensively managed as required in the RMP (BLM 2008a,
p. 2-53), impacts are not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
Fish. The types of impacts to fish would be the same as for the Proposed Action, but because of the larger
surface area affected (~14,500 acres more, ~35 percent more, initial; ~5,000 acres more long-term), the
magnitude of impacts would be proportionally greater.
4.8.3.3

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

The Enhanced Resource Protection (ERP) alternative was developed to avoid significant impacts to
resources of concern by implementing additional protections and mitigations beyond those normally
applied (e.g. BMPs, Wildlife Monitoring and Protection Plan). The enhanced resource protections would
go into effect immediately and be applied to all future APDs.
The ERP alternative also recognizes that development may be more intensive than currently expected and
may result in impacts occurring on wildlife habitats and populations faster than anticipated. Therefore,

4-90

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

this alternative includes surface-disturbance and population thresholds for some specifically designated
high-value resources. If these surface-disturbance or population thresholds were reached, additional
protection measures would be implemented, specific to each species. The alternative would combine
prescriptive and adaptive management approaches that include assessing the specific issue, designing and
implementing a response, monitoring and evaluating results, and adjusting the management response
when needed on a case-by-case basis. See Section 2.2.3 for a detailed description of this alternative.
Three general requirements are applied across the board in this alternative: (1) uniform application of
dust-abatement procedures, (2) environmental awareness training for all employees and subcontractors,
and (3) the BLM will require remote monitoring at well pads when a surface disturbance threshold of 5
percent is reached for applicable resources.
Under the ERP, initial facility construction within the project area would disturb and alter an estimated
45,516 acres of wildlife habitat over the next 15 years, in addition to the 60,176 acres previously
disturbed by natural-gas and other development. This would be a slight decrease relative to the Proposed
Action. Reclamation of disturbed habitats would commence immediately and continue throughout the 15­
year construction period, resulting in recovery (in one to several years, depending on precipitation and
effectiveness of reclamation efforts) of 18,249 acres of grass-dominated habitat. Recovery of shrubs to
pre-disturbance levels would not occur during the life of the project.
Under this alternative, pronghorn and mule deer CWR and migratory corridors would receive enhanced
protections. Enhanced protections for Special Status Species are discussed in Section 4.9.
Pronghorn and Mule Deer Crucial Winter Range and Migration Corridors. Initially, an additional
3.5 percent of pronghorn and 4.3 percent of mule deer CWR within the project area would be directly
impacted by development of well pads and access roads under the Proposed Action (Table 4.8-1).
Assuming successful interim reclamation, as much as 6.1 percent of pronghorn and 6.6 percent of mule
deer CWR within the project area would remain disturbed for the life of the project.
The enhanced protections for big game would decrease the degree of risk associated with impacts of the
Proposed Action (Section 4.8.3.1). Under this alternative, APDs that would affect pronghorn and mule
deer crucial winter/yearlong range and migration corridors would be submitted with an overall
development plan. The development plan would be submitted either for an individual lease or several
leases. It should aim at reducing surface disturbance and disturbance associated with vehicle traffic and
other human activity (Section 2.2.3).
In addition, the following requirements would be implemented throughout mule deer and pronghorn
crucial winter range or crucial winter/yearlong range and migration corridors:




Man camps would be prohibited on BLM land;
Noise-reduction technology would be required at compressor stations; and
Migration corridors would be monitored to determine which fences restrict movement.

With these protection measures, the risk of big game displacement and stress from increased human
activity would be expected to decrease (especially during winter) compared to the Proposed Action. Dustabatement programs would also help maintain forage palatability adjacent to roads.
In addition to the measures discussed above, to reduce the human impact on big game in their CWR, this
alternative contains surface-disturbance and population thresholds developed to maintain pronghorn and
mule deer habitat and populations in the face of increasing development pressure. Surface-disturbance
thresholds would reduce the impact of habitat removal and modification in CWR. The surface-disturbance
thresholds are intended to reduce the amount of habitat disturbed and to mitigate disturbance through
reclamation. When surface disturbance for natural gas access roads, pipelines, well pads or other facilities
exceeds 5 percent of a lease within pronghorn or mule deer CWR, the BLM would:

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE





Evaluate reclamation success in the lease and review, approve and oversee the implementation of an
Operators’ revised reclamation plan to ensure it addresses the reason for the failed reclamation. The
calculated percentage disturbance would be adjusted downward for successful interim reclamation.
Conduct an assessment of the disturbance and determine if enhancement of CWR is needed at this
time. If so, begin implementation.
Install remote monitoring at all well pads.

If surface disturbance reached 10 percent of pronghorn or mule deer CWR in a lease, habitat
improvement projects would be required in addition to the requirements above. The BLM would establish
an interagency CD-C consultation group and consult with them to determine which projects would be
beneficial. These projects could include, but would not be limited to:



Water developments.
Vegetation treatments such as herbicide treatments, seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping
for regeneration, planting shrubs or trees, fencing, establishing food plots, etc.

If the WGFD were to express formal written concern that the herd within the project area was declining at
an accelerated rate, all new APDs on leases within pronghorn and mule deer CWR in the CD-C project
area would require an approved mitigation plan if the population decrease in those Herd Units were
attributable in whole or in part to oil and gas development. The plan would include, but not be limited to:






Evaluation of reclamation success in the lease and review, approve and oversee the implementation
of an Operators’ revised reclamation plan to ensure it addresses the reason for the failed
reclamation.
Implementation of BLM-approved habitat-improvement projects such as water developments or
vegetation treatments. (BLM may coordinate habitat improvement projects among multiple
Operators.) New well pads would not be authorized without Operator participation in habitatimprovement projects.
Limitation of the number of well pads to no more than four per section within CWR to maintain
habitat effectiveness.

If the population status of a species were to change in the future, additional data would be collected and
additional protective measures would be developed.
With these protective measures in place the impact from habitat removal and modification in CWR is
expected to decrease compared to the Proposed Action. Monitoring of population numbers would ensure
that any population decline is identified early on and mitigation applied. This level of development within
big game CWR, including migration routes, compounded by the current condition of CWR forage, along
with the additional stress and displacement during the production phase, would exceed the WGFD
definition of “High Impact” for both species, with the possibility of exceeding the WGFD definition of
“Extreme Impact” and would thus exceed significance Criterion 2.
Overlapping Big Game Crucial Winter Range. As in the discussion of both pronghorn and mule deer,
the additional protections available under this alternative would likely reduce the impacts to overlapping
big game CWR, including migratory routes, but would still exceed Criterion 3 and the WGFD definition
of “High Impact,” with the possibility of exceeding the WGFD definition of “Extreme Impact.”
Raptors. Under this alternative, no additional species-specific protections beyond those required by the
RMP (timing and surface stipulations) and BMPs (Appendix C) would apply. Because of the buffers and
restrictions on activity around raptor nests and the fact that most of the prey utilize habitat that can be
reclaimed in a timely fashion, the impact from Alternative B is not expected to exceed the significance
criteria.

4-92

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

Small Mammals and Neotropical Songbird Nests. Under this alternative, no additional species-specific
protections beyond those required by the RMP (timing and surface stipulations), BMPs (Appendix C)
and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act would apply. With the application of these mitigation measures and
implementation of timely reclamation activities, it is anticipated that local population productivity would
be maintained and the impact from Alternative B is not expected to exceed the significance criteria.
Upland Game Birds. No enhanced protection measures would apply; however, the mourning dove is
likely to benefit from protection measures under this alternative. Impacts to greater sage-grouse under this
alternative are discussed in detail in Section 4.9.3.4.
Fish. The Enhanced Resource Alternative Protections for the Muddy Creek Corridor/Watershed described
in Section 2.2.3.4 could substantially reduce project impacts to fish. The sources of these reductions
would include the following protections:






For protection of amphibians and their habitats, avoidance of surface-disturbing and disruptive
activities within 0.25 mile of Red Wash, springs, wells, and wetlands. The required avoidance
distance would be further increased on perennial streams to 0.5 mile. Exceptions would only be
granted by the BLM based on environmental analysis and site-specific engineering and mitigation
plans. Only actions within areas that could not be avoided and that would provide protection for the
resource identified would be approved. In-channel activities would be restricted to the low-flow
period.
Current monitoring on upper Muddy Creek would be extended to Lower Muddy Creek in the CD-C
area. This requirement would bring lower Muddy Creek into conformance with the monitoring
being done for upper Muddy Creek and other drainages within the Atlantic Rim project area. If
results of the monitoring program showed impacts to sensitive fish habitat, the BLM and an
interagency CD-C consultation group would determine whether habitat-improvement projects
should be implemented. The projects could include, but would not be limited to, increasing the
number of drainage features along roads, increasing in-stream cover for fish, and other measures as
applicable.
A monitoring plan for Bitter Creek watershed will be designed.

The following requirements related to selenium and salinity for well locations and operations would also
be implemented:



No surface discharge of produced waters within the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds.
Line all reserve pits in the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds.

These protections, however, only apply to BLM land and only about 36 percent of Muddy Creek within
the project area is on BLM land, while 51 percent and 13 percent are on private and state land,
respectively. An unintentional consequence of these protections being applied only to BLM land could be
to increase drilling activities on private and state land. Such development on private and State land along
Muddy Creek could completely negate the enhanced resource protections on BLM land along Muddy
Creek. To preclude this possibility, the Operators and the state should make a commitment to apply these
same enhanced resource alternative protections to private and state land along Muddy Creek. Without this
commitment, it is possible that the impacts to fish for this alternative would be the same as for the
Proposed Action.
4.8.3.4

Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap with High and Low Density Development
Areas

This alternative designates parts of the project area for high-density development—those areas that have
seen the greatest natural-gas development to date (Map 2-1). Within the high-density development areas,
a 60-acre cap would be placed on the amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance allowed at any one time
in a section of public land. For the remainder of the project area—the low-density development areas—

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-93

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

the cap would be 30 acres per public land section. Once interim reclamation on the development is
determined to be successful, the cap would be increased by the number of acres deemed to have achieved
successful interim reclamation.
Under Alternative C, the types of impacts to wildlife species and their habitats would be similar to those
described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.8.3.1). The cap, however, places a limit on the amount of
unreclaimed surface disturbance at any one time in a section of federal land. This requirement should
encourage the use of directional drilling and enhanced reclamation practices. For this reason, the scope
and intensity of impacts on wildlife and their habitat would be less. Maximum surface disturbance for this
alternative is estimated to decrease by 4,245 acres in the short term to 42,955 acres, a 9-percent reduction
from the Proposed Action. Long-term disturbance would decrease by 1,543 acres, to 17,318 acres.
Because more wells would be drilled from directional well pads under this alternative, fewer well pads
overall would be developed—an estimated 5,299 compared to the estimated 6,126 well locations of the
Proposed Action, a reduction of about 13 percent. Therefore, fewer access roads would be developed and
habitat fragmentation and other adverse impacts would be less extensive than for the Proposed Action.
However, disruptive activities are expected to continue and may increase in high-density development
areas, accompanied by associated adverse affects on population productivity and survival in localized
areas, when compared to the Proposed Action.
Pronghorn. Initially, an additional 3.3 percent of pronghorn CWR within the project area would be
directly impacted by development of well pads and access roads under the Proposed Action (Table 4.81). Assuming successful interim reclamation, approximately 6 percent of pronghorn CWR within the
project area would remain disturbed for the life of the project.
Of the estimated 90,310 acres of CWR and associated migratory routes in the project area (Map 3.8-2),
30 percent would be in the high-density development area and 70 percent outside. Therefore, no more
than 30 acres per section could be unreclaimed at any one time in the majority of pronghorn CWR. In the
30 percent of pronghorn CWR located within the high-density development, no more than 60 acres per
section could be unreclaimed at any one time. Due to the surface disturbance cap, more directional wells
would be drilled, decreasing habitat fragmentation from that of the Proposed Action and also reducing the
acreage of indirect impact to pronghorn, especially in the low-density areas. Since private and state lands
would not be subject to the cap, surface disturbance in those sections would not be limited, so the benefits
of less fragmentation may not be as prevalent at the landscape level. Impacts under this alternative are
expected to be less than those of the Proposed Action and sufficient to avoid significance under Criterion
2, provided disturbance is limited to 20 acres per square mile (the likely disturbance associated with a
single multi-well pad). If that figure were exceeded, the impact could be significant. In addition,
disruptive activities are expected to continue and may increase, in high-density areas, accompanied by
associated adverse affects on population productivity and survival in localized areas, when compared to
the Proposed Action.
Mule Deer. There are 17,849 acres of mule deer CWR within the project area, located in the southeastern
portion (Map 3.8-4). Of this acreage, approximately 25 percent is within the high-density development
area and 75 percent outside. Initially, an additional 4.1 percent of mule deer CWR and associated
migratory routes within the project area would be directly impacted by development of well pads and
access roads under Alternative C (Table 4.8-2). Assuming successful interim reclamation, approximately
6.4 percent of mule deer CWR within the project area would remain disturbed for the life of the project.
Impacts under this alternative are expected to be less than those of the Proposed Action and sufficient to
avoid significance under Criterion 2, provided disturbance is limited to 20 acres per square mile (the
likely disturbance associated with a single multi-well pad). If that figure were exceeded, the impact could
be significant. In addition, disruptive activities are expected to continue and may increase in high-density
areas, accompanied by associated adverse affects on population productivity and survival in localized
areas when compared to the Proposed Action.

4-94

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

Alternative C is expected to exceed significance Criterion 2 (substantial disruption or irreplaceable loss of
vital and high-value habitats) and the WGFD definition of “High Impact” for pronghorn and mule deer
CWR and associated migration routes in high-density development areas.
Overlapping Big Game Crucial Winter Range. Impacts under this alternative are expected to be less
than those of the Proposed Action and sufficient to avoid significance under Criterion 2, provided
disturbance is limited to 20 acres per square mile (the likely disturbance associated with a single multiwell pad). If that figure were exceeded, the impact could be significant. However, disruptive activities are
expected to continue and may increase if high-density development were to occur in CWR.
Raptors, Small Mammals, Upland Game Birds, Neotropical Migratory Birds. In areas of low-density
development, impacts to these species should be less than the Proposed Action since the amount of
surface disturbance, both initial and long-term, would decrease. In high-density development areas
impacts would likely be greater on some species when compared to the Proposed Action. For example,
recent research (Gilbert and Chalfoun 2011) found that when natural gas well density reached more than 8
wells per square kilometer (> 20 wells per square mile) the observed numbers of Brewer’s sparrow, sage
sparrow, and vespers sparrow declined. In the same study, horned lark numbers increased while sage
thrashers showed no effect as a result of high-density well development (Gilbert and Chalfoun 2011).
The impact from Alternative C is expected to exceed the significance criteria in high-density areas;
however, the application of the RMP general wildlife management action #13 (BLM 2008a, pg. 2-53),
“Surface-disturbing activities and disruptive activities will be intensively managed. BMPs (Appendix 14
and 15) will be applied to surface-disturbing and disruptive activities to maintain or enhance upland game
bird species, neotropical and other migratory bird species, and their habitats,” may serve to reduce these
impacts and thus the significance criteria may not be exceeded.
Fish. Within the project area, only a small part of Muddy Creek would be located in the high-density area
(Map 2-1). Most of Muddy Creek is in the low-density area. In addition, where Muddy Creek is within
the high-density areas, it primarily flows through private land. Because surface disturbance would be
capped at 30 acres per section in the low-density area and at 60 acres per section in the high-density area,
impacts to fish in Muddy Creek derived from surface disturbance should be decreased compared with the
Proposed Action. However, without the added types of protections for Muddy Creek discussed in Section
4.8.3.3 for Alternative B, the types of impacts to fish would be similar to those for the Proposed Action,
although the magnitude of impacts should be less.
4.8.3.5

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Under Alternative D, the types of impacts to wildlife species and their habitats would be similar to those
described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.8.3.1) though on a more localized level. This alternative
requires that all future natural gas wells on federal mineral estate and surface be drilled from multi-well
pads. In public land sections that have already had development, the enlargement of one existing well pad
would be permitted as the multi-well pad for all future drilling in that section. No new roads or pipeline
routes would be permitted in these leases. In sections in which there is no existing development, one new
well pad would be permitted for all future development. One road and pipeline corridor on the lease or
section would be permitted. The objective of this alternative is to minimize surface disturbance, thereby
reducing habitat loss and wildlife disturbance. This alternative also reduces habitat fragmentation. Total
surface disturbance for this alternative would decrease by 10,751 acres to 36,499, a reduction of about 23
percent from the Proposed Action. Long-term disturbance is estimated to decrease by 3,908 acres to
14,952 acres, a reduction of about 21 percent from the Proposed Action.
Because more wells would be drilled from directional well pads under this alternative, fewer well pads
overall would be developed—an estimated 4,032 compared to the estimated 6,126 well locations of the
Proposed Action for a reduction of about 34 percent. Therefore, fewer access roads and pipelines would

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-95

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

be developed and habitat fragmentation and indirect impacts would be less extensive than for the
Proposed Action.
Pronghorn. Initially, an additional 3.0 percent of pronghorn CWR and associated migration routes within
the project area would be directly impacted by development of well pads and access roads under
Alternative D (Table 4.8-1). This is a decrease from the 3.6 percent increase in disturbance anticipated
under the Proposed Action. As a result of the extended timeframe needed to fully restore the shrub
component of the CWR, as much as 5.6 percent of pronghorn CWR within the project area would remain
disturbed for the life of the project; however, various seral stages of shrub habitat would be available over
the life of the project and would serve as pronghorn forage.
Due to the multi-well pad requirement, fewer well pads would be constructed, decreasing habitat
fragmentation as compared to the Proposed Action. Alternative D would also reduce the extent of indirect
impacts to pronghorn, especially in the lower-density development areas. Since private and state lands
would not be subject to the multi-well pad requirement, surface disturbance in those sections would not
be limited, so the benefits of reduced habitat fragmentation may not be as evident at the landscape level.
Impacts under this alternative are expected to be less than those of the Proposed Action and sufficient to
avoid significance under Criterion 2; provided disturbance is limited to less than 20 acres per square mile,
the impact would be classified as “Moderate” per the WGFD definition (WGFD 2010a). The application
of mitigation (Timing Stipulations) precluding activity in crucial ranges and associated migration routes
during the winter season should serve to minimize impacts to the species from these long-term/long­
duration well sites and their noise and enhanced activity levels.
Mule Deer. An additional 3.7 percent of mule deer CWR and associated migration routes within the
project area would be directly impacted by development of well pads and access roads under Alternative
D (Table 4.8-2). Due to the extended timeframe needed to fully restore the shrub component of the CWR,
approximately 6.0 percent of mule deer CWR within the project area would remain disturbed for the life
of the project; however, various seral stages of shrub habitat would be available over the life of the
project and would serve as mule deer forage. The impacts would be similar to those described for
pronghorn above. However, a greater percentage of the Mule Deer CWR is outside of the checkerboard,
so the landscape-scale benefits of this alternative should be greater for mule deer than for pronghorn.
Impacts under this alternative are expected to be less than those of the Proposed Action, and sufficient to
avoid significance under Criterion 2; provided disturbance is limited to less than 20 acres per square mile,
the impact would be classified as “Moderate” per the WGFD (2010) definition. The application of
mitigation (Timing Stipulations) precluding activity in crucial ranges and associated migration routes
during the winter season should serve to minimize impacts to the species from these long-term/long­
duration well sites and their noise and enhanced activity levels.
Overlapping Big Game Crucial Winter Range. Impacts under this alternative are expected to be less
than those of the Proposed Action, and would avoid significance under Criterion 2 and meet the WGFD
definition of “Moderate Impact” (WGFD 2010a), provided disturbance is limited to less than 20 acres per
square mile.
Raptors, Small Mammals, Upland Game Birds, and Neotropical Migratory Birds. Impacts to these
species should be less than for the Proposed Action since the amount of surface disturbance, both initial
and long-term, would decrease. Noise from drilling and completion activities occurring at long-duration
multi-well pads could represent a localized negative impact to a sub-set of sensitive receptors (i.e. nesting
raptors, sage-grouse) due to the increased period of time required for drilling at a single location. Reduced
surface disturbance and habitat fragmentation resulting from multi-well pads comes with an increase in
decibel level and frequency of that noise, as well as the extended period of time over which large haultruck activity would occur. However, application of the following RMP general wildlife management
action #13 (BLM 2008a, p. 2-53) would also serve to provide habitat protection for small mammal
species: “Surface-disturbing activities and disruptive activities will be intensively managed. BMPs

4-96

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

(Appendix 14 and 15) will be applied to surface-disturbing and disruptive activities to maintain or
enhance upland game bird species, neotropical and other migratory bird species, and their habitats.” With
the application of these mitigation measures, the impact from Alternative D is not expected to exceed the
significance criteria.
Fish. The types of impacts to fish for this alternative would be similar to those for the Proposed Action.
Total surface disturbance for this alternative, however, would be about 23 percent lower than for the
Proposed Action; therefore, the magnitude of impacts to fish should be proportionately less.
4.8.3.6

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no new surface disturbance and no new impacts on
wildlife habitat. Wildlife would continue to be affected by earlier habitat alterations, by human activity in
the vicinity of natural gas production facilities, by traffic in the project area, and by diminished
palatability of browse and forage caused by dust.
4.8.4

Impact Summary

The project, as proposed, would disturb and alter approximately 47,200 acres of wildlife habitat over the
15-year project development phase, in addition to the 60,176 acres previously disturbed by natural gas
and other development. Reclamation of disturbed areas should recover to grass-dominated habitats in one
to several years, depending on precipitation and effectiveness of reclamation efforts. Shrub habitats would
not reach pre-disturbance levels during the life of the project; however, a variety of shrub age classes
would be available as forage and cover throughout the project area as reclaimed areas mature. Therefore,
wildlife dependent on mature shrub habitats would be impacted most by habitat loss. In addition to the
physical removal of habitat, disturbance during construction and production can displace or preclude
wildlife use during all seasons. Timing restrictions for the critical times of year have been developed for
the most sensitive species and are generally implemented during the development phase. During the
production phase, the application of BMPs identified in Appendix 15 of the RMP (BLM 2008a) would
work to alleviate impacts to the species. This would likely serve to reduce stress and help maintain animal
condition and improve winter survival of the animals as they travel farther or are displaced to lowerquality range. Other impacts from natural gas development include habitat fragmentation, reduced
availability and palatability of forage due to dust, and mortality from collision between vehicles and
wildlife.
The Proposed Action is expected to exceed significance under Criterion 2 (substantial disruption or
irreplaceable loss of vital and high-value habitats) and the WGFD definition of “High Impact” for
pronghorn and mule deer CWR and associated migration routes. Other species (raptors, small mammals,
songbirds, and fish) should be protected sufficiently by the COAs, RMP requirements, and BMPs to
avoid exceeding the significance level.
Alternative A: 100-percent Vertical Drilling would affect an additional 14,496 acres of habitat
compared to the Proposed Action. The impacts described above would be intensified under this
alternative; Criterion 2 and the WGFD definition of “Extreme Impact” would likely be exceeded for
pronghorn and mule deer CWR, migration routes, and overlapping crucial habitats.
Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection was designed to reduce impacts of development on those
species or habitats that are most vulnerable to an infill oil and gas project. There would be a slight
reduction (1,684 acres, about 3.5 percent) in the amount of habitat disturbed under this alternative
compared to the Proposed Action. Anticipated impacts to mule deer and pronghorn CWR and associated
migration routes would be reduced compared to the Proposed Action through the application of additional
mitigation requirements. That said, impacts to mule deer and pronghorn CWR and migration routes are
expected to exceed significance under Criterion 2 and the meet the WGFD definition of “High Impact”

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-97

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILDLIFE

(WGFD 2010a). Other wildlife species would also benefit from this alternative and its additional
protection of the Muddy Creek watershed, riparian areas, and playas.
Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance, 60 or 30 Acres per Section seeks to reduce habitat
disturbance and reward successful reclamation. This alternative is expected to impact 4,245 fewer acres
than the Proposed Action. It should reduce the impacts to all species below those of the Proposed
Alternative, but is still expected to exceed the level of significance under Criterion 2 for mule deer and
pronghorn CWR. Anticipated impacts would meet the WGFD definition of “High” for both pronghorn
and mule deer, as well as “High” for overlapping crucial ranges (WGFD 2010a), primarily in areas of
high-density development.
Alternative D: 100 Percent Directional Drilling is expected to reduce surface disturbance by 10,751
acres (about 23 percent) compared to the Proposed Action. Impacts under this alternative are expected to
be less than those of the Proposed Action, and sufficient to avoid significance under Criterion 2; provided
disturbance is limited to less than 20 acres per square mile, the impact would be classified as “Moderate”
per the WGFD (2010) definition.
Alternative E: No Action is assumed to result in no new surface disturbance and no new impacts on
wildlife habitat because no further natural gas development would occur within the CD-C project area.
4.8.5

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

The amount of wildlife habitat would be unavoidably reduced on a short- to long-term basis as a result of
the surface disturbance related to construction of well sites and associated facilities on public, state, and
private lands within the CD-C project area. The quality and function of habitat would also be reduced due
to intermediate- to long-term alterations in the vegetative composition of habitats and the continuing
traffic and human presence associated with natural gas production activities. These impacts would be in
addition to historical impacts from prior surface disturbance. Proposed and existing habitat alteration
together would represent ten percent or more of the CD-C project area. The impacts on mule deer and
pronghorn habitat are expected to exceed significance under Criterion 2—management actions that result
in substantial disruption or irreplaceable loss of vital and high-value habitats—for the Proposed Action
and all action alternatives except Alternative D.
Application of additional mitigation measures such as those listed below, many of them found as
elements of Alternative B, could work toward reducing the impacts of the Proposed Action and the action
alternatives. In many circumstances the RFO is already requiring these mitigation measures as standard
Conditions of Approval (COAs) (M. Read, pers. com., January 2012).

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

4.9
4.9.1

SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES
Introduction

Special-status species are (1) those listed as Threatened or Endangered by the USFWS under the
Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 or those that are candidates or have been petitioned for listing and
(2) those designated by the BLM State Director as sensitive (BLM 2010). Species are designated as
sensitive if their numbers are declining so rapidly that ESA listing might be necessary, or if they have
typically small or dispersed populations or inhabit unique habitats.
Eight species listed by the USFWS as threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate are present, or
potentially are present, within or near the CD-C project area (USFWS 2010; Table 3.9-1). Two are
mammals, and one is a bird. Four of the species are fish found downstream of the project area in the
Colorado River system which may be impacted if water depletions occur or if environmental
contaminants are increased within the system. One plant listed as USFWS-threatened (Ute ladies’-tresses)
may occur within the project area
Twenty-eight species that have been designated as sensitive by BLM are present or potentially present
within or near the project area: eight mammals, 10 birds, two amphibians, four fish, and four plants
(Table 3.9-3).
A Biological Assessment (BA) will not be included in this draft document. Once a Preferred Alternative
is selected, the BA will be finalized and sent to the USFWS for a Biological Opinion (BO).
4.9.2

Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) management objectives for special status wildlife and fish species are
the same as those presented for wildlife (Section 4.8.2). The RMP also defines the following impact
significance criteria that are used in this document to assess the impacts associated with the Proposed
Action and alternatives (BLM 2008b). Impacts to special status wildlife and fish species would be
considered significant if any of the following were to occur:


Substantial loss of the biological integrity and habitat function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
that would make a species eligible for listing under the ESA.
 Decreased viability or increased mortality of Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, and/or Candidate
species, or adverse alteration of their critical habitats.
 Substantial loss of habitat function or disruption of life-history requirements of special status
species that would preclude improvement of their status. Habitat function means the arrangement of
habitat features and the capability of those features to sustain species, populations, and diversity of
wildlife over time (WGFD 2010a).
Impacts to special status plant species would be considered significant if any of the following were to
occur:


Any action or event that would remove a community’s unique attributes or ability to support other
resource values within the planning period, or if corrective actions were beyond the scope of the
RMP.
 The viability of protected plant species is jeopardized, with little likelihood of reestablishment after
disturbance, or actions result in the need to list a species under ESA.
 Actions that have the potential to remove sensitive plant species or substantially alter the habitat’s
ability to support the species.
Additionally, the RFO has determined that the following impact significance criterion should be included
for this project:

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-99

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES


Actions that preclude attainment of conservation goals, as stated in conservation plans and strategies
for special status species.
The degree of impact that constitutes “substantial” loss of habitat or disruption of life-history
requirements is quantified for some wildlife species in the habitat and population thresholds described in
the Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative (Alternative B).
4.9.3
4.9.3.1

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action

Habitats directly and indirectly affected by the proposed project are the same as those discussed for
general wildlife (Section 4.8.3).
Standard environmental protection measures prescribed as Conditions of Approval (COAs) or used as
BMPs (Appendix C) would be implemented under the Proposed Action and all alternatives. The Wildlife
Monitoring and Protection Plan (Appendix I) would be followed to detect, prevent, and reduce impacts to
wildlife and fish species throughout the life of the project. These protective and mitigative measures
would serve to minimize the impacts of development activity on public land managed by the BLM.
However, the measures do not apply to private and state lands, which encompass 46 percent of the project
area. Therefore, the effectiveness of the mitigation is limited when considering a landscape approach,
particularly in the checkerboard section of the project area.
Threatened, Endangered, Proposed or Candidate Wildlife Species

Habitat for Canada lynx is not found in the project area and their potential occurrence is described as
Very Unlikely (Table 3.9-3). This species will not be further addressed in this document.
Black-footed ferret. The presence of black-footed ferret in the project area is very unlikely (see Section
3.9.1.1). The Proposed Action would likely disturb colonies of white-tailed prairie dogs, which are the
black-footed ferret’s primary habitat and prey source in this area. Surveys for black-footed ferrets may be
required before ground-disturbing activities within mapped prairie-dog colonies located in the Continental
Divide, Dad, and Desolation Flats non-block clearance areas. The remaining white-tailed prairie-dog
colonies within the CD-C project area are within the USFWS designated block clearance area, where
surveys for black-footed ferrets are no longer warranted. The Proposed Action is not expected to exceed
the impact significance criteria for black-footed ferret populations.
Greater sage-grouse. The impacts with the potential for the greatest negative effects to greater sagegrouse populations include: loss of nesting or brood-rearing habitat, displacement or additional stress due
to increased human activities, excessive noise levels proximal to occupied leks, removal or modification
of severe winter habitats, and increased predation due to an increased number of roosting sites for raptors
on power poles and other man-made structures.
Approximately 60 percent of the CD-C project area is comprised of sagebrush and other mesic shrubdominated vegetative classes, which represent identified greater sage-grouse nesting habitat, as defined by
the RFO (Map 3.9-2). Recovery of shrubs in locations that have been disturbed by development to predisturbance levels would not occur during the life of the project. However, younger age classes of
sagebrush with grass and forb components may serve as nesting and brood-rearing habitat for grouse.
Populations have persisted in many areas where energy development is ongoing, yet research has shown
that development can influence declines in lek occupancy, lek attendance, and possibly in population
persistence (Braun et al. 2002, Aldridge and Boyce 2007, Harju et al. 2010, Walker et al. 2007). Sagegrouse may repopulate an area following energy development, but may not attain population levels that
occurred before development (Braun 1998). Likelihood of abandonment is higher when nests are
disturbed early in the incubation period (Remington and Braun 1991).

4-100

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

In the generally accepted body of literature, the following are potential sources of indirect impact to
greater sage-grouse and their habitats, all of which could lead to lower productivity and long-term decline
in the population of this species in the project area (WGFD 2010a):












Habitat loss resulting from dust settling on vegetation (Section 4.6) and reducing the palatability
and production of forbs and shrubs used by grouse.
Visual intimidation from high-profile structures.
Potential loss of sagebrush and understory due to over-browsing or grazing by wild ungulates,
livestock, and wild horses on ranges shared with grouse, reducing quality and abundance of nesting,
brood-rearing and winter habitats, as well as forage.
In areas of Extreme Impact (more than 3 well pad locations or 60 acres of disturbance per square
mile within 2 miles of an occupied lek in non-core population areas; WGFD 2010a), as
development becomes more intense, the impact zones surrounding each well pad, production
facility, and road corridor begin to overlap, thereby reducing habitat effectiveness over much larger,
contiguous areas. Human, equipment, and vehicular activity and noise impacts are also more
frequent and intensive (WGFD 2010a).
Noise levels interfere with bird communication during mating periods resulting in lower bird
attendance at leks.
Disruptive human activities alter normal bird behavior, increase nest abandonment, and may
displace birds into less-desirable habitats.
Construction of facilities and roads creates a long-term loss of grouse habitat and increases
fragmentation of remaining habitat.
Increased predation by raptors and corvids due to facilities such as well houses, compressor stations,
and above-ground power lines serving as perches.
Roads may also serve as travel corridors for some predators.

Refer to Section 3.9.1.1, Greater sage-grouse, for a complete discussion of the protective measures in
place throughout the project area for the conservation of greater sage-grouse and its seasonal habitats. The
conservation strategy for greater sage-grouse continues to evolve and the requirements that would be
applied to proposed activities in sage-grouse habitat will change similarly. Map 3.9-2 shows the core and
non-core sage-grouse population areas within and near the project area. Fifty-four of the project area’s
leks are in non-core areas and 31 are in state-designated core areas.
The Proposed Action and alternatives have been analyzed relative to the requirements of IM WY-2012­
019 (BLM 2012c) and the national IM 2012-043 (BLM 2012b) which impose limits for surfacedisturbing and disruptive activities in sage-grouse core and non-core areas. The conservation guidelines
provided in the WGFD Recommendation for Development of Oil and Gas Resources within Important
Wildlife Habitats (WGFD 2010a) were also considered. IM WY-2012-019 (BLM 2012c) calls for
consideration and evaluation of greater sage-grouse conservation measures that are the same as or in some
cases more stringent than those of the Rawlins RMP. The Rawlins RMP prohibits surface-disturbing
activity on and within 0.25 mile of the perimeter of an occupied lek year-round in non-core areas and
increases the distance to 0.6 of a mile from the perimeter of an occupied lek in designated core. The IM
calls for consideration of the same. The RMP has an associated timing limit on disruptive activities within
0.25 miles of an occupied lek from 6:00 pm to 9:00 am from March 1 to May 20; IM WY-2012-019 calls
for consideration of extending the distance of that timing stipulation to 0.6 mile in core areas. Under the
IM, avoidance of surface-disturbing and/or disruptive activities within all core area nesting and early
brood-rearing habitat (Map 3.9-2) from March 1 to July 15 (timing period as found in the RMP) is to be
considered. The RMP applies that same level of protection to identified nesting and early brood-rearing
habitat, regardless of distance from the lek, in non-core areas from March 1 to July 15 (M. Read,

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

pers.com. February 2012). BLM is currently working to amend the RMP as it relates to greater sagegrouse conservation (BLM 2010c).
IM WY-2012-019 also includes a density goal for core areas that requires maintenance of sagebrush
communities by maintaining or reducing the existing level of density of energy production and/or
transmission structures on the landscape, or not exceeding one energy production location and/or
transmission structure per 640 acres. The one location and cumulative value of existing disturbances in
the area would not exceed 5 percent (32 acres) of sagebrush habitat within those same 640 acres.
IM WY-2012-019 provides protection for mapped or modeled winter habitat/concentration areas from
surface-disturbing activities from November 15 to March 14. Activities would be allowed outside this
period and winter habitat could still be affected or removed by surface disturbance outside the timing
limitation. Loss of this habitat could lead to lower productivity and long-term decline in the population of
this species. As winter concentration areas are identified and mapped in the CD-C project area BLM
would apply seasonal stipulations and habitat protection measures (BLM 2008a and 2012b).
Habitat loss would continue around leks outside the 0.25-mile protected buffer in non-core areas and the
0.6-mile buffer in core areas, including within the buffer zones outside the seasonal protection. In noncore areas, application of the standard for avoidance of potential nesting and brood-rearing habitat as well
as the BLM standard COAs, BMPs (Appendix C), Timing Limitations, and Mitigation (Appendix I)
would reduce the impact to sage-grouse but impact to those populations (dust, noise, and continued
human presence during the drilling and production phase) would still be anticipated. It is expected that
greater than three wells or 60 acres of disturbance per square mile could occur within the 2-mile radius of
some non-core leks but not all. In some areas this level of disturbance has already been exceeded; this
would be considered an “Extreme Impact” relative to those individual leks (WGFD 2010). In core
population areas, habitat disturbance would be limited to less than 5 percent of a 640-acre section or one
disruption (i.e. well location) per section (square mile), averaged over the specific sage-grouse impact
(i.e. DDCT) analysis area. Provided the protections for greater sage-grouse found in IM WY-2012-019
and the Rawlins RMP are applied, it is not expected that the significance criteria would be exceeded in
core areas but localized exceedance of Criteria 1, 2, and 4 could occur in non-core areas. Sage-grouse
populations in non-core areas may experience localized substantial loss of habitat, biological integrity or
function, decreased viability or increased mortality or substantial disruption of life-history requirements.
By definition non-core areas are not “critical habitats;” therefore Criteria 3 would not be exceeded.
Threatened and Endangered Fish Species

Four federally Endangered fish species may occur as downstream residents of the Colorado River system:
Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius), bonytail (Gila elegans), humpback chub (Gila cypha),
and razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) (USFWS 2003). Suitable habitat for these species does exist
downstream of the project area in the Little Snake, Yampa, and Green Rivers. Because the Colorado
pikeminnow is found in the Little Snake River, it could migrate into Muddy Creek. Muddy Creek,
however, is not considered suitable habitat for this species. The action alternatives are not expected to
affect this habitat, provided that mitigation measures for water resources and soils outlined in this
document are implemented. Although they currently exist only downstream of the project area, water
draining from the project area affects the downstream habitat for these species. Under the Proposed
Action, the sources of risks to these fish species are water depletions, discharges of produced water, and
spills of toxic materials.
Water Depletions. The Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program is a partnership
working to recover the endangered fish of the Upper Colorado River Basin. The goal of recovery is to
achieve natural, self-sustaining populations of the endangered fish so that they no longer require
protection under the ESA. Under the Recovery and Implementation Program (RIP) for Endangered Fish
Species in the Upper Colorado River Basin, “any water depletions from tributary waters within the

4-102

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Colorado River drainage are considered as jeopardizing the continued existence of these fish.” Tributary
water is defined as water that contributes to instream flow habitat. Depletion is defined as water which
would contribute to the river flow if not intercepted and removed from the system.
The FWS has determined that progress made under the RIP has been sufficient to merit a waiver of the
depletion fee, which helps fund the RIP, for depletions of 100 acre-feet per year or less (Memorandum
dated March 9, 1995 to Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, Region 6, from Regional
Director 6, “Intra-Service Section 7 Consultation for Elimination of Fees for Water Depletions of 100
acre-feet or Less from the Upper Colorado River Basin”). The Proposed Action, however, may deplete an
average of 510 acre-feet of water per year (Section 4.4.4.1) and therefore a one-time depletion fee of
approximately $20 per acre foot may be required. The figure of 510 acre-feet is the amount of water
estimated to be withdrawn from aquifers in the Wasatch formation that may have contact with and
contribute to the Little Snake River and its tributaries, including Muddy Creek. The extent to which the
groundwater withdrawals constitute a depletion and any depletion fee will be determined in consultation
between BLM and FWS before the Final CD-C EIS.
Discharges of Produced Water and Spills of Toxic Chemicals. Produced water from the project area
would not be discharged to Muddy Creek within the Little Snake River drainage; therefore, producedwater discharges will not pose a risk to these species. Accidental releases (e.g., spills) of toxic chemicals
also could occur. However, accidental releases of toxic chemicals should become highly diluted before
they would reach any downstream waters where these species occur; consequently, the risks from such
occurrences are negligible (BLM 2007). For any future proposals involving CBNG, the proposed
treatment and disposal of produced water will be analyzed in a separate NEPA document.
Threatened and Endangered Plant Species

The USFWS (2002) determined that the threatened Ute ladies’-tresses (Spiranthes diluvialis) may be
present within the CD-C project area. However, because extensive surveys failed to document the
presence of Ute ladies’-tresses within the project area, impacts to this plant are not anticipated. The
possible presence of this federally listed plant species on public lands would be determined by the
presence of appropriate riparian habitat. The application of the COA requiring avoidance of riparian areas
by 500 feet serves to protect this species. In the unlikely event that the species is found within the project
area, potential impacts to the species on public land would be addressed through consultation with the
USFWS. In particular, those sites would be avoided to prevent any impacts. Therefore, decreased viability
or increased mortality of Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, and/or Candidate plant species or adverse
alteration of their critical habitats, if identified, on public lands within the project area would not occur
with implementation of the Proposed Action. Because the likely presence of this species on private or
state lands is low, the likelihood of direct impacts on those lands is also low.
Sensitive Wildlife Species

The following sensitive wildlife species have not been found within the project area and would likely not
be impacted by the project: black-tailed prairie dog, fringed myotis, long-eared myotis, spotted bat,
Townsend’s big-eared bat, Baird’s sparrow, Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, northern goshawk, peregrine
falcon, and boreal toad. These species will not be discussed further. Nevertheless, should populations be
found, mitigation would be applied to avoid disruption of habitat function or of life history requirements.
Species that may be affected by the Proposed Action are discussed below.
Sensitive Mammal Species
Fringed myotis, long-eared myotis, spotted bat, and Townsend’s big-eared bat have the potential to
occur in the project area even though their preferred roosting and hibernation habitats are not found in the
project area; however, equipment stack caps would be required as a mitigation for these species in an

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

effort to preclude incidental roosting. No other adverse effects are anticipated at this time, and Criterion 2
would not be exceeded.
Pygmy rabbits are patchily distributed throughout the project area (WYNDD 2007, HWA unpublished
data). The intensity of development associated with implementation of the Proposed Action would likely
result in direct disturbance of some portions of pygmy rabbit habitat and burrow systems. The RFO has a
survey and avoidance policy for pygmy rabbit burrow systems. Therefore, direct impacts to pygmy
rabbits, in the form of lost burrows and foraging habitat, are not expected to exceed the impact
significance criteria.
Swift foxes have been documented within the project area in the past; however, sightings in the area have
not occurred in recent years. The intensity of development associated with implementation of the
Proposed Action would likely result in direct disturbance to some suitable foraging habitat. Should
populations be found, mitigation would be developed to protect them. Therefore, impacts are not expected
to exceed the impact significance criteria.
White-tailed prairie-dog colonies covering approximately 8,818 acres have been mapped within the
project area to date (BLM unpublished data, HWA unpublished data). The Rawlins RMP requires that
development avoid prairie-dog colonies whenever possible. The intensity of development associated with
implementation of the Proposed Action would likely result in direct disturbance to some portions of these
prairie-dog colonies. Direct impacts to prairie dogs, in the form of lost burrows and foraging habitat, are
not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
Wyoming pocket gophers are found within the project area. This was established by trapping efforts in
2008–2010 (WYNDD unpublished data, HWA unpublished data). Based on those trapping efforts, the
availability of suitable habitat, and the known distribution of the species, Wyoming pocket gophers are
likely to be found in additional areas of suitable habitat within the project area. The BLM requires sitespecific surveys to determine if a project proposal should be relocated in an effort to avoid Wyoming
pocket gopher mounds whenever possible. Therefore, impacts are not expected to exceed the impact
significance criteria.
Sensitive Bird Species
Bald eagles have been observed within the project area primarily from November through March (WGFD
2006, HWA unpublished data). No bald eagle nests or nesting habitat occur within the area, and the
nearest potential nesting habitat is found along the Little Snake River, approximately 9 miles south of the
project area. Bald eagles may forage within the project area during the winter months because of carrion
associated with pronghorn, mule deer, and elk winter ranges. The potential for vehicle-animal collisions
would increase as a result of greater vehicle traffic associated with the project. Because bald eagles
commonly feed on carrion, particularly during the winter months, the presence of road-killed wildlife on
and adjacent to the access roads is an attractant. Eagles feeding on these carcasses are in danger of being
struck by moving vehicles. However, such occurrences would be rare and effects on the population are
not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
Brewer’s sparrow, loggerhead shrike, sage sparrow, and sage thrasher are the predominant shrubdependent songbirds that occur within the project area (WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007, HWA unpublished
data). In addition to the removal of habitat, activities under the Proposed Action may displace birds to
lower-quality habitats, which could lead to a reduction in reproduction rates or an increase in predation.
Recent research (Gilbert and Chalfoun 2011) found that when natural gas well density reached more than
eight wells per square kilometer (more than 20 wells per square mile) the observed numbers of Brewer’s
sparrow, sage sparrow, and vespers sparrow declined. In the same study horned lark numbers increased
while sage thrashers showed no effect as a result of high-density well development (Gilbert and Chalfoun
2011).

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Burrowing owls are found throughout the project area (WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007, BLM unpublished
data). Surveys for this species should be conducted before construction in prairie-dog colonies during the
owl breeding/nesting season. If nesting owls are found, the same measures used for protection of other
raptor species (Appendix I) will be applied. Given these precautionary measures, the Proposed Action is
not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria for this species population.
Ferruginous hawks are the most abundant raptor species nesting within the project area (BLM
unpublished data). The primary impact to ferruginous hawks from project activities is disturbance during
nesting, which could result in reproductive failure. This impact would be mitigated by implementing
measures in Appendix C, such as no surface occupancy (i.e. well locations, roads, ancillary facilities, or
other surface structures) year-round within 1,200 feet of a ferruginous hawk nest and a seasonal
restriction on surface disturbing and other disruptive activity from March 1 to July 31 within 1 mile of a
ferruginous hawk nest. Nests located near private or state surface in the checkerboard would not benefit
from the entire 1-mile seasonal buffer zone for nesting/foraging ferruginous hawks. It is difficult to
determine if this would exceed Criterion 4 in this case because other factors such as topography could
decrease the size of the needed buffer around nests, but the impacts are not expected to exceed the
criterion.
Long-billed curlew is an uncommon summer resident, but may be locally common in suitable habitat
(WGFD 2004a). The long-billed curlew has been recorded once within the project area (WGFD 2007)
and is not expected to nest within the area due to lack of habitat. No significant impacts to this species are
expected with implementation of the Proposed Action.
Mountain plover. The impacts with the potential for the greatest effects to mountain plover populations
include: loss of nesting habitat, displacement or additional stress due to increased human activities, and
increased potential for vehicular collisions due to higher traffic levels on existing and new roads.
Mountain plover breed in suitable habitat throughout the project area (WGFD 2007, BLM unpublished
data, HWA unpublished data). Approximately 342,393 acres of occupied or potential mountain plover
nesting habitat have been mapped, comprising approximately 32 percent of the project area (Map 3.9-4;
HWA unpublished data). A substantial portion of this nesting habitat would be disturbed with
implementation of the Proposed Action. Impacts of displacement or additional stress from increased
human activities should be minimized by avoiding construction activities in potential plover nesting
habitat during the nesting period from April 10 to July 10, unless surveys show that no birds were found.
Mountain plovers tend to use the same nesting areas from year to year (Dinsmore 2003), but the exact
nest locations change. They often nest near roads and well sites (Manning and White 2001), feed on or
near roads, and use roads as travel corridors (USFWS 1999), all of which make them susceptible to being
struck by vehicles. In occupied habitat, BLM guidelines call for speed and traffic volume controls during
the brood-rearing period. This may modify work schedules and shift changes during the most likely time
for plovers to be on the road (Appendix 16 to the RMP). Following drilling and well-completion
operations, noise levels, vehicle traffic, and human activity would be reduced. As a result, plovers might
acclimate to the well pad production facilities and use habitats immediately adjacent to such sites. With
the COAs and BMPs (Appendix C) and the Wildlife Monitoring and Protection Plan (Appendix I), the
impact of the Proposed Action on mountain plover populations would likely not exceed the impact
significance criteria.
Trumpeter swans and white-faced ibis are uncommon in the project area and are always associated with
wetland habitats. Both species have been observed within the project area during migration on only a few
occasions (WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007). Except for a few areas along Muddy Creek, wetlands are very
limited within the project area. The Proposed Action is not expected to exceed the impact significance
criteria because development would not occur within 500 feet of riparian and wetland habitats.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Sensitive Amphibian Species
Great Basin spadefoot have been documented within the project area (WGFD 2006, WYNDD 2007) and
occur within sagebrush communities. The intensity of development associated with implementation of the
Proposed Action would likely result in direct disturbance to suitable breeding habitat. Development
would not be permitted within 500 feet of riparian and wetland habitats; however, and with this
protection, significant impacts are not expected.
Northern leopard frog sightings have been documented in all counties of Wyoming and this species has
been documented in the project area. Provided that measures are taken to avoid disturbance and
contamination of perennial water sources (Section 4.4), impacts from the Proposed Action are not
expected to exceed the impact significance criteria because development would not occur within 500 feet
of riparian and wetland habitats.
Sensitive Fish Species

Sources of risks to sensitive fish species are (1) increases in suspended sediments and sedimentation, (2)
produced-water discharges, and (3) spills of toxic materials. For any future proposals involving CBNG,
the proposed treatment and disposal of produced water will be analyzed in a separate NEPA document.
Increases in Suspended Sediments and Sedimentation. Research conducted during the summer and fall
of 2003 and 2004 within the upper Muddy Creek watershed, including the project area, found the two
most consistent habitat associations among sub-adult and adult roundtail chubs, bluehead suckers, and
flannelmouth suckers to be positive associations with both rock substrates and deep pools (Figures 4.9-1
and 4.9-2; Bower 2005). Under the Proposed Action, the primary impacts to these two habitat features
are (1) sedimentation from new construction and project-related land disturbance resulting in decreased
availability of rock substrates, and (2) alteration of local hydrologic conditions by new road construction
that could lead to sedimentation and channel adjustments resulting in a loss of deep pool habitats.
Additionally, fragmentation of aquatic habitats, if any project-related road crossings of Muddy Creek are
constructed, could limit access to required habitats or block fish migration.
The impact of new roads and other facilities on fish habitats can be divided into three categories:
construction, presence, and urbanization (Angermeyer et al. 2004). During the construction phase, prior to
interim reclamation, erosion of soils exposed during earth-moving activities accelerates fine-sediment
loading in stream channels. Though the biological effects of sedimentation include a variety of ecological
interactions (Waters 1995), sedimentation can act to shift habitat structure such as channel depth, pool-to­
riffle ratio, percent fines in substrates, and cover availability (Angermeyer et al. 2004). This sediment can
extend miles downstream of the construction site and persist in stream channels for years (Angermeyer et
al. 2004).
During the presence phase, impacts are primarily associated with the interception of shallow groundwater
flow paths by roads. Water is frequently diverted along the roadway and routed to surface-water drainage
networks at drainage crossings. This can, in turn, alter the timing, routing, and magnitude of runoff,
triggering geomorphic adjustments through erosion by channel incision, new gully or channel-head
formation, or slumping and debris flows (Figure 4.9-1; see review in Trombulak and Frissel 2000).
Channel incision occurs when the base elevation of the stream channel adjusts to account for an alteration
of geomorphic parameters such as sediment supply, flow volume, or channel roughness (e.g., riparian
vegetation). Channel incision has been shown to simplify channel geometry and result in the loss of pool
habitat (Shields et al. 1994). Project-related crossings of Muddy Creek would be required to pass fish and
would be mitigated as outlined in the Rawlins RMP. The RMP requires that any road crossing of a stream
that may potentially support fish for a portion of the year must be constructed to allow fish passage.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

In the case of the Proposed Action, the effects
of urbanization are thought to include the
detrimental effects of exotic species
introduction and increased human presence
within the project area. Roads provide
dispersal mechanisms for a variety of exotic
upland and riparian plant species. Of
particular concern is the spread of tamarisk
(Tamarix spp., also known as salt cedar)
within the upper Muddy Creek watershed.
This exotic species has been shown to displace
native riparian vegetation while consuming a
greater volume of water, resulting in reduced
water tables and suitability of aquatic habitats
(Graf 1978). Tamarisk is currently known to
exist in portions of the project area and its
spread is likely a result of dispersal via
Figure 4.9-3. Example of erosion resulting from
concentration of surface runoff at
roadways. Increased human uses of the area
drainage crossings
are also likely to increase the probability of
unsanctioned, illegal, and unintentional
introductions of exotic fishes and other aquatic
organisms. These introductions have been cited as one of the major threats to fresh-water biodiversity
(Allan and Flecker 1993) and warrant careful consideration given the detrimental effects of exotic fishes
on native Colorado River Basin fishes present within the upper Muddy Creek watershed.
Stream fishes require habitats for spawning, feeding, rearing, and refuge. The spatial heterogeneity and
connectivity of the stream system can necessitate the movement of fishes among these habitats in order to
complete their life-cycles (Schlosser 1995). Interruption of movement among required habitats by road
crossings can have demographic effects, decreasing population viability (Trombulak and Frissel 2000,
Gibson et al. 2005). The distributions of the three target species during the summer and fall of 2003
suggest several implications of habitat fragmentation with regard to access to refuge habitats and
subsequent ability to recolonize adjacent reaches (Bower 2005). Additionally, movements of the three
species observed during 2005 suggests that required habitats exist in spatially distinct portions of the
watershed, thus requiring movement of individuals in order to complete their life history requirements
(Compton 2007). Eighty-acre spacing of well locations, typical in the high-development parts of the
project area, could result in a road density of up to 2.5 mi/mi2 within the portion of the project along
Muddy Creek, including new road construction. Additionally, crossings of Muddy Creek may occur as a
result of the Proposed Action, although the number and specific locations of these crossings have not yet
been determined. Eighty-acre spacing would result in significance based on Criterion 2.
Research within the Little Robbers Gulch drainage has demonstrated the effects of roads, natural gas drill
pads, and pipelines on sediment production and runoff (Wollmer 1994). This work examined the effect of
road densities of 2 mi/mi2, including associated well pad and pipeline facilities, on local sediment
production and runoff. A net increase of 1 percent in local sediment production and 0.3 percent in local
runoff was found when compared to unaltered rangeland sites. Although this work helps to identify the
potentially limited extent of local erosion caused by roads, the study did not address the effects of flow
interception which can lead to altered runoff timing, routes, and magnitudes. It is these hydrologic
alterations that are most likely to result in geomorphic adjustments through erosion, causing
sedimentation or loss of habitat features such as deep pools.
Increased sediment delivery to stream-bottoms can embed gravels and reduce spawning success via
decreased embryo survival fill in rearing pools, and reduce complexity of the habitat in stream channels

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

(Magee et al. 1996). Deposition of sediment can also decrease populations and species composition of
aquatic macroinvertebrates that are highly dependent on interstitial spaces for different life stages. These
community changes can be detrimental to fisheries that depend on macroinvertebrates as primary food
supplies and can change the abundance and diversity of the fish population. Loss of these stream
attributes would threaten the persistence of BLM sensitive fish species.
In addition to project activities that cause surface disturbance, a major source of sediment input to streams
in the project area is wind erosion. Much of the area along Muddy Creek within the project area has a
moderate to high wind-erosion potential (Map 3.3-2). A moderate potential for wind erosion exists for 80
percent of the total project area or 859,633 acres (Table 3.3-1).
Discharges of Produced Water. Produced water from the project area would not be discharged to
Muddy Creek within the Little Snake River drainage; therefore, produced-water discharges would not
pose a risk to these species
Spills of Toxic Materials. Accidental releases of toxic materials to Muddy Creek would pose a risk to
sensitive fish populations. The probability of spills occurring is unknown, but their consequences could
be significant if spills occurred. One spill could kill most of the fish in lower Muddy Creek.
Because of the limited distribution in Wyoming and other states of the three sensitive fish species found
in the project area—the roundtail chub, the bluehead sucker, and the flannelmouth sucker—the effects of
the Proposed Action are considered to be significant. The disturbance created by new roads and facilities
would increase suspended sediments and sedimentation, altering habitat features found to be important to
the fishes and fragmenting that habitat. These effects would be exacerbated by any accidental discharge of
produced water or spills of toxic materials into the watershed. The significant impact on the habitat of the
species within the project area may preclude improvement of their status as prescribed in the Range-wide
Conservation Agreement for Bluehead Suckers, Flannelmouth Suckers, and Roundtail Chubs. This would
be contrary to Criterion 4. Eighty-acre spacing of wells would result in significance based on Criterion 2.
Sensitive Plant Species

The presence of sensitive plant species on public lands would be determined by soil surveys or rare-plant
surveys prior to site development. Avoidance and best management practices identified on a case-by-case
basis would then be applied to proposed surface-disturbing activities to protect or enhance sensitive plant
species and their habitats (BLM 2008a, p. 2-47). Therefore, decreased viability or increased mortality of
the Cedar Rim thistle, Gibben’s beardtongue, Meadow milkvetch, and persistent sepal yellowcress—or
adverse alteration of their critical habitats—would not occur on public lands within the CD-C project area
with implementation of the Proposed Action. Meadow milkvetch and persistent sepal yellowcress would
be further protected on public lands because development would not be permitted within 500 feet of
riparian and wetland habitats (BLM 2008a). Cedar Rim thistle and Gibben’s beardtongue could be
impacted if their habitats are disturbed by development activity. BLM-designated sensitive plant species
are likely to occur on private and state lands within the project area; however, surveys to determine their
presence or to locate their habitat would not be required nor would avoidance or other mitigating activity.
The impact on private and state lands is thus not known.
Indirect impacts to special status plants and/or their habitats could occur as a result of several natural gas
development activities. New invasive weed infestations near well pad locations and other surface
disturbances could spread into occupied special status plant species habitat. The effects of fugitive dust
created by new access roads and increased vehicle activity could have a detrimental effect on the vigor
and survival of special status plant species. Unauthorized off-road vehicle use could negatively impact
special status plant species, either by direct destruction or by alteration of their habitats. Indirect impacts
to BLM-designated sensitive plants on public lands are anticipated to be either minimal or none due to the
required 500-foot setback from riparian areas and the use of soil survey information to locate potential

sensitive species habitats. In addition, the RFO staff has information that identifies potential habitats by
soil type and known populations of these species.
4.9.3.2

Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, or Candidate Wildlife Species

Under Alternative A, the types of impacts to special status species and their habitats would be similar to
those described for the Proposed Action. For this alternative, the scope and intensity of the impacts would
be more widespread because of the increased surface disturbance associated with construction of more
well pads, roads, and pipelines required for 100-percent vertical drilling. The total number of well pads
and access roads would be 8,950, compared to the estimated 6,126 well pads estimated for the Proposed
Action. Estimated surface disturbance for this alternative would be 31 percent greater (14,496 acres) than
the Proposed Action. Combined with previous surface disturbance, more than 11 percent of the project
area would be disturbed at one time or another. After successful reclamation, the project-related acreage
that would remain in a non-vegetated state would be 28 percent greater (5,272 acres) than the Proposed
Action. Shrub-dominated habitat would not recover during the life of the project. Habitat loss and
fragmentation would be comparably more extensive than under the Proposed Action. Impacts to species
already likely to exceed significance criteria such as sage-grouse in non-core areas would be increased
and are expected to exceed Criteria 2 and 3. Additionally, in the checkerboard portion of the project area,
the RMP limitations do not apply to private and state lands, so it is possible that impacts to species with
large indirect impact zones, such as nesting/foraging ferruginous hawks, could reduce the effectiveness of
the mitigation on BLM land, possibly leading to exceeding impact significance Criterion 4. Although this
increase of surface disturbance would increase the impact to shrub dependent bird species such as
Brewer’s sparrow, loggerhead shrike, sage sparrow, and sage thrasher, it should not reach the level of
significance under Criterion 4.
The BLM will seek to apply conservation measures for greater sage-grouse in state-designated core
population areas consistent with IM WY-2012-019 (BLM 2012c), pending the amendment of the Rawlins
RMP. In non-core areas, leks would be protected by the application of the 0.25-mile lek NSO as well as
the Rawlins RMP requirement to avoid identified nesting and early brood-rearing habitat, regardless of
distance from a lek, from March 1 to July 15. Timing Limitations would provide additional seasonal
protection to wintering sage-grouse in non-core areas. It is expected that greater than three wells or 60
acres of disturbance per square mile could occur within the 2-mile radius of some non-core leks but not
all; this would be considered an “Extreme Impact” relative to those individual leks (WGFD 2010a).
As discussed in the Proposed Action, ferruginous hawk nests located near private or state surface in the
checkerboard would not benefit from the entire 1-mile seasonal buffer zone. It is difficult to determine if
this would exceed Criterion 4 in this case because other factors such as topography could decrease the
size of the needed buffer around nests, but the impacts are not expected to exceed the criterion.
Other sensitive species including mountain plover and white-tailed prairie dog would be provided
protections for nest and habitat avoidance, as appropriate, on BLM-managed lands but not on private and
state-managed lands. Given the increased acreage anticipated to be disturbed under this Alternative it is
expected that Criterion 4 may be exceeded for these species.
Although the increase of surface disturbance anticipated under this alternative would increase the impact
to shrub-dependent bird species such as Brewer’s sparrow, loggerhead shrike, sage sparrow, and vespers
sparrow, it is not likely to reach the level of significance under Criterion 4.
Threatened and Endangered Fish Species

Impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action.

4-110

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Sensitive Fish Species

The types of impacts to sensitive fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action, but because
of the larger surface area affected, the magnitude of the impacts would be proportionally greater.
Special Status Plants
Although the amount of surface disturbance would be greatly increased under Alternative A, the measures
to avoid and protect special status plants that would be implemented make it unlikely that special status
plants would be more affected by implementation of Alternative A than by the Proposed Action.
4.9.3.3

Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, or Candidate Wildlife Species

The ERP alternative was developedin part to prevent significant impacts to wildlife resources of concern
by implementing additional protections and mitigations, when necessary, beyond those normally applied
(e.g. BMPs, COAs, Wildlife Monitoring and Protection Plan). The ERP alternative also recognizes that
development may be more intensive than currently expected and may result in impacts to wildlife habitats
and populations faster than anticipated. This alternative would combine prescriptive and adaptive
management approaches, which includes assessing the specific issue, designing and implementing a
response, monitoring and evaluating results, and adjusting the management response when needed on a
case-by-case basis. The enhanced resource protections would go into effect immediately and be applied to
all future APDs and other project-related activities. Should surface disturbance or population thresholds
be reached, additional protection measures would also be implemented, specific to each affected species.
See Section 2.23 for a detailed description of this alternative.
The additional restrictions under this alternative are likely to encourage the use of directional drilling and
enhanced reclamation practices. For this reason, the scope and intensity of impacts on special status
species and their habitat would be less. Maximum initial surface disturbance for this alternative is
estimated to decrease by 1,684 acres to 45,516 acres, a 3.6 percent reduction from the Proposed Action.
Long-term disturbance would decrease by 611 acres, to 18,249 acres.
Because more wells would likely be drilled directionally from multi-well pads under this alternative,
fewer well pads overall would be constructed—an estimated 5,798 compared to the estimated 6,126 well
locations of the Proposed Action, a reduction of 5.4 percent. Therefore, fewer access roads would be
developed and habitat fragmentation would be less extensive than for the Proposed Action.
The special status species/habitat that would receive enhanced protections under this alternative include
greater sage-grouse leks, nesting/brood-rearing habitat, and winter concentration areas, and ferruginous
hawk nest habitat. Enhanced protections afforded these species and their habitats would benefit numerous
other species. The following additional mitigation measures, along with many others more specific to
special status species, are included in this alternative:







Minimize human presence at well sites after they have been put into production by installing remote
monitoring devices on project facilities and gating roads;
Utilize noise-reduction techniques;
Timely reclaim well pads, pipelines, and rights-of-way to reduce displacement of wildlife from the
well field;
Provide training programs for field workers to raise awareness of activities that cause stress to
wildlife, times of day when collisions are most likely, and other programs as necessary;
Install devices to preclude raptor-perching near prairie-dog towns and pygmy rabbit burrows; and
Bury new power lines near sage-grouse leks.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

Greater sage-grouse. The enhanced protections for greater sage-grouse would decrease the degree of
impact, especially in non-core areas, as compared to the Proposed Action. These enhanced protections
would be in addition to protections normally applied (e.g. BMPs, COAs, Wildlife Monitoring and
Protection Plan) and protections described in IM WY-2012-019 for sage-grouse core areas. Applications
for Permit to Drill (APDs) within greater sage-grouse lek, nesting/brood-rearing habitat, and winter
concentration areas would be submitted as part of an overall development plan for an entire lease or
several leases. The plan is described previously in the general requirements portion of the alternative.
In addition, the following requirements would be implemented throughout sage-grouse habitat:




Burying new power lines and using low-profile facilities within 1 mile of an occupied lek or in
winter concentration areas;
Use of noise-reduction technology so that noise would not exceed 49 decibels measured at 30 feet
from the source at all drilling, production and compressor sites; and
No more than one oil and gas or mining location per 640 acres and no more than 5 percent habitat
disturbance (related to all programs or applicable sources of disturbance).

Additionally, surface-disturbance and population thresholds have been developed as part of this
alternative to maintain sage-grouse habitat and populations in the face of increasing development
pressure.
Surface-disturbance thresholds would reduce the risk of impacts of habitat removal and modification in
sage-grouse habitats. The surface-disturbance thresholds seek to reduce the amount of habitat disturbed
and to mitigate disturbance with reclamation. If surface disturbance for natural gas roads, pipelines, well
pads or other facilities has exceeded 5 percent or one oil and gas or mining location per 640 acres within
core areas, the BLM would:





Require remote well-monitoring at all well pads;
Evaluate reclamation success in the section and request from the Operator a revised reclamation
plan to address any failed reclamation. The calculated percentage disturbance would be adjusted
downward for successful interim reclamation.
Conduct an assessment of the disturbance and determine if enhancement of sage-grouse habitat is
needed at that time. If so, begin implementation.

If surface disturbance were to reach 10 percent or 2 oil and gas or mining locations per 640 acres of noncore sage-grouse lek, nesting/early brood-rearing habitat, or winter concentration areas in a lease, habitat
improvement projects would be required. Projects could include, but would not be limited to:



Vegetation treatments such as fertilization, seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping for
regeneration, planting shrubs, and establishment of food plots; and
Water developments.

Population-level thresholds are intended to maintain sage-grouse population levels within the project area.
If WGFD were to express formal written concern that the population of sage-grouse is declining at an
accelerated rate, all Operators on public lands within sage-grouse lek, nesting/early brood-rearing habitat
or winter concentration areas would implement a mitigation package identified by BLM that would
include, but would not be limited to:





4-112

Evaluation of reclamation success in the lease or right-of-way and a request to the Operator to
provide a revised reclamation plan to address any failed reclamation.
Vegetation treatments such as fertilization, seeding, prescribed burning, cutting/chopping for
regeneration, planting shrubs, and establishment of food plots (the BLM may also coordinate habitat
improvement projects among multiple Operators); and
Timing and Distance Restrictions (Non-core areas to conform with core areas):



When the threshold is reached, surface-disturbing activity or surface occupancy would be
prohibited or restricted on or within a 0.6 mile of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks. In
addition, disruptive activities within 0.6 mile of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks are
restricted from 6:00 pm to 9:00 am from March 1 – May 15.
Avoid surface-disturbing and disruptive activities in suitable greater sage-grouse nesting and
early brood rearing habitat within 2.5 miles of the perimeter of an occupied lek from March 15
– June 30.
Prohibition of surface-disturbing and disruptive activities within 0.5 mile of non-core sagegrouse winter concentration areas from November 15 – March 14.

Density Restrictions:
o

o

Core area APDs would be limited to the density disturbance calculation tool thresholds (see
density restrictions in IM 2012-019). When thresholds are exceeded, the BLM would work to
colocate or minimize disturbance for valid and existing rights.
When the population threshold is reached in non-core areas, strive to maintain <3 pads per
square mile within 2 miles of the perimeter of occupied sage-grouse leks

If the population status of the species changes in the future, additional data would be collected and
additional protection measures would be developed.
Standard density restrictions in defined core population areas would limit the density of disruptions on the
landscape to 1 well pad per 640 acres or the cumulative area of disturbance to less than 5 percent of the
suitable sagebrush habitat within the same 640 acres (IM WY-2012-019). In non-core areas the Rawlins
RMP provides timing stipulation protection to identified nesting and early brood-rearing habitat
regardless of the distance from a lek. With these protection measures, habitat in sage-grouse lek,
nesting/early brood-rearing habitat, or winter concentration areas should be maintained. The risk of a
significant population decrease resulting from gas development is expected to decrease under this
alternative. Impacts to sage-grouse in both core and non-core areas should not reach the level of
significance under this alternative provided the Core Population Area mitigation measures found in the
IM, the RMP, and the State Executive Order are applied and the 5 percent surface disturbance trigger is
effective at predicting habitat impact issues in advance of Criterion 4 being exceeded.
Ferruginous Hawk Nesting Habitat. Under this alternative, the basic RMP requirements and standard
site-specific requirements would apply. Currently, there are 84 known ferruginous hawk territories within
the project area. No additional protections would apply to ferruginous hawk nesting habitat unless one of
the two following thresholds were reached—a surface disturbance threshold and a population threshold:
In the event that surface disturbance within 1 mile of a ferruginous hawk nest exceeds 10 percent,
Operators in all leases within the 1 mile nest radius of would be required to participate in a
development/mitigation plan before additional APDs would be issued.
If WGFD were to express formal written concern about the ferruginous hawk population, the following
mitigation measures would be implemented immediately:


All existing development features and facilities (pads, pipelines, roads, holding yards, compressor
stations, and other associated infrastructure) within the nesting territories would be inspected to
determine reclamation success. If reclamation has been unsuccessful, measures would be taken to
improve the reclamation of the facilities.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES


Ten man-made19 nests would be built outside of existing monitoring territories on natural substrates,
and farther than 1,200 feet from existing disturbances, prior to January 10th of the year following
receipt of WGFD’s letter of concern.
o
o



The farther the nest is constructed from existing disturbances the better.
These nests would be incorporated into the annual monitoring efforts.
Controlled Surface Use and Timing Limitation stipulations would be applied to any nests that
become occupied by raptors.

Two artificial nesting structures 20 would be placed outside of existing monitoring territories, and
farther than 1,200 feet from existing disturbances, prior to January 10th of the year following receipt
of WGFD’s letter of concern.
o

o
o

Priority for placement of these nests would be determined based on information regarding
extant nests located on man-made infrastructure, or where there is known repeated attempts at
nesting on man-made infrastructure.
These nests would be incorporated into the annual monitoring efforts.
Controlled Surface Use and Timing Limitation stipulations would be applied to any nests that
become occupied by raptors.

If the species population continues to decline, additional data would be collected and additional protection
measures would be developed.
With these protection measures, nesting habitat and fledgling production should be maintained, even in
the checkerboard area. The risk of population decrease resulting from gas development is expected to
decrease from the Proposed Action and would not be expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
Under the Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative, other special status species discussed in the
Proposed Action (e.g. pygmy rabbit, mountain plover, white-tailed prairie dog, swift fox, long-billed
curlew, Great Basin spadefoot, northern leopard frog, etc.) would have no additional specific species
protections beyond those required by the RMP (timing and surface stipulations), BMPs (Appendix C)
and the Wildlife Monitoring and Protection Plan. However, by implementing the ERP alternative, many
of these species would benefit from the additional protections. For example, riparian species and northern
leopard frogs would benefit from the enhanced protections of the Muddy Creek corridor/watershed, Chain
Lakes wetlands, and playas.
Threatened and Endangered Fish Species

Impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action.
Sensitive Fish Species

The Enhanced Resource Alternative Protections for the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek
Corridors/Watersheds described in Section 2.2.3.4 could significantly reduce project impacts to sensitive
fish species. The sources of these reductions would include the following protections:


For protection of amphibians and their habitats, avoidance of surface-disturbing and disruptive
activities within 0.25 mile of Red Wash, springs, wells, and wetlands would be required. The
required avoidance distance would be further increased on perennial streams to 0.5 mile. Exceptions
would only be granted by the BLM based on environmental analysis and site-specific engineering
and mitigation plans. Only actions within areas that could not be avoided and that would provide

Man-made nests are nests that are built in appropriate habitat and are intended to attract ferruginous hawks.

Artificial nesting structures are built to attract hawks that would build their own nest on the structure.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES





protection for the resource identified would be approved. In-channel activities would be restricted to
the low-flow period.
Current monitoring on upper Muddy Creek would be extended to lower Muddy Creek in the CD-C
project area. This requirement would bring lower Muddy Creek into conformance with the
monitoring being done for upper Muddy Creek and other drainages within the Atlantic Rim project
area. If results of the monitoring program showed impacts to sensitive fish habitat, the BLM and an
interagency CD-C consultation group would determine whether habitat-improvement projects
should be implemented. The projects could include, but would not be limited to, increasing the
number of drainage features along roads, increasing in-stream cover for fish, and other measures as
necessary.
A monitoring plan for the Bitter Creek watershed will be designed.

The following requirements related to selenium and salinity for well locations and operations would also
be implemented:



No surface discharge of produced waters within the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds.
Line all reserve pits in the Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek watersheds.

These protections, however, would only apply to BLM land (an estimated 48 percent of the total area). An
unintentional consequence of these protections could be to increase drilling activities on private land and
state land. Such development on private and state land along Muddy Creek could completely negate the
enhanced resource protections on BLM land along Muddy Creek. To preclude this possibility, the
Operators and the state should make a commitment to apply these same enhanced resource protections to
private and state land along Muddy Creek. Without this commitment, it is likely that the impacts to
sensitive fish species for this alternative would be the same as for the Proposed Action alternative.
Sensitive Plant Species

Special-status plants would receive no added protection under Alternative B. The measures aimed at
avoiding and protecting special status plants that would be implemented under the Proposed Action and
all alternatives would ensure that special status plants would not be affected by implementation of
Alternative B any more than they would under the Proposed Action.
4.9.3.4

Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low Density Development Areas

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, or Candidate Wildlife Species

This alternative differentiates between existing high-density development areas—those areas that have
seen the greatest natural-gas development to date—and low-density development areas (Map 2-1),
placing a higher cap on disturbance in areas that have already undergone considerable development.
Within the high-density development areas, a 60-acre cap would be placed on the amount of unreclaimed
surface disturbance allowed at any one time in a section of public land. For the remainder of the project
area—the low-density development areas—the cap would be 30 acres per section. All prior surface
disturbance committed to long-term use for roads or on-pad production facilities and all disturbance that
had not been successfully reclaimed would count against the cap. Acreage that had successfully
undergone interim reclamation would not count against the cap. In general, adverse impacts in both areas
should be reduced compared to the Proposed Action.
Under Alternative C, the types of impacts to special status wildlife species and their habitats would be
similar to those described for the Proposed Action. The cap, however, would place a limit on the amount
of unreclaimed surface disturbance at any one time in a section of public land. This requirement should
encourage the use of directional drilling and enhanced reclamation practices. For this reason, the scope
and intensity of impacts on special status species and their habitat would be less. Maximum surface

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-115

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

disturbance for this alternative is estimated to decrease by 4,245 acres in the short term to 42,955 acres, a
9 percent reduction from the Proposed Action. Long-term disturbance would decrease by 1,543 acres, to
17,318 acres.
Because more wells would be drilled from directional well pads under this alternative, fewer well pads
overall would be developed—an estimated 5,299 compared to the estimated 6,126 well locations of the
Proposed Action, a reduction of 13.5 percent. Therefore, fewer access roads would be developed, fewer
pipelines would be installed, fewer haul-truck miles would be logged, and habitat fragmentation would be
less extensive than for the Proposed Action.
Greater sage-grouse should benefit from fewer wells and disturbance. In the core areas, restrictions found
in IM WY-2012-019 and the Greater Sage-grouse Core Area Protection program (SGEO) (SWED 2011)
would apply in many instances, so impacts may not exceed the impact significance criteria. In non-core
areas, application of RMP and IM timing stipulations in potential nesting and brood-rearing habitat as
well as the BLM standard COAs, BMPs, and mitigation would reduce the potential impact to sage-grouse
although some impact to those populations would still be anticipated over the long term. The protections
found in the SGEO would apply in non-core areas on non-federal lands. Impacts to sage-grouse in both
core and non-core areas should not reach the level of significance under this alternative provided the Core
Population Area mitigation measures found in the IM, RMP, and SGEO are applied. As discussed in the
Proposed Action alternative, ferruginous hawk nests located near private or state surface in the
checkerboard would not benefit from the entire 1-mile seasonal buffer zone. It is difficult to determine if
this would exceed Criterion 4 in this case because other factors such as topography could decrease the
size of the needed buffer around nests. Impacts to white-tailed prairie dog and mountain plover are not
expected to exceed Criterion 4 as the protection measures found in the RMP would be applied.
Threatened and Endangered Fish Species

Impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action.
Sensitive Fish Species

Within the project area, about 59 percent of the Muddy Creek watershed is located in the high-density
area and about 41 percent is in the low-density area (Map 2-1). Because surface disturbance would be
capped at 30 acres per section in the low-density area and at 60 acres per section in the high-density area,
impacts to fish in Muddy Creek as a result of surface disturbance should be less under this alternative
compared with the Proposed Action. Without the added types of protections for Muddy Creek discussed
in Section 4.8.3.3 for Alternative B, however, the impacts to sensitive fish species could be similar to
those for the Proposed Action.
Sensitive Plant Species

The measures aimed at avoiding and protecting special status plants that would be implemented under the
Proposed Action and all alternatives would ensure that special status plants would be as little affected by
implementation of Alternative C as by the Proposed Action. To the extent that surface disturbance
decreases and the number of disturbance sites is reduced, the likelihood of adverse impacts is diminished
further.
4.9.3.5

Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, or Candidate Wildlife Species

Under Alternative D, the types of impacts to special status species and their habitats would be similar to
those described for the Proposed Action. This alternative requires that all future natural gas wells on
federal mineral estate and surface be drilled from multi-well pads. In sections that have already undergone

4-116

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

development, the enlargement of one existing well pad would be permitted as the multi-well pad for all
future drilling in that section. No new roads or pipeline routes would be permitted in these leases. In
sections that have not been developed, one new well pad would be permitted for all future development.
One road and pipeline corridor on the lease would be permitted. The objective of this alternative is to
minimize surface disturbance and to reduce habitat loss and wildlife disturbance. It would also reduce
fragmentation of habitat. Total surface disturbance for this alternative would decrease by 10,751 acres to
36,449, a reduction of about 23 percent from the Proposed Action. Long-term disturbance is estimated to
decrease by 3,908 acres to 14,952 acres, a reduction of about 21 percent.
Most wells would be drilled from directional well pads under this alternative and fewer well pads overall
would be developed—an estimated 4,032 compared to the estimated 6,126 for the Proposed Action, for a
reduction of about 34 percent. Therefore, fewer access roads would be constructed and fewer pipelines
installed, and habitat fragmentation would be less extensive than for the Proposed Action. However, noise
from drilling and completion activities occurring at long-duration multi-well pads could represent a
localized negative impact to a sub-set of sensitive receptors (i.e. nesting raptors, lekking or brooding sagegrouse) due to the increased period of time required for drilling and well completion activity at a single
location. Reduced surface disturbance and habitat fragmentation resulting from multi-well pads comes
with an increase in decibel level and frequency of that noise, as well as the extended period of time over
which large haul-truck activity would occur.
Because this alternative reduces the number of active well locations to be drilled along with associated
roads and pipelines, impacts to most species would be reduced under this alternative compared to the
Proposed Action. Impacts to the habitats of those species that depend on shrubs (sage-grouse and the
shrub-dependent songbirds) would be significantly less than the Proposed Action due to the decrease in
impacted habitat.
In addition to the reduced surface disturbance and fragmentation resulting from Alternative D,
implementation of the BLM IM and State Executive Order sage-grouse protections would reduce impacts
to greater sage-grouse in core areas. Mitigations and restrictions applied for protection of sage-grouse in
non-core areas (BLM 2012c and WSEO 2010) would apply on all remaining sage-grouse habitat in the
project area, regardless of ownership, as appropriate.
As discussed in the Proposed Action, ferruginous hawk nests located near private or state surface in the
checkerboard would not benefit from the entire 1-mile seasonal buffer zone; however, the reduced
number of well locations on BLM-administered lands should further decrease risks to the species. It is not
expected that Criterion 4 would be exceeded as other factors such as topography could decrease the size
of the needed buffer around nests.
Threatened and Endangered Fish Species

Impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action.
Sensitive Fish Species

Total surface disturbance for this alternative would be about 23 percent lower than for the Proposed
Action; therefore, impacts to sensitive fish species should be proportionally less.
Sensitive Plant Species

The measures aimed at avoiding and protecting special status plants that would be implemented under the
Proposed Action and all alternatives would ensure that special status plants would be as little affected by
implementation of Alternative D as by the Proposed Action. To the extent that surface disturbance
decreases and the number of disturbance sites are reduced, the likelihood of adverse impact would be
diminished even further.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

4.9.3.6

Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative it is assumed that no further natural gas development would occur
within the CD-C project area. There would consequently be no new surface disturbance and no new
impacts on special status species or their habitat. These species would continue to be affected by earlier
habitat alterations, by human activity in the vicinity of natural gas production facilities, by traffic in the
project area, and by diminished palatability of browse and forage caused by dust.
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008b) prescribes the following management objectives associated with
wildlife and fisheries resources (including Special Status Species):








Maintain, restore, or enhance wildlife habitat in coordination and consultation with other local,
state, and federal agencies and consistent with other agency plans, policies, and agreements. A full
range of mitigation options will be considered when developing mitigation for project-level
activities for wildlife and Special Status Species habitats.
Maintain, restore, or enhance T&E species habitat, in coordination and consultation with the
USFWS and other local, state, and federal agencies and consistent with other agency plans, policies,
and agreements.
Maintain, restore, or enhance designated BLM State Sensitive Species habitat to prevent listing
under the ESA, in coordination and consultation with other local, state, and federal agencies and
consistent with other agency plans, policies, and agreements.
Maintain, restore, or enhance habitat function in crucial winter range.

The RMP also defines the following impact significance criteria that are used in this document to assess
the impacts associated with the Proposed Action and alternatives (BLM 2008b). Impacts to special status
wildlife and fish species would be considered significant if any of the following were to occur:
1. Substantial loss of the biological integrity and habitat function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems
that would make a species eligible for listing under the ESA.
2. Decreased viability or increased mortality of Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, and/or Candidate
species, or adverse alteration of their critical habitats.
3. Substantial loss of habitat function or disruption of life-history requirements of special status
species that would preclude improvement of their status. Habitat function means the arrangement of
habitat features and the capability of those features to sustain species, populations, and diversity of
wildlife over time (WGFD 2010a).
4. Actions that preclude attainment of conservation goals, as stated in conservation plans and
strategies for special status species. (Not in the RMP but added by RFO staff to this list.)
Impacts to special status plant species would be considered significant if any of the following were to
occur:
1. Any action or event that would remove a community’s unique attributes or ability to support other
resource values within the planning period, or if corrective actions were beyond the scope of the
RMP.
2. The viability of protected plant species is jeopardized, with little likelihood of reestablishment after
disturbance, or actions result in the need to list a species under ESA.
3. Actions that have the potential to remove sensitive plant species or substantially alter the habitat’s
ability to support the species.
4. Actions that preclude attainment of conservation goals, as stated in conservation plans and strategies
for special status species. (Not in the RMP but added by RFO staff to this list.)

4.9.4

Impact Summary

The project, as proposed, would disturb and alter approximately 47,200 acres of wildlife habitat over the
next 15 years, in addition to the 60,176 acres already disturbed by natural-gas and other development.
Reclamation of disturbed areas should recover grass-dominated habitats in one to several years,
depending on precipitation and effectiveness of reclamation efforts. Shrub habitats would not reach predisturbance levels during the life of the project. Therefore, shrub-dependent special status species would
be impacted most by habitat loss.
In addition to the physical removal of habitat, disturbance during construction and production can
displace or preclude wildlife use during all seasons. Timing restrictions for the critical times of year have
been developed for the most sensitive species and are generally implemented during the development
phase, but no restrictions would be in place during the production phase. Other impacts from natural-gas
development include habitat fragmentation, reduced availability and palatability of forage due to dust, and
mortality from collision between vehicles and wildlife. The measures aimed at avoiding and protecting
special status plants that would be implemented under the Proposed Action and all alternatives would
ensure that potential impacts to special status plants would be minimized or eliminated.
Proposed Action. It is expected that for the Proposed Action, Criteria 2 and 3 (Decreased viability or
increased mortality of Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, and/or Candidate species, or adverse
alteration of their critical habitats. and Substantial loss of habitat function or disruption of life-history
requirements of special status species that would preclude improvement of their status.) could be
exceeded for sage-grouse outside the core area. Additionally, ferruginous hawk nests located near private
or state surface in the checkerboard would not benefit from the entire 1-mile seasonal buffer zone but it is
not expected that Criterion 4 would be exceeded as other factors, such as topography, could decrease the
size of the needed buffer around nests. Other special status species should be protected sufficiently by the
COAs, RMP requirements, and BMPs to avoid exceeding the significance level.
The primary source of potential risks to fish species from land disturbance from project activities would
be increases in suspended sediments and sedimentation. The intensity of these impacts may decrease with
the completion of the construction phase and with the onset of reclamation efforts on disturbed areas.
None of the Threatened and Endangered fish species found downstream of the project area within the
Colorado River system are known to occur in the project area; therefore, there would be no direct impacts
to these species. Implementation of all mitigation measures for water and soils would help reduce other
potential impacts. Accidental releases of produced waters or other materials also could occur. However,
these materials would become highly diluted before they would reach any downstream waters where these
species occur; consequently, the potential risks from such occurrences would be negligible.
With the implementation of the Proposed Action, direct loss of habitat for sensitive fish species would
result from sedimentation associated with the construction of well sites and related access roads and
pipelines. Accidental releases of produced waters or other materials could occur. Alteration of sensitive
fish habitat suitability from sedimentation would result in significant impacts to sensitive fishes (Criteria
3 and 4).
Alternative A: 100-percent Vertical Drilling would affect an additional 14,496 acres of wildlife habitat
(a 30.7-percent increase). The impacts described above would be greatly intensified under this alternative
and Criteria 2 and 3 would likely be exceeded for sage-grouse outside the core area. Criterion 4 (Actions
that preclude attainment of conservation goals, as stated in conservation plans and strategies for special
status species.) would not be exceeded for ferruginous hawks.
Impacts to threatened and endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action. Overall,
the types of impacts to sensitive fish species would be similar to those described for the Proposed Action;
however, the level of impacts would be greater due to increased surface disturbance. Accidental releases
of produced waters or other materials also could occur with significant consequences. Alteration of fish

habitat suitability from sedimentation would result in significant impacts to sensitive fish species (Criteria
3 and 4).
Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection was designed to reduce impacts of development on those
species or habitats that are most vulnerable to an infill oil and gas project. There would be a slight
reduction (1,684 acres, about 3.5 percent) in the amount of wildlife habitat disturbed under this alternative
compared to the Proposed Action, but because of the additional mitigation requirements, impacts to sagegrouse outside core areas and ferruginous hawks should be reduced to a level below significance. Other
special status species (white tailed prairie dogs, Wyoming pocket gopher, pygmy rabbits, mountain
plovers and neotropical birds) would also benefit from this alternative. The additional protection of the
Muddy Creek watershed, riparian areas, and playas would also benefit a number of special status species.
Impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action. The
Enhanced Resource Protections for the Muddy Creek Corridor/Watershed described in Section 4.2.3.9
could significantly reduce project impacts to sensitive fish species if they were applied to both BLM and
private land within the project area. Without the application of these protections to private land, however,
the benefits of these enhanced resource protections could be negated by increased drilling activities on
private land. Accidental releases of produced waters or other materials also could occur. Without this
commitment, alteration of fish habitat suitability from sedimentation could result in significant impacts to
sensitive fish species (Criteria 3 and 4). With such a commitment, the project area and other human
activities within the Muddy Creek and Great Basin watersheds should not have significant cumulative
impacts on the status of their populations within Wyoming.
Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low Density Development Areas seeks to
reduce habitat disturbance and reward successful reclamation. It is expected to impact 4,245 fewer acres
than the Proposed Action. It should reduce the impacts to all species below that of the Proposed
Alternative, but impacts would still be expected to exceed the significance level for sage-grouse in noncore areas. While fewer wells should help nesting ferruginous hawks, it is still possible the significance
level would be reached in the checkerboard area.
Impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action.
Because only a small proportion of Muddy Creek is on BLM land in high-density development areas,
impacts to sensitive fish species would be less than under the Proposed Action. Alteration of fish habitat
suitability from sedimentation, however, still would result in significant impacts to sensitive fish species
(Criteria 3 and 4). Accidental releases of produced waters or other materials also could occur with
significant consequences.
Alternative D: Directional Drilling would be expected to reduce surface-disturbance acreage by
approximately 23 percent, when compared to the Proposed Action; anticipated impacts to special status
species in the project area would be below the point of significance. Impacts to threatened and
endangered fish species would be the same as for the Proposed Action. Because the amount of land
disturbed under this alternative would be less than for the Proposed Action, impacts to fish should be
proportionally less. Accidental releases of produced water or other materials also could occur with
significant consequences. Alteration of fish habitat suitability from sedimentation would result in
significant impacts to sensitive fish species (Criteria 3 and 4).
Alternative E: No Action is assumed to result in no new surface disturbance and no new impacts on
special status species or their habitat because no further natural gas development would occur within the
CD-C project area on federal, state, or fee mineral estate.
4.9.5

Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures

Criterion 1—Substantial loss of the biological integrity and habitat function that would make a species
eligible for listing under the ESA— is not expected to be exceeded under the Proposed Action or any of

4-120

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES

the alternatives for any species. Criterion 2— Decreased viability or increased mortality of Threatened,
Endangered, Proposed, and/or Candidate species—would be exceeded for greater sage-grouse in noncore areas under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives except Alternative B. Criterion 2—
Substantial loss of habitat function or disruption of life-history requirements—would be exceeded for
greater sage-grouse in non-core areas under The Proposed Action and all action alternatives except
Alternative B. It would also be exceeded for sensitive fish species. Criterion 4—Actions that preclude
attainment of conservation goals—may be exceeded for ferruginous hawks under Alternative A and
would be exceeded for sensitive fish species under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives. The
measures aimed at avoiding and protecting special status plants under the Proposed Action and all
alternatives would insure that potential impacts to special status plants would not be exceeded under the
Proposed Action or any action alternatives.
The exceedances of Criteria 2 and 3 for greater sage-grouse in non-core areas could be avoided by
application of the protections and mitigations for greater sage-grouse found in Alternative B, including:




Burying new power lines and using low-profile facilities within 1 mile of an occupied lek or in
winter concentration areas;
Use of noise-reduction technology so that noise would not exceed 49 dBa measured at 30 feet from
the source at all drilling, production and compressor sites; and
Enhance timing, distance, and density restrictions within high value habitats.

The exceedances of Criteria 3 and 4 for sensitive fish species under the Proposed Action and all action
alternatives could be avoided by application of the increased set-back distances found in the Muddy
Creek watershed in Alternative B to private and state lands as well as public lands. Those increased
distances are from 500 feet to 0.25 mile of Red Wash, springs, wells, and wetlands and to 0.5 mile from
perennial streams.
Additional mitigation measures whose general application would benefit numerous special status species
include the following:






Minimizing human presence at well sites after they have been put into production by remote
monitoring of project facilities and gating of roads;
Development of travel management plans;
Utilization of noise-reduction techniques;
Training programs for field workers to raise their awareness of activities that cause stress to
wildlife, times of day when collisions are most likely; and
Installation of devices to preclude raptor-perching near prairie-dog towns and pygmy rabbit
burrows.

These additional mitigation measures, along with others more specific to special status species, are
included in Alternative B, Enhanced Resource Protection.

WILD HORSES

4.10.1 Introduction
Surface-disturbing activities associated with the construction of well pads, reserve pits, and roads could
adversely affect wild horses. Land-clearing and grading activities necessary for construction remove
vegetation, resulting in loss of forage, and create disturbance through increased human activity. Assuming
successful reclamation, BLM standards for reclamation of disturbed sites such as linear road and pipeline
rights-of-way and well pad sites would be adequate to mitigate any potential adverse effect on wild horses
because of forage loss.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-121

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILD HORSES

Prevention and containment of invasive plant species establishment and spread would have a positive
impact to wild horses, wildlife, and livestock by reducing competition with native plants, consequently
maximizing forage production.
4.10.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) lists the following management objectives for wild horses:
1. Maintain wild horse populations within the appropriate management levels (AML) of the HMA.
2. Manage wild horses to meet the Wyoming Standards for Healthy Rangelands.
3. Identify existing genotypes and phenotypes through recognized means of genetic evaluation and
maintain genetic integrity.
4. Maintain habitat for existing AMLs.
5. Conduct all activities in compliance with relevant court orders and agreements, including the
Consent Decree (August 2003).
Impacts to the wild horse resource would be considered significant if any of the following were to occur:









Resource management actions resulting in greater than a 10-percent permanent reduction in animal
unit months (AUMs) available for livestock grazing within a given allotment. In the case of the Lost
Creek HMA, this would apply only to the Cyclone Rim allotment as it is the only grazing allotment
within the HMA boundary in the CD-C project area (Map 3.10-1). The Adobe Town HMA
occupies a very small portion of the project area (5,826 acres), primarily located in the Continental,
Red Creek, South Flat Top and Willow Creek allotments.
Available forage, water, or other habitat components are not sufficient to achieve or maintain the
appropriate management level (AML) in a given HMA.
Viability of wild horse populations cannot be maintained.
The wild, free-roaming character of a wild horse herd in an HMA is lost.
Wyoming BLM Standards for Healthy Rangelands are not met.
Vegetation significance criteria are not met (Section 4.6.2).
Non-compliance with any provision of the Free-Roaming Wild Horse and Burro Act of 1971.

4.10.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
The wild horse resource would be directly impacted by the intensity and timing of development within the
affected herd management area (HMA) and indirectly by any quantitative or qualitative changes to the
vegetation resource. The primary impact to wild horses would be initial loss of available forage as a result
of construction and production-related disturbances. Available forage would be reduced during drilling
and field-development and reclaimed as soon as feasible under direction of the current BLM reclamation
guidelines and recommendations (Section 4.6.3.1). A long-term loss of forage would occur under all
alternatives by construction of roads, drill pads, and ancillary facilities that remain in-use during the life
of the project. Wild horse management concerns with development of gas resources on public lands in the
CD-C project area include control of invasive, non-native weed species, reclamation success, rangeland
improvement functionality, and dust from roads. In the past, reclamation efforts within the project area
have been hampered by inadequate reclamation techniques and extended drought conditions.
Indirect impacts of natural gas development on wild horses would include increased vehicle activity that
could increase the potential for horse/vehicle collisions. If the Operators advise project personnel
regarding appropriate speed limits on designated access roads, and these instructions are complied with,
the likelihood of horse/vehicle collisions would be minimized. The level of risk for displacement of wild
horses from the CD-C project area to areas outside HMA boundaries is unknown at the present time.
There is some potential for wild horse conflict with wildlife/livestock.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILD HORSES

4.10.3.1 Proposed Action

Under the Proposed Action (Section 2.2.1), construction of 8,950 new natural gas wells and required
ancillary facilities would be anticipated over the course of the 15 year development phase within the CD­
C project area. It is assumed that 42 percent of the wells (3,765) would be drilled from directional drilling
pads. The Proposed Action is estimated to initially disturb a total of 47,200 surface acres (Table 4.0-1),
which represents about 4.4 percent of the total land surface of the project area. Within this total, the initial
disturbance acres for the Cyclone Rim allotment in the CD-C project area portion of the Lost Creek HMA
is projected to be up to about 2,336 acres. Following successful reclamation, the long-term disturbance
would be about 592 acres, representing a forage loss equivalent to approximately 69 AUMs (based on an
average stocking ratio of 8.6 acres per AUM), less than 0.2 percent of the total forage in the allotment).
The Proposed Action would also have a small effect on the Adobe Town HMA as the initial disturbed
acres for the four allotments within the HMA would total an estimated 385 acres as follows: Continental,
2 acres; Red Creek, 82 acres; South Flat Top, 301 acres; and Willow, 0 acres. Long-term surface
disturbance is estimated at 101 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to 11.7 AUMs, less than
0.1 percent of the total AUMs in the allotments. Because the relative loss of forage is so small, none of
the allotments in either HMA would undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
The level of risk for displacement of wild horses from the CD-C project area to areas outside the HMA
boundaries is unknown at the present time. The opportunity for the public to view wild horses would not
be affected.
4.10.3.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A (Section 2.2.2) is similar to the Proposed Action except this alternative assumes that no
wells would be drilled using directional drilling rigs. Impacts to the vegetation resource resulting from
implementation of Alternative A would be similar to the Proposed Action with the exception that the total
amount of initial disturbed acres would increase from a total of 47,200 acres (Proposed Action) to 61,696
acres (Alternative A). Within this total, the initial disturbance acres for the Cyclone Rim (Lost Creek
HMA) allotment is projected to be about 3,037 acres. Following successful reclamation, the long-term
disturbance would be about 770 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to approximately 90.0
AUMs, less than 0.2 percent of the total forage in the allotment.
Alternative A would have a small effect on the Adobe Town HMA as the initial disturbed acres for the
four allotments within the CD-C portion of the HMA would total an estimated 503 acres as follows:
Continental, 3 acres; Red Creek, 107 acres; South Flat Top, 393 acres; and Willow, 0 acres. Long-term
surface disturbance is estimated at 107 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to 12.4 AUMs,
less than 0.1 percent of the total AUMs in the allotments. Because the relative loss of forage is so small,
none of the allotments in either HMA would undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
4.10.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B was developed to avoid and/or mitigate significant impacts to specified resource values
described in Section 2.2.3 by implementing additional protections and mitigations beyond those normally
applied. The wild horse resource is not identified as one that would receive enhanced protection directly.
However, the wild horse resource may indirectly benefit because livestock forage would be afforded
enhanced protective measures to avoid reaching the significance criteria. These include mitigation of
adverse impacts on water features, thorough power-washing of field vehicles to reduce the spread of
invasive weeds, and control of fugitive dust from roads and production facilities, along with surface
disturbance thresholds which trigger review of reclamation efforts and potentially range improvement
projects.
Impacts to wild horses resulting from implementation of Alternative B (Section 2.2.3) would be slightly
less than the Proposed Action, decreasing from a total initial disturbance of 47,200 acres (Proposed

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-123

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILD HORSES

Action) to 45,516 acres (Alternative B). Within this total, the initial disturbance acres for the Cyclone
Rim (Lost Creek HMA) allotment is projected to be about 2,253 acres. Following successful reclamation
the long-term disturbance would be about 571 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to
approximately 66.0 AUMs, less than 0.2 percent of the total forage in the allotment.
Alternative B would have small effect on the Adobe Town HMA as the initial disturbance for the four
allotments within the CD-C portion of the HMA would total an estimated 371 acres as follows:
Continental, 2 acres; Red Creek, 79 acres; South Flat Top, 290 acres; and Willow, 0 acres. Long-term
surface disturbance is estimated at 107 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to 12.4 AUMs.
Because the relative loss of forage would be so small, none of the allotments in either HMA would
undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
4.10.3.4 Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance, 60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section

Under Alternative C (Section 2.2.4), the types of impacts to the wild horse resource would be similar to
those described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but the scope and intensity of the impacts
would be less because of the surface cap restrictions. Total surface disturbance would be reduced from
47,200 acres (Proposed Action) to 42,955 acres (Alternative C), a 9-percent reduction.
Within this total, the initial disturbance acres for the Cyclone Rim (Lost Creek HMA) allotment is
projected to be about 2,126 acres. Following successful reclamation, the long-term disturbance would be
about 539 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to approximately 63.0 AUMs, less than 0.2
percent of the total forage in the allotment.
Alternative C would have a small effect on the Adobe Town HMA as the initial disturbance for the four
allotments within the CD-C portion of the HMA would total an estimated 351 acres as follows:
Continental, 2 acres; Red Creek, 75 acres; South Flat Top, 274 acres; and Willow, 0 acres. Long-term
surface disturbance is estimated at 92 acres, with an associated forage loss equivalent to 10.7 AUMs.
Because the relative loss of forage would be so small, none of the allotments in either HMA would
undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
4.10.3.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Under Alternative D (Section 2.2.5), the types of impacts to the wild horse resource would be similar to
those described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.6.3.1) but the scope and intensity of the impacts
would be less widespread because of the expected reduction in surface disturbance. Estimated projectwide, initial surface disturbance for this alternative would be approximately 36,449 acres, a decrease of
10,751 acres (23 percent) from the Proposed Action. The initial forage lost under this alternative is
estimated to be 1,131 AUMs less than the Proposed Action. The estimated 14,952 acres of long-term
disturbance is estimated to be 3,908 acres less than the Proposed Action, representing about 411 fewer
AUMs lost than the Proposed Action.
Although it is not known at the present time where future multi-well pads would be located in the
Cyclone Rim allotment in the CD-C project area portion of the Lost Creek HMA, the estimated maximum
initial disturbance within the Cyclone Rim allotment would be approximately 164 acres, which represents
the equivalent of about a 19 AUM loss for the allotment. Following successful reclamation, the long-term
disturbance would be about 80 acres, representing a forage loss equivalent to approximately 9 AUMs
(based on an average stocking ratio of 8.6 acres per AUM).
It may also be assumed that with fewer well pads developed, there would be similar reductions in the
number of access roads and road miles within the allotment which would decrease the potential for wild
horse/vehicle collision hazards, as well as reduced human presence and reduced fugitive dust generation.
Alternative D would have a small effect (if any) on the Adobe Town HMA because of the small amount
of acreage involved (see 4.10.3.1). Because the relative loss of forage is so small, none of the four

4-124

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WILD HORSES

allotments in the Adobe Town HMA or the Lost Creek HMA within the Cyclone Rim allotment would
undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
4.10.3.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative it is assumed that no further natural gas development would occur
within the CD-C project area and there would be no new disturbance except where APDs have been
approved by the BLM for previously authorized activities.
4.10.4 Impacts Summary
Impacts to wild horses associated with the action alternatives would include disturbed land and associated
loss of available forage. Implementation of the Proposed Action would result in an initial loss of forage
equivalent to approximately 69 AUMs within the project-area portion of the Lost Creek HMA, less than
0.2 percent of the total forage in the allotment. The Proposed Action would also have only a small effect
on the Adobe Town HMA as the forage loss would be equivalent to 11.4 AUMs, less than 0.1 percent of
the total AUMs in the allotments. Because the relative loss of forage would be so small, none of the
allotments in either HMA would undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
The alternatives to the Proposed Action would generally affect wild horses to a greater or lesser degree
than the Proposed Action according to the increase or decrease in surface disturbance that would result
from the alternative. However, because the relative loss of forage would be so small in each case, none of
the allotments in either HMA would undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated. The No
Action Alternative would have the least impact upon wild horses because virtually none of the land in
either HMA would be developed.
Incentives for successful reclamation, which are featured components of Alternative C, would be a
positive impact to wild horses because it rewards timely reclamation, which can prevent and contain
invasive species, thus reducing competition with native plants and consequently maximizing forage
production.
Under Alternative D, it may be assumed that with the fewer well pads developed, there would be similar
reductions in the number of access roads and road miles within the affected allotments which would
decrease the potential of wild horse/vehicle collision hazards, as well as reduced human presence and
reduced fugitive-dust generation, all of which would benefit the wild horse resource.
None of the alternatives would affect the opportunity for the public to view wild horses.
The risk of displacement of wild horses from the CD-C project area to areas outside the HMA boundaries
is unknown at the present time.
Wild horse conflict with wildlife and livestock would be minimized provided the current AMLs for both
HMAs are closely monitored and regulated by periodic gather-and-removal cycles.
4.10.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
No measurable unavoidable adverse impacts on the area’s wild horse herds are expected under the
Proposed Action or the other alternatives. However, one additional mitigation measure may further
minimize the likelihood of impact on the herds. The Operators could enhance wild horse welfare by
addressing the importance of the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-195)
at all new-employee orientations. Such orientations would stress the fact that wild horses are federally
protected and it is a violation of the Act to harass, injure, or destroy them, and that violations may result
in citations being issued as appropriate. In addition, a violation of the Act would be considered a
significant project impact by the BLM (Section 4.10.3). Overall avoidance of wild horses is the best
policy to prevent unnecessary displacement and agitation of the horses and potential separation of small
foals from their mares during the foaling season.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VISUAL RESOURCES


4.11

HUMAN ENVIRONMENT
VISUAL RESOURCES

4.11.1 Introduction
As described in Chapter 3, Affected Environment, the BLM manages approximately 60 percent of the
CD-C project area as Visual Resource Management (VRM) Class III and approximately 40 percent as
VRM Class IV. Chapter 3 identified the management objectives for the VRM class designations found in
the project area as the following:
Class III. The objective of Class III is to partially retain the existing character of the landscape. The level
of change to the landscape should be moderate. Management activities may attract the attention of the
casual observer but should not dominate the view of the casual observer. Changes should repeat the basic
elements found in the predominant natural features of the characteristic landscape.
Class IV. The objective of Class IV is to provide for management activities that require major
modifications to the existing character of the landscape. The level of change to the landscape can be high.
The management activities may dominate the view and may be the major focus of viewer attention. Every
attempt should be made to minimize the impact of these activities through careful location, minimal
disturbance, and repetition of the basic visual elements of form, line, color, and texture.
In other words, Class III and IV areas are intended for surface-disturbing activities that respectively cause
moderate and high levels of landscape alteration. This summarizes the management guidance for VRM
that appears in Appendix 25 of the ROD for the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008b).
4.11.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) lists the following management objectives for visual resources:
1. Establish VRM classes for the RMPPA.
2. Maintain the overall integrity of visual resource classes while allowing for development of existing
and future uses.
Impacts to visual resources would be considered significant if the RFO is unable to meet the management
objective for VRM established in the approved RMP, namely to “maintain the overall integrity of visual
resource classes while allowing for development of existing and future uses” (Record of Decision and
Approved Rawlins RMP, p. 2-48). This means that for the BLM to allow oil and gas development and
production facilities within VRM Class III, the landscape change introduced by development must be
moderate or reduced to moderate by mitigation in the form of BMPs as conditions of approval (Rawlins
RMP FEIS, 4-393). Within VRM Class IV, the BLM permits oil and gas development and production
facilities without additional mitigation because VRM Class IV allows for major modification of the
existing landscape. However, the BLM does review individual permit applications in VRM Class IV and
can ask oil and gas operators to voluntarily use the basic visual impact mitigation methods of adjustment
in the siting of facilities, painting of facilities to reduce contrast with the natural landscape, and
minimizing the amount of surface disturbance caused by construction and operations.
The impact analysis is based on interdisciplinary team knowledge of resources and the project area,
review of existing BLM documents, and information provided by other agencies. Map 3.11-1 presents
VRM classes for the project area, and Table 3.11-1 presents acreages for each VRM class. To compare
the alternatives in terms of impact severity, the analysis uses the amount of initial and long-term surface
disturbance presented in Table 2.4-1 as a direct indicator.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VISUAL RESOURCES

4.11.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
4.11.3.1 Proposed Action

Under the Proposed Action, the RFO would be able to meet its management objective for VRM within
the project area. This is based upon the RFO’s experience with development that has occurred in the
project area to date.
The Proposed Action would create initial surface disturbance of 47,200 acres, or 4.4 percent of the project
area. Most of the initial disturbance would be for well pads, structures, and roads. Interim reclamation
would reduce surface disturbance to 18,861 acres, or 1.8 percent of the project area, which would remain
as open disturbance for the life of the project, after which facilities would be removed and final
reclamation would begin.
The RFO approach to mitigating the effects of oil and gas development to visual resources is to first
enforce operator commitments to particular BMPs. Additional BMPs may be added as Conditions of
Approval (COAs) on a site-specific basis in VRM Class III (Section 2.2.1.7 Operator-Committed
Practices). This would mitigate the impact to the landscape and keep landscape modification at a
moderate level.
As noted in Appendix C, BLM may require BMPs as COAs for APDs and other site-specific permits.
Requirements or requests for site-specific mitigation occur during the review and NEPA analysis of
APDs, right-of-way applications, and other individual permit applications.
As described in Section 4.11.2, oil and gas development and production facilities would be compatible
with VRM Class III management objectives when the development, including adequate mitigation, yields
a moderate level of landscape modification. Figure 4.11.1 illustrates the moderate contrast introduced by
development of a single natural gas production site, viewed in the foreground from a public road. The
structures remain below the horizon line and are all painted in one suitable color, and the site and related
roads have been reduced to the minimum adequate and safe size.

Figure 4.11.1. Example of existing site in the project area

In its analysis of the RMPPA, BLM anticipated that meeting VRM objectives would affect the placement
of facilities associated with minerals exploration and development. This would exert a definite influence
on finding acceptable locations where development might occur as well as the size and coloration of
facilities depending on the visual class and location (Minerals, Rawlins RMP FEIS p. 4-87).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-127

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VISUAL RESOURCES

Since the project is an infill development in an existing natural gas field, new road construction would not
be extensive. The primary access to the project area is I-80. Existing arterial roads, including WY 789 and
several Sweetwater and Carbon county roads, provide access within the project area. New road
construction would primarily be short sections of road from the existing road network to the individual
new well sites and support facilities. Some existing access roads may need to be improved to
accommodate increased traffic. At the project scale, incremental road development would be low for a
project of this size, which means a relatively low level of surface disturbance.
At the site-specific level within VRM Class III, individual facilities may modify the visual character of a
view from a given “key observation point” (KOP) such that BMPs other than those explicitly committed
to by the Operator may be needed for adequate mitigation (see Appendix C for the full list of BMPs).
BLM may impose additional BMPs as COAs to site-specific permits. However, some BMPs that involve
facility siting, road alignment, and the scale or configuration of equipment would have to be evaluated in
each case for consistency with prior terms of valid minerals leases.
Despite operator-committed practices, oil and gas development under the Proposed Action would
unavoidably affect the visual resources of the project area by modifying the landscape (Figure 4.11.1).
Development removes existing vegetation, replacing it with bare ground, graveled roads and pads, and
structures related to drilling and production. The “built” forms, lines, colors, and textures contrast with
natural landscape elements, though mitigation can reduce the level of contrast.
In addition, as described in Section 4.11.3, oil and gas development is compatible per se with VRM Class
IV management objectives because a designation of VRM Class IV determines that major modification of
the existing character of the landscape would be permitted. At the level of a large-scale development such
as that proposed for the project area, this is a categorical determination. In effect, the designation of areas
as VRM Class III or VRM Class IV reflects a planning level (RMP) decision to allow oil and gas
development to affect visual resources, subject to more individualized and site-specific conditions of
approval in VRM Class III that can only be determined once site-specific permitting begins.
Operator implementation of BMPs would lower the visual impact of site-specific development even in the
VRM Class IV part of the project area. Committed BMPs include interim reclamation of well locations
and access roads, painting new facilities with a suitable environmental color, and building new roads to a
“no higher than necessary” standard which reduces surface disturbance. Despite the application of
committed BMPs, a high level of change could occur under the Proposed Action in the parts of the project
area that are in VRM Class IV but are still relatively natural. In such areas, oil and gas facilities could
dominate the view of even the casual observer and perhaps discourage or displace activities for which a
setting with natural character is desired.
Section 3.11.3 described how, in parts of the project area where public and private land-ownership is
intermingled in a “checkerboard” pattern, much of the private land may not be subject to BLM
administration. The BLM’s authority over visual resources extends only to where BLM owns the surface
or the oil and gas beneath the surface. In the checkerboard specifically and wherever non-BLM inholdings exist, the BLM would mitigate the visual impact of development on the BLM-administered
surface as best it can and would encourage oil and gas developers to apply comparable mitigation to
adjacent privately owned surface. Development not managed by the BLM that occurs on non-BLM
sections in the checkerboard or other in-holdings may not attain BLM standards and so may indirectly
degrade the appearance of the landscape on the BLM land.
Oil and gas development would be quite apparent from the road network in the project area. The road
network of the project area is extensive, so any development visible from an established road would be in
the foreground to middle ground of the view from (i.e., within 5 miles of) the road (BLM 2011a).
The site-specific analysis called for in permitting APDs and other individual development proposals
contained within the Proposed Action would require the selection of KOPs. A KOP is a proxy for the

location of a casual viewer sensitive to scenic quality. All KOPs in the project area are likely to be on the
state, county, and BLM roads used by hunters, sightseers, and wildlife watchers. Table 4.11-1 lists the
roads in the project area that access Class III areas in the northern and southern part of the project area.
BLM would consider the view of a well site, road, or other facility from identifiable KOPs during the sitespecific analysis of the application for a permit.

Notes:
1. All county roads are in Sweetwater County.
2. All roads would likely access foreground to middle-ground views of facilities within 3 to 5 miles or less of the viewer.

Given successful final reclamation, impacts to visual resources are not irretrievable. However, they are
long term. During the process of final reclamation of the Proposed Action, reclaimed land would
potentially present evidence of disturbance that would have a residual effect on scenic quality until
vegetative treatments mature. The road network would contribute the most to this type of impact; even
reclaimed roads may present obviously intrusive linear features on the project area landscape lasting long
after the life of the project.
4.11.3.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Allowing 100-percent vertical drilling (one well per pad) would increase the visual impacts of
development. In the short term, Alternative A would disturb 61,696 acres, or 5.8 percent of the project
area. This is 31 percent more initial disturbance than would be caused by the Proposed Action. The types
of facilities causing impacts and the qualitative character of impacts would be the same as described for
the Proposed Action.
Interim reclamation would reduce surface disturbance to 24,133 acres, or 2.3 percent of the project area,
which would remain open for the life of the project under Alternative A, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative A would cause about 28 percent more long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action. The likelihood of casual observers encountering visual impacts to
views within the project area would be higher roughly in proportion to the greater amount of disturbance.
The compatibility of Alternative A with BLM’s VRM objectives would be the same as for the Proposed
Action. Adequate visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and COAs would allow oil and gas development
to be compatible with VRM Class III, which allows up to moderate change to existing landscape
character. Oil and gas development is compatible per se with VRM Class IV, which allows for major
modification to existing landscape character.
4.11.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B would slightly decrease the potential for visual impacts of development compared to the
Proposed Action. In the short term, Alternative B would disturb 45,516 acres, or 4.3 percent of the project
area. This is 4 percent less initial disturbance than for the Proposed Action. The kinds of facilities causing
impacts and the qualitative character of impacts would be the same as described for the Proposed Action.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-129

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VISUAL RESOURCES

Interim reclamation would reduce surface disturbance to 18,249 acres, or 1.7 percent of the project area,
that would remain open for the life of the project under Alternative B, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative B would cause about 3.0 percent less long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action. The likelihood of casual observers encountering visual impacts to
views within the project area would be roughly the same for Alternative B as for the Proposed Action.
The compatibility of Alternative B with BLM’s VRM objectives would be the same as for the Proposed
Action. Adequate visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and COAs would allow oil and gas development
to be compatible with VRM Class III, which allows for moderate change to existing landscape character.
Oil and gas development is compatible per se with VRM Class IV, which allows for major modification
to existing landscape character.
Under Alternative B, enhanced protection measures for biological resources would reduce impacts to
visual resources because of their broad aim to reduce surface disturbance. Measures to minimize
biological disturbance of the Chain Lakes Alkaline Wetlands and Other Playas would particularly benefit
scenic quality because these features characterize the natural landscape of the northern part of the project
area (BLM 2011a).
4.11.3.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap, High and Low Density Development Areas

Alternative C would modestly decrease the potential for visual impacts of development, compared to the
Proposed Action. In the short term, Alternative C would disturb 42,955 acres, or 4.0 percent of the project
area. This is 9.0 percent less initial disturbance than for the Proposed Action. The kinds of facilities
causing impacts and the qualitative character of impacts would be the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Interim reclamation under Alternative C would reduce surface disturbance to 17,318 acres, or 1.6 percent
of the project area, which would remain open for the life of the project, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative C would cause about 8.0 percent less long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action. The likelihood of casual observers encountering visual impacts to
views within the project area would be slightly less for Alternative C than for the Proposed Action.
The compatibility of Alternative C with BLM’s VRM objectives would be the same as for the Proposed
Action. Adequate visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and conditions of approval would allow oil and
gas development to be compatible with VRM Class III, which allows up to moderate change to existing
landscape character. Oil and gas development is compatible per se with VRM Class IV, which allows for
major modification to existing landscape character.
The surface-disturbance caps under Alternative C would put an upper limit on the impact to scenic quality
that would occur at points in time during the life of the project.
4.11.3.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Alternative D would decrease the the potential for visual impacts of development, compared to the
Proposed Action. In the short term, Alternative D would disturb 36,449 acres, or 3.4 percent of the project
area. This is 23 percent less initial disturbance than for the Proposed Action. The kinds of facilities
causing impacts and the qualitative character of impacts would be as described for the Proposed Action.
Interim reclamation would reduce surface disturbance to 14,952 acres, or 1.4 percent of the project area,
that would remain open for the life of the project under Alternative D, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative D would cause about 21 percent less long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action.
The compatibility of Alternative D with BLM’s VRM objectives would be the same as for the Proposed
Action. Adequate visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and conditions of approval would allow oil and
gas development to be compatible with VRM Class III, which allows up to moderate change to existing

4-130

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VISUAL RESOURCES

landscape character. Oil and gas development is compatible per se with VRM Class IV, which allows for
major modifications to existing landscape character.
The likelihood of casual observers encountering visual impacts to views within the project area would be
less for Alternative D than for the Proposed Action. In addition, if Alternative D achieves fewer and less
densely distributed well pads and fewer associated roads, pipelines, and other facilities, a casual viewer
observing from points along the interior road network of the project area may encounter oil and gas
related disturbance somewhat less frequently because of the wider distribution of pads and related
development.
This would benefit parts of the CD-C project area, especially those located in VRM Class III. When
combined with less surface disturbance overall, the probability that a more compact pattern of
development would be seen somewhat less often as a visitor moves through the landscape could lead
casual viewers to be more accepting of modification to the existing character of the landscape. Thus,
development under Alternative D could be more consistent with the management objective of landscape
retention in areas now rated VRM Class III.
4.11.3.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under Alternative E, none of the impacts to visual resources described under the Proposed Action or
under Alternative A through Alternative D would occur. The key assumption for the analysis of
Alternative E is that no further oil and gas development would occur in the project area and there would
be no further change to the existing character of the landscape as a result of new oil and gas development.
In addition, as oil and gas facilities gradually become obsolete over time, much of the project area now
affected by oil and gas development would gradually return to a more natural-appearing scenic quality,
assuming the success of past reclamation planning and its implementation in the future.
The likelihood of casual observers encountering visual impacts to views within the project area because
of oil and gas development would, over time, gradually become less than today for Alternative E and
much less in the long term than for the Proposed Action, because it is assumed that Alternative E would
lead to no new oil and gas development and that existing oil and gas facilities would eventually become
obsolete and be reclaimed.
4.11.4 Impact Summary
Compared to the Proposed Action,less degradation of landscape quality would occur under Alternatives
B, C, and D and more would occur under Alternative A. Under Alternative E, no new oil and gas
development would occur, and there would be no further change to the existing character of the landscape
because of new development.
The character of the surface disturbance and the character of the impacts to visual resources would be
similar under all action alternatives because they would consist in all cases of drill sites and equipment,
production pads and facilities, access roads, and utilities. The level of impact to landscape quality would
vary roughly in proportion to the difference among the alternatives in terms of the level of development
and the resulting amount of initial and long-term surface disturbance. Under Alternative E, No Action,
much of the project area now affected by existing oil and gas development would gradually return to a
more natural-appearing scenic quality, assuming reclamation success over time.
4.11.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
The Proposed Action and alternatives would create contrasting lines, forms, colors, and textures in the
landscape through the removal of existing vegetation and the introduction of drilling and production
facilities and access roads. Visual resources would be unavoidably adversely impacted for the life of the
project and beyond until the surface has returned to a condition that is comparable to the surrounding

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-131

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—VISUAL RESOURCES

natural area. The level of contrast would be more evident in areas with little or no current energy
development.
Approximately 60 percent of the project area is managed as VRM Class III, where the level of change
must be moderate or reduced to moderate using mitigation measures, operator-committed measures, and
BMPs applied at the discretion of the RFO as conditions of approval for site-specific APDs. The
remaining 40 percent of the project area is managed as VRM Class IV, where major modifications of the
landscape are allowed. Because both VRM Class III and Class IV allow for modification of the landscape,
no additional visual mitigation measures would be necessary for the CD-C project.
4.11.6 Effect of the VRM Amendment to the Resource Management Plan
As noted in Section 3.11.4, the RFO must use the existing 1990 VRM classifications to manage visual
resources in the CD-C project area. However, the BLM has begun the VRM-RMP amendment process
and intends to finalize the VRM amendment to the RMP by the end of 2013 (Section 3.11.5). A VRM
amendment may lead to changes in the classification of land within the CD-C project area, based on the
findings of the 2011 visual resource inventory (Section 3.11.3).
Changes to the classification of land within the CD-C project area could affect the analysis of impacts to
visual resources in terms of how many acres of land are governed by the management objectives of VRM
Class III or VRM Class IV. In its decision on the CD-C project, the BLM would seek to attain the
management objectives for each VRM class that is in effect.

4.12

RECREATION

4.12.1 Introduction
This section presents impacts to recreation from the Proposed Action and alternatives. Recreational uses
on public lands administered by the BLM within the project area include hunting, off-highway vehicle
(OHV) use, wildlife viewing, and pleasure driving on public roads. The affected environment for
recreation resources is described in Section 3.12, Recreation, with recreation features of the project area
illustrated in Map 3.12.1.
4.12.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) lists the following management objectives for recreation resources:
1. Provide for the health and safety of visitors.
2. Prevent or mitigate resource damage resulting from recreation uses.
3. Coordinate with other programs to minimize conflicts and adverse impacts on recreational
opportunities.
4. In the Western Extensive Recreation Management Area (ERMA), consider the above recreation
objectives during development involving surface-disturbing or disruptive activity. Consider the
Adobe Town Dispersed Recreation Management Area desired future condition during development
involving surface-disturbing or disruptive activity.
5. In the Eastern ERMA (RMP Map 2-17), retain the quality of dispersed recreation opportunities and
settings (with the exception of isolated development areas, such as coal mines or wind generation
facilities) while meeting the above recreation objectives.
6. Provide public education regarding appropriate use of BLM lands.
7. Provide opportunities for public use, interpretation, education, and appreciation of natural and
cultural resources.
Impacts to recreation would be considered significant if any of the following were to occur:

4-132

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RECREATION

1. Management actions result in long-term elimination or reduction of recreation use in any area or
compromise public health and safety.
2. Intensity of development is incompatible with the stated objectives of Special Recreation
Management Areas (SRMAs).
3. Increases in recreational activity create substantial risks to public health and safety or resource
damage.
4.12.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
4.12.3.1 Proposed Action

Under the Proposed Action, the RFO would be able to meet its management objectives for recreation
within the project area. This is because the Operators have incorporated IM WY-2004-194, Integration of
Best Management Practices into Application for Permit to Drill Approvals and Associated Rights-ofWay. The Operators cite this IM as prompting their commitment to considering several BMPs in nearly
all circumstances during development. Several of the cited BMPs would have the effect of lowering
surface disturbance (Section 2.2.1.7 Operator-Committed Practices). Lowering surface disturbance
would lower impacts to big-game wildlife (see Section 4.8 Wildlife), and lower impacts to big game
would in turn indirectly lower impacts to hunting, the main recreation activity that currently exists in the
project area.
Pursuant to a general agreement with the WGFD, the Approved RMP directs the BLM to intensively
manage surface-disturbing and disruptive activities to reduce impacts to wildlife (Rawlins RMP 2-33).
Interactions with the WGFD over management of development’s impacts to wildlife under the Proposed
Action would also indirectly lower impacts to hunting recreation.
In addition, BMPs that lower surface disturbance would reduce impacts to visual resources. Lower
impacts to visual resources would indirectly reduce impacts to recreation settings, which in turn would
indirectly reduce impacts to hunting and to non-consumptive, dispersed recreation in the project area such
as wildlife observation, OHV recreation, and driving for pleasure.
The level of impact to recreation from the Proposed Action would correlate with measures of surface
disturbance. The Proposed Action would create initial surface disturbance of 47,200 acres, or 4.4 percent
of the project area. Most of the initial disturbance would be for well pads, structures, and roads. Interim
reclamation would reduce surface disturbance to 18,861 acres, or 1.8 percent of the project area, which
would remain as open disturbance for the life of the project, after which facilities would be removed and
final reclamation would begin.
Despite Operator-committed practices, oil and gas development under the Proposed Action would
unavoidably affect recreation resources of the project area by modifying supplemental values important
for recreation quality. As part of the natural gas development process, new roads could create access to
areas that previously were not used for recreation. However, the industrial character associated with oil
and gas activity introduces contrasting elements affecting scenic quality, which would displace some
recreationists to other areas. Supplemental values and resources such as scenic quality, solitude, and
wildlife would be degraded and would interfere with recreationists’ goals and experiences. Eventually,
successful final reclamation would rehabilitate the recreation settings to be found in the project area.
However, the time needed to accomplish this would potentially span more than one generation of
recreatoinists.
Overall, the intensity of impacts to recreation under the Proposed Action would vary roughly in
proportion to the change in the density of well development. In addition, impact intensity would vary
within the project area depending on the extent of new well development as compared to the density of
existing development.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-133

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RECREATION

Thus, the intensity of impacts to recreation would be highest in the northern part of the project area,
where natural gas development is less dense to date and where the Chain Lakes WHMA and the large
block of public land northwest of the WHMA are a resource for big game hunting and other wildlifebased recreation. Similarly, impacts to the WGFD Carbon County Walk-In Area #1 would be relatively
high because less development has occurred to date in this part of the project area.
Natural gas development raises health and safety issues for the BLM because of conflict that may arise
between industrial traffic and recreational traffic. The hazard associated with road use would potentially
rise in proportion to the amount of gas development, plus the trend in recreational use.
At Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir in the southern part of the project area, unrestricted surface-disturbing
activity nearby would degrade the setting of the undeveloped recreation site. However, low water levels
in the agricultural reservoir have already degraded the site’s appeal as a fishing hole and group campsite
during hunting season, meaning that further degradation of the setting at the reservoir may have less
importance to recreationists because of the already declining usage for other reasons.
Recreation use displaced from the project area could find substitute opportunities elsewhere within the
RFO or in adjoining BLM field offices. This applies equally to hunting, wildlife viewing, and pleasure
driving. However, these resources would likely be farther away for recreationists who now use the CD-C
project area; additionally, resources elsewhere may themselves be under increasing pressure from fluid
minerals development and development of other resources potentially conflicting with recreation.
4.12.3.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

With 100-percent vertical drilling (one well per pad) there would be no reduction of surface disturbance
as there would be from using directional drilling and pads with multiple wells. Alternative A would
disturb 61,696 acres in the short term, which is 5.8 percent of the project area. This is 31 percent more
initial disturbance than would be caused by the Proposed Action.
Interim reclamation would reduce un-revegetated surface disturbance to 24,133 acres (2.3 percent of the
project area); this would remain open for the life of the project under Alternative A, after which facilities
would be removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative A would cause about 28 percent more
long-term disturbance than the Proposed Action. The types of facilities causing impacts and the
qualitative character of impacts would be the same as described for the Proposed Action.
The relative intensity of impacts to recreation would be highest in the parts of the project area where
previous well density has been no more than one or two wells per section. The likelihood of impacts to
recreation would be higher roughly in proportion to the greater amount of disturbance and rise in well
density.
4.12.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B Enhanced Resource Protection would slightly decrease the potential for impacts to
recreation compared to the Proposed Action. In the short term, Alternative B would disturb 45,516 acres,
or 4.3 percent of the project area. This is 4 percent less initial disturbance than for the Proposed Action.
The types of facilities causing impacts and the qualitative character of impacts would be the same as
described for the Proposed Action.
Interim reclamation under Alternative B would reduce surface disturbance to 18,249 acres (1.7 percent of
the project area); this would remain open for the life of the project, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative B would cause about 3 percent less long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action.
Under Alternative B, impacts would be more apparent in the parts of the project area where previous well
density has been no more than one or two wells per section. The likelihood of impacts to recreation would
be roughly the same for Alternative B as for the Proposed Action. However, specific measures to benefit

4-134

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RECREATION

big game wildlife habitat that are among the enhanced protections included in Alternative B may provide
some additional mitigation of impacts to wildlife and in turn reduce impacts to the hunting-based
recreation that predominates in the project area.
4.12.3.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap, High and Low Density Development Areas

Alternative C would modestly decrease the potential for recreation impacts from development, compared
to the Proposed Action. In the short term, Alternative C would disturb 42,955 acres, or 4 percent of the
project area. This is 9 percent less initial disturbance than for the Proposed Action. The types of facilities
causing impacts and the qualitative character of impacts would be the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Interim reclamation under Alternative C would reduce surface disturbance to 17,318 acres, or 1.6 percent
of the project area, which would remain open for the life of the project, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative C would cause about 8 percent less long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action.
The likelihood of impacts to recreation would be higher roughly in proportion to the greater amount of
disturbance. However, the surface disturbance caps under Alternative C would put an upper limit on the
impact to recreation that would occur at points in time during the life of the project.
4.12.3.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Alternative D would decrease the potential for recreation impacts, compared to the Proposed Action. In
the short term, Alternative D would disturb 36,449 acres, or 3.4 percent of the project area. This is 23
percent less initial disturbance than for the Proposed Action. The kinds of facilities causing impacts and
the qualitative character of impacts would be as described for the Proposed Action.
Interim reclamation would reduce surface disturbance to 14,952 acres, or 1.4 percent of the project area;
this would remain open for the life of the project under Alternative D, after which facilities would be
removed and final reclamation would begin. Alternative D would cause about 21 percent less long-term
disturbance than the Proposed Action.
The likelihood of impacts to recreation within the project area would be somewhat less for Alternative D
than for the Proposed Action. Alternative D further lowers surface disturbance and therefore lowers the
direct loss of habitat, improving the chance of retaining herd sizes in the CD-C project area. A more
compact pattern of development under Alternative D would also benefit big game wildlife management
long term by lowering habitat fragmentation and disturbance from human activity because fewer well pad
access roads would be constructed. The benefit to big game wildlife management under Alternative D
would lower the impact to hunting recreation during the life of the project.
4.12.3.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under Alternative E, none of the impacts to recreation described under the Proposed Action and
Alternatives A through D would occur, so there would be no further change to recreation resources in the
CD-C project area because of new oil and gas development. In addition, as existing oil and gas facilities
gradually become obsolete over time, those parts of the project area now affected by oil and gas
development could gradually return to a reclaimed condition that is intended to attain a more naturalfunctioning character. The effect of reclaiming obsolete oil and gas facilities could be positive for the
recreation resource if the current trend toward habitat loss, degradation of recreation settings, and growth
in human intrusion is stabilized for a number of years or perhaps reversed to some degree.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-135

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RECREATION

4.12.4 Impact Summary
Under the Proposed Action, the RFO would be able to meet its management objective for recreation
within the project area because the project area is within the RFO’s Western ERMA, where restriction or
avoidance of surface-disturbing and disruptive activities to protect recreation is not required by the
Rawlins RMP. Consistent with the RMP’s management prescription for the Western ERMA, the
Operators have incorporated BLM IM 2004-194, Integration of Best Management Practices into
Application for Permit to Drill Approvals and Associated Rights-of-Way. Operator-committed practices
noted in Section 2.2.1.7 Operator-Committed Practices would lower surface disturbance, impacts to
big game, and indirectly the impacts to hunting, the main recreation activity in the project area.
The intensity of impacts to recreation from the Proposed Action and other action alternatives would
correlate to the variation in long-term surface disturbance by alternative:






Proposed Action—18,861 acres (1.8 percent of the project area)
Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling—24,133 acres (2.3 percent of the project area)
Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection—18,249 acres (1.7 percent of the project area)
Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance, 60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section —17,318 acres (1.6
percent of the project area)
Alternative D: Directional Drilling—14,952 acres (1.4 percent of the project area)

Under Alternative E, none of the impacts to recreation described under the Proposed Action and
Alternatives A through D would occur. Thus, there would be no further change to recreation resources in
the CD-C project area because of new oil and gas development. As existing oil and gas facilities gradually
become obsolete over time and are reclaimed, the effect could be positive for the quality of the recreation
resource.
4.12.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
The Proposed Action and alternatives may result in a reduction or long-term elimination of recreation—
most notably hunting—within portions of the project area that are directly affected by short-term or longterm surface disturbance. Impacts to big game as a result of the Proposed Action and alternatives may
also indirectly impact hunting and wildlife viewing. However, because the project area lies entirely within
the RFO’s Western ERMA, the Rawlins RMP does not require restrictions or avoidance of surfacedisturbing or disruptive activities to protect recreation. No additional mitigation would be required
beyond Operator-committed measures and BMPs.

4.13

LANDS WITH WILDERNESS CHARACTERISTICS

No Lands with Wilderness Characteristics (LWCs) are located within the boundaries of the CD-C project
area. Therefore, the Proposed Action and alternatives are in compliance with the RMP, which provides
for oil and gas development on multiple-use lands within the RFO, subject to BLM approval and
permitting.
As directed by BLM Manual Sections 6310 and 6320 (BLM 2012f, 2012g),21 and in compliance with
FLPMA Sections 201 and 202, the RFO will maintain the inventory of LWCs on a continuing basis and

21

Instruction Memorandum (IM) No. 2011-154 , dated July 25, 2011, and transmitted July 26,2011, directs offices to continue to
conduct and maintain inventories regarding the presence or absence of wilderness characteristics, and to consider identified lands
with wilderness characteristics in land use plans and when analyzing projects under NEPA. The IM places BLM Manuals 6301,
6302, and 6303, dated February 25, 2011, into abeyance until further notice. The policy expressed in the IM was developed by the
Division of the National Landscape Conservation System and the Division of Decision Support, Planning and NEPA of the BLM.

rely on its inventory of LWCs in the development and revision of land use plans and when making
subsequent project level-decisions.

4.14

CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

4.14.1 Introduction
Cultural resources on public lands, including archaeological sites and historic properties, are protected by
various laws and regulations, for example the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA),
Governing Regulations, and 36 CFR Part 800. The specific directives can be found in “Archaeology and
Historic Preservation: Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines” (Federal Register 1983).
Laws and regulations concerning cultural resources stipulate that the proposed undertaking take into
consideration the effects of the action to significant cultural resources. This requires that cultural
resources within the proposed area of potential effect (APE) be identified and evaluated. Measures must
be taken to mitigate or minimize any adverse effects to those historic properties included in, or eligible
for, the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Wyoming Cultural Records Office documents
4,860 sites in the project area, as summarized in Section 3.14.3. Appendix J, Cultural Resources
Management, describes how the BLM applies cultural laws and regulations to the inventory,
classification, protection, and mitigation of cultural resources located on public lands.
Many of the historic and prehistoric sites within the project area are located in eolian sand deposits with
increased site density near playa lakes and springs. An extensive sand dune complex is located within the
CD-C project area which has been designated Site 48CR5784. This area differs from other eolian sand
dunes in the project area in that the eolian deposits are relatively stable and continuous for a nine-square­
mile area. Very little development has occurred in this sand dune complex and the integrity of any
cultural deposits has not been assessed. Soils mapping and a site-specific treatment plan were completed
for the EIS.
The BLM has designated a quarter-mile buffer surrounding the contributing segments of the historic trails
and associated sites as highly sensitive. These eligible linear resources include the Overland and
Cherokee Trails, the 1868 Union Pacific Railroad Grade, and the Lincoln Highway. All but the Cherokee
Trail are located in the checkerboard land pattern; however, for the basis of this analysis, the calculations
include both the public and private land. For management purposes, the BLM has established a two-mile
analysis area around the trails for consideration of the elements of setting, defined as those elements of
integrity of location, feeling, and association that contribute to the eligibility of the trails or associated
sites. Although 2 miles is the standard distance for consideration of setting, it does not preclude the
consideration of a larger area, depending on the circumstances.
4.14.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes the following management goals associated with cultural
resources:
1. Develop management plans for special areas or cultural resources (e.g., Aimee Eaton site, Powder
Wash, Robbers Gulch, and Muddy Creek site complex) in areas of high risk for development or at
high risk for adverse effects.
2. Maintain setting for those contributing portions of historic properties where setting is an aspect of
integrity by utilizing viewshed management tools (e.g., sacred sites, Lincoln Highway, Union
Pacific Railroad [UPRR], and associated sites).
3. Monitor the condition of historic properties that are known to be under threat from development or
vandalism.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

4. Identify cultural resources in the RMPPA by defining priority geographic areas for new field
inventory, based on probability for unrecorded significant cultural resources.
5. Develop a public outreach and education program to instill a conservation ethic in the public
regarding cultural resources.
6. Develop and maintain interpretation of cultural resources in areas of high public interest and access.
7. Consult proactively with Native American tribes as appropriate to identify resource types or places
that may be affected by BLM authorizations or actions.
8. Seek opportunities for cooperation with tribal governments for management of cultural resources
and public education.
9. Maintain an inventory and evaluate historic transportation routes for contributing or noncontributing
status (Appendix 5).
The RMP also prescribes the following management goals for Historic Trails (Cherokee, Overland,
Rawlins to Baggs, etc):
1. Develop management plans for historic trails or segments of historic trails in areas of high risk for
development or at high risk for adverse effects.
2. Maintain setting for those contributing portions of historic trails where setting is an important aspect
of integrity by utilizing viewshed management tools.
3. Monitor the condition of contributing portions of historic trails that are known to be under threat
from development.
4. Maintain an inventory and evaluate trail segments and associated sites for contributing or
noncontributing status.
5. Provide educational opportunities and public outreach programs.
6. Develop and maintain interpretation of historic trails in areas of high public interest and access.
7. Manage historic trails and other resources for long-term heritage, recreational, and educational
values.
Impacts would be considered significant if management actions result in adverse effects to properties
listed or determined eligible for listing on the NRHP or considered important to Native American groups
as measured by:





Destruction or alteration of all or part of a property.
Isolation of a cultural resource from, or alteration of, its surrounding environment.
Introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric elements that are out of character with the property
or alter its setting.
Neglect and subsequent deterioration.

The criteria for evaluating cultural resource significance are described in the Code of Federal Regulations
(36 CFR 60.4):
“The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
1. that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history; or
2. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
3. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

4. that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.”
For cultural sites, both prehistoric and historic, significance is primarily judged either by the site’s ability
or potential to yield information important in prehistory or history (Criterion D) or the site’s association
with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history (Criterion A).
Each site’s importance, however, is determined individually, so the existence of sites eligible under
Criteria B or C must not be discounted.
The BLM meets its responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA through implementation of a national
Programmatic Agreement among the BLM, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), the
National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, and a state protocol with the Wyoming State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) rather than by following the procedures set forth in the ACHP’s
regulations (36 CFR Part 800).
The preferred strategy of cultural resource management is avoidance of effect to those elements that
contribute to the eligibility of a historic property. If this strategy cannot be implemented, mitigation of
effects by project redesign, data recovery, project cancellation, or numerous other mitigation options
should be implemented.
4.14.3 Direct and Indirect impacts
4.14.3.1 Proposed Action

Eleven percent of the project area has been subject to Class III cultural resource inventory as a result of
previous development. These inventories indicated a cultural site density of 0.04 sites per acre. Of the
total sites within the project area, 23 percent on average could be expected to be eligible for the NRHP.
These calculations assume that the area-wide site density is equal across the project area and that the 11
percent of the area inventoried is a valid sample. With an estimated surface disturbance of 47,200 acres,
the Proposed Action could affect an estimated 1,888 sites. Of these, 434 could be eligible for nomination
to the NRHP.
Gauging the effect of any impact depends on the level of information available for that particular property
provided by inventory and/or testing data. In compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, a Class III
cultural resource inventory would be conducted for the proposed area of disturbance associated with each
APD or other proposed project activity. The inventory would identify cultural resources either eligible or
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and whether any of the NRHP-eligible sites would be adversely
affected. The values that render a cultural resource eligible for the NRHP would dictate what type and
kind of impacts are of concern. If a cultural resource is not listed on the NRHP or is determined by the
BLM and SHPO as not eligible for listing on the NRHP, it is not a historic property for purposes of the
NHPA and does not need to be considered under Section 106.
For NRHP-eligible sites located in proposed disturbance areas, site avoidance is the preferred method of
mitigation. However, when avoidance is not feasible, if any cultural resources listed on or eligible to the
NRHP would be adversely affected by the Proposed Action, adverse effects would be appropriately
mitigated as directed in Section 106. The Operator, in consultation with the BLM and the SHPO and with
input from other interested parties per 36 CFR Part 800.6 and the Statewide Protocol Section VII, shall
develop a mitigation plan designed to eliminate the adverse effects. These additional mitigation measures
would be developed in accordance with BMPs and COAs outlined in Appendix C. Construction would
not proceed until the terms of the mitigation plan were satisfied. Impacts to historic properties from
projects occurring in the absence of a federal undertaking (federal authorization) would be beyond federal
control. Data recovery (i.e., archaeological excavation), photo-documentation, additional archival
research, or any other form of mitigation would be identified as part of the APD process and implemented
prior to ground-disturbing activities associated with the Proposed Action. Implementation of appropriate
mitigation measures would eliminate or minimize project-related adverse effects, and required additional

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-139

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

mitigation measures would meet or exceed these criteria. Data derived through mitigation could provide
beneficial information on prehistoric and historic use in the CD-C project area, as well as contribute to the
regional database for cultural resources.
Direct impacts would primarily take the form of alteration or disturbance of previously unidentified sites.
Physical disturbance of eligible sites could result from construction activities and associated operations
and could adversely affect undiscovered archaeological sites. Cultural resource inventories may not locate
all significant sites. Buried sites—in particular, burials—may be missed in the course of field
investigations. If construction or other project personnel discover what may be human remains, funerary
objects, or items of cultural patrimony on federal land, construction would cease within the vicinity of the
discovery, and the Authorized Officer (AO) would be notified of the find. The AO would notify the
appropriate County Sheriff and state medical examiner. Any discovered Native American human remains,
funerary objects, or items of cultural patrimony found on federal land would be handled in accordance
with the Native American Graves Repatriation Act. Non-Native American human remains would be
handled in accordance with Wyoming law. Construction would not resume in the area of the discovery
until the AO has issued a notice to proceed.
Iincreased indirect impacts to archaeological sites could result from increased access within the project
area, as well as increases in both surface activities and number of workers during construction associated
with the Proposed Action. Potential indirect effects would include changes in erosion patterns due to
construction, soil compaction, or vegetation removal; fugitive dust; off-road vehicle traffic associated
with construction or maintenance activities; and increased vandalism, including illegal artifact collection,
due to increased access. Where the setting of historic trails and associated sites contributes to NRHP
eligibility, actions resulting in the introduction of visual elements that diminish the integrity of the
property’s significant historic features must be mitigated. Best management practices to reduce visual
impacts such as consolidation of facilities, low-profile tanks, and paint that blends with terrain would be
implemented.
4.14.3.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Impacts to prehistoric and historic properties under Alternative A would be the greatest. With an
estimated surface disturbance of 61,696 acres, an estimated 2,467 sites could be affected, of which 568
could be eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Avoidance of significant cultural properties is the preferred
management strategy. If avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures would be implemented on a caseby-case basis as outlined in Section 4.14.6.
4.14.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Under Alternative B, with an estimated surface disturbance of 45,516 acres, an estimated 1,821 sites
could be affected, of which 418 could be eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Avoidance of significant
cultural properties is the preferred management strategy. If avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures
would be implemented on a case-by-case basis as outlined in Section 4.14.6.
4.14.3.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap with High and Low Density Development
Areas

Under Alternative C, with an estimated surface disturbance of 42,955 acres, an estimated 1,718 sites
could be affected, of which 395 could be eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Avoidance of significant
cultural properties is the preferred management strategy. If avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures
would be implemented on a case-by-case basis as outlined in Section 4.14.6.

4-140

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

4.14.3.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Under Alternative D, with an estimated surface disturbance of 36,449 acres, an estimated 1,458 sites
could be affected, of which 335 could be eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Avoidance of significant
cultural properties is the preferred management strategy. If avoidance is not possible, mitigation measures
would be implemented on a case-by-case basis as outlined in Section 4.14.6.
4.14.3.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under Alternative E, because there would be no new natural gas development and no new surface
disturbance, no sites would be affected and no cultural studies would be required as a result of this
project. Impacts to historic properties from activities occurring in the absence of federal authorization
would be beyond the oversight of the BLM.
4.14.5 Impact Summary
Impacts to cultural resources are assumed to be proportional to the amount of new surface disturbance for
each alternative (i.e., increased disturbance would result in a proportionately increased potential for
adverse impacts to prehistoric and historic resources). Impacts under Alternative A would be the greatest,
with an estimated 2,467 sites that could be affected. Impacts would decrease proportionately for the
Proposed Action (1,888 potentially affected sites), followed by Alternatives B (1,821 potentially affected
sites), C (1,718 potentially affected sites), and D (1,458 potentially affected sites). No impacts would
occur under Alternative E, No Action, because there would be no new natural gas development and no
new surface disturbance. Avoidance and mitigation would remove the potential for significant impacts on
public lands for all alternatives.
4.14.6 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Cultural resource inventories may not locate all significant sites—especially burials or other buried
sites—resulting in unintentional destruction, alteration, or disturbance of artifacts or sites during
construction and associated operations. Cultural resources may also become isolated from their
surroundings if they are not discovered prior to project development, and/or the character or physical
components of their settings may be altered by the introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric
elements. Appendix C describes mitigation measures for the inventory and protection of cultural sites
discovered during project operations. No additional mitigation measures would reduce or eliminate
impacts to undiscovered sites.
Mitigation measures that would affect Historic Properties for which setting is an Aspect of Integrity,
including visual, auditory, and atmospheric impacts, are described in Appendix C. The following
additional mitigation measures would apply to all development activities under all alternatives that would
affect those elements of a setting:








Begin reclamation at the time most optimal to regenerate the native species.
Replace native shrubs to decrease visibility.
Construct roads in minimally visible areas.
Relocate project or hide disturbance.
Use matting on rights-of-way during construction to minimize surface disturbance and visibility.
Allow no surface disturbance within a quarter-mile or the visual horizon, whichever is closer, of
contributing segments of historic trails or trail-associated sites.
Limit trail crossings to existing disturbance corridors or non-contributing segments, unless
otherwise determined by BLM in consultation with the SHPO.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-141

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES

An additional mitigation measure that may serve to minimize visual impacts to the setting of Historic
Properties is the use of low-profile tanks.
Direct impacts to other cultural resources would be further minimized by any mitigation measures that
reduce the amount of surface disturbance using modified construction techniques.

SOCIOECONOMICS

This section provides an assessment of social and economic effects of the Proposed Action and
Alternatives.
4.15.1 Planning Documents and Regulations
4.15.1.1 Rawlins RMP

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) provides the following management goals and objectives for
socioeconomics.
Management Goals

1. Provide opportunities to develop national energy resources on BLM-administered lands within the
RMP project area.
2. Provide opportunities to develop resources other than those related to energy (e.g., grazing,
recreation, wildlife, fisheries, and tourism) on BLM-administered lands within the RMP project
area.
3. Provide opportunities to sustain the cultural, social, and economic viability of local and regional
communities by using decision review processes that include considerations of various potential
impacts of BLM decisions, including: housing, employment, population, fiscal impacts, social
services, cultural character, and municipal utilities.
Management Objectives

1. Work cooperatively with private and community groups and local government to provide for
customary uses consistent with other resource objectives and to sustain or improve local, regional,
and national economies.
2. Maintain and promote the cultural, economic, ecological, and social health within the RMP project
area.
4.15.1.2 County Land Use Plans
Carbon County

The Carbon County Land Use Plan (CCLUP) (Carbon County Board of Commissioners and Carbon
County Planning Commission 2010) was adopted in November of 2010. Although the CCLUP does not
outline goals and objectives for natural resources development, it does specify recommended areas for oil
and gas industry expansion and for an oil and gas industry processing and transportation corridor. The
CD-C project area lies within the CCLUP’s recommended area for oil and gas exploration and
production.
The CCLUP contains the following goals, strategies and actions relative to energy development:
Goal 1. Achieve a sustainable balance between energy development, agriculture, and the environment.

4.15.1.3 Impact Significance Criteria

The following criteria are used to assess the significance of the anticipated socioeconomic impacts of the
Proposed Action and Alternatives and the No Action Alternative:






4-144

An increase in a county’s or community’s resident and temporary populations that would
substantially strain the ability of affected communities to provide housing and public services or
otherwise adapt to growth-related social and economic changes
An aggregate change in public revenue and expenditure flows likely to result in an inability on the
part of affected units of government to maintain public services and facilities at acceptable or pre­
established service levels
Permanent displacement of residents or users of affected areas resulting from project-related
changes in or conflicts with existing uses or ways of life

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS


Disproportionately high and adverse environmental or human health impacts to an identified
minority or low-income population, which appreciably exceed those to the general population in
and around the project area

4.15.2 Direct and Indirect Impacts
Three key considerations shape this assessment:


Ongoing Development in the CD-C project area― Oil and gas drilling, field development, and
production activities have occurred within the project area for over 50 years and the pace of drilling
has accelerated over the last decade. An average of 289 wells per year have been drilled in the
project area over the last five years and at the beginning of 2011 there were an estimated 3,738
producing wells within the project area.
For all action alternatives, this assessment considers the effects of increased drilling, field
development, and production activities. Thus, while the Proposed Action assumes annual drilling of
an average of approximately 600 wells, the socioeconomic assessment considers the incremental
socioeconomic impacts associated with the Proposed Action to be those associated with the drilling
of roughly 300 additional new wells per year, along with subsequent completions and production.
This approach acknowledges that the industrial and community infrastructure associated with the
historic development of approximately 300 wells per year is already in place and local communities
have addressed many of the socioeconomic effects associated with that pace of development. At the
same time, the recent economic recession triggered a slowdown in pace of development that in turn
resulted in an outmigration of non-resident oil and gas workers from the region. Consequently, the
initiation of drilling at levels assumed for all action alternatives would result in a substantial influx
of workers. Conversely, the No Action alternative would result in further outmigration of oil and
gas workers from the region.



Uncertainty—The socioeconomic assessment assumes a sustained, relatively high level of new
well development over time. However, the actual pace of natural gas drilling has been and will
continue to be variable and unpredictable because development decisions are dependent on a variety
of factors including natural gas demand, pricing, regulatory approvals, rig and manpower
availability, transmission pipeline capacity, weather, and the overall investment and development
strategies of individual energy companies. For example, during the assessment period for this EIS,
global energy demand and prices rose to historic levels and then declined precipitously. This decline
was accompanied by a concurrent crisis affecting the availability of development capital, which
hampered expansion and operations for some Operators and service companies. Although less
affected than many other areas of the country, Carbon and Sweetwater counties each experienced
economic slowdowns in the 2008 through 2010 period.
To acknowledge this uncertainty, the assessment provides a discussion of the effects of higher and
lower annual rates of drilling for certain social and economic conditions.



Regional Context—Cumulative effects are analyzed in a separate section of this document, but for
socioeconomics, cumulative influences must be considered in the assessment of impacts for the
Proposed Action and alternatives. The natural gas reserves in the project area are part of a regional
natural gas resource. Consequently, periods of expansion and decline in the project area would
generally occur in the context of regional energy development expansion and decline in southwest
Wyoming and indeed throughout much of the Rocky Mountain west. This means that extended
periods of elevated demand for natural gas and resultant high gas sales prices would generate not
only periods of accelerated activity in the project area but in other natural gas fields in Carbon,
Sweetwater, and adjacent counties. Conversely, extended periods of lower natural gas demand
would result in regional slowdowns in development activity.

4-145

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

4.15.2.1 Impacts Common to the Action Alternatives

Natural gas development can have a variety of effects on social and economic conditions. These effects
can be both beneficial and adverse and can include:











Employment—effects on direct employment in the natural gas industry, induced employment in
businesses that support the natural gas industry, and indirect effects on other sectors of the
economy, including those sectors affected by changes in industry and employee spending and
sectors that could be directly affected by development including outdoor recreation and ranching.
Natural gas development can also affect community and regional economic diversity.
Income—effects on income of direct, indirect, and induced businesses and their employees; on
other sectors of the economy such as tourism, recreation, and ranching; and effects on landowners,
mineral owners, and royalty interests.
Population—effects on resident and temporary populations in nearby communities.
Housing—demand for temporary and long-term housing.
Infrastructure and services—demands on a variety of government and quasi-public and private
facilities and services.
Fiscal conditions—changes in local and state tax and federal mineral royalty revenues and
government expenditures.
Social conditions—effects on community stability and cohesion, quality of life, attitudes, opinions,
lifestyles, and changes in crime and other social indicators.
Environmental Justice—beneficial or disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and
low-income populations.

Each alternative considered in this EIS, including the No Action Alternative, has the potential to affect the
social and economic conditions previously described in Section 3.15. All action alternatives would result
in increased employment and income in certain sectors of the local economy and population growth with
resultant increased demand for housing and community infrastructure and services. After all authorized
wells are drilled, each alternative would result in decreased employment and income for certain sectors of
the economy, and result in further outmigration of employees and households should the cessation of
drilling coincide with a period of economic stability or decline in other regional economic activity. Each
of the alternatives has the potential to affect other sectors of the economy, such as ranching and outdoor
recreation, that are also closely linked to land use and access in the project area. Beneficial and adverse
effects on community infrastructure, local government services, and community social conditions would
also likely occur under all alternatives.
Economic Effects

Each action alternative would generate additional direct employment and income in the natural gas
industry, indirect employment and income in businesses that support the natural gas industry, and induced
effects on other sectors of the economy affected by changes in industry and employee spending. Each
alternative would also affect other economic activities including outdoor recreation and ranching and
could potentially affect regional economic diversity.
Under the No Action Alternative, it is assumed that drilling and field-development employment would
cease, resulting in a substantial decline in direct, indirect, and induced employment in the study area.
Production-related employment would continue but diminish as production from existing wells declines
and the wells eventually become uneconomical and production ceases.
Under all action alternatives, employment and income associated with drilling and field development is
assumed to occur over 15 years and then cease; production-related employment would continue at

4-146

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

substantially higher levels than under the No Action Alternative after Year 6, but again diminish as
production decreases and previously drilled wells cease production.
Induced and indirect employment associated with drilling, field-development, and production activities
would parallel the advances and declines in direct employment for each alternative.
Cyclical Economic Expansion and Contractions

The economic expansion associated with each action alternative would likely be followed by a period of
economic contraction.22 For the No Action Alternative, the contraction phase is assumed to begin upon
the issuance of a ROD for the EIS and economic activity and employment would diminish as production
decreases and eventually ceases. For all action alternatives, the current level of natural gas development
would expand and extend drilling within the project area for approximately 15 years. The contraction
phase would then begin as drilling and field-development employment ceases and production
employment begins to decrease.
The expansion phase would be characterized by substantial increases in direct employment and income in
the natural gas industry and increases in indirect and induced employment and income. For the action
alternatives, the 15-year drilling and field-development phase would be accompanied by increases in both
temporary and long-term population as well as temporary and long-term housing demand, and demand for
community infrastructure and local government services. For the No Action Alternative, these
expansionary effects would not occur. To the contrary, No Action would precipitate further economic
contraction.
Federal, state, and local governments would receive additional tax and royalty revenues from all
alternatives. Such revenues, particularly federal mineral royalties, would be substantially higher under the
action alternatives when contrasted to the revenues associated with the No Action Alternative.
The economic contraction phase would likely result in substantial reductions in employment, outmigration of workers and families, and reductions in demand for housing, community infrastructure, and
local government services. The contraction phase would also be characterized by reductions in annual
federal, state, and local government tax and royalty revenues. The severity of these effects would depend
on other economic activities occurring at the time and the success of interim economic development
initiatives. Under the No Action alternative, the contractions would follow the issuance of the ROD for
this EIS.
The foregoing discussion assumes the pace of development outlined for the Proposed Action and
alternatives. Historically, natural gas development and expansion cycles have been more frequent and
shorter in duration than the 15-year cycle assumed for all action alternatives in this EIS.
Effects on Other Uses in the Project Area (Recreation and Ranching/Grazing)

All alternatives have the potential to displace some other uses and users of the project area, temporarily in
some instances and for longer periods in others. The current level of existing development and ongoing
drilling and field-development activity has already altered the recreational setting in portions of the
project area, displacing some recreation use (primarily hunting). The intensification of development
would result in a more dense level of development in already-developed parts of the project area and
perhaps introduce development in currently undeveloped areas. The effect of doubling the average annual
level of drilling and field-development activity under the action alternatives would increase the potential
for conflict with recreation activities and for displacement of recreation use of the area. Over time, as
development and production activities cease and reclamation occurs, recreation users may return to the

22

This characterization of effects is a function of the assumption of the steady pace of new well development. In fact some variability
would be expected over time. Such variability would likely temper both the expansions and contractions described here.

4-147

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

project area. Shifts in the geographic distribution of hunting and other recreation activity could have
corresponding economic implications as well.
Grazing patterns and practices in the project area have already been affected by natural gas development
activity. The boundaries of some grazing allotments extend beyond the project area, but the portions of
these allotments in some areas adjacent to the project area are also affected by natural gas development.
The high level of development activity, disturbance, infestation of invasive plant species and resultant
reductions in available forage have resulted in reductions in use of certain allotments and require grazing
permittees to more actively monitor and more frequently move livestock, resulting in higher labor and
fuel costs and reductions in livestock weight gain. These effects—together with damage to fences, cattle
guards, and other grazing improvements; increased livestock mortality from vehicle/livestock collisions;
an extended period of drought; volatile livestock sales prices; difficulty obtaining capital; high fuel costs;
and labor shortages—have resulted in higher cost, lower production, and reduced profitability for grazing
permittees and temporarily displaced some permittees from allotments within the project area. Some
grazing permittees interviewed for this assessment tied these effects to actual or anticipated reductions in
herd size, complete sell-off of herds, and serious consideration of relinquishing their BLM grazing leases.
Permanent displacement of grazing permittees along with a substantial reduction in overall levels of
grazing use could trigger the significance threshold established for this assessment.
Under the No Action Alternative, the adverse effects on grazing permittees associated with high levels of
drilling and field-development activity and traffic would diminish as drilling and field-development and
associated traffic ceases, and temporary disturbances are reclaimed. Under all of the action alternatives,
the levels of drilling and field-development and associated traffic could potentially double over recent
levels and the amount of temporary and long-term disturbance would increase substantially, likely
resulting in displacement of grazing operators from portions of allotments that are undergoing intensive
development. Adverse effects on portions of grazing allotments, coupled with the aforementioned other
factors (drought, high labor costs, volatile livestock sales prices, and scarcity of operating capital) could
have detrimental effects on the economic viability of some affected ranches.
Effects on Environmental Amenity Values

As noted in Section 3.15.7.1, environmental amenities including air and water quality, wildlife and
wildlife habitat, scenic vistas, cultural and historical features, and areas that provide opportunities for
solitude are highly valued by many local residents and non-residents alike. These amenities add to the
quality of life for residents, provide value by promoting local tourism and recreation, and are some of the
factors that can attract new residents and businesses to an area. Many people value these amenities for
their very existence and desire their continued availability for future generations.
Much of the project area has already been affected by development, adversely affecting some outdoor
amenities including wildlife and wildlife habitat, scenic vistas, and areas that provide opportunities for
solitude. All alternatives would continue to affect these amenities, although the No Action Alternative
would result in no incremental effect. The action alternatives would intensify development in many
currently developed areas of the project area and perhaps result in development in currently undeveloped
areas.
In addition to the effects of development, disturbance, and activity on environmental amenities, the
proliferation of litter along roads and increases in poaching that have accompanied development activity
adversely affect scenic and wildlife amenities. These effects would continue under all alternatives but
would likely intensify under the action alternatives given the increase in activity and extended duration of
the drilling and field-development phase.

Economic Diversity

Energy development has the potential to enhance economic diversity in rural communities by expanding
commercial and community infrastructure and by providing funding which can be used for economic
development, community revitalization, and tourism promotion efforts. Energy development also has the
potential to limit economic diversity in rural communities by raising housing costs and limiting housing
availability, contributing to workforce shortages, and adversely affecting environmental amenities.
Potential dampening effects of natural gas development in the project area on the growth and maintenance
of economic diversity in certain communities within the study area would diminish sooner under the No
Action Alternative as labor competition and high housing costs decline, the perceived effects on amenity
values diminish as drilling and field-development cease, and long-term reclamation proceeds. Potential
dampening effects on economic diversity would intensify under all action alternatives as the pace and
duration of drilling would increase substantially and housing demand and cost and labor shortages would
likely increase. The potential dampening effects on economic diversity should be viewed in the context of
the cumulative development within the study area as high levels of drilling in the project area would
likely be accompanied by high levels of drilling elsewhere in the study area. Potential economic diversityenhancing effects could ultimately be associated with all action alternatives as well as with cumulative
development. Energy development in the region has expanded the inventory of housing, tourism and
recreation infrastructure (motels and restaurants), other commercial infrastructure, and increased the
resident workforce in communities in the study area, all of which would be resources for economic
development as natural gas development subsides.
4.15.2.2 Proposed Action

Oil and natural gas exploration and production have been important but volatile elements of the Carbon
and Sweetwater County economies for well over 30 years. According to the Wyoming Oil and Gas
Conservation Commission (WOGCC), there were 1,791 producing wells in Carbon County in 2010, with
another 3,234 producing wells in Sweetwater County, although natural gas production in the two counties
declined by 4 percent in 2010.
Up to 8,950 additional wells would be drilled in the project area over the course of 15 years under the
Proposed Action; an average of almost 600 new wells drilled annually. Information provided by the
Operators indicates that a range of 213 to 738 new wells per year (Figure 4.15-1) would be drilled. The
pace and timing of natural gas development are two key variables affecting socioeconomic conditions in
communities near development. The actual pace and timing of development in the project area would be
dependent on a variety of factors including natural gas demand, pricing, regulatory approvals, rig and
manpower availability, weather, and corporate strategies. Given the cyclical nature of natural gas
development and the regional nature of the natural gas development industry discussed in Section
4.15.2.1, the assessment also considers the socioeconomic effects of surges and declines in development
that might result in higher or lower levels of drilling than those contemplated by this assessment.

Implementation of the proposed drilling program would result in consistently increasing production over
the first 13 years of drilling, with projected annual production peaking at more than 670 MMcf and 9.4
million bbls of liquid condensates. Production would then begin an extended period of decline (see

Estimated total production for the Proposed Action over the life of the field is 12.02 trillion cubic feet
(Tcf) of gas and 167.3 million bbls of liquid condensates.
Employment

A key driver of the socioeconomic impacts of the Proposed Action and alternatives is the estimated direct
employment associated with the proposed natural gas development, extending from pre-development
approval and permitting through drilling, completion, production, and reclamation. The direct
development and operations jobs would in turn support additional indirect and induced jobs in the local
economies, all of which would create demands on the local labor force, promote economic migration and
population growth, increase demands on housing and public facilities and services, and affect local social
conditions.
The labor-intensive drilling and completion phase for new wells is of initial concern for assessing shortterm effects on migration, population, housing demand, and public facilities and services. Over time, the
level of Proposed Action-related field operations and production employment would rise due to the need
to service additional wells and haul increased volumes of produced water and condensate.
Project-related direct employment estimates were developed based on information obtained from the
Operators, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Wyoming Department
of Employment, and other sources. Projected direct employment estimates were then used as the primary
input into the REMI23 economic-demographic model, calibrated for a six-county region of southwest
Wyoming, which in turn yields projections of the total employment, income, population, and other
economic and demographic changes over time.
It is important to note that the employment projections described in this section are based on current
natural gas development and production employment experience in the CD-C project area. In recent
years, the Operators have been successful in refining development and production technologies and
processes, which has reduced labor force requirements on a per well basis. It is reasonable to assume that
further technology and process refinements will further reduce workforce requirements, particularly in the
later years of this period used for this assessment.
Estimated Direct Jobs
Information supplied by the Operators indicates that development of a typical well in the project area,
from access road and pad construction through drilling, completion, installation of surface production
facilities and gathering lines and interim reclamation, requires approximately 30 days. Direct onsite
employment at an individual well site varies over time, ranging from a single field biologist doing predevelopment site clearance to 25 or more drilling and well-service employees during actual drilling and
completion operations. Some development activities and events are of relatively short duration (a matter
of hours); others continue for days on a round-the-clock basis. Interim reclamation would also occur at
each site, employing a small number of workers for several days. Additionally, project engineers and
managers, state and federal regulatory and resource management staff, and others occasionally visit an

23

The Economic Profile System – Human Dimensions Tool (EPS-HDT), created by Headwaters Economics, Inc. and supported by
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, is a valuable tool for characterizing and describing historic economic and demographic
trends in a region. It was also used to inform this assessment. EPS–HDT does not offer a forecasting or projection capability to
assess changes in employment and income stemming from new economic stimulus. Many assessments rely on economic inputoutput (I-O) models to estimate the indirect and induced effects of natural resource development initiatives. The use of such I-O
models has received criticism. Such criticism is one factor that led to the use of the REMI model in this assessment.
REMI is a dynamic, econometric economic and demographic model developed by Regional Economic Models, Inc. that has
gained broad professional recognition and acceptance. Versions of the core model are calibrated for specific geographic regions.
The specific application of the REMI to this project was completed by Sammons/Dutton LLC (SDLLC) and Blankenship
Consulting, LLC (BCLLC). The REMI model is used because its capabilities address many of the more common criticisms
associated with the use of economic input-output (I-O) models, including the static nature of the economic relationships and lack
of a demographic component.

individual well site, but are not included in the Operator’s summary of onsite employees. Allowances for
these workers were captured in adjustments for off-site direct employees and estimated induced
employment.
The Operators provided information regarding the timing/phasing of development activities, duration of
activities, and approximate numbers of employees, including both company and contractor employees, for
a typical well in the project area. Separate development profiles were provided for single-bore vertical
wells and for multiple-bore directional wells from a single location. These profiles are the basis for
estimating direct onsite employment during field development, based on the concept of work teams or
crews, with a work team or crew responsible for each of the major development activities. Individual
members of a crew may work together or independently, may be company employees or contractors, and
may complete some of their work off-site. Given the varying durations of the key activities, it is estimated
that completion of an average of almost 600 new wells per year under the Proposed Action could involve
as many as 100 separate work crews within the field on any given day, of which approximately 25 would
be drilling crews directly associated with operating rigs. Table 4.15-1 summarizes the estimated numbers
of crews and average crew size associated with the Proposed Action.

Factors including the numerous tasks involved in drilling, completing, and bringing a well into
production; the specialized nature of crews involved in completing those tasks; the different number of
individuals associated with the various crews and varying durations for distinct tasks; and the fact that the
work schedules of different crews vary (some 5-day/40-hour weeks, some round-the-clock for extended
periods of time) results in fluctuating levels of onsite employment within the project area over time. Over
a typical eight-week period, onsite employment within the project area would range from just over 500
jobs to more than 970 jobs, with an average of approximately 765 jobs.
The round-the-clock drilling and sequential nature of some activities results in a considerable level of
activity on weekends and requires additional employees to sustain work crews during scheduled times off,
24

The Operators have estimated that between 20 and 40 rigs could be on location within the project area at any one time. Some
rigs contracted to major Operators would be working on a continuous year-round basis, while others contracted to small
independent Operators would drill one or two wells in any one year. An average of 25 rigs was used for this assessment.

illness, injury, or labor market inefficiencies. A 15-percent allowance above the average onsite
employment is used for this analysis, raising the total direct onsite jobs supported by the Proposed Action
to 881 employees. The breakdown of those jobs by major activity is presented in Table 4.15-2 below.

The direct workforce estimates for the development phase include one further adjustment; that being an
allowance for administrative, management, maintenance, clerical, and other support employees working
locally for the company and contractors to support the workers actually working onsite. An example of
such direct-support jobs would be the mechanics based in Rock Springs who maintain and service the
drilling rigs and gas-field service trucks. This analysis includes a 20-percent allowance for such jobs,
based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and economic censuses of industry. The
adjustments for administrative and support personnel raise the total direct employment associated with the
Proposed Action to 1,057 (Table 4.15-2).
Direct onsite employment was also estimated in conjunction with ongoing production and field
operations. The primary activities associated with operations would be the ongoing monitoring,
maintenance, and servicing of the wells, occasional well workovers, and the hauling of produced water
and condensate.25 The numbers of jobs in all three categories would climb over time as the cumulative
number of producing wells increases. The annual numbers of well service employees are estimated from
information provided by the Operators and the numbers of transportation workers are a function of the
estimated water and oil condensate production. Estimates of the number of production and transportation
workers account for the diminishing levels of production from the existing wells over time. As with the
development employment, the estimates of operations employment include allowances to account for 7­
day-per-week staffing and for management and support employees. Estimated direct employment for
operations derived using these assumptions climbs steadily over time, eventually peaking at 2,494
employees in Year 13 of the project (see Figure 4.15-3). The peak coincides with a year of high new
development (671 new wells) combined with high levels of water and condensate production.

25

Some producers may develop piping systems to handle produced water. Such systems would reduce the number of employees
required. However, the extent of such systems is currently unknown. Consequently, the current analysis assumes an all truck haul
cenario in order to portray a “worst case” scenario with respect to both transportation and socioeconomics.

The current assessment addresses the incremental increase in employment due to the Proposed Action.
Such increases would be above and beyond the employment already working in the project area due to the
ongoing drilling and production activity by the CD-C Operators, which is estimated at about 522 at
present. The resulting incremental direct employment estimates, shown in Table 4.15-3 and Figure 4.154, would increase to a peak of 1,600 total direct jobs in Year 13. Direct employment would decline
sharply following the completion of new well development, shedding nearly 1,200 total direct jobs by

Figure 4.15-4. Incremental direct employment, Proposed Action

Estimated total direct employment over time, by major industrial sector, is the primary input driving the
economic and demographic forecasts associated with the Proposed Action. Features in the REMI model
were used to increase the likelihood that much of the growth in labor demand from the Proposed Action
would be satisfied by non-residents who would work in the region on a temporary basis while
maintaining their permanent residence elsewhere, and also that migrating workers would be more
predominantly male than the general population. Both of these characteristics have been observed in the
local labor force in conjunction with recent and ongoing energy resource development in southwest
Wyoming.
In addition to the employment associated with drilling, field development, and production, Proposed
Action-related employment would occur in conjunction with the construction of ancillary facilities
including up to ten field compression facilities, a central pipeline compression facility, one or two central
processing/stabilization plants, and up to 45 miles of high-pressure pipeline. The timing, location, and
ultimate configuration of these facilities are not currently known, but their development would result in
additional short-term construction and secondary employment during the period in which they were
constructed. Most of these facilities would be constructed over a matter of months using a mix of local
and non-local construction workers. The central processing/ stabilization plants could require a year or
more to construct, with a workforce ranging to several hundred workers at peak.
Effects on Total Employment
Economic activity associated with the Proposed Action would result in additional economic growth in the
two-county region. The incremental employment growth would increase over time as production
increases the demands for operations and water and condensate transportation.
Projected employment gains of 890 jobs in the region would result from the Proposed Action in the first
full year of expanded drilling. The total includes an estimated 428 direct jobs and 432 additional indirect
and induced jobs supported by the increased economic stimulus associated with new well development,
purchases by the Operators, suppliers and vendors, the consumer purchases of employees, and increased
expenditures by local public entities. The net employment increment associated with the increased
development activity in Sweetwater and Carbon counties would climb to 3,951 jobs in Year 13 (Figure
4.15-5). That total includes the 1,865 direct jobs and 2,086 indirect and induced jobs supported by the
Proposed Action. Over the 15-year period of project development, each direct job is estimated to support
approximately 1.14 additional induced and indirect jobs.

All sectors of the local economies would be expected to see job gains as a result of the Proposed Action.
Beyond the direct impacts in mining (including the oil and gas industry) and transportation, the largest
gains in private sector jobs would occur in retail and wholesale trade, construction, and accommodations
and food service. Local government employment, including public education, would also increase given
implementation of the Proposed Action. The distribution of the net job gains in the peak year, by selected

The majority of the new jobs, including not only direct jobs but also indirect and induced jobs, would be
based in Sweetwater County, although substantial job gains are projected to occur in Carbon County. Net
gains in Sweetwater County are projected to be nearly 600 jobs in the first year of development,
increasing to more than 2,800 jobs at the peak. The corresponding range of job gains in Carbon County is
from 197 jobs in Year 1 to 966 jobs at the peak (Figure 4.15-6). New well development under the
Proposed Action is also projected to result in up to 170 incremental indirect and induced jobs elsewhere

Figure 4.15-6. Total employment effects in Sweetwater and Carbon Counties from the
Proposed Action

Completion of field-development operations would trigger substantial reductions in employment. Net
reductions of more than 4,300 jobs (approximately 3,100 in Sweetwater County) are projected in the two
counties within two years of field development completion. Further declines would be expected over the
following three years such that the net change in total employment, as compared to the outset of the
project, would become negative even though more than 475 direct employees would be involved in
continuing production and transportation. This seeming paradoxical result would occur because of the
loss of drilling and development jobs previously associated with ongoing development activity in the CD­
C project area that would be sustained by the approval of the Proposed Action.
At the peak, the Proposed Action would increase the combined total local employment in Sweetwater and
Carbon counties by about 9 percent as compared to total current (2009) employment. The net increase in
local employment attributable to the Proposed Action would also be comparable to the increase in
combined employment anticipated from all other economic activity in Sweetwater and Carbon counties.
Year-to-year variability in the pace of drilling would likely result in some corresponding fluctuations in
the number of drilling and field-development jobs; higher rates translating into more employees and lower
rates of drilling requiring fewer employees. Levels of off-site direct employment would likely be slightly
less sensitive to fluctuations in drilling employment, but sustained differences in the annual number of
wells drilled would eventually be accompanied by commensurate changes in off-site employment.
Differences in the annual rate of drilling and development would translate into slight differences in the
number of incremental operations and production employees hired, but such employment tends to be
more responsive to the long-term levels of production than to current drilling rates.
Other Economic Effects
At the time of the original assessment (2007), labor-market conditions in the project area were tight due to
past and ongoing energy and mineral resource development. Unemployment rates were low, labor-force
participation among residents was high, and temporary, non-resident workers filled many jobs. Estimates
generated by the REMI model suggested that as many as one in five jobs added prior to the recession had

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-157

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

been filled by temporary or commuting non-resident workers. As the economic recession persisted,
triggering layoffs, labor-market conditions eased, increasing worker availability and out-migration of
some non-resident workers. The higher rate of development associated with the Proposed Action would
likely result in a return to pre-recession conditions, including lower unemployment as available local
labor is absorbed and an influx of workers, many of whom would be single-status. Labor-market
conditions would again change once project development is completed and labor demand weakened
relative to available supply. Local unemployment would increase, labor-force participation would decline,
and labor-force out-migration would likely occur.
Per-Capita Personal Income

Total and average per-capita personal income would increase under the Proposed Action. Total personal
income would rise due to increases in the number of jobs, particularly in the relatively higher-paying
energy-sector jobs. More energy-sector related jobs would contribute to rising per-capita incomes, which
would also receive a boost from the upward pressure on all wages and salaries from the tight labor
markets. Some of the gains in personal income would likely be offset by higher consumer prices. The
positive project-related effects on income would moderate and eventually diminish, particularly following
the completion of the well-development phase.
Population Growth

Implementation of the Proposed Action would provide a long-term economic stimulus to the local
economies of Sweetwater and Carbon counties. Local labor availability to fill the jobs supported by the
economic expansion is limited due to recent and ongoing economic expansions in the region. Past
expansion also triggered substantial labor immigration to the area. Future expansion with the Proposed
Action would trigger additional migration and population growth for the region.
Under the Proposed Action, substantial net labor migration would occur during the first several years of
implementation, peaking at over 600 in Year 2. Projected annual net migration attributable to the
Proposed Action would fluctuate in response to the variation in the pace of drilling, averaging about 275
people per year through the completion of development. Substantial net out-migration of more than 800
residents per year would occur for several years after the cessation of drilling (Figure 4.15-7). The rate of
net out-migration would be less pronounced than the initial immigration due to the continuing operations
and transportation employment associated with the Proposed Action.

Driven by migration, population growth due to the Proposed Action is projected to increase over time to
almost 4,936 residents in Year 14. Approximately 3,100 additional residents are projected to reside in
Sweetwater County, with 1,050 additional residents in Carbon County (Table 4.15-5 and Figure 4.15-8).
The majority of the project-related incremental population in Sweetwater County would be expected to
reside in Rock Springs and Wamsutter. In Carbon County, most of the incremental population would be
anticipated to live in Rawlins and Baggs/LSRV. The net increase in population is comparable to the net
increase in employment, reflecting a combination of a high level of single-status workers, two-worker
households, and workers holding multiple jobs among the immigrating households, and an increasing
number of temporary non-resident and commuting workers.

Figure 4.15-8. Forecast population increments due to the Proposed Action

The effects of the Proposed Action would contribute to growth during the development period, with
population peaking in about Year 14 or 15 and then declining in the wake of the economic contractions
associated with the completion of drilling. At the peak, the incremental population impacts associated
with the Proposed Action would represent about 8 percent of the combined 2010 resident populations of
Sweetwater and Carbon counties.
The estimated population impacts presented above may overstate the actual change in resident population
by the extent to which jobs are filled by unaccompanied temporary non-resident and commuting workers.
While these workers would place demands on local facilities and services, increase market demand for
private-sector businesses, and generate public-sector revenues, they have fewer indirect demands on
facilities, services, and conventional housing than do migrating households.
Results of the model indicate that the number of non-resident workers would increase over time to meet
the labor demands associated with production and transportation operations. Following the completion of
new well development, the number of non-resident workers would decline substantially.
Short-term surges in temporary population would accompany the construction of the ancillary facilities
described in the preceding employment section. The operations workforce associated with these facilities
would be relatively small and result in small long-term changes in population within the study area.
Population Distribution in Sweetwater and Carbon Counties
The incremental population growth and additional non-local workers residing in the region would create
demands on housing, private-sector businesses, and public facilities and services, with the incidence of
demands on various providers being determined largely on the residency patterns of the new residents and
workers. In turn, three important factors affect residency patterns: housing availability, the base of
operations/location of the jobs, and proximity to community facilities and services. Among those factors,
job location and housing availability, including temporary living facilities, tend to be more influential for
the temporary workers. Housing availability and proximity to community facilities and services are
typically more influential for those production and transportation workers who establish long-term
residence in the area, and even moreso for those filling the indirect and induced jobs supported by the
Proposed Action.
Residency assumptions for the temporary and permanent populations were established considering the
size of communities, their distances from the project area, informed judgment regarding housing

availability (including the potential development of construction-worker housing in the area) and historic
residency patterns of natural gas workers. Applying the assumed residency patterns to the incremental
project-related population shows an increasing population over time, peaking at more than 2,100 residents
and 128 temporary workers in Rock Springs in Year 15, with a corresponding peak in excess of 758
residents and 52 temporary workers in Rawlins in that year (Table 4.15-6). The peak influx of temporary
workers actually happens several years earlier. It is important to note that these estimates are in addition
to the population associated with ongoing development and production operations in the project area.

The most notable effect on local population would be expected to occur in Wamsutter. The town is
located at the I-80 interchange that serves as the major access point into the project area. BP has
established a field operations center in Wamsutter and a number of oil and gas service firms have
established offices and yards in the town. Furthermore, some new permanent housing has been developed
in Wamsutter, and temporary living facilities have been located in Wamsutter during past periods of high

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

drilling activity. An initial impact of 125 residents and non-local workers is projected in Year 1,
increasing to over 400 within the next two years. Provided adequate housing is available, the net
population growth increment is projected to increase to over 600 residents and temporary workers in Year
10.
In summary, implementation of the Proposed Action would result in substantial incremental employment
and population growth in Sweetwater and Carbon counties, with the net increments increasing over time
until peaking in Year 14 of the project. Thereafter the impacts would diminish although ongoing
production would sustain ongoing operations and transportation employment for more than 40 years. The
peak employment impacts are estimated at 3,951 jobs, including 1,863 direct jobs and 2,088 indirect and
induced jobs. A peak population impact of nearly 3,700 permanent residents is projected. At the peak, the
incremental population attributable to the Proposed Action would represent about 8 percent of the total
population of the respective counties. Following the completion of new well development, the
incremental employment and population impacts would decline to levels sustained by the ongoing
production and transportation. At that time, substantial out-migration of Proposed Action-related
population would be anticipated to occur, in the absence of other major economic activities.
Fluctuations in annual drilling rates would result in substantial increases or decreases in temporary
workers. Corresponding effects on indirect and induced workers would be less pronounced, but would
have relatively larger effects on community population, as most of these workers are assumed to be
community residents.
Housing

Direct, indirect, and induced workers associated with the Proposed Action would require both temporary
and longer-term housing resources. A portion of the drilling and field-development workforce, including
ancillary facility construction workers whose work assignments would be temporary, would be likely to
seek temporary housing resources while working in the project area. Such resources include dormitory
units in mobile home and RV parks in Wamsutter, as well as motels, mobile home parks and RV Parks in
Rawlins, Rock Springs, Wamsutter, and Baggs. Other resources have included a 250-bed complex in
Wamsutter, now closed and relocated, and two smaller temporary-living facilities located on WY 789
near Dad.
Most production workers and a portion of drilling, completion, and gas-field service workers and indirect
and induced employees would likely seek long-term housing resources in communities near the project
area. For this assessment, long-term housing includes conventional single-family and multi-family
housing and mobile homes, both on lots and in mobile home parks.
Table 4.15-7 displays estimated Proposed Action-related demand for temporary and longer-term housing
in communities near the study area for five periods: the first year of development and Years 5, 10, 15
(following completion of drilling), and 20. Demand estimates for long-term housing are expressed in
terms of units; demand for temporary housing is expressed in terms of beds. Temporary demand could be
accommodated by motels and RV pads, which typically accommodate more than one bed per unit or by
worker camps/temporary living facilities, which can house one or multiple beds per unit.
In all communities, demand for both long-term and temporary housing increases sharply over the first 10
years of activity of the Proposed Action. Demand for temporary housing eases while demand for longterm housing continues to increase for several more years, after which demand for housing is projected to
decline dramatically.26

Note that vendors and certain types of contractors will require short-term temporary housing, primarily motels throughout the
production phase of the project. These short-term requirements have not been estimated.

Several communities, including Rawlins, Rock Springs, and Wamsutter, have developed housing and/or
infrastructure improvement plans that, if realized, would accommodate the long-term housing demand
associated with the Proposed Action and other energy development. At present no communities have the
existing available housing to accommodate the anticipated long-term demand.
During late 2008 and early 2009 there was an increase in available long-term housing units throughout the
study area as a result of the national economic slowdown and in Carbon County, due to substantial
completion of Sinclair Refinery expansion construction. Still, most of the long-term housing required to
fill the Proposed Action-related housing demand would need to be added through new construction, given
that the Proposed Action would likely occur in the context of substantial regional natural gas
development.
Although there are adequate regional temporary housing resources to accommodate temporary housing
demand associated with the Proposed Action, there would be localized shortages of temporary housing,
particularly in Wamsutter. The closure of the BP Wamsutter base camp, which had 250 beds and was
permitted for an additional 250 beds, has substantially reduced the availability of temporary housing
resources within that community. If the pace of development within the project area accelerates, as

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-163

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

contemplated by the Proposed Action, additional worker housing would be required in Wamsutter. There
could also be substantial competition for temporary housing from demand associated with the regional
natural gas development projects and other planned and proposed energy development described in Table
5.0-1. Development and expansion of temporary living facilities and potential expansions of motels,
mobile homes and RV parks throughout the study area would be required to accommodate Proposed
Action-related temporary housing demand if the Proposed Action occurred concurrently with other
development.
Project-related demand for housing would also be subject to variability in response to the anticipated
year-to-year variances in the pace of development. Variations in drilling levels would primarily affect the
number of temporary workers, which would correspondingly result in higher or lower demand for and
occupancy of temporary housing resources.
The substantial decrease in demand for long-term housing resources in communities following the 15­
year drilling and field-development phase of the Proposed Action could result in substantial shocks to
community housing markets, including vacancies and a decrease in housing value, depending on other
economic activities occurring in the area at that time.
Community Infrastructure and Services

The Proposed Action would affect community infrastructure and services in several ways. The increases
in industrial activity within the project area and increases in traffic to and within the project area would
result in demand for additional law enforcement, emergency management and response, and road
maintenance services for Carbon and Sweetwater Counties and the volunteer emergency response
agencies that serve these areas. The Proposed Action-related population increase in affected communities
including Rawlins, Baggs/LSRV, Wamsutter, Rock Springs and Green River would experience increased
demand for a wide range of community infrastructure and local government services. The increase in
temporary and transient population would likely generate higher levels of demand for certain services
including law enforcement and emergency medical treatment. County and municipal governments would
receive revenues from the Proposed Action (assessed in the following section), which could help offset
the costs of the additional services required to meet the demand, although municipal revenues generated
directly by the project would be limited to sales and use tax revenues. Incremental revenues from
development would typically lag development-related demand by months or in some cases, years.
Community Infrastructure
Expanding and improving community infrastructure to accommodate growth requires substantial leadtime and capital. With the possible exception of Wamsutter, demand for public facilities during the
assessment period will result from a number of other projects and factors in addition to the project area.
Consequently, while project area-related demand for public facilities may not by itself trigger a need for
community infrastructure expansion, cumulative demand from the project area in combination with other
natural gas and energy projects and other sources could trigger additional infrastructure needs.
Because energy-related population growth occurred within the study area for several years prior to the
current slow-down and additional growth was anticipated, most local governments expanded and
improved some community facilities including water and wastewater systems, solid-waste disposal
facilities, detention facilities, and a range of other facilities. For some local governments, further
improvements in specific systems are planned.
Solid Waste Disposal Facilities. Most communities and solid-waste management districts within the
study area have implemented solid waste management plans and in some cases, expanded landfill
capacities. The Carbon County communities within the study area (Rawlins and Baggs) are transporting
their municipal solid waste to the Casper Regional Landfill. The City of Casper is permitted to operate the
CRL on a 1,750 acre site; Phase I includes 88 acres and has an estimated capacity of 11,920,000 cubic

4-164

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

yards and a lifespan of 50 years. Five future cells also have estimated life spans of 50 years (Inberg-Miller
Engineers 2009).
The Sweetwater County communities in the study area (Wamsutter, Green River and Rock Springs) plan
to transport their municipal solid waste to the Rock Springs Regional landfill. Much of the gas-field solid
waste within the project area is also transported to the Rock Springs landfill. The Rock Springs Landfill,
which will become the I-80 Solid Waste Management Planning Area landfill, has capacity for about 30
years at current fill rates. The District has an additional 300 acres that may be used after the current
facility reaches capacity.
Through their participation in the solid-waste management districts, all communities within the study area
should have capacity to accommodate the increase in solid-waste-disposal demand generated by the
Proposed Action and alternatives, although some operating improvements will likely be required to
accommodate the increased volumes associated with the Proposed Action, with associated increases in
operating costs. Increased levels of drilling and development in the project area would likely be
accompanied by increases in drilling and development in other natural gas fields in the study area.
Implementation of the Proposed Action would increase fill rates at both regional and municipal landfills,
hastening the date when expansion of existing landfills or development of new landfills would be
required.
Water. Water systems within the study area are operated by municipalities. All communities have
adequate water rights and treatment and storage capacity or are in the process of improving their systems
to provide adequate capacity to accommodate additional population.
Although the main components of municipal water systems, with planned improvements, would be
adequate to accommodate the growth associated with the Proposed Action, each municipality could
encounter the need to expand or improve its water-distribution system to accommodate areas within the
community that would develop housing to accommodate growth. Additionally, elevated levels of drilling
and development in all gas fields in and near the project area could result in the need to expand water
systems to serve new housing developments in each municipality, resulting in additional water system
expenditures.
Wastewater. Rawlins, Rock Springs, and Green River all have adequate wastewater treatment capacity to
accommodate the population increment associated with the Proposed Action and other foreseen growth.
Baggs and Wamsutter are currently in the planning stages of developing additional wastewater treatment
capacity to accommodate foreseen growth. All municipalities have the potential to encounter costs to
develop wastewater collection mains to serve areas of their communities that would accommodate new
housing development and to expand or improve wastewater treatment systems to meet evolving
regulatory standards.
Criminal Detention Facilities. Carbon and Sweetwater counties each have relatively new criminaldetention facilities. The 78-bed Carbon County detention facility has been in operation since 2004.
During the summer of 2009 the facility’s design capacity was exceeded several times; suggesting a
shorter than expected 10- to 15-year design life for the facility. The Proposed Action would contribute to
the potential need to expand the Carbon County Detention Facility during the 15-year development phase
of the project.
The Sweetwater County Detention Facility has a design capacity of 208 inmates. Recent occupancy has
averaged about 110 inmates, or 53 percent of capacity. The facility was designed to allow for expansion
on the same site while maximizing use of existing administrative facilities. The Sweetwater County
Detention Facility should be adequate to accommodate the population increment associated with the
Proposed Action.
Hospitals. Major health-care institutions within the study area include the Memorial Hospital of Carbon
County, which is undergoing major renovations, and Memorial Hospital of Sweetwater County, which

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-165

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

recently completed a major improvement and expansion project. In general, the expanded physical
hospital facilities should be adequate to accommodate the population increment associated with the
Proposed Action. Both hospitals would experience increased use of emergency rooms and staff to treat
patients, including gas-field development workers who do not have local primary-care physicians.
Consequently the Proposed Action, in concert with other energy-development activities, could result in
strains on emergency-room facilities and staff. On the other hand, recent development and expansion of
urgent care facilities in Rawlins and Rock Springs could reduce this impact.
Both hospitals experienced substantial increases in uncollected debt attributed to increasing numbers of
patients without health-care insurance and indigent patients during periods of expanded energy
development. Uncollected debt would likely increase under the Proposed Action and increases in other
energy development.
Physician and health-care professional recruitment and retention has also been a problem in the past. The
Proposed Action and other energy development would increase demand for physicians and likely
contribute to increases in housing costs, which could contribute to difficulties in physician and health-care
professional recruitment.
Other Municipal Infrastructure. As discussed below, each of the counties and communities within the
study area will require additional employees and equipment to accommodate demand from the
incremental population growth associated with the Proposed Action and other energy development. New
employees will require office space and new equipment will require storage space in buildings or storage
yards. Recreational facilities such as parks, libraries, and recreation centers will receive additional
demand and may require expansion, improvement, or increases in staffing. It is likely that counties and
municipalities would be required to develop new facilities and expand and improve existing facilities to
accommodate the additional demand associated with the Proposed Action and other energy development.
Community Services
Demand associated with the incremental population associated with the Proposed Action would result in
additional demand for community services, which, in turn, would require additional staff, equipment, and
operating expenditures.
County sheriff’s departments and local emergency-management and response agencies would be required
to increase resources to maintain the current level of services (LOS) they provide to the project area and
on highways and roads that provide access to the area. County road and bridge departments would
experience demands for additional road maintenance for county roads within the project area. County
governments would experience pressure to expand all essential services to accommodate the additional
population, housing, commercial, and community infrastructure associated with the Proposed Action and
other energy development. As discussed in the following section on fiscal effects, counties would receive
ad valorem property taxes on certain natural gas facilities and production and sales and use tax revenues
to help offset the cost of increased service demand.
Affected communities and certain special districts within the study area would also experience increased
demand for services associated with the Proposed Action. For municipalities, this demand would
generally be driven by the incremental population associated with the Proposed Action, although the
specific demographics of the temporary and transient, single-status, working-age male population would
likely result in higher demand for law enforcement and emergency medical services.
Communities are much more limited than counties in their ability to fund the needed increases in
municipal services. As is discussed in the fiscal section, direct revenues generated by the Proposed Action
to communities would accrue primarily in the form of sales and use tax revenues, although the Proposed
Action could indirectly result in additional ad valorem tax revenues on commercial and residential
development and from relatively larger distributions from various shared revenues for which the
allocation formulas are population based. To assist local communities affected by energy development,

4-166

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments administers a number of grants and loans funded out
of mineral revenues that local governments can use to fund infrastructure improvements, and a number of
energy companies have provided funds to local governments to develop facilities to accommodate
energy-related growth, particularly in Wamsutter.
Public Education

Three school districts would be affected by the Proposed Action, Sweetwater County School Districts 1
and 2 and Carbon County School District 1. Table 4.15-8 below summarizes the projected increases in
student enrollments in these school districts for the first 20 years of the Proposed Action.

Proposed Action-related increases in school enrollment would follow the trends in resident population
increase, climbing over time as long-term employment increases, but then declining as drilling activity is
completed and the production levels begin to fall (see Figure 4.15-9).

Source: SDLLC and BCLLC, using the REMI model.

Proposed Action-related enrollment in SCSD #1 schools in Rock Springs would increase from an
estimated 38 students in Year 1 to 434 in Year 20. Based on recent enrollment trends, the incremental
increases in student enrollment would initially be more heavily concentrated in kindergarten and the
lower grades, but shifting into the middle and high school grades over time. Considering cumulative
increases in enrollment for other energy development, the Proposed Action-related enrollment would
exceed the capacity of the current schools during the 15-year field-development period, depending on
other concurrent levels of energy development in the region. If SCSD #1 is able to anticipate the increase
in demand in a timely fashion and seek and obtain approval from the Wyoming School Facilities
Commission for new school facilities, the demand could likely be accommodated without long periods of
overcrowding. Depending on the date of approval, the length of time required to construct such facilities
and the concurrent level of energy development, modular classrooms could be required to accommodate
some Proposed Action-related students in the interim.
Proposed Action-related enrollment in the SCSD #1 K–8 school in Wamsutter would increase from an
estimated six students in Year 1 to 81 in Year 15, decreasing thereafter. The current school facility in
Wamsutter would require expansion to accommodate this increase in enrollment.
SCSD #2, based in Green River, would experience much lower impacts on student enrollments than
would SCSD #1. Proposed Action-related enrollment in the SCSD #2 in Green River would increase from
an estimated five students in Year 1 to 45 in Year 20. SCSD #2 could accommodate the anticipated
increase in enrollment with current school facilities, depending on the level of other energy development
concurrent with the Proposed Action.
Proposed Action-related enrollment in CCSD #1 in Rawlins would increase from an estimated 15
students in Year 1 to 182 in Year 20. The school-age enrollments would begin declining thereafter. CCSD
#1 schools in Rawlins could nominally accommodate the Proposed Action-related increases in
enrollment, but given that increases in drilling and field development in the project area are likely to be
accompanied by increases in drilling and development in other fields in the study area, the capacities of
Rawlins schools are likely to be exceeded during the 15-year drilling period. The available capacities of
the newly completed Rawlins Elementary School and the 500-student-capacity high school authorized by

4-168

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

the Wyoming School Facilities Commission would be nearly exceeded by the projected Proposed Actionrelated increase in enrollment alone, not considering increases in enrollment related to other energy
development.
The LSRV K–12 schools in Baggs could accommodate the projected Proposed Action-related increase in
enrollment, but would absorb most available capacity such that enrollment associated with other nearby
energy development could result in enrollment increases beyond available capacities, particularly toward
the end of the 15-year drilling phase and the subsequent five years of project operations.
As discussed in Section 1.7.4 of the Socioeconomic Technical Report, the Wyoming School Foundation
Program provides a guaranteed level of funding to every school district in the state, with funding based on
numbers of students, classrooms, and other factors such as adjustments for small schools, transportation,
special programs, and the cost of living. Consequently, the school districts affected by Proposed Actionrelated increases in enrollment should have the financial resources to fund the required increases in
teachers and operating costs, although the districts would experience increased costs to provide for special
needs of incoming students, including programs for transient students and additional teachers to serve
English-language learners. Wyoming teacher salaries are relatively high, but districts may have to provide
housing to recruit the required number of teachers. Districts may also have trouble recruiting and
retaining custodians and school-bus drivers if the area experiences another surge in energy development,
given the wage competition during energy booms.
Fiscal Effects

Projections of future natural gas and condensate production provide the foundation for projecting the
Proposed Action-related mineral development revenue.27 Projected production was derived using typical
well-production data provided by the BLM Wyoming’s Reservoir Management Group (RMG) and the
projected numbers of new wells associated with the Proposed Action.
Estimated total production for the Proposed Action (and Alternative A) over the life of the field is 12.02
Tcf of gas and 167.3 million bbls of liquid condensate. The estimated market value of that production,
based on assumed future commodity prices of $4.00 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas28 and $40.00 per
bbl of liquid condensates is $52.0 billion ($2010); $45.6 billion for gas and $6.4 billion for condensate.29
The value of gas and condensate sales under the Proposed Action would reflect the trends in annual
production, increasing over time as long as the anticipated level of new development occurs, but declining
steadily once new development ceases. At the level of development associated with the Proposed Action,
the incremental annual sales would exceed $1 billion within three to four years and remain above that
mark for approximately 20 years. Projected annual sales value would peak at approximately $2.92 billion
for the Proposed Action (Figure 4.15-10). Sales of natural gas would account for nearly 90 percent of the
total, $2.6 billion. In 2007, a total value of $1.37 billion in natural gas and $441 million in crude oil and
condensate was produced in Carbon and Sweetwater counties. Despite substantial increases in natural gas
production, the corresponding production values in 2009 were $949 million and $330 million,
respectively.

27

The gas and condensate volumes associated with the Proposed Action would be in addition to gas and condensate produced
from wells already developed and allowed under previous NEPA actions.

28

The $4.00/mcf commodity price for natural gas is net of an assumed $0.50/mcf gas processing allowance.

29

Projected market value of sales assumes 95 percent of projected production is sold.

Production and the value of sales would decline rapidly after full-field development occurs (Year 15),
decreasing by approximately 65 percent in the subsequent decade.
Severance Taxes
The State of Wyoming levies a severance tax on all minerals produced in the state. Current severance tax
rates are 6.0 percent on condensate and natural gas. Severance tax rates are applied to the taxable value at
the point where the production process is complete, before processing and transportation. Because
processing adds value to the raw gas, the effective tax rate relative to market value is less than the
nominal rate. In 2007, the Wyoming Legislative Services Office estimated the effective rates at 5.46
percent for condensate and 4.86 percent for natural gas. Applying these rates to the project values for the
Proposed Action yields severance taxes of $818 million in the first decade as development continues and
production climbs; $1.13 billion in the second decade during which peak production occurs; and a total of
nearly $2.6 billion over the life of the field (Figure 4.15-10 and Table 4.15-9).

Severance tax receipts collected by the state are allocated to the Permanent Wyoming Mineral Trust Fund
(PWMTF) and to the Severance Tax Distribution Account; further distributions to numerous other funds
are made from the latter. Those subsequent distributions are subject to a legislatively established
aggregate cap of $155 million on annual revenue deposits. Revenue in excess of the annual cap is

4-170

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

distributed one-third to the state’s general fund and two-thirds to the budget reserve account.30 The high
levels of mineral production and prices over the past decade have consistently generated sufficient
severance taxes for such distributions to the general fund and budget reserve account. Under the assumed
allocations, the Proposed Action would generate nearly $1.1 billion to the PWMTF, nearly $500 million
to the state’s General Fund, and more than $993 million to the Budget Reserve Account.
Federal Mineral Royalties
Federal mineral royalties (FMR), based on a rate of 12.5 percent, would be derived on the value of
production from the federal mineral estate. The federal mineral estate encompasses about 59 percent of
the total oil and gas mineral estate in the project area. Total projected FMR of $3.8 billion would be
generated from the Proposed Action over the life of the field.31 Of that total, nearly $1.96 billion would
accrue to the Federal Treasury, with $1.88 billion in disbursements to the State of Wyoming (Table 4.1510).

As with the state’s severance taxes, the state’s share of FMR is allocated according to a tiered allocation
formula. The state first deducts 1 percent for administration. Thereafter, the next $200 million in annual
receipts is distributed among seven different funds, e.g., a county highways fund and school capital
construction account. FMR in excess of $200 million are distributed as follows: one-third to the School
Foundation Program and two-thirds to the state Budget Reserve Account. The $200 million annual cap
has been exceeded consistently for more than a decade, such that incremental revenues flow to the
education and budget reserve accounts. In recent years, a portion of the School Foundation Program
distributions has been diverted to two special education accounts: the Hathaway and Higher Education
endowments. The Hathaway endowment provides scholarships for high-school graduates entering college
and the Higher Education endowment allows the University of Wyoming (UW) to fund a number of
endowed faculty positions and acquire materials and resources to support those chairs. Projected
allocations of the $1.88 billion in FMR accruing to the state are $626 million for education and $1.25
billion to the state’s Budget Reserve Account (Table 4.15-11).

30

The high levels of mineral production and commodity prices have consistently generated sufficient severance tax revenue to
exceed the cap, such that additional revenues flow to the general fund and budget reserve account. The resulting distribution,
which is used in this analysis, is 41.7 percent to the PWMTF, 19.4 percent to the General Fund and 38.9 percent to the Budget
Reserve Account.

31

A “temporary” change in the distribution of FMR was recently enacted by Congress and the President. Under the new formula, 51
percent of the revenue accrues to the federal government and 49 percent to the state, rather than the prior 50/50 split net of a 1
percent administrative processing fee. The forecasts reflect the current allocation formula.

State Royalties
Like the federal government, the State of Wyoming collects mineral royalties on production from the
state’s mineral estate. The state’s interest in the project area oil and gas estate is estimated at 2 percent,
yielding an estimated $169 million ($2010) in royalties over the life of the field, assuming a 12.5-percent
royalty rate. State mineral royalties accrue to the Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments. Those
revenues are in turn used to benefit public education and other designated state institutions, such as the
Wyoming State Hospital.
Gross Products and Local Ad Valorem Taxes
The gross products tax is based on the value of the minerals produced in the previous year. The taxable
value is determined by the state, but the tax is levied and collected by local taxing jurisdictions based on
the applicable tax levy. Consequently, the tax is akin to local ad valorem property taxes. Based on the
location of the wells and mineral resources, the taxing districts most directly affected by the Proposed
Action include Sweetwater County, Carbon County, SCSD #1 and CCSD #1. A mandatory statewide mill
levy to support public education via the Wyoming School Foundation program would be collected by the
two counties, with the proceeds being transferred to the state. Projected gross products tax revenue from
the Proposed Action, assuming current mill levies over the life of the project, would total $3.11 billion
(Table 4.15-12). Of that total, 13.8 percent would accrue to Sweetwater County, 7.4 percent to Carbon
County, 43.2 percent to SCSD #1, 25.0 percent to CCSD #1, and 10.6 percent to the Wyoming School
Foundation Program.32

32

The allocation to school districts assumes that the two local districts retain all of the additional tax revenue to meet increases in
operating costs associated with changes in enrollment, rather than being subject to the “recapture” provisions under the Wyoming
School Finance Act. Under those provisions, locally generated tax revenues in excess of the amount a district is authorized to
expend under the financing equalization program are transferred to the state to help support statewide education. As a result,
school districts realize little significant fiscal benefits from high levels of mineral development within their boundaries. Both SCSD
#1 and CCSD #2 have been subject to the recapture provisions, CCSD # 1 as recently as 2010. In 2010, CCSD #1 contributed
$15.8 million of its ad valorem tax collections to the School Foundation Program.

collections to the School Foundation Program.

In addition to the gross products tax on production, the counties, school districts, and some local taxing
districts (special service districts and communities) would levy ad valorem taxes on the production
equipment, pipelines, and other real improvements associated with the project, as well as residential,
commercial, and industrial development generated by the project. Local communities would realize
additional ad valorem tax revenues from new real-estate development supported by the project and the
effects of demand on values of existing real estate. The affected local taxing districts include: Sweetwater
County Conservation District; Sweetwater County Solid Waste District #2; Sweetwater County Weed and
Pest District; Western Wyoming Community College; the Baggs Cemetery and Solid Waste Disposal
districts; the Little Snake River Conservation, Museum, and Rural Mental Health districts; Carbon
County Weed and Pest District; the cities of Rock Springs, Green River, and Rawlins, and the towns of
Wamsutter and Baggs. Project-related ad valorem tax revenues accruing to these districts are not
estimated in this analysis.
Sales and Use Taxes
Future expenditures for materials, supplies, and equipment associated with new well development and
subject to sales and use tax are projected to exceed $2.8 billion under the Proposed Action. That total
excludes taxable capital expenditures associated with any new centralized gas-processing facilities or
transmission pipelines. Based on the locations of the wells and the concentration of well drilling and oil
and gas service firms in Rock Springs, approximately two-thirds of that total, $1.9 billion, would occur in
Sweetwater County. Taxable expenditures of $340 million by the Operators are assumed to occur in
Carbon County, and $626 million are assumed to occur elsewhere in Wyoming or out of state.33 The latter
would be subject to use tax when brought into the state.34
The state imposes a 4.0-percent general sales and use tax on such purchases. Sweetwater County’s tax
rate is 2.0 percent (1.0 percent general purpose and 1.0 percent specific-purpose option). Carbon County
historically levied only the 1.0-percent general purpose tax, but added a 1.0-percent specific purpose tax
effective April 2009. Those tax rates, assumed to remain constant, would yield nearly $161 million in

33

These estimates are based on information provided by the Operators to SDLLC and BCLLC and the development of 8,950 new
wells.

34

Additional taxable purchases would be made in conjunction with ongoing production and field operations. However, data to
estimate such purchases was not available at the time of the analysis.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

sales and use taxes; $115.8 million from the state’s 4.0-percent rate, $38.2 million in locally imposed
taxes in Sweetwater County and $6.7 million on sales in Carbon County.35
Projected distributions of the state’s sales and use tax receipts, based on the current statutorily established
allocations, would include $80.3 million to the general fund and $35.5 million to local governments. The
distributions to local governments, which are primarily a function of population distribution in the 2000
Census, would include: $4.2 million to Sweetwater County, $1.3 million to Carbon County, and $30.0
million to other local governments.36 Each county retains a portion of its distribution from the state; the
remainder is distributed to cities and towns in the respective counties. Combining the locally generated
sales and use tax and distributions from the state yields totals of $42.4 million in Sweetwater County and
$8.1 million in Carbon County; more than $2.8 million in Sweetwater County and $534,000 in Carbon
County on an annual basis.
The Proposed Action would stimulate higher consumer expenditures in the regional economy and
Sweetwater and Carbon counties and local municipalities would benefit from sales and use tax receipts
derived from the consumer expenditures. All sectors of the economy would benefit from the boost in
consumer sales, with the most pronounced effects on the retail trade, food and beverage, and lodging and
entertainment sectors. Incremental consumer expenditures would increase over time, as production and
transportation employment increases, augmenting the incremental expenditures associated with the
development phase. The incremental expenditures would drop sharply after the development phase is
completed.
Revenue Summary
The combined total public-sector revenues from the identified sources are projected to exceed $9.3 billion
over the life of the field. FMR totaling $3.8 billion would account for the single largest share of the total,
41.0 percent (Table 4.15-13 and Figure 4.15-11) though nearly one-half of that total would be distributed
to the State of Wyoming. The state would garner another $2.7 billion in severance taxes and state mineral
royalties. Sweetwater and Carbon Counties would realize a combined total of $544 million in gross
products and ad valorem taxes and the two school districts and Wyoming State Foundation program
would collectively receive nearly $2.0 billion in tax revenues.

35

The total assumes all non-local purchases are made out of state. If purchases are made elsewhere in Wyoming, additional sales
taxes could be generated for that county, but the revenues accruing to Sweetwater and Carbon counties would be unaffected.

36

The resident populations of Sweetwater and Carbon county, expressed as a percentage of Wyoming’s total population, increased
slightly between 2000 and 2010. Consequently, assuming no changes in the allocation formula by the Wyoming Legislature, the
shares of local distributions from the state’s receipts may increase slightly in the future.

Local Public Sector Expenditures
Although the revenues generated to the public sector by the Proposed Action would be substantial over
time, local and state governments would correspondingly be required to make substantial expenditures to
respond to demand from development activities and from the population associated with the Proposed
Action. Many of the required infrastructure and service expenditures were identified and discussed
conceptually in the preceding Community Infrastructure and Services section. The amount and timing of
expenditures that local governments might make in response to development are not known and would
depend in part on the concurrent level of development throughout the study area.
In the past, local governments have often had to respond to service demand from energy development
prior to receiving substantial revenues from that development. In the case of major infrastructure
investments, local governments assume substantial risk that the development will continue and generate
adequate revenue to pay for the investment. This phenomenon has been called the “tax lead-time

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-175

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

problem” (Governors Committee on Oil Shale Environmental Problems 1974), but might be more
appropriately called the “tax lag-time problem,” in that the receipt of adequate tax revenues lag the point
in time at which local governments incur cost to serve development and growth.
Another issue alluded to elsewhere in this assessment is the “jurisdictional mismatch problem,” in which
development-related tax revenues do not accrue in sufficient amounts to the local governments affected
by development-related impacts. In Wyoming, ad valorem taxes on natural gas production and facilities
typically do not accrue to municipalities, where most of the population-related impacts occur.
Municipalities must rely on development-related sales and use taxes, which are often inadequate to fund
expenditures to serve development and can diminish relatively rapidly when development slows.
These are historical problems that have accompanied energy and other forms of natural-resource
development in Wyoming and much of the west. The magnitude of these problems in relation to the
Proposed Action will depend in part on the magnitude of concurrent energy development in the study
area. As previously noted, most local governments in the study area have expanded infrastructure during
past periods of energy development, so there is some capacity for growth in infrastructure in the affected
communities. Additionally, production-related revenues from existing wells within the project area will
provide revenue streams for counties, school districts, the Wyoming School Foundation Fund and some
special districts as future development occurs.
Social Effects

Many of the social effects of the last natural gas boom discussed in Section 3.15.7 could occur under the
Proposed Action, particularly if substantial concurrent development were to occur in other parts of the
study area. The availability of a relatively large number of high-paying jobs and corresponding low
regional unemployment would again be seen as positive aspects of development. Many of the current
residents of Carbon and Sweetwater counties are associated with energy industries and residents of all
affected communities are familiar with energy development. But as the population in affected
communities would grow as a result of the Proposed Action and other energy development, the
proportion of newcomers and the numbers of temporary and transient persons in affected communities
would increase. This trend has been associated with decreased community cohesion and increases in
certain types of crime including those involving drugs, alcohol, and minor disturbances and assaults (see
Section 3.15.4.1).
Conversely, as more families relocate to communities, more commercial and community infrastructure
would be available for newcomers and long-time residents alike. Community infrastructure and services
would likely be strained and commercial establishments would experience some crowding in some
communities during the early part of the development period, particularly if increases in development in
the project area coincided with development elsewhere in the study area.
Each of the communities within the CD-C study area would be affected differently by population growth
associated with the Proposed Action. Rawlins and Rock Springs have embarked on housing and
infrastructure development and community revitalization efforts. Both of these communities have
initiated programs to preserve and redevelop portions of their historic downtown areas and have instituted
and expanded cultural and recreational events that offer venues for newcomers and long-time residents to
socialize. Wamsutter has an extensive program to develop and expand both physical and commercial
infrastructure and housing resources and has enlisted participation by natural gas companies and the State
of Wyoming in their efforts. Baggs is expanding and improving infrastructure to accommodate growth
and the social effects of growth on this relatively close-knit ranching and outdoor recreation community
will present unique challenges. However, the relatively modest level of growth associated with the
Proposed Action and the community’s experience with prior and ongoing energy development will likely
soften these effects. Green River would receive proportionately the smallest amount of growth from the

4-176

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

Proposed Action and is likely to host few temporary workers, so adverse social effects of the Proposed
Action would likely be minimal in that community.
Although the value of environmental amenities and outdoor recreation for residents of the study area is
relatively well-documented, social effects of the change in environmental amenities associated with the
Proposed Action are likely to be minimal. The fact that much of the project area is already developed and
industrialized would diminish concern for further changes in most environmental amenities. The
exceptions would be areas that are considered sensitive such as the sage-grouse lek complex southeast of
Creston, the small portion of the Red Lake Dunes Citizens’ Proposed Wilderness that extends into the
northwestern part of the project area, and the Chain Lakes Wildlife Habitat Management Area.
The displacement of grazing permittees from the most intensively developed areas of the CD-C project
area would be a substantial social impact, particularly if the ranching families who hold the allotments
exit the ranching business. Ranching is an important element of the culture in the study area and further
reductions in the ranching community would be of concern for many residents.
Environmental Justice

No environmental justice populations have been identified within or in areas immediately adjacent to the
project area. Although some communities in this area have concentrations of racial and ethnic minority
populations slightly higher than the statewide averages, the percentages are not meaningfully higher with
the exception of Rawlins and that minority population is in large part attributable to the racial
composition of the inmate population at the Wyoming State Penitentiary. Rawlins is 25 miles from the
eastern boundary of the project area; consequently, the inmate population is unlikely to be affected by
human health or environmental effects of the Proposed Action.
The percentage of persons in poverty within and immediately adjacent to the project area is lower than the
statewide average. The percentage of persons in poverty in Carbon County is slightly higher than the
statewide average as a result of the population associated with the Wyoming State Penitentiary, but again,
that population is unlikely to be affected by the activities associated with the Proposed Action.
Based on the foregoing, no disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on
minority or low-income populations are anticipated under the Proposed Action.
4.15.2.3 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling
Employment

Like the Proposed Action, Alternative A assumes a total of 8,950 new wells would be drilled over a 15­
year period. Alternative A assumes that all wells would be drilled vertically from single-well pads. The
shift to all single-well pads would require more rigs to drill the same number of wells each year compared
to the Proposed Action. Projected long-term gas, condensate, and water production would be the same as
under the Proposed Action. Applying the work-crew concept developed for the Proposed Action to
Alternative A yields an increase of 15 to 20 percent in the number of direct onsite jobs (about 150) and
200 to 210 total direct jobs as compared to the Proposed Action. Estimated long-term production and
transportation employment would be slightly higher than for the Proposed Action due to the reduced
efficiencies of servicing the higher number of single-well pads.
The additional direct employment would support more indirect and induced employment, as well as
triggering additional population growth. Total peak incremental employment under Alternative A would
average about 400 more jobs than under the Proposed Action during the 15-year development phase
(Figure 4.15-12). The majority of the added jobs would be based in Sweetwater County.

Figure 4.15-12. Total incremental employment, Alternative A compared with the Proposed Action
Sources: SDLLC & BCLLC based on CD-C Operators employment estimates and REMI model output

Following the completion of new well development, incremental employment under Alternative A would
be comparable to that under the Proposed Action, because Alternative A would have similar long-term
direct production and transportation employment requirements.
Population

Projected population growth under Alternative A would mirror employment impacts, with the peak
incremental population eventually reaching 4,464 residents, approximately 450 higher than under the
Proposed Action (Table 4.15-14). The majority of the higher population would likely reside in
Sweetwater County, particularly in Rock Springs. Alternative A would also result in higher net inmigration and an influx of temporary non-resident workers during the initial years of implementation, but
also higher out-migration following the completion of new well development.

Most of the difference in population change would occur in Rock Springs and Rawlins, although the
magnitudes of those differences would be limited in comparison to either the current population or the
incremental growth associated with the Proposed Action.
Other Socioeconomic Effects

The relatively minor differences in community population between Alternative A and the Proposed
Action would result in minor differences in housing demand, demand for community infrastructure and
local government services, and increases in public-school enrollment. Rock Springs and Rawlins would
likely experience a small increase in temporary workers resulting in a corresponding increase for services
associated with the predominantly working-age-male demographics of that workforce.

Fiscal Effects

Alternative A includes the same number of wells as the Proposed Action, both in total and on an annual
basis. However, all of the wells would be drilled from single-bore pads. The projected production is also
equivalent to that under the Proposed Action. Consequently, projected revenues from state severance
taxes, FMR, state mineral royalties, and gross products/ad valorem taxes would be comparable to those
under the Proposed Action: approximately $9.4 billion over the life of the field (Table 4.15-15).

Sales and use tax revenues derived from the direct expenditures by the Operators under Alternative A
would be comparable to those under the Proposed Action, totaling about $223.3 million during the
development phase. Sales and use tax revenues derived from consumer expenditures would be slightly
higher under Alternative A than under the Proposed Action, due to the higher level of employment during
the development phase; however, estimates of the differences were not prepared for this analysis.
Social Effects

Social effects of Alternative A would be comparable to those associated with the Proposed Action.
Environmental Justice

No disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or lowincome populations would be anticipated under Alternative A.
4.15.2.4 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection
Employment

Like the Proposed Action, Alternative B assumes a total of 8,950 wells drilled over a 15-year period, but
assumes a 20 percent increase in the number of directionally drilled wells located on federal lands. For
purposes of this assessment the shifts in projected long-term gas, condensate and water production would
be the same as under the Proposed Action. Total direct employment under Alternative B, including longterm production and transportation employment, would be slightly lower than for the Proposed Action.
However, the differences would not be of such a magnitude as to materially alter the direct, indirect, and
induced employment and income effects from those anticipated under the Proposed Action.
Consequently, the profile of employment growth and subsequent declines shown for the Proposed Action
in Figure 4.15-6 reasonably characterizes the impacts on local employment of Alternative B.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-179

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

Population

Projected population growth under Alternative B, like the foreseeable effects on employment and income,
would be similar but slightly lower than those under the Proposed Action. The majority of the projectrelated incremental population in Sweetwater County would be expected to reside in Rock Springs and
Wamsutter. In Carbon County, most of the incremental population would be anticipated to live in Rawlins
and Baggs/LSRV. Any difference in population in communities would likely be negligible and not
reflective of any specific feature of Alternative B.
Other Socioeconomic Effects

Project-related demands on temporary and long-term housing resources, community infrastructure and
local government services, and public-school enrollment under Alternative B would be comparable to
those under the Proposed Action.
Fiscal Effects

Alternative B includes the same number of wells as the Proposed Action, both in total and on an annual
basis, but more of the wells on federal lands would be drilled on multi-well pads. The projected
production is also equivalent to that under the Proposed Action. Consequently, projected revenues from
state severance taxes, FMR, state mineral royalties, and gross products/ad valorem taxes would be
comparable to those under the Proposed Action: approximately $9.4 billion over the life of the field (see
Table 4.15-13 above).
Sales and use tax revenues derived from the direct expenditures by the Operators under Alternative B
would be comparable to those under the Proposed Action, totaling about $223.3 million during the
development phase. Sales and use tax revenues derived from consumer expenditures would be slightly
lower under Alternative B than under the Proposed Action, due to the lower level of employment during
the development phase; however, these differences would be minimal and estimates of the differences
were not prepared for this analysis.
Social Effects

Generally, social effects of Alternative B would be comparable to those associated with the Proposed
Action. However, the additional protections afforded by Alternative B for areas that are considered
sensitive such as the sage-grouse lek complex southeast of Creston, the small portion of the Red Lake
Dunes Citizens’ Proposed Wilderness that extends into the northwestern part of the project area, and the
Chain Lakes WHMA would reduce concern for the environmental effects on those areas.
Similarly, the additional resource protections provided by Alternative B (Section 2.2.3) would result in a
reduction of impacts to forage and grazing activities and correspondingly reduce impacts to ranchers and
grazing permittees as compared to the Proposed Action.
Environmental Justice

No disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or lowincome populations would be anticipated under Alternative B.
4.15.2.5 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap
Employment

Like the Proposed Action, Alternative C assumes a total of 8,950 wells drilled over a 15-year period, but
assumes a 50-percent increase in directional drilling of wells located on federal lands. Projected long-term
gas, condensate, and water production would be the same as under the Proposed Action. Total direct

4-180

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

employment under Alternative C, including long-term production and transportation employment, would
be lower than for the Proposed Action. However, the differences would not materially alter the direct,
indirect, and induced employment and income effects from those anticipated under the Proposed Action.
Consequently, the profile of employment growth and subsequent declines shown for the Proposed Action
in Figure 4.15-6 reasonably characterizes the impacts on local employment of Alternative C.
Population

Projected population growth under Alternative C, like the foreseeable effects on employment and income,
would be similar to but somewhat lower than those anticipated under the Proposed Action.
Other Socioeconomic Effects

Project-related demands on temporary and long-term housing resources, community infrastructure and
local government services, and public-school enrollment under Alternative C would be comparable to but
somewhat lower than those under the Proposed Action.
Fiscal Effects

Alternative C includes the same number of wells as the Proposed Action, both in total and on an annual
basis, but more of the wells on federal lands would be drilled on multi-well pads. The projected
production would also be equivalent to that under the Proposed Action. Consequently, projected revenues
from state severance taxes, FMR, state mineral royalties, and gross products/ad valorem taxes would be
comparable to those under the Proposed Action: approximately $9.4 billion over the life of the field (see
Table 4.15-13 above).
Sales and use tax revenues derived from direct expenditures by the Operators under Alternative C would
be comparable to those under the Proposed Action, totaling about $223.3 million during the development
phase. Sales and use tax revenues derived from consumer expenditures would be somewhat lower under
Alternative C than under the Proposed Action, due to the lower level of employment during the
development phase; however, the difference is anticipated to be small and estimates of the differences
were not prepared for this analysis.
Social Effects

Social effects of Alternative C would be comparable to those associated with the Proposed Action.
Environmental Justice

No disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or lowincome populations would be anticipated under Alternative C.
4.15.2.6 Alternative D: Directional Drilling
Employment

Like the Proposed Action, Alternative D assumes a total of 8,950 new wells drilled but with all future
natural gas wells on federal mineral estate to be drilled directionally from multi-well pads. Projected
annual and long-term gas, condensate, and water production would be the same as under the Proposed
Action (see Figure 4.15-3). Based on differences in the lower average overall labor requirements between
vertical wells on single wells pads and those for directionally drilled wells on multi-well pads, on a per
well basis, total direct employment under Alternative D, including long-term production and
transportation employment, would be 5 to 10 percent lower than for the Proposed Action. However, the
differences would not materially alter the direct, indirect and induced employment and income effects
from those anticipated under the Proposed Action. Consequently, the profile of employment growth and

Population

Projected population growth under Alternative D, like the foreseeable effects on employment and income,
would mirror those under the Proposed Action—but with about 300 fewer residents at the peak. The
majority of the project-related incremental population in Sweetwater County would be expected to reside
in Rock Springs and Wamsutter. In Carbon County, most of the incremental population would be
anticipated to live in Rawlins and Baggs/the Little Snake River Valley. Any difference in population in
communities would likely be negligible and not reflective of any specific feature of Alternative D.
Alternative D would also result in lower initial influx of temporary non-resident workers during the initial
years of implementation but also lower out-migration following the completion of new well development.
Other Socioeconomic Effects

The relatively minor differences in community population between Alternative D and the Proposed
Action would result in minor differences in housing demand, demand for community infrastructure and
local government services, and increases in public-school enrollment. Rock Springs and Rawlins would
likely experience a somewhat smaller influx of temporary workers than under the Proposed Action, the
difference resulting in a corresponding lesser decrease for services associated with the predominantly
working-age-male demographics of that workforce.
Fiscal Effects

Alternative D includes the same number of wells as the Proposed Action, both in total and on an annual
basis, but more of the wells on federal lands would be drilled on multi-well pads. The projected
production is also equivalent to that under the Proposed Action. Consequently, projected revenues from
state severance taxes, FMR, state mineral royalties, and gross products/ad valorem taxes under
Alternative D would be comparable to those under the Proposed Action: approximately $9.4 billion over
the life of the field (see Table 4.15-13 above).
Sales and use tax revenues derived from the direct expenditures by the Operators under Alternative D
would be comparable to those under the Proposed Action, totaling about $223.3 million during the

development phase. Sales and use tax revenues derived from consumer expenditures would be slightly
lower under Alternative D than under the Proposed Action, due to the lower level of temporary
employment during the development phase; however, estimates of the differences were not prepared for
this analysis.
4.15.2.7 Alternative E: No Action

At year-end 2010 there were an estimated 3,486 producing wells in the project area. For this analysis, the
No Action Alternative assumes that no additional wells would be drilled in the project area beyond those
drilled before the issuance of the ROD for the EIS. Assuming the cessation of drilling in 2012, production
would peak at approximately 270 Bcf per year, less than 40 percent of the peak under the Proposed
Action, and then begin an extended period of decline (see Figure 4.15-14). Total remaining production
from producing wells under No Action is estimated at about 3.2 Tcf of gas and 43 million barrels of oil
condensates.

Employment

Implementation of the No Action alternative would reduce an important source of economic stimulus in
the regional economy as drilling and field development in the CD-C area would come to a halt in 2012.
Thereafter, drilling-and-completion-related employment would rapidly decline (Figure 4.15-15). Longterm production and transportation employment would also be lower under the No Action as compared to
the Proposed Action, due to the lower volumes of gas, condensate, and water production.37 The loss of
direct onsite and off-site drilling and field-development employment, along with the lower production and
transportation jobs relative to the Proposed Action, would ripple through the economy, reducing the
number of indirect and induced jobs supported by activity in the project area. The magnitude of the
eventual job losses would grow over time.

37

Current levels of direct onsite and off-site development employment associated with development are assumed to cease at the
same time as the completion of drilling under the No Action.

Projected population change under No Action would initially show a modest decline as temporary
residents would account for most of the outflow. Over time, population declines would mount as the
losses in temporary and long-term induced and production-related jobs and slower growth in populationrelated consumer demand affected resident households. Net population declines in the region would
exceed an estimated 2,000 residents within 5 years and eventually total approximately 4,000 fewer
residents (see Figure 4.15-16), assuming the absence of other economic activity that would provide
employment for the displaced workers. The largest declines in resident and temporary populations would
occur in Rock Springs, with the largest relative difference occurring in Wamsutter.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

Housing, Community Infrastructure and Services

Implementation of the No Action Alternative would result in substantially lower demand for long-term
and temporary housing resources in communities near the project area. Following the completion of
development, and depending on other energy-development activities occurring at the time, communities
near the CD-C project area could see substantial increases in vacancies and lower real estate values and
rental costs in both long-term and temporary housing under the No Action Alternative.
Communities near the project area would experience moderating demand for most community facilities
and services following implementation of the No Action Alternative. Some workforce and social service
organizations may see temporary increases in the need to assist individuals and families affected by loss
of employment. Over time, the trends in population change could result in excess capacity in some
communities depending on the level of other energy-development activity. Future reductions in service
demand would be relatively greatest in Wamsutter and Baggs/LSRV but would also extend to Rawlins
and Rock Springs.
Fiscal Effects

The No Action Alternative assumes a halt to new oil and gas development in the project area following a
ROD for the EIS. Cessation of activity would be followed by a steady decline in production volumes,
with corresponding effects on sales of product and the associated public sector tax revenues. Total
estimated incremental sales value of production from existing wells under the No Action is projected at
$15.0 billion, approximately 29 percent of the $52.0 billion in aggregate sales value under the Proposed
Action. Under No Action, peak annual market value of sales is projected at $1.38 billion in 2012. The
rapidity of both the growth and decline of annual sales volume under the No Action Alternative contrasts
markedly to that for the Proposed Action (Figures 4.15-2 above and 4.15-17 below).

The lower total production under No Action, relative to the Proposed Action, would result in
correspondingly lower royalty and tax generation. Total projected revenues from the defined sources are
$2.5 billion (Table 4.15-16), nearly 73 percent lower than under the Proposed Action. Similar relative
reductions characterize the differences in the other major public sector revenues as well. The differences
reflect not just the lower projected production, but also the absence of FMR resulting from the lack of
additional new wells on federal lands under the No Action Alternative. State mineral royalties from new
wells and production on state lands would, however, be the same as under the Proposed Action.

Source: SDLLC and BCLLC.

The lower total production under No Action, relative to the Proposed Action, would result in
correspondingly lower royalty and tax generation, including FMR and state mineral royalties due to the
lack of new wells completed on public lands. Not only would less revenue accrue to the Wyoming State
Foundation program from distributions of the FMR, but the program would also receive less revenue
from the statewide mandatory levy on gross products and the taxable real property associated with oil and
gas development.
Sales and use taxes would also be substantially lower under No Action than under the Proposed Action
due to the lower value of taxable purchases by the Operators and lower consumer expenditures by
workers and businesses supported indirectly by new development.
Social Effects

Social effects of the No Action Alternative would include increases in unemployment and reductions in
income that would result 15 years sooner under the No Action than the Proposed Action. Widespread
unemployment would trigger out-migration and some disruption of the social fabric in communities.
Local residents who have benefited economically from continued development of the project area would
likely be dissatisfied with the forgone opportunities.
As development within the project area ceases and interim reclamation occurs, many of the adverse
impacts to grazing permittees would begin to diminish. Over time, the use of grazing allotments in the
most intensely developed portions of the project area could increase, benefiting ranchers in the region.
Similarly, as development activities cease and interim reclamation occurs, some recreation users of public
lands within the project area might return to the area.
Environmental Justice

No disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority or lowincome populations would be anticipated under the No Action Alternative.
4.15.3 Impact Summary
Each of the alternatives assessed in this EIS would result in substantial social and economic effects within
the study area. Under the parameters and assumptions used for this assessment, the five action alternatives
would generate similar effects with minor differences. Alternative A – 100 Percent Vertical Drilling
would have slightly higher levels of employment, population, sales and use tax generation, and housing
and public infrastructure and services demand than the Proposed Action; Alternative B – Enhanced
Resource Protection, Alternative C – Surface Disturbance Cap, and Alternative D – Directional Drilling

4-186

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

would each have increasingly fewer effects on socioeconomic conditions. However, for broad assessment
purposes the effects of the five action alternatives would be similar and are summarized together.
The beneficial economic, social, and fiscal effects of the action alternatives would be foregone under the
No Action Alternative. Instead, the added economic stimulus associated with drilling, development, and
production would be replaced by increased unemployment, workforce outmigration, and a decline in
public-sector revenues. Moreover, these effects would begin occurring soon after the issuance of the
ROD, 15 years sooner than under the action alternatives.
Each of the five action alternatives would generate over 1,000 incremental total onsite and off-site direct
jobs during the fifth year of field development and about 1,400 and 1,600 total direct jobs in Years 10 and
15, respectively. Direct employment would decline sharply following the completion of new well
development, shedding nearly 1,200 total direct jobs by Year 20. At that time, five years after drilling and
field development is scheduled to cease, total direct jobs would decrease to below 500.
For the five action alternatives, total employment including direct, indirect, and induced jobs, would
climb to a peak of around 4,000 jobs in Year 14 of development. It is important to note that these would
be in addition to the existing level of project-area employment associated with average annual drilling of
almost 300 wells and production of over 3,700 wells. Once drilling/field development is completed,
regional employment would decrease by over 4,300 jobs, which would include not only the incremental
jobs associated with drilling/field development under the Proposed Action but the currently existing
drilling/field development-related jobs as well, hence the total job loss would be larger than the total
incremental job gain associated with the action alternatives, even though a substantial number of
production-related jobs would remain after drilling/field development ceases.
Population increases and losses for all alternatives would closely follow employment gains and losses.
Incremental population associated with the five action alternatives would increase over time to a peak of
about 3,700 new residents and almost 1,000 temporary workers during Year 15 of development. Projectrelated population would fall to about 700 residents by Year 20, five years after drilling/field development
ceases.
Project-related population under No Action would decline rapidly upon issuance of the ROD resulting in
population outmigration in both Sweetwater and Carbon counties and the affected communities.
The population associated with the five action alternatives would generate demand for additional longterm and temporary housing resources, increasing to an estimated total demand of over 1,500 long-term
units and almost 1,000 temporary beds in Year 15 of development, and decreasing to about 250 long-term
units and no temporary units during Year 20. Again, this substantial reduction in housing demand would
be associated not only with the decrease in incremental demand associated with the action alternatives,
but the decrease in demand from the population associated with current development and production
employment in the project area as well.
Implementation of the No Action Alternative would result in a substantial decrease in area housing
demand compared to existing conditions. Depending on other energy-development activities occurring at
the time of the issuance of the ROD, communities near the CD-C project area could see substantial
vacancies in both long-term and temporary housing under the No Action Alternative.
The substantial increase in population associated with the five action alternatives would generate
corresponding demand for community infrastructure and services. Most communities within the study
area have anticipated energy-related growth and have improved or are planning to improve major
community infrastructure such as water, wastewater, solid-waste disposal systems, criminal detention
facilities, and schools. Current or planned facilities should be adequate to accommodate the population
associated with the action alternatives in the near term but may require expansion during the latter part of
the 15-year drilling and field-development cycle, depending on the cumulative level of energy

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-187

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

development occurring at the time. Demand for community facilities would substantially diminish after
the 15-year drilling/field-development cycle is completed.
Many community-service providers would be required to add staff, equipment, and perhaps facilities to
accommodate the population associated with the five action alternatives, particularly in the context of
cumulative regional energy development.
Under the No Action Alternative, current infrastructure and service demand associated with development
in the CD-C project area would diminish substantially, perhaps resulting in excess capacity in some
infrastructure and services, depending on the level of other energy development activity occurring at the
time of the issuance of a ROD. Future reductions in service demand would be relatively greatest in
Wamsutter and Baggs/LSRV but would also extend to Rawlins and Rock Springs.
Substantial federal, state, and local government revenues would be generated by the natural gas and
liquids production associated with each of the five action alternatives and by the capital investment
associated with drilling/field development. Under the production and pricing assumptions used for this
assessment, the action alternatives would generate about $3.8 billion ($2008) in FMR over the 40-year
life of the project, and about $1.8 billion of that amount would accrue to the state. An estimated $530
million in state mineral royalties would be generated by the action alternatives, and $3.1 billion in ad
valorem and gross products taxes to various counties, special districts, school districts, and the Wyoming
School Foundation Fund. Sales and use taxes associated with project-related investments would yield
nearly $161 million in sales and use taxes at current rates: $115.8 million from the state’s 4.0 percent rate,
$38.2 million in locally imposed taxes in Sweetwater County, and $6.7 million on sales in Carbon
County. Projected distributions of the state’s sales and use tax receipts, based on the current statutorily
established allocations would include $80.3 million to the general fund and $35.5 million to local
governments. As noted above, sales and use tax revenues would be somewhat higher under Alternative A
and somewhat lower under Alternatives B, C, and D.
Oil and gas-related tax revenues would be much lower under the No Action Alternative than under any of
the action alternatives, both in terms of annual receipts and total receipts over the life of the field.
The lower total production under No Action relative to the action alternatives would result in
correspondingly lower royalty and tax generation. Total projected revenues from the defined sources
would be nearly 77 percent lower than under the Proposed Action. Similar relative reductions characterize
the differences in the other major public-sector revenues as well.
Not only would less revenue accrue to the Wyoming State Foundation program from distributions of the
FMR, but the program would also receive less revenue from the statewide mandatory levy on gross
products and the taxable real property associated with oil and gas development.
Sales and use taxes would also be substantially lower under No Action than under the action alternatives
due to the lower value of taxable purchases by the Operators and lower consumer expenditures by
workers and businesses supported indirectly by new development.
Social effects of the action alternatives would generally be similar to current effects in communities
within the study area, which are both beneficial and adverse. Increases in certain types of crime and social
problems and decreases in community cohesion could be associated with rapid population growth and
large numbers of temporary workers in communities, depending on the concurrent level of energy
development in the area. Conversely, increased employment opportunities, a generally robust economy,
and increases in commercial and community infrastructure would be seen as beneficial to many residents.
The fact that much of the project area is already developed and industrialized would diminish concern for
further changes in most environmental amenities under the action alternatives. Given that substantial
change in the recreation setting has already occurred, the relative change in recreation use associated with
any further development would be small. The concern for development-related effects on areas that are

4-188

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—SOCIOECONOMICS

considered sensitive would also occur under all action alternatives, but would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
The displacement of grazing permittees from the most intensively developed areas of the project area
could occur under all alternatives; the risk of additional displacement would not occur under the No
Action Alternative.
No disproportionately high and adverse human-health or environmental effects on minority or lowincome populations would be anticipated under any of the action alternatives or the No Action
Alternative.
4.15.4 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Most unavoidable adverse socioeconomic impacts of the Proposed Action and alternatives are associated
with: the rapid and/or temporary influx of new workers, the need to provide housing and community
services and facilities for the additional workforce and their families, and the decline in public revenues
that would occur at the end of the project or with the implementation of the No Action alternative. The
following mitigation measures should be implemented to reduce adverse socioeconomic effects and
enhance the beneficial effects:





To the extent practicable, the Operators should attempt to hire and train local workers from Carbon
and Sweetwater counties.
The Operators should acquire and require their contractors to acquire Carbon and Sweetwater
County sales and use tax licenses and purchase all materials, equipment, and supplies to be used
within the project area under these licenses so that proper attribution of sales and use tax payments
can occur.
The Operators and their major contractors should ensure that adequate temporary housing resources
are available to accommodate their temporary drilling, field-development, and ancillary facility
construction workforces.

In order to allow local governments to effectively plan for the needed infrastructure and services to
accommodate the workforce and population associated with this major development initiative, the
Operators should meet annually with the BLM and representatives of local and state governments to
discuss near-term and mid-term development plans. If events that would substantially accelerate or retard
development in the project area become evident, the Operators should meet with the BLM and
representatives of local and state governments to discuss the potential effects of such events.

4.16

TRANSPORTATION

This section assesses effects of the Proposed Action and other alternatives on the transportation system
providing access to and within the CD-C project area, including federal and state highways, Carbon and
Sweetwater county roads, BLM roads, and private roads. Environmental effects of new and improved
roads within the project area are described in sections 3.3 Soils; 3.7 Invasive, Non-native Species; 3.8
Wildlife; 3.11 Visual; 3.12 Recreation; and 4.18 Range Resources.
4.16.1 Planning Documents and Criteria
4.16.1.1 Rawlins RMP

The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes the following goal and objectives for transportation and
access management:

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-189

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—TRANSPORTATION

Management Goal
1. Develop and maintain a transportation management system to accommodate public demand for
legal access through and across public land and to meet resource management needs and objectives
(e.g., wildlife objectives).
Management Objectives
1. Maintain or expand, as determined necessary, existing access, including the right of access by a
non-federal-land in-holder.
2. Abandon or close redundant or unnecessary access roads; reclaim after consultation with local
government and interested parties.
3. Conduct transportation planning to manage existing and new access in a manner that ensures
compatibility with resource values and management objectives.
4. Incorporate existing state and county road systems into BLM transportation system to accurately
show existing access. Coordinate access issues with state and local governments.
4.16.1.2 Transportation Plan

As noted in Section 3.16 Transportation and Access, an MOU between the BLM, WYDOT, Carbon
and Sweetwater Counties and a number of the CD-C Operators established a transportation plan (TP) and
transportation planning committee (TPC) for the Continental Divide portion of the project area. Upon the
issuance of a ROD, the Creston portion of the project area will be brought into the TP and the Creston
Operators will join the TPC as part of the federal permitting process.
4.16.1.3 Impact Significance Criteria

The following criteria are used to determine whether transportation impacts would be significant and
represent a balance between public access and transportation safety:
1. Substantial limitation on public access to travel within the project area.
2. Substantial reduction in opportunity for acquisition of access easements and road development.
3. Increases in traffic levels on the local public transportation system that would cause the level of
service on the system to fall below acceptable levels, as defined by the responsible government
agency.
4.16.2 Direct and Indirect Impacts
Section 3.16 Transortation and Access describes the highway network providing access to the project
area and the county, the BLM, and the private road network providing access within the project area. The
CD-C project is an infill project; consequently, under all alternatives new roads would primarily be
resource roads connecting the existing road network with new well pads, and ancillary facilities (e.g.
gathering systems, compressor stations, and other associated infrastructure).
The principal measure of transportation effects related to the alternatives would be changes in the number
of vehicle trips required. Vehicle trips would be generated by drilling, completion, and ancillary facility
construction; by production activities, including routine monitoring and maintenance; by hauling of
produced water and liquids; and by periodic well workovers. Interim and final reclamation activities
would also generate vehicle trips.
For all alternatives, vehicle trips would originate from a variety of locations including Rock Springs,
Rawlins, Wamsutter, Baggs, and locations outside the study area. Drilling rigs and some gas-field service
and construction equipment would be transported to the project area and remain there for the duration of a
particular contract or task. For the major Operators, drilling rigs would work on a year-round basis; in
these cases, trips involving major pieces of equipment, such as rig moves, would occur primarily within

4-190

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—TRANSPORTATION

the project area. Similarly, most produced-water and liquids-collection trips are likely to occur entirely
within the project area as produced-water disposal and liquids-transportation sites will be located within
the project area.
Many gas-field service firms serving the project area are presently located in Rock Springs, although
some are located in Rawlins and a few are located in Baggs and the Little Snake River Valley (LSRV)
area. BP has a major field-operations center just north of Wamsutter and several companies have
established field offices and equipment lay-down and support yards in Wamsutter, which also houses
many gas-field workers on both a temporary and longer-term basis. Devon Energy has a field office in
Baggs to serve the Creston/Blue Gap field. There are two temporary living facilities located adjacent to
WY 789 in the Dad area, and many gas-field workers reside in Rock Springs, Rawlins, and Baggs.
Tables 4.16-1 and 4.16-2 display estimated per-well round-trips associated with typical drilling and
production activities in the project area. Trip estimates were developed from information provided by the
Operators, estimates from similar projects, and from information concerning anticipated per-well volumes
of produced liquids and water provided by the BLM Wyoming’s Reservoir Management Group. The trip
estimates are based on drilling and completion activities for typical wells, construction of gathering
systems and well-site production facilities, performance of routine field operations and maintenance
activities, and consideration of vendor and miscellaneous visits.

Table 4.16-1 displays trip estimates for single wells drilled vertically from an individual well pad and for
directional wells drilled from multi-well pads, which are assumed to average four bores/pad. Directional
wells drilled from multi-well pads generate reduced drilling, completion, and field-development traffic,
on a per well basis, as compared to vertical wells on single-well pads. The reductions are principally in
trips associated with well pad and access road construction, rig moves, completion, gathering and
electrical system construction, and interim reclamation activities.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—TRANSPORTATION

Tables 4.16-1 and 4.16-2 display traffic estimates in terms of round trips. The principal measure of traffic
used elsewhere in the assessment is average annual daily traffic (AADT). In contrast to round trips,
AADT represents one-way trips, i.e. AADT would count a round trip as two trips.
Not all drilling and production trips would originate outside the project area. For each drilling and
production activity, a certain number of trips would originate within the project area, including trips
associated with some rig moves and other heavy equipment that would move from well pad to well pad
without leaving the project area, commuting trips for some drilling and completion crews who reside in
Wamsutter in motels and mobile-home/RV parks, and some trips associated with gas-field service
companies whose offices and yards are located in Wamsutter.
Under all action alternatives, construction and operations of additional compressor sites, a central pipeline
compression facility, central gas-processing/stabilization facilities and high-pressure gas line would be
required. Because the same number of wells would be developed under all action alternatives, the overall
volume of traffic generated by these facilities is assumed to be the same, although the location of
individual facilities and the timing of construction could differ based on the alternative. For Alternative E:
No Action, no additional facilities are assumed to be required.
4.16.2.1 Proposed Action

This analysis assumes a total of 8,950 additional wells would be drilled over 15 years under the Proposed
Action; an average of about 600 wells per year. The transportation assessment is based on the drilling
schedule outlined in Section 3.5, Air Quality. Of the total wells, 42 percent are assumed to be directional
wells drilled from multi-well pads averaging four bores/pad. The remaining 58 percent are assumed to be
drilled vertically from single-well pads.
Drilling and production in the project area during 2009 generated an estimated AADT of 1,525. Of that
total, an estimated 1,060 trips traveled on highways providing access to the project area and on county,
BLM, and private roads to a worksite within the project area. An estimated 465 trips were internal, both
originating and terminating within the project area, traveling entirely on county, BLM, and private roads
to reach a worksite.
Figure 4.16-1 displays estimated Proposed Action-related AADT, including both internal and external
trips by year through the 15-year drilling period and the first 15 years of full-field operations, based on
the drilling schedule provided by the Operators. Transportation effects of drilling and production
activities associated with the Proposed Action would build from an estimated 1,682 AADT in Year 1 to a
peak of over 3,900 AADT in Years 13 and 14 of drilling. This would be in addition to the trips associated
with ongoing production activities from existing wells, which are described under the No Action
alternative (Section 4.16.2.6). This volume would diminish during the last year of drilling and for the
remainder of the productive life of the project, as produced-water and liquids volumes decrease as the
wells age. By Year 30 of the Proposed Action, an estimated 1,360 AADT would be generated daily within
the project area. Table 4.16-1 provides estimates of per-well round trips for drilling and completion
activities. Drilling-related trips could be higher or lower during any given year, depending on the actual
number of wells drilled. Actual future drilling levels would vary in response to natural-gas demand and
prices, drill rig and workforce availability, gas transmission pipeline capacity, weather, regulatory
approvals, individual company development strategies, and other factors. Actual production-related trips
would depend on the cumulative number of wells in production.

Tables 4.16-3, 4.16-4, and 4.16-5 display estimated incremental highway AADT associated with Year 1,
Year 10, and Year 20 of the Proposed Action. Year 1 AADT is contrasted with WYDOT 2009 AADT
estimates for segments of highways providing access to the project area. It is important to note that
WYDOT 2009 AADT estimates include traffic associated with the drilling of 244 new wells and
production services for 3,783 wells within the project area during that year.
Estimates of drilling-related traffic for Year 1 and Year 10 of the Proposed Action represent the increment
over the 2009 drilling level, which are included in the WYDOT 2009 AADT and the forecast 2020
AADT. Note that in Year 20 of the Proposed Action, project area-related traffic would be entirely
operations related, as all drilling would have been completed under the assumptions used for this
assessment.
Project area drilling and production-related AADT were assigned to highway segments based on a
combination of development-area access and likely locations of Operator offices and yards, natural gas
field-service companies and vendor offices and yards, and temporary and long-term employee housing.
Based on these origin and destination factors and a review of each drilling and production-related activity,
it is assumed that about 40 percent of all project area-related trips would originate internally, from
Wamsutter or elsewhere within the project area during the initial years of drilling. That percentage would
decrease over time as production-related traffic increases. Beginning in Year 16, following the
completion of drilling, an estimated 24 percent of all trips would be strictly internal, traveling exclusively
on county, BLM and private roads. Internal trips would diminish to about seven percent by Year 30, due
to reductions in produced water and liquids over time.
Of trips that originate or terminate externally, 55 percent are assumed to be to or from Rock Springs; 25
percent to/from Rawlins, 10 percent from Baggs/LSRV or at points along WY 789 and 10 percent from
Wamsutter.38 Of the total trips traveling from Rawlins, 15 percent are assumed to originate at points to the

Although Wamsutter is within the CD-C project area, external trips originating from Wamsutter are assumed to travel on I-80 to
other destinations within the project area.

Under the assumptions used for this assessment, the highest concentration of project area-related traffic
on I-80 would be at Wamsutter. As shown in Table 4.16-3, during Year 1 of the Proposed Action, when a
total of 440 wells are assumed to be drilled, both total AADT and truck AADT on I-80 at Wamsutter
would be an estimated 4 percent of 2009 WYDOT estimates for that location. Total AADT and truck
AADT on WY 789 would be 1 to 2 percent of 2009 AADT. Total AADT would be less than 1 percent of
2009 AADT at the bypass north of Rawlins; total and truck AADT would be 1 to 2 percent of 2009
AADT elsewhere on US 287 during Year 1 of the Proposed Action.

During Year 10 of the Proposed Action (Table 4.16-4), a total of 738 wells are assumed to be drilled and
6,240 Proposed Action-related wells would require production activities. Highway traffic estimates
during Year 10 of the Proposed Action are contrasted with WYDOT forecasts of 2020 traffic on affected

During Year 20 of the Proposed Action, no new drilling would occur but 8,950 wells would require
production-related activities. Highway traffic estimates during Year 20 of the Proposed Action are
contrasted with WYDOT forecasts of 2030 traffic Proposed Action-related total AADT on I-80 at
Wamsutter would be six percent of WYDOT projected 2030 AADT at that location and truck traffic
would be two percent. Total AADT on WY 789 at Creston Junction would be 3 percent of forecast 2030
AADT and Proposed Action-related truck AADT would be 13 percent. Both total and truck AADT on US
287 would be less than 1 percent of forecast WYDOT 2030 AADT on that highway.
Traffic associated with the Proposed Action would be unlikely to result in a deterioration of the LOS on I­
80, except to perhaps accelerate the decrease from LOS A to LOS B at the Creston Junction intersection,
given the relatively high forecasts for Proposed Action-related traffic at that intersection during drilling
and field development. Similarly, the level of Proposed Action-related traffic on WY 789 from Creston
Junction south to Baggs would be unlikely to result in a substantial deterioration in LOS but would
certainly contribute to the LOS rating of C at the intersection with Carbon County Road 700 West during
the drilling and field development period. The Proposed Action-related traffic on US 287/WY 220 north
to Casper will contribute to the decrease in LOS from B to the forecast LOS C, but the relatively minor
level of project-related traffic will play a small role in that decrease in LOS.
In addition to the drilling and production-related traffic shown in the preceding table, a number of
ancillary facilities would be required under the Proposed Action. Such facilities could include up to 10
field compression facilities, a central pipeline compression facility, one central processing/stabilization
plant, and up to 45 miles of high-pressure pipeline. Trip estimates for these facilities were not available
from the Operators; consequently, estimates of similar facilities in other natural gas development areas
were used to provide order-of-magnitude estimates for assessment purposes. Table 4.16.6 below
summarizes the construction trip traffic associated with each of these facilities.

These facilities would be constructed at different locations and at different times during the drilling and
field-development period; therefore, the construction trips would also occur during different periods. In
addition to the construction traffic estimates contained in Table 4.16-6, these facilities would generate a
low level of traffic during operations and most of those trips would involve light-duty vehicles.
Because AADT is calculated on a 365-day/year basis, construction of each of these facilities, except the
central gas-processing/stabilization facility, would result in minor increases in AADT. However, traffic
on the specific access road to each facility and at intersections of highways and access roads could be
substantial during the construction period, particularly during shift changes for construction workers.
During these brief periods, the level of service ratings for these intersections could drop below current
levels. As noted, once constructed, these facilities would generate relatively low volumes of daily traffic.
The increases in traffic volumes associated with the Proposed Action could result in additional
maintenance requirements on affected highway segments, particularly on WY 789 and on I-80 around the
Wamsutter interchange during peak drilling years. The volume of over-height/over-width loads using I-80
underpasses (described in Section 3.16.2) would continue to increase under the Proposed Action,
requiring more frequent Wyoming Highway Patrol traffic-safety services, unless and until modifications
in underpasses are completed. Given the substantial percentage increase in AADT associated with the
Proposed Action, higher accident rates could be possible on the segments of highways providing access to
the project area, especially during peak drilling years.
County roads providing access within the project area would see substantial increases in use, particularly
SCR 23S (Wamsutter-to-Crooks Gap Road South), CCR 701 (Wamsutter-to-Dad Road), and SCR 23N
(Wamsutter-to-Crooks Gap Road North), which would provide access to the most densely developed
portion of the project area. CCR 701 currently has the highest traffic volume of any road or highway in
Carbon County, with the exception of I-80, and SCR 23 (north and south) is among the highest trafficvolume roads in Sweetwater County. The vast majority of traffic on these roads is industrial and is
associated with project area gas-field activities. The Proposed Action would result in substantially
accelerated maintenance requirements on these roads and likely require additional improvements to
accommodate the increased volume of industrial traffic.
Certain BLM and private roads providing access within the project area would also experience substantial
increases in traffic associated with the development phase of the Proposed Action. Typically the
Operators improve and maintain these roads through agreements with the BLM and private surface
owners. Operators would also be required to secure right-of-way agreements with private landowners for
use of private roads and BLM roads without right-of-way agreements.
Based on the above, the state of Wyoming, Sweetwater and Carbon counties, and the BLM would all
experience substantially higher road-improvement and maintenance requirements associated with the
Proposed Action. Each of these entities would also receive substantial additional revenues from severance

taxes (in the case of the state), federal mineral royalties (in the case of the BLM, the state, and the
counties) and from ad valorem property taxes (in the case of the counties39), on natural gas production
associated with the Proposed Action, which could be used to help fund Proposed Action-related
improvements and maintenance requirements.
Continued implementation of the CD-C TP and TPC process would result in a coordinated approach to
road use, development, maintenance, and reclamation; to the extent possible considering the high level of
development and associated traffic, it would also reduce transportation effects.
4.16.2.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A assumes the same overall drilling schedule as the Proposed Action, but assumes all wells
would be drilled vertically from single-well pads. The trip-generation factors used for Alternative A are
the same factors used for vertical wells in the Proposed Action (see Vertical Wells columns in Table
4.16-1).
Figure 4.16-2 compares total AADT for the Proposed Action and Alternative A. Alternative A would
result in an estimated total AADT of 1,935 during Year 1, 15 percent higher than the estimated total
AADT for the Proposed Action during Year 1. During Year 10, Alternative A would generate an
estimated AADT of 4,217, 10 percent greater than the Proposed Action. The smaller percentage is the
result of the larger proportion of operations-related traffic to total traffic in that year (the level of
operations traffic would be the same under either alternative). After Year 15, when drilling is assumed to
be completed under both alternatives, the estimated average number of round trips would be the same.
The higher level of traffic associated with Alternative A would generate correspondingly higher levels of
traffic on federal and state highways providing access to the project area. However, incremental AADT
associated with Alternative A would generate no more than 1 to 2 percent increases in AADT on any
highway segment during the first 15 years as compared to the Proposed Action.
Under Alternative A, the increases in AADT on highways providing access to the project area associated
with construction and operations of additional compressor sites, a central pipeline compression facility,
two or more central gas processing/stabilization facilities and 45 miles of high-pressure gas line would be
the same as under the Proposed Action.
The higher traffic volumes associated with Alternative A would result in correspondingly higher
maintenance requirements on affected highway segments as compared to the Proposed Action and
generate the potential for higher accident rates on the segments of highways providing access to the
project area.
County roads providing access within the project area would experience higher levels of traffic under the
drilling and field-development phase of Alternative A compared to the Proposed Action and
correspondingly higher maintenance requirements.
BLM and private roads providing access within the project area would also experience higher increases in
traffic associated with the Proposed Action. As with the Proposed Action, the Operators would improve
and maintain these roads through agreements with the BLM and private surface owners.
Although WYDOT and Sweetwater and Carbon counties would experience higher road maintenance costs
under Alternative A compared to the Proposed Action, natural gas production would likely be the same
under both alternatives; consequently, the state and counties would receive the same revenues under both
alternatives but be required to fund somewhat higher highway and road maintenance costs under
Alternative A than under the Proposed Action.

Sweetwater County has a dedicated mill levy for road and bridge funding; Carbon County does not.

As with the Proposed Action, continued implementation of the CD-C TP and TPC process would result in
a coordinated approach to road use, development, maintenance and reclamation and, to the extent possible
considering the high level of development and associated traffic, reduce potential transportation effects.
4.16.2.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative

Implementation of Alternative B would result in the same drilling schedule and number of wells as the
Proposed Action. For the purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that implementation of the enhanced
resource protection measures described in Section 2.2.3 would result in a 20 percent increase in
directional drilling from multi-well pads on federal lands compared to the Proposed Action. This would
result in 53 percent of all wells within the project area being drilled vertically from single well pads
(compared to 58 percent for the Proposed Action) and 47 percent of all wells being drilled directionally
from multi-well pads (compared to 42 percent for the Proposed Action).
Figure 4.16-3 provides a comparison of total AADT for the Proposed Action and Alternative B.
Alternative B would result in an overall reduction of 1 to 2 percent in total AADT during the 15-year
drilling period compared to the Proposed Action. However, at a site-specific level, drilling four
directional wells on a multi-well pad would require approximately 33 percent fewer trips than drilling
four vertical wells on individual pads. Consequently, reductions in traffic at specific well-site locations
could be substantial under Alternative B as compared to the Proposed Action.
After drilling is completed, Alternative B and Proposed Action AADT would be the same because the
same number of wells would require production-related activities. Traffic associated with construction of
ancillary facilities under Alternative B would be similar to that associated with the Proposed Action.
Highway and road maintenance and improvement requirements would be similar for both alternatives, as
would the potential for increases in accidents. Similar levels of tax and royalty revenues would accrue to
state and local governments under both alternatives.

4.16.2.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low Density Development Areas

Implementation of Alternative C would result in the same drilling schedule and number of wells as the
Proposed Action. For the purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that implementation of the 60-acre
surface disturbance cap in high-density natural gas development areas and the 30-acre disturbance cap
elsewhere in the project area would result in a 50-percent increase in directional drilling from multi-well
pads on federal lands. This would result in 46 percent of all wells within the project area being drilled
vertically from single well pads (compared to 58 percent for the Proposed Action) and 54 percent of all
wells being drilled directionally from multi-well pads (compared to 42 percent for the Proposed Action).
Figure 4.16-4 compares total AADT for the Proposed Action and Alternative C. Implementation of
Alternative C would result in a reduction of 3 to 4 percent in total AADT during Years 1 through 13 of
the 15-year drilling period compared to the Proposed Action; AADT would be the same for the two
alternatives after drilling is completed. As with all alternatives, at a site-specific level, drilling four
directional wells on a multi-well pad would require an estimated 33 percent fewer trips than drilling four
vertical wells on individual pads.
After drilling is completed, Alternative C and Proposed Action AADT would be the same because the
same number of wells would require production-related activities. Traffic associated with construction of
ancillary facilities under Alternative C would be similar to that associated with the Proposed Action.
Highway and road maintenance and improvement requirements would be similar for both alternatives, as
would the potential for increases in accidents. Similar levels of tax and royalty revenues would accrue to
state and local governments under both alternatives.

4.16.2.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

For the purpose of this assessment, it is assumed that requiring all wells on federal lands to be drilled on
multi-well pads would result in a 74-percent increase in directional drilling from multi-well pads on
federal lands. This would result in a total of 27 percent of all wells within the project area being drilled
vertically from single well pads (compared to 58 percent for the Proposed Action) and 74 percent of all
wells being drilled directionally from multi-well pads (compared to 42 percent for the Proposed Action).
Figure 4.16-5 provides a comparison of total AADT for the Proposed Action and Alternative D.
Implementation of Alternative D would result in a reduction of 3 to 11 percent in total AADT during the
15-year drilling period compared to the Proposed Action. These reductions would result from the reduced
number of trips required for location construction, rig mobilization and demobilization, and other drilling
and completion activities that could be performed for multiple wells on one well pad. During project
operations, AADT would be about the same as that associated with the Proposed Action.
After drilling is completed, Alternative D and Proposed Action AADT would be similar because the same
number of wells would require production-related activities. Traffic associated with construction of
ancillary facilities under Alternative D would be similar to that associated with the Proposed Action
although the timing and location of facilities construction could differ.
Highway and road maintenance and improvement requirements would be similar for both alternatives, as
would the potential for increases in accidents. Similar levels of tax and royalty revenues would accrue to
state and local governments under both alternatives.

4.16.2.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action alternative it is assumed that drilling activities would cease upon issuance of a ROD
for the EIS. The termination of drilling within the CD-C project area would result in a reduction of traffic
on area highways and roadways; during 2009 an estimated AADT of 726 was associated with drilling and
completion activities within the project area. Production activities for existing wells would continue under
the No Action alternative; it is estimated that an AADT of 798 was associated with production activities
within the project area during 2009. Production-related AADT would be somewhat higher initially to
account for additional wells drilled prior to the issuance of a ROD, but begin to decline thereafter as
produced water and liquids volumes decline and wells come off-line as the field matures.
The reduction in traffic associated with the No Action alternative would result in substantially lower wear
and tear on area highways and on county, BLM, and private roads as compared to any of the action
alternatives. Conversely, state and county governments would receive substantially fewer revenues to
perform road maintenance activities. Given the substantially lower volumes of traffic, the potential for
project-related accidents would be substantially lower under the No Action alterative.

alternatives.

AADT, all action alternatives

Each action alternative would result in increases in traffic associated with drilling and production
activities. Based on the assumptions associated with each alternative, the pattern of traffic increases
would be similar for all alternatives. Differences in the magnitude of traffic increases on affected
highways and roads would result from differences in the ratio of directional wells drilled on multi-well
pads to wells drilled horizontally on single-well pads. Additionally, the pace of drilling would be a factor
under Alternative D.
In addition to the traffic associated with drilling and production, each action alternative would result in
similar temporary increases in AADT on federal and state highways resulting from construction of
ancillary facilities such as compressor sites, a central pipeline compression facility, two or more central
gas-processing/stabilization facilities, and a high-pressure gas line.
All action alternatives would accelerate highway maintenance requirements on county, BLM, and private
roads. The timing and level of improvements and maintenance requirements would be driven by the
magnitude of traffic increases on specific highways and roads.
All action alternatives would generate similar amounts of revenue that could be used to fund highway and
road-maintenance needs.
Highway and road-maintenance requirements would be substantially less under the No Action alternative
than under any action alternative. The amount of production-related tax and royalty revenues to fund
maintenance requirements would correspondingly decrease as production diminishes and wells cease
production at a more rapid pace than under the action alternatives.
4.16.4 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Most unavoidable adverse transportation impacts of the Proposed Action and alternatives are associated
with increases in the number of vehicle trips on the network of roads and highways in the project area and

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-203

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—TRANSPORTATION

the consequent need to manage and maintain that network. An important component for reduction of
those impacts for all action alternatives would be continued active participation in the CD-C TP and TPC
process. For all alternatives, the substantial increase in industrial traffic would require a sustained and
coordinated transportation-planning and road-maintenance effort. For Alternative E, No Action, roadabandonment and reclamation planning would be required sooner than under the action alternatives.

4.17

NOISE

4.17.1 Introduction
Noise anticipated from the Proposed Action and all alternatives would include that which currently occurs
within the CD-C project area as a result of gas-compression stations, livestock grazing operations, wind,
well-workover operations, and traffic along area access roads, state highways, and I-80. Additional noise
would be generated by well site and access road construction, drilling and completion, pipeline
construction, and surface-disturbing reclamation operations. Frequent strong winds would add to ambient
noise levels. The EPA guideline of 55 decibels (dBA) represents a level at which an activity would have
no effect on receptors in the environment; the sounds would not be noticeable to the human ear. Emerging
research relative to the impact of noise on wildlife, specifically greater sage-grouse and mountain plover,
indicates this level of noise or the 49-dBA level (10 dBA over background) commonly found in BLM
documents may not be sufficiently protective (Blickley and Patricelli undated, Blickley and Patricelli
2010). The Rawlins RMP does not contain specific noise limitations or reduction/mitigation
requirements; rather, the RMP manages noise impacts through performance-based project design or
mitigation. In Appendix 15 to the RMP (Best Management Practices) there is a general statement
requesting consideration of “noise reduction techniques and designs” to benefit wildlife in general and the
greater sage-grouse in particular.
Blickley and Patricelli (2010) express concern that, “Other acute impacts of noise, such as masking and
behavioral disruption, occur over a much larger area. Masking occurs when the perception of a sound is
affected by the presence of background noise, with high levels of background noise decreasing the
perception of a sound. One possible consequence of masking is a decrease in the efficacy of acoustic
communication. Many animals use acoustic signals to attract and retain mates, settle territorial disputes,
promote social bonding, and alert other individuals to predators. Disruption of communication can,
therefore, have dramatic impacts on survival and reproduction,” and “In addition to the acute effects of
noise, animals may suffer chronic effects, including elevated stress levels and associated physiological
responses. Over the short term, chronic stress can result in elevated heart rate. Longer-term stress can be
associated with the ability to resist disease, survive, and successfully reproduce.”
Appendix 16 of the Rawlins RMP (Mountain Plover Guidelines) provides for operations setbacks from
identified nesting habitat, as follows: “To protect the identified mountain plover-occupied habitat, the
proposed facility will be moved one-half mile from the identified occupied habitat.” Blickley and
Patricelli (2010) found through their research of selected compressor stations in the Powder River Basin
that “stipulations limiting the development of compressor stations within ½ mile of nesting sites are likely
to prevent masking of the mountain plover vocalizations analyzed.”
Refer to Wildlife (Section 4.8) and Special Status Species (Section 4.9) for evaluations of the
performance standards and their effectiveness relative to the project area.
4.17.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) does not provide management objectives specific to noise. The
following criterion was used to assess the significance of noise impacts related to this project:

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—NOISE

1. Long-term activities that would exceed the federal 55-dBA maximum guideline for noise at either
human- or animal-sensitive locations.
Impact significance criteria for noise relative to wildlife and special status species can be found in
Sections 4.8 and 4.9, respectively.
4.17.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
4.17.3.1 Proposed Action

Direct impacts of the Proposed Action would include increased noise levels from the drilling, completion,
and production of an additional 8,950 wells, of which 500 may be CBNG. Operators anticipate drilling up
to 600 wells per year with up to 25 rigs running at any one time for up to 15 years; 42 percent of the wells
could be directionally drilled. Related activities would include construction of associated infrastructure
including access roads, power lines, and gas/water/condensate pipelines, as well as the reclamation of
disturbed areas.
Construction and drilling operations would take place at each well site resulting in an increase in noise
when compared to the natural background condition of 30 to 50 dBA. Construction, drilling, and
completion activities related to the drilling of conventional wells may last from 30 to 60 days. Wells
drilled directionally may take slightly longer to drill and complete compared to vertical conventional
wells. Directional wells may also require a larger rig with larger engines. Directional pad drilling usually
involves several wells drilled from the same location, lengthening the period of disturbance per location.
If 3,760 wells were drilled directionally, the greater number of days needed for drilling and completion
activities would increase well-development noise/activity substantially, compared to vertical drilling.
However, directional drilling would result in fewer well pads and access roads being built in the project
area and would require a reduced number of rigs to accomplish the development within the estimated 10to 15-year period. Fewer semi-truck loads of equipment would be brought to each site, resulting in
reduced overall traffic noise. The shallower CBNG wells are expected to take up to 20 days for drilling
and completion.
Equipment and operational noise would be generated during these activities from a variety of sources
including engines, equipment impact, and well-flaring. The large rigs used for drilling conventional wells
are significantly louder than the lower-horsepower (hp) rated small drilling rigs used for developing
CBNG. It has been determined that drilling and flaring operations produce the loudest project-related
noise. In the Jonah field, noise from drilling operations was measured as 77.5 dBA onsite and 50.1 dBA
at 0.25 miles (BLM 2006b). Based on this information, drilling operations should not exceed the
significance threshold for impacting sage-grouse leks—a sensitive receptor—as long as the lek and nest
protection buffers are observed. This is consistent with the findings of the 2009 PAPA Noise Study (KC
Harvey 2009) which evaluated noise at various lek sites within the natural gas field. Flaring operations at
the Jonah field were measured at 97.9 dBA on site and 66.3 dBA at 0.25 miles. The use of flowback
separators decreased flaring noise to 63.7 dBA on site. Holloran (2005) suggests that heavily traveled
main haul-roads located within 3 miles of greater sage-grouse leks may negatively impact male lek
attendance. While Holloran (2005) does not provide information regarding the vehicle type(s), anecdotal
information (Holloran pers. com. 2003) indicated a steady stream of large diesel semi-rigs such as water
and fuel tankers, completion equipment haul trucks, and drilling equipment as the traffic generating noise
and disturbance impacts to sage-grouse. Directional pad drilling would result in locally more intense
noise generation but would result in fewer well pads and access roads being built in the project area. In
addition, directional pad drilling would result in fewer total semi-truck loads of equipment going into the
field over the life of the project.
During the production phase of field operations, noise sources are generally less intense or of very short
duration. These activities include occasional well workovers, routine site visitation by company personnel
(“pumpers” and technicians) and road-maintenance equipment. Produced-water and condensate hauling,

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-205

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—NOISE

compressor stations, and well-site compression are generally louder and frequent or continual sources of
noise.
Vehicle traffic associated with production is typically limited to pickup trucks and occasional workover
rigs. Wells producing water and condensate are regularly visited by haul tanker trucks, which transport
these fluids to disposal facilities and sales points unless connected to gathering pipeline systems. In the
absence of gathering systems, the greater the volume of fluid produced, the more frequent the tanker
visits.
Noise resulting from compressor stations or well-site compression would continue for as long as gas
production, gathering, and transmission occur within the field or from a particular well. The number, size,
and location of field compressors would change over the life of the field depending on the volume of gas
produced, the size of the lines, and the volume and pressure of gas within the major transmission lines.
Project Operators anticipate the need for 10 additional compressor stations in the project area including
one large central pipeline compression facility. Operators also anticipate the need to enlarge some of the
existing compression infrastructure.
The need for well-site compression is dependent on the characteristics of the specific well and gas-line
pressures. An unknown number of wells would likely require well-site compression for some period of
time during the life of the project. Well-site compression typically uses 125- to 200-hp two-stage
compressors.
Two or more central gas-processing/stabilization plants would also be required within the project area.
The specifics of these anticipated facilities have not been determined and would be evaluated on a caseby-case basis by the BLM.
Existing operations within the project area generate noise levels as indicated in Table 4.17-1. Operations
that may result from the Proposed Action are expected to generate noise at the same level at a larger
number of sources for the life of the project.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—NOISE

Relative to the production life of a well, the construction, drilling, and completion phases of operations
are short-term events lasting up to 60 days. However, when considered over the life of the Proposed
Action, the increased noise levels resulting from drilling and completion activities at multiple sites within
the project area would continue for up to 15 years, until the resource is fully developed. In addition to the
noise related to field-development activities, noise could be expected from the continued production and
maintenance of existing wells within the project area. Noise levels in the project area would also continue
to be influenced as they are now by weather, occasional vehicle traffic, and aircraft overflights.
At various times and at specific locations within the project area, noise levels associated with drilling,
field-development, and operations activities would temporarily exceed the EPA-established baseline noise
levels of 39 dBA for a “Farm in Valley” and the EPA-established threshold of 55 dBA, averaged over 24
hours. Noise generated from these activities can be of an intensity and frequency that causes harm to
human receptors. Field-development and production-related noise impacts would affect site workers who
are subject to state and federal Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) standards. OSHA mitigation
standards for noise limits exposure as follows: an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 dBA or a dose of
50 percent are referred to as OSHA action levels [29 CFR 1910.95(c)(2)]. Occupational exposure to noise
levels in excess of 85 dBA requires monitoring and mitigation, preferably by engineering means, to
protect workers. Offsite worker impacts would be limited due to the lack of residential occupation and
concentrated recreational activity within the development area. The small towns within the project area
are generally located along I-80 and would continue to be impacted by the general noise of human
activity, the vehicle and traffic noise generated along the interstate, and train movement along the
railroad. Scattered, transitory activities such as livestock operations and recreation including hunting may
be exposed to noise as they move past development activities and operating equipment. Temporary
worker housing (man camps) located within the project area may be affected by noise generated by fielddevelopment activities but these impacts would generally be associated with specific operations and of
limited duration. Noise can also modify animal behavior and habitat-use patterns such as the use of
critical winter habitats or sage-grouse leks.
Operational noise would be lessened with the implementation of remote telemetry, which can
significantly reduce the number of site visits needed by operations personnel. A survey conducted in the
Moxa field area (BLM 2007e) found that the use of telemetry (remote monitoring of wells) could reduce
field visits by 50 percent. The use of electricity or natural gas as a fuel for onsite power generation, as
opposed to the use of diesel fuel, also reduces noise levels. There would be situations when noisemitigation opportunities are limited by operational and engineering constraints. For example, CBNG
production might be operated using diesel generators until water is removed and gas volumes are
adequate to power pumping equipment. Natural gas wells may require artificial lift systems to facilitate
production resulting in the need to use gas-lift, plunger-lift, down-hole pump, or other technology. This
could include rod pumps or other noise-generating mechanisms. Depending on the fluid volumes
produced, the installation of produced-water and condensate-gathering systems to transport these fluids to
centralized facilities for disposal or sale could substantially reduce production-related noise compared to
tanker-truck transportation.
Noise from field-development and production activities can also be dampened or reduced with the use of
mechanical muffler systems; the use of vegetative, constructed, or topographic screening; distance; and
consideration of the direction of the noise source from the receptor. These methods serve to lessen the
impact of noise on workers, residences, and sensitive wildlife species. Noise is also affected by
environmental factors such as humidity, wind direction and speed, and air density. Consideration of the
prevailing wind direction when siting noise-generating operations also serves to lessen the impact of noise
on sensitive receptors.
Indirect impacts of the Proposed Action include the continued production of the existing federal, fee, and
state wells in the project area and the continuation of compression required to transport the gas produced
in the field. Noise-control devices already in place would continue to provide mitigation. Directional

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—NOISE

drilling of 3,760 wells would require an increase in the number of rigs needed to complete development
within the proposed 10- to 15-year period due to the additional number of days needed for drilling and
completion activities per well; alternatively, the time needed for completion of the project would be
extended appreciably.
4.17.3.2 Alternative A―100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Overall noise generated as a result of drilling 100 percent of the project wells vertically, as opposed to the
Proposed Action, which includes drilling 42 percent or 3,760 of the wells directionally, would not change
the analysis of impacts when compared to the Proposed Action. The number of days needed for drilling
and completion of individual wells may be slightly less for vertical wells when compared to directional
wells and result in an overall reduction in the number of days of drilling and completion noise generated
during development of the project.
Construction, drilling, and completion activities related to the drilling of vertical conventional wells may
last from 30 to 60 days. If it takes an additional week (7 days) to drill a well directionally, then the total
number of days affected by drilling and completion noise would decline substantially under this
alternative. However, 100-percent vertical wells would also require 42 percent more rig moves and the
associated noise from rig moves within the field, when compared to the Proposed Action. In addition, the
number of well completion semi-truck trips may also increase as a result of this alternative.
Directional wells may also require a larger rig with larger engines, which may operate at higher decibel
and frequency levels when compared to the rigs needed to drill vertically. The noise level, frequency of
noise generation, or distance from which noise from larger engines is perceived may decline under
Alternative A.
4.17.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Design features of Alternative B, as detailed in Chapter 2, would serve to reduce noise in sensitive
environments. For example, (1) clustered development would concentrate noisy activities rather than
having noise sources dispersed across the project area, (2) use of noise-reduction technology would
prevent noise exceeding 49 dBA measured at 30 feet from the source at all drilling, production, and
compressor sites, (3) pipeline transportation of produced liquids would reduce semi/haul truck traffic and
associated noise, and (4) remote well-monitoring would also reduce daily traffic near sage-grouse leks
and in crucial big game habitats. Enhanced seasonal restrictions on surface-disturbing or disruptive
activities within buffers associated with sage-grouse leks, mountain plover nesting habitat, and
ferruginous hawk nests would reduce noise impacts on these sensitive species.
4.17.3.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low Density Development Areas

Implementation of Alternative C could result in areas with concentrated development activity as well as
areas of more dispersed operations. It is likely that development noise levels within the high-density areas
would be greater than those found in the low-density development areas. The Surface Disturbance Cap
approach could slow the pace of development, especially in the high-density development areas, to the
point that elevated development noise levels were extended in time compared to the Proposed Action.
4.17.3.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Alternative D would likely result in an extension of the period of time over which a sensitive receptor is
impacted by drilling noise. The engine size required for directional drilling would be larger and may
result in a higher, or more noticeable, level of noise impacting a sensitive receptor. Noise resulting from
completion activities and flaring would also be extended over a longer period of time at any one drilling
site. These extended and possibly enhanced noise levels could result in a greater frequency of
displacement by sensitive receptors.

4-208

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—NOISE

4.17.3.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action alternative the noise generated by currently authorized and approved development
and production operations would continue. No new noise sources would be produced.
4.17.4 Impact Summary
The Proposed Action (8,950 wells, of which an estimated 3,760 could be directional) may result in an
increase in the number of rigs running annually in order to accomplish the goal of completion of resource
development in 15 years when compared to Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling. Noise impacts
would differ somewhat among the alternatives with noise sources potentially being more dispersed across
the landscape under the disturbance cap alternative (Alternative C) or extended over time.
The duration of noise-generating activity and dispersal of noise-generating equipment across the project
area would be greatest under the Proposed Action. Directional wells are considered in the Proposed
Action and Alternatives B, C, and D. Directional drilling may require a larger rig with larger engines,
which may operate at higher decibel and lower frequency levels when compared to the rigs needed to drill
vertically. The noise level, frequency of noise generation, or distance from which noise from larger
engines is perceived may decline under Alternative A. Alternative D (Directional Drilling), while these
rigs are a more intensive noise source, would result in an overall reduction in well pads and roads built
and provide only localized areas of noise.
Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling, would result in the greatest number of generation sources.
The number of days needed for drilling and completion of individual wells may be slightly less for
vertical wells when compared to directional wells and result in an overall reduction in the days of drilling
and completion noise generated in the development of the project. The time savings realized from vertical
drilling could be negated by the amount of time it takes for a rig move; furthermore, the noise reductions
realized from Alternative B could be negated by the noise of semi/haul trucks moving drilling rigs. The
greatest difference between the Proposed Action and Alternative A could possibly be reduction in the
low-frequency noise generated by the bigger engines on directional rigs.
Design features of Alternative B, as detailed in Chapter 2, would serve to reduce noise in sensitive
environments.
4.17.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Under the Proposed Action and all alternatives, construction, drilling, and flaring activities would
generate onsite noise levels exceeding the EPA-established maximum of 55 dBA. In addition, haul trucks
and other construction traffic would generate transitory noise exceeding the federal maximum. In general,
these would be short-term events lasting up to 20 days for directional wells and up to 60 days for
conventional wells. However, when considered over the life of the Proposed Action, the increased noise
levels resulting from drilling and completion activities at multiple sites within the project area would
continue for up to 15 years, until the resource is fully developed. Over the life of the project, compressor
stations and well-site compression would generally be louder and frequent or continual sources of noise.
However, full and successful implementation of the required mitigation measures as set forth in the
Rawlins RMP and CD-C required Conditions of Approval and BMPs (Appendix C) would ensure that
the significance criterion is not exceeded.
In Appendix 15 of the RMP (Best Management Practices) there is a general statement requesting
consideration of “noise reduction techniques and designs” to benefit wildlife in general and the greater
sage-grouse in particular. Implementation of mitigation measures should be considered on a site-specific
basis. The following additional mitigation measures would also be considered:


Dampen or reduce noise from field-development and production activities with the use of
mechanical mufflers, vegetative or constructed screening, and direction from receptor, topography,

or distance. Noise is also affected by environmental factors such as humidity, wind direction and
speed, and air density.
Consider the prevailing wind direction when siting noise-generating operations to lessen the impact
of noise on sensitive receptors.
Use flowback separators within 0.25 mile of sensitive receptors.
Reduce semi/haul truck traffic with the installation of gathering pipelines for produced water and
condensate.
Install remote well-site monitoring to reduce light-truck traffic.
Modify or enclose compressors to minimize or eliminate loud, continuous noise during greater sagegrouse strutting periods from March 1 through May 20 each year within 0.25 mile of strutting
grounds.
Avoid noise-generating activities from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. within 2 miles of strutting grounds.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

4.18

MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT
RANGE RESOURCES

4.18.1 Introduction
The CD-C project area includes lands that are located within 47 grazing allotments (described in Section
3.18). In many cases, the boundaries of these allotments extend beyond the boundaries of the CD-C
project area. Under all alternatives, cattle and sheep grazing would continue throughout the duration of
the project. Impacts to rangeland resources would result with implementation of all alternatives. Impacts
would be the greatest during the natural gas project development phase but would occur throughout the
life of the project, due to vegetation and soil disturbance associated with construction activities,
reclamation, weed-control, and road construction and use (e.g., fugitive dust and animal collisions).
4.18.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) includes the following management objectives for livestock grazing:
1. Maintain, restore, and enhance livestock grazing to meet Wyoming Standards for Healthy
Rangelands (RMP Appendix 8) and achieve allotment objectives.
2. Encourage grazing permittees and the interested public to participate with BLM to monitor and
evaluate rangeland health to determine appropriate management actions.
3. Utilize livestock grazing management techniques (RMP Appendix 19) to maintain vegetation
communities and ecosystem functions, in consultation and coordination with the grazing permittees
and with participation by the interested public. Utilize data collected from scientifically based
inventory and monitoring techniques to support decisions that authorize livestock grazing levels and
management.
4. When feasible and providing Wyoming Standards for Healthy Rangelands are met, maintain and/or
increase animal unit month (AUM) levels in the RMP project area for livestock grazing.
5. Identify opportunities and implement range and vegetation improvement projects to sustain and
enhance livestock grazing and meet Wyoming Standards for Healthy Rangelands in cooperation,
consultation, and coordination with the grazing permittees and the interested public (Appendix 19).
6. Mitigate direct, indirect, and cumulative livestock forage losses and impacts to livestock grazing
(including impacts on livestock grazing operational capabilities and production performance) where
opportunities exist.
Impacts to rangeland resources would be considered significant if:
1. Resource management actions result in greater than 10 percent permanent reduction in AUMs
available for livestock grazing within a given allotment,
2. Resource management actions reduce or eliminate the opportunity to run the livestock of choice,
3. Wyoming BLM Standards for Healthy Rangelands are not met, or
4. Vegetation significance criteria are exceeded (Section 4.6.2).
4.18.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
Impacts to livestock and grazing resources would occur under the Proposed Action and all action
alternatives on all lands in the project area, as well as on private and state lands under the No Action
Alternative. The impacts would include those caused by a reduction of total available forage, road
construction and maintenance, well pad construction, pipeline construction, improperly fenced open pits,

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-211

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

vehicle traffic, fugitive dust creation, accidental spills of hazardous or other materials, and creation of
habitats conducive to invasive weed infestations.
The primary impact to grazing resources would be loss of available forage as a result of construction and
production-related disturbances. Available forage would be reduced during drilling and field development
and would be partially reclaimed as soon as feasible under direction of the current BLM reclamation
guidelines and recommendations (Appendix E). A long-term loss of forage would occur under all
alternatives by construction of roads, drill pads, and ancillary facilities that remain in place throughout the
life of the project. In addition, in areas where vegetation resources have been enhanced, disturbance
would not only reduce quality and quantity of diverse vegetation but would also result in wasted
investments by the BLM and permittees (for example, tebuthiuron [Spike 20PTM] treatments).
While new roads, pipelines, and well pad construction produce adverse impacts such as removing
available forage, the construction of new roads could provide beneficial impacts for livestock permittees
from improved access to remote facilities and grazing areas. However, increased access could produce an
increased disturbance to livestock, an increased number of undesignated roads/trails, and increased
distribution problems associated with unclosed cattle gates and/or cut fences. Vehicles would also present
a potential collision hazard to livestock, especially during the calving/lambing season and at night.
For all of the alternatives, fugitive dust caused by vehicles traveling along proposed new roads, existing
roads, and other areas of surface disturbance could settle on vegetation used as forage, especially
alongside roadway corridors with heavy traffic. This dust would affect the quality and regenerative
capacity of roadside grasses and forbs as well as decrease the palatability of the forage for
livestock/wildlife use and potentially increase operating costs through increased livestock medical
expenses (see Section 3.6.3). The graveling of roads reduces dust in the short term, but the scoria
commonly used breaks down faster than other gravels and, in the long term, fugitive scoria dust covers
the vegetation. Livestock forage would also be impacted should any spills of fuels, solvents, or drilling
fluids occur.
Areas of disturbed soil would lead to the spread of invasive plant species. These species would reduce
rangeland and forage values by replacing preferred forage species, leading to a reduction in grazing
capacity. Without proper management and control, invasive plant species may become established and
cause wide-spread infestations. Additionally, some invasive species such as halogeton, black henbane,
and houndstongue are poisonous to livestock and can kill or impair them if ingested.
Livestock management concerns with development of natural gas resources on public lands in the CD-C
project area include reclamation success, rangeland improvement functionality, dust from roads, and
livestock losses. In general, adequate reclamation efforts within the project area have been hampered by
inadequate reclamation techniques and extended drought conditions. Invasive weed control has been
sporadic and random in implementation, which results in a threat to maintaining Wyoming BLM
Standards for Healthy Rangelands and watershed health.
Cattle guards and gates are often damaged by overweight/over-width loads, leading to added maintenance
and unwanted mixing of livestock. Numerous instances of gates being left open or fences cut for pipelines
that have not been closed or repaired adequately have been recorded. This has led to mixing of livestock
and additional time for herding. In large allotments, this may involve up to a week of additional time and
expense for the livestock operator.
Improving roads leads people to drive faster, which has increased the incidences of young lambs, calves,
and even full-grown animals being hit and killed or maimed.
4.18.3.1 Proposed Action

Under the Proposed Action (Section 2.2.1), approximately 8,950 new natural gas wells and the
construction of required ancillary facilities would be anticipated over the course of the 15-year

4-212

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

development phase within the CD-C project area. It is assumed that 42 percent of the wells (3,765) would
be drilled from directional drilling pads. Over the development phase, the Proposed Action is estimated to
initially disturb a total of 47,200 surface acres (Table 4.0-1). This total represents an initial forage loss
equivalent to approximately 5,488 AUMs, based upon an allotment-wide average of about 8.6 acres per
AUM stocking ratio. During the projected 45- to 55-year life of the project, the initial 47,200 acres of
disturbance would be reduced to about 18,861 acres resulting in a long-term forage loss equivalent to
about 2,193 AUMs.
In addition to the 47,200 acres initially disturbed by implementation of the Proposed Action, an estimated
initial total of 60,176 historic disturbance acres already exist within the project area (Table 4.0-1). The
existence of 60,176 initial historic disturbance acres added to Proposed Action disturbance acreage would
result in a grand total of 107,376 initial disturbance acres or about 10 percent of the total land surface of
the project area. During the projected 45- to 55-year life of the project, the overall disturbance would be
reduced to about 36,524 acres, or about 3.4 percent of the total land surface in the project area with
successful reclamation on all disturbed acres. The driving factors for attaining pre-disturbance conditions
would mainly depend upon time to achieve successful reclamation, future land uses, and future climatic
conditions. This would hold true for the reclamation of herbaceous species, but not for native shrub
establishment, especially in the more xeric portions of the project area where Wyoming big sagebrush and
Gardner’s saltbush are the primary land cover types on approximately 590,272 acres, which represents
about 55.1 percent of the project’s total land surface area (Table 3.6-1).
The first impact significance criterion described in Section 4.18.2 says that impacts to rangeland
resources would be considered significant if they were to result in a permanent reduction in AUMs
available for livestock grazing within an allotment that was greater than 10 percent. Such a reduction
would be a decision made by BLM on a case-by-case basis after a thorough examination of an allotment’s
historic and ongoing forage availability. Ultimately the decision would be based on the long-term loss of
available forage within the allotment. While this analysis cannot say how much disturbance each
allotment would receive as a result of the CD-C project and to what extent that would translate to a longterm loss of available forage, it is possible to estimate which allotments may be at a greater risk of longterm loss of forage in excess of 10 percent. According to Table 3.18-2, the Echo Springs and North
LaClede allotments have already had historic initial surface disturbance in excess of 9 percent. Nine other
allotments have had historic disturbance in excess of 5 percent but less than 9 percent. Assuming some
degree of successful reclamation and a return to pre-disturbance vegetative conditions, none of these
allotments may currently be near the 10 percent significance threshold, as the long-term disturbance
figures in Table 3.18-2 would indicate. However, the surface disturbance associated with the Proposed
Action—47,200 acres—could bring total initial disturbance to almost 10 percent of the overall project
area. If previously disturbed areas are not being returned to pre-disturbance vegetative conditions, then
the allotments described in the preceding sentences—and others—could be at risk of long-term forage
reductions in excess of 10 percent.
Indirect impacts to vegetation due to dust from unpaved roads would be variable throughout the project
area, depending upon the primary factors cited in Section 3.6.3. In addition to the primary factors that
generate dust on unpaved roads, the amount and timing of precipitation events—especially in the hotter
and drier summer season—could play an important role in the amount of dust generated. Wind speed and
prevailing direction in relation to the horizontal azimuth of the road would be important secondary
factors, especially with north/south-oriented roads such as Sweetwater County Road (SWCR) 23 which
extends from Wamsutter to the north boundary of the project area. The poor palatability of dust-covered
vegetation could cause animals to concentrate in dust-free locations, leading to over-utilization and
lowered plant productivity/cover in these areas. Increased dust may also affect animal health. These
impacts could include reduced weight gains or required lowering of stocking rates in affected allotments.
The Proposed Action could result in impacts to livestock operations as a result of increased death loss,
unusable forage due to dust, declining rangeland health and forage productivity, and disruptions to

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-213

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

livestock-management actions. Suggestions for voluntary coordination may or may not be implemented
and death loss of young animals and disruptions to livestock-management actions would still be likely to
occur. Existing standards and mitigations may not adequately address issues with dust and road
alterations to overland hydrology. Therefore, reduction in forage palatability from dust and declining
rangeland health and productivity due to accelerated erosion from roads could still occur.
The Proposed Action would result in increased traffic and increased speeds on the improved roads within
the CD-C project area, particularly during the drilling and field-development phase. The potential for
livestock/vehicle collisions would be increased, especially during the calving/lambing season and during
nighttime hours. Roads on moderate to steep slopes that result in long-term changes to overland
hydrology and desertification impacts below these locations would also lead to lower weight gains or
require reduced stocking rates. New and improved access roads could, however, improve livestock
operations by improving access for viewing the allotment, facilities, and animals; for doctoring sick
animals; and for transporting animals in or out of an allotment.
The potential exists for disruptions to livestock management. Traffic along roads that pass through
shipping pastures or by corrals when in use may interrupt or complicate this work, extending the time and
increasing the cost to complete it. Herding of animals through areas being developed or moving around
them would increase the complexity and time to accomplish these tasks. In some allotments, management
flexibility may be sacrificed to avoid or to minimize these types of impacts.
There is also potential for damage to range improvements from the movement of heavy trucks, drilling
equipment, and heavy construction equipment.
Disturbance of soils and increased vehicle activity would increase the potential for introduction,
establishment, and spread of undesirable non-native weedy species. This can reduce forage palatability
and animal weight gains, in addition to affecting trail routes and animal health, particularly increasing
death loss with sheep.
4.18.3.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

Alternative A (Section 2.2.2) is similar to the Proposed Action except this alternative assumes that no
wells would be drilled using directional drilling rigs. Impacts to the range resource resulting from
implementation of Alternative A would be similar to the Proposed Action with the exception that the total
amount of initial disturbed area would increase from 47,200 acres to 61,696 acres, a 31-percent increase;
the total long-term disturbed area following successful reclamation would increase from 18,861 acres to
24,133 acres.
Under Alternative A, the rangeland forage resource on the 47 CD-C grazing allotments would initially be
reduced by the forage equivalent of approximately 7,174 AUMs (1,686 more AUMs than the Proposed
Action). Assuming successful reclamation occurs, the long-term forage loss equivalent under Alternative
A would be about 2,806 AUMs for the 47 allotments versus 613 more AUMs than the Proposed Action.
The greatly increased disturbance acreage under this alternative would make it more likely that an
allotment would approach or exceed the 10-percent significance criterion. The 61,696 acres of new
disturbance amounts to a 110-percent addition to historic disturbance. If historic development patterns
were to continue, some allotments, including the eleven that have historic disturbance in excess of 5
percent, could be nearing the criterion percentage even if reclamation efforts were successful.
The greater amount of construction activities, increased soil-surface disturbance, and higher traffic
volumes associated with Alternative A would likely increase the potential for introduction and spread of
invasive weed species, as well as increasing the total fugitive dust load within the project area.

4-214

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

4.18.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

Alternative B (Section 2.2.3) was developed to prevent significant impacts to the range and other
resources by implementing protections and mitigations beyond those normally applied. Alternative B also
recognizes that development may be more intensive than currently expected and may result in impacts to
vegetation communities faster than anticipated. This alternative would combine a prescriptive and
adaptive management approach, which includes assessing the specific issue, designing and implementing
a response, monitoring and evaluating results, and adjusting the management response when needed on a
case-by-case basis.
The enhanced resource protections for the livestock resource would go into effect immediately and be
applied to all future APDs. They include mitigation of impacts on livestock water features, annual
meetings conducted by the BLM with natural gas Operators and grazing permittees to discuss projectspecific impacts, notification of the affected grazing permittees when drilling is to take place within their
allotment, thorough power-washing of all field vehicles associated with natural gas operations, and
control of fugitive dust on well sites, pipelines, and access roads.
Surface-disturbance thresholds would trigger further mitigation activities. If surface disturbance were to
reach 5 percent of an allotment, a review of reclamation success in the allotment would take place and
planning for further development, including potential range improvement projects, would take place. If
the amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance were to reach 8 percent, the BLM would require that
mitigation be implemented to avoid reaching the significance level of a permanent 10-percent loss of
vegetation.
Under Alternative B, the initial disturbance would be 45,516 acres (a decrease of 1,684 acres compared to
the Proposed Action) resulting in an initial forage loss equivalent to approximately 5,293 AUMs (195
fewer AUMs than the Proposed Action). Assuming successful reclamation efforts, the long-term
disturbance area would decrease to 18,249 acres (a decrease of 612 acres compared to the Proposed
Action) resulting in a long-term forage loss equivalent of about 2,122 AUMs (71 fewer AUMs than the
Proposed Action).
The decreased surface disturbance under this alternative would make it less likely that an allotment would
approach or exceed the 10-percent significance criterion. More importantly however, the two thresholds
would assure that timely intervention took place before the 10-percent significance threshold was
approached.
The reduction in the amount of construction activities, reduced soil-surface disturbance, and diminished
traffic volumes associated with Alternative B would decrease the potential for introduction and spread of
invasive weed species, as well as decreasing the total fugitive dust load within the project area.
4.18.3.4 Alternative C: Cap on Surface Disturbance, 60 Acres and 30 Acres per Section

Under Alternative C (Section 2.2.4), the types of impacts to the range resource would be similar to those
described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.18.3.1). For this alternative, the scope and intensity of the
impacts would be less widespread because of the surface cap restrictions. Under Alternative C, the
maximum initial disturbance would be 42,955 acres (a decrease of 4,245 acres compared to the Proposed
Action) resulting in an initial forage loss equivalent to approximately 4,995 AUMs (493 fewer AUMs
than the Proposed Action). Assuming successful reclamation efforts, the long-term disturbance area
would decrease to 17,318 acres (a decrease of 1,543 acres compared to the Proposed Action) resulting in
a long-term forage loss equivalent of about 2,014 AUMs (179 fewer AUMs than the Proposed Action).
With this alternative there would be fewer well locations developed. Therefore, fewer access roads would
be developed and habitat fragmentation would be less extensive than for the Proposed Action. The
impacts to the range resource associated with implementation of Alternative C would be similar in nature,

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-215

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

but somewhat less in magnitude, compared to impacts associated with the Proposed Action (Section
4.6.3.1).
The reduced surface disturbance under this alternative would make it less likely that an allotment would
approach or exceed the 10-percent significance criterion. The 42,955 acres of new disturbance would be a
9-percent reduction from the Proposed Action. However, this is still a substantial addition to historic
disturbance and, if previously disturbed areas are not being returned to pre-disturbance vegetative
conditions, then the 11 allotments with historic disturbance in excess of 5 percent—and others—may be
at risk of long-term forage reductions in excess of 10 percent.
On federal lands, invasive weed programs would be implemented per stipulations outlined in individual
right-of-way applications and APDs.
4.18.3.4 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

Under Alternative D (Section 2.2.5), the types of impacts to the range resource would be similar to those
described for the Proposed Action (Section 4.18.3.1) but the scope and intensity of the impacts would be
less widespread because of the expected reduction in surface disturbance. Estimated initial surface
disturbance for this alternative would be 36,449 acres, a decrease of 10,751 acres from the Proposed
Action. The forage lost initially under this alternative is estimated to be 4,238 AUMs (1,210 fewer than
the Proposed Action). The estimated 14,952 acres of long-term disturbance would be 3,908 acres less than
the Proposed Action, representing 1,739 AUMs (454 fewer AUMs than the Proposed Action).
The reduced surface disturbance under this alternative would make it less likely that an allotment would
approach or exceed the 10-percent significance criterion. The 36,449 acres of new disturbance would be a
22.8-percent reduction from the Proposed Action. However, this addition to historic disturbance could
cause the 11 allotments with historic disturbance in excess of 5 percent—and others—to be at risk of
long-term forage reductions in excess of 10 percent if previously disturbed areas are not being returned to
pre-disturbance vegetative conditions.
With this alternative there would be fewer well locations developed—an estimated 4,032 compared to the
6,126 estimated for the Proposed Action. This 35-percent reduction in well locations would likely lead to
similar reductions in the number of access roads and road miles with associated reductions in potential
collision hazard and dust accumulation on nearby forage.
4.18.3.5 Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action Alternative it is assumed that no further natural gas development would occur
within the CD-C project area and there would be no new disturbance except where APDs have been
approved by the BLM for previously authorized activities. There would consequently be no new surface
disturbance and no new impacts on rangeland. Grazing would continue to be affected by earlier habitat
alterations, by human activity in the vicinity of natural gas production facilities, by traffic in the project
area, and by diminished palatability of forage caused by dust.
4.18.4 Impact Summary
Rangeland impacts associated with the Proposed Action and Alternatives would include disturbed land
and associated loss of available forage. Other impacts include those from dust-reducing forage
palatability, impacts to livestock operations (e.g. leaving gates open, impacts to fences or range
improvements), possible increases in invasive plant species, and accidental injury or death of livestock
from vehicle collisions. Table 4.0-1 shows the anticipated surface disturbance for the alternatives
compared to the Proposed Action.
Under the Proposed Action, assuming reclamation and reseeding efforts are successful, during the
projected 45- to 55-year life of the project, the initial 47,200 acres of disturbance would be reduced to

4-216

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—RANGE RESOURCES

about 18,861 acres, resulting in a long-term loss of about 2,193 AUMs. Two allotments and possibly
more would be at risk of exceeding the RMP significance criteria of a permanent reduction in AUMs
greater than 10 percent.
Under Alternative A, the initial 61,696 acres of disturbance would be reduced to about 24,133 acres over
the life of the project, resulting in a long-term loss of about 2,806 AUMs. Allotments would be at a
greater risk of exceeding the RMP significance criteria of a permanent reduction in AUMs greater than 10
percent.
Under Alternative B, the initial 45,516 acres of disturbance would be reduced to about 18,249 acres over
the life of the project, resulting in a long-term loss of about 2,122 AUMs. Many of the impacts associated
with the Proposed Action would be reduced under this alternative (e.g. dust, controlling the spread of
invasive plants, and impacts to range improvements). The two-phase process to identify allotments which
are approaching the RMP significance criteria should reduce the risk of allotments exceeding the criteria.
The use of surface-disturbance caps under Alternative C would result in reduced surface impact. During
the life of the project, the initial 42,955 acres of disturbance would be reduced to about 17,318 acres,
resulting in a long-term loss of about 2,014 AUMs. The reduced surface disturbance under this alternative
would make it less likely that an allotment would approach or exceed the 10-percent significance criterion
but, if previously disturbed areas are not being returned to pre-disturbance vegetative conditions, then
some allotments may be at risk of long-term forage reductions in excess of 10 percent.
Under Alternative D, the initial 36,449 acres of disturbance would be reduced to about 14,952 acres over
the life of the project, resulting in a long-term loss of about 1,739 AUMs. The reduced surface
disturbance under this alternative would make it less likely that an allotment would approach or exceed
the 10-percent significance criterion but, if previously disturbed areas are not being returned to predisturbance vegetative conditions, then some allotments may be at risk of long-term forage reductions in
excess of 10 percent.
Because it is assumed that there would be no development under Alternative E, No Action, there would
be no new impacts of the type described in the Proposed Action, such as deaths of livestock and damage
to fences and other range improvements. Grazing would continue to be affected by earlier habitat
alterations, by human activity in the vicinity of natural gas production facilities, by traffic in the project
area, and by diminished palatability of forage caused by dust.
4.18.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Rangeland impacts associated with the CD-C project—a reduction in available forage, reduced forage
palatability, negative effects on livestock operations (e.g. leaving gates open, damaged fences and range
improvements), accidental injury or death of livestock from vehicle collisions—would continue
throughout the life of the project. The most effective mitigation for reduced forage is to minimize the
amount of new disturbance. Alternatives C and D would produce the least amount of new disturbance.
Impacts would be further reduced with the application of mitigation measures found in Appendix C and
the successful implementation of current BLM reclamation guidelines and recommendations described in
Appendix E. The addition of the following measures not found in Appendix C would further minimize
impacts to the range:




The Operators could, in cooperation with the applicable county, establish reasonable speed limits
within the project area, such as Carbon County has done on 20 Mile Road south of Rawlins, to
enhance personnel safety, reduce fugitive dust, and reduce potential for livestock/wildlife/wild horse
collisions
Heavy equipment exceeding the recommended gross vehicle weight would not be allowed to use
cattle guard crossings.

All gates within the project area would be left as they are found (i.e., open gates would be left open,
closed gates would be closed).
The Operators could coordinate with affected livestock operators to minimize disruption during
livestock operations, including lambing/calving season.
The BLM could require that off-road activity be minimized.
The BLM could require that no vehicle activity be allowed on recently reclaimed sites (including
pipeline rights-of-way), wetland areas, or other sensitive sites.
Sites undergoing reclamation could be signed at all possible entry sites, especially gathering
pipelines that connect several well pads. Signs should state “Authorized Vehicles Only” to allow
maintenance work on valves, for example, by responsible Operators.

Where vegetation improvement projects exist, additional acreage may be treated to replace disturbance
impacts and balance or reimburse investment costs for the permittees and BLM.

4.19

OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

4.19.1 Introduction
The Proposed Action and the action alternatives would involve recovery of natural gas resources, which
would cause a loss of reserves in the ground. The recovered natural gas would provide a needed energy
resource and would generate private and public revenues.
The occurrence and potential for occurrence of locatable and other leasable mineral resources have been
identified in the project area (Section 3.19). Although potential for development of those resources is low,
their development would not be precluded by the development of the oil and gas resource. Multiple
development of public land minerals is anticipated by regulation and the granting of oil and gas leases and
permits to develop those leases does not “preclude the issuance of other permits or leases for the same
lands for deposits of other minerals with suitable stipulations for simultaneous operation, nor the
allowance of applicable entries, locations or selections of leased lands with a reservation of the mineral
deposits to the United States.” (43 CFR 3000.7) The development of natural gas would in turn require the
development of aggregate minerals—sand, gravel, and klinker—for building materials for roads, well
pads, and other ancillary facilities.
4.19.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) prescribes the following management objectives for mineral resources:
1. Provide for exploration and development of locatable minerals, except in withdrawn areas.
2. Provide opportunities for exploration and development of conventional and unconventional oil and
gas, coal, and other leasable minerals.
3. Provide opportunities for exploration and development of salable minerals.
Impacts of the CD-C project would be considered significant if they:
1. caused a substantial reduction in leasing and development of non-oil and gas leasable minerals.
2. caused a substantial reduction in the development of locatable and salable minerals.
4.19.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
4.19.3.1 Proposed Action and All Action Alternatives

Some deposits of uranium are known to occur within the project area but no development is occurring and
none is anticipated in the foreseeable future and so no impacts are expected. The principal leasable

4-218

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—OIL & GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

minerals found in the project area are coal and natural gas. Coal seams of the Fort Union Formation, the
Lance Formation, and the Mesaverde Group are found within and adjacent to the project area but no
development is occurring and none is anticipated in the foreseeable future. The Proposed Action and
action alternatives are not expected to affect the coal resource in any way.
Development of the natural gas resource would be affected by the Proposed Action and alternatives.
Successful natural gas field development would result in the ultimate recovery of the natural gas resource
from the target formations, under economic conditions favorable to development, and would substantially
increase natural gas supply, regionally and nationally. Under the Proposed Action and all action
alternatives, recoverable natural gas reserves produced over the life of the project are estimated at 12.02
Tcf; liquid condensate is estimated at 167.3 million barrels (Section 4.14.2.2, Socioeconomics). With this
amount of production from the target formations, it is expected that the oil and natural gas resource in the
CD-C project area would have been substantially depleted, pending new technology or the discovery of
new reserves.
Development of surface mineral material deposits mined in support of CD-C development activities
would occur as a result of any of the action alternatives. Construction-grade materials such as sand, stone,
gravel, pumice, pumicite, clay, and rock are likely to be obtained from local sources. Currently permitted
sources have been identified (Map 3.19-1) and other sources are likely to be developed. The total
quantities required are not known..
4.19.3.2 Alternative E -- No Action

Under Alternative E, No Action, it is assumed that no new development would take place and no more
reserves of natural gas or liquid condensate would be produced in the CD-C project area.
4.19.4 Impact Summary
Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, the fluid mineral resources of the CD-C project
area would be developed fully—12.02 Tcf of natural gas and 167.3 million barrels of liquids— in the
context of known reserves and current extraction technologies. Under Alternative E, it is assumed that the
fluid mineral resources would not be developed. Development of surface mineral material deposits mined
in support of CD-C development activities would not occur. Deposits of coal and uranium are not
expected to be affected by the Proposed Action and the action alternatives.
4.19.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Because no unmitigated adverse impacts are expected, no additional mitigation measures would be
necessary.

4.20

HEALTH AND SAFETY

4.20.1 Introduction
Health and safety impacts associated with the action alternatives would be similar to those associated with
existing conditions in the project area. As the level of gas development increases in the area the potential
for accidents increases due to the number of vehicles, rigs, other heavy equipment, and personnel in the
area. The greatest potential for health and safety impacts includes the occupational hazards associated
with oil and gas exploration and development, and vehicular travel on improved and unimproved roads.
4.20.2 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
The Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) does not identify any specific health and safety standards or impact
significance criteria.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-219

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—HEALTH AND SAFETY

In general, health and safety effects of the action alternatives would be considered significant if they
resulted in substantially increased risk to the general public. Health and safety are regulated by state and
federal environmental and safety agencies such as the WDEQ, the EPA, OSHA, Wyoming OSHA, and
the WOGCC.
4.20.3 Direct and Indirect Impacts
4.20.3.1 Proposed Action

Direct and indirect health and safety risks arising from the Proposed Action include oil and gas
occupational hazards, the operation of vehicles on improved and unimproved roads, natural gas pipeline
operations, winter driving and working conditions, hunting-related firearms accidents, collisions with
livestock and big game, and natural hazards associated with wildfires, flash-floods or winter blizzards. A
wide variety of hazardous materials are handled and used in gas-field development and operations
activities, resulting in an increased risk of inappropriate use, disposal, or accidental release.
Health and safety impacts to the project workforce include industrial and vehicle accidents. Impacts to the
general public are generally limited to an increased risk of traffic accidents. The risk of occupational
hazards declines substantially once development activities (drilling and completion operations) are
concluded. The risk of vehicle accidents impacting the general public and the workforce may decrease
during the field-operations phase depending on the volume of produced water and condensate being
transported by truck to disposal or sale.
Hazardous materials storage/use and waste management are stringently regulated by the BLM, EPA,
WDEQ and WOGCC, and are discussed in Sections 3.21 and 4.21. The risk to human health and the
environment from these materials is limited to regulatory non-compliance situations and accidental
releases or spills.
Occupational and Public Hazards

Health and safety concerns associated with the Proposed Action would be similar to those described in
Section 3.20. Implementation of the Proposed Action would likely result in an increased risk to the
workforce due to the increased number of personnel in the field, the increase in heavy equipment use and
drilling operations, and the resultant increase in vehicle traffic. Compliance with the State of Wyoming
Department of Employment Workers Occupational Health and Safety (WOSHA) program rules and
regulations for construction and oil and gas well drilling, well servicing, and well special servicing
operations would aid in reducing project-related occupational hazards. In addition, the BLM considers
safety issues during the APD review process (Onshore Order #1) and reminds the Operator of its
occupational health and safety responsibilities in 43 CFR Ch. II, 3162.5-3. Compliance with the OSHA
standards works to reduce the opportunity for occupational injuries.
The remote nature of the project area further reduces the opportunity for development and productionrelated hazards to impact the general public. The public using state and federal highways would be
affected by increased levels of traffic, specifically semi/haul truck units related to drilling and completion
operations and produced-water and condensate-hauling activities. General public use of lease roads is
generally related to livestock activities and recreation, including hunting. Persons pursuing these activities
would be at a greater risk of collision with pick-up trucks being driven by field personnel (pumpers and
field technicians) and semi-haul trucks. Compliance with WOGCC underground power certification
regulations would reduce the opportunity for faulty electrical installations on well sites. In addition, the
extremely rural nature of the area and land-ownership patterns (the “Checkerboard”) do not encourage or
support residential development, further reducing the opportunity for the public to be affected by
underground electrical hazards and other possible hazards.

4-220

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—HEALTH AND SAFETY

Pipeline Hazards

Implementation of the Proposed Action would increase the miles of gas-gathering and transmission
pipeline installed in the project area as well as the number of natural gas compression and stabilization
facilities. Natural gas transmission and gathering pipeline operations are regulated by the federal Office of
Pipeline Safety (OPS). Operators of the gas-transmission infrastructure are required to comply with the
applicable OPS regulations including implementing stringent system maintenance programs, emergency
response planning, risk-management planning, and task specific personnel training in operations and
maintenance for each natural gas pipeline system. Compliance with the OPS program requirements
reduces the opportunity for pipeline accidents and, likewise, the risk to the general public and employees.
Other Risks and Hazards

The opportunity for accidents involving the general public and the workforce increases as the volume of
activity in the field and on the road increases. All actions required to implement the Proposed Action
would result in some increased level of risk to the general public and the workforce. Effective contractor
and personnel training, emergency-response planning, and coordination with emergency responders
should reduce the risks associated with field development and operations.
Highway and road-safety impacts related to the Proposed Action and alternatives are discussed in Section
4.16 Transportation. There are inherent risks associated with the operation of vehicles on improved and
unimproved roads. Awareness training alerts field personnel to variable road-surface conditions including
the risk of collision with the general public, livestock, and wildlife. As a result of greater access to
previously inaccessible areas, the public may also be exposed to hazardous driving conditions and
wildlife on the roads. With the exception of semi-haul trucks, the public would be exposed to these same
hazards wherever they were recreating; the hazards of backcountry recreation are not limited to the
project area.
The public would be exposed to an increased number of large vehicles on county roads and state and
federal highways resulting in a greater risk of being involved in an accident. For example, the number of
semi trucks needed to accomplish a fracking operation is substantial; when multiplied by 600 wells being
completed each year the number of additional large trucks on the roadways is also substantial. The drivers
of these commercial big-rigs are required to hold commercial driver’s licenses with special operations
endorsements and receive training prior to operating such vehicles; however, this does not preclude the
possibility of accidents.
Weather-related hazards due to winter driving and working conditions could impact the general public
and the workforce.
Natural or accidental fires also pose a risk to the workforce and the public. Adherence to the BLM
seasonal fire restrictions and the OPS pipeline regulations would reduce the opportunity of fire-related
injury and property loss. Fire as a result of natural gas development and production activity would likely
result in damage to the field equipment and the range resource. The opportunity for privately owned
structures to be involved in such incidents would be limited; very few privately owned structures exist in
the project area outside of Wamsutter.
Hunting-related firearms accidents would be a remote possibility. Site workers are generally proximal to
field infrastructure and conscientious hunters avoid shooting toward facilities. The hunting public is at
risk for such accidents regardless of where they are hunting. Operations personnel and contractors are not
allowed access to firearms when working.
Risk to the public as a direct result of development and production operations is limited. Harm caused by
extreme noise events would be limited to situations when individuals might place themselves in close
proximity to the noise-emitting operation; noise is discussed in greater detail in Sections 3.17 and 4.17.

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—HEALTH AND SAFETY

4.20.3.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

The impacts of implementing Alternative A would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action with the exception that drilling vertical wells could result in fewer days of concentrated drilling
activity per well when compared to drilling directional and pad wells and, therefore, a slightly lower risk
of occupational hazard exposure for the drilling workforce.
4.20.3.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

The impacts of implementing Alternative B would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action.
4.20.3.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low-Density Development Areas

The impacts of implementing Alternative C would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action with the exception that travel-related risks to the recreating public may be higher in high-density
development areas when compared to low-density development areas.
4.20.3.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

The impacts of implementing Alternative D would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action. The implementation of the Directional Drilling requirement could slow down development to the
extent that it reduces, somewhat, road travel risk to the public.
4.20.3.6 Alternative E: No Action

Under the No Action alternative, occupational health and safety exposure to site workers and exposure to
the public would be greatly reduced because it is assumed that no new wells would be drilled. Some
exposure would still exist with ongoing production activities.
4.20.4 Impact Summary
The Proposed Action and all action alternatives would result in similar impacts to the public and site
workers including increased risk of vehicle collisions on interstate highways and local road systems.
4.20.5 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Any increase in the volume of activity in the natural gas field required to implement the Proposed Action
and alternatives would increase the risk of accidents and injury to the workforce from project-related
activities as well as weather-related incidents, wildfires, and increased noise levels. The resulting increase
in traffic using the local transportation network would increase the risk of vehicle collisions with other
vehicles, wildlife, and livestock for the workforce as well as the general public. However, effective
contractor and personnel training, emergency-response planning, and coordination with emergency
responders should reduce the risks associated with field development and operations. The level of risk
would be highest during project development.
The operating companies and their contractors are obligated to operate in compliance with applicable
local, state, and federal regulations. The BLM recognizes these authorities and requires compliance with
the applicable regulations.
In addition to required mitigation measures as set forth in the Rawlins RMP and CD-C required
Conditions of Approval and BMPs (Appendix C), the following mitigation measure would further reduce
risks to human health and safety for the workforce and the public:

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

4.21

WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

4.21.1 Management Objectives and Impact Significance Criteria
Appendix 32 to the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) sets out objectives for the Hazard Management and
Resource Restoration Program (HMRRP), an administrative program that emphasizes management of
hazards on public lands to reduce risks to visitors and employees, restore contaminated lands, and carry
out emergency response actions. The HMRRP contains the following objectives:
1. Identify and control imminent hazards or threats to human health and/or the environment from
hazardous substance releases on public lands.
2. Promote working partnerships with states, counties, communities, other federal agencies, and the
private sector to prevent pollution and minimize hazardous waste on public lands.
3. Provide hazardous materials management training to BLM employees and educate public land users
concerning laws, rules, and standards.
4. Require potentially responsible parties to undertake response actions and to pay their fair share or
face cost recovery.
5. Encourage public collaboration in environmental decision-making.
6. Inventory, assess, and manage the cleanup of hazardous substance release sites on public lands that
present a potential risk to human health and/or the environment, and promote healthy ecosystems.
7. Ensure that solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities that might affect
public lands are properly located, designed, and constructed, consistent with the law, as well as
prohibit Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) temporary storage facilities on public
lands.
8. Reduce hazardous waste produced by BLM activities and from authorized uses of public lands
through waste minimization programs that include: recycling, reuse, substitution, and other
innovative, safe, and cost-effective methods of pollution prevention.
9. Ensure that authorized activities on public lands comply with applicable federal, state, and local
laws, regulations, policies, guidance, and procedures.
10. Ensure appropriate review of authorized activities and application of effective management controls
to correct weaknesses.
No specific waste and hazardous materials standards were identified in the Rawlins RMP; however, IM
WY-2012-007, Management of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Pits, includes several standards
for waste management from oil and gas operations. This far-reaching IM is not restricted only to issues
related to pit management. In general, waste and hazardous materials effects of the action alternatives
would be considered significant if they resulted in substantially increased risk to the public.
4.21.2 Direct and Indirect Impacts
4.21.2.1 Proposed Action

Waste Management
Waste management impacts resulting from the Proposed Action would be similar to those currently in
place in the project area. Most wastes that would be generated at project locations are exempt from
regulation by the RCRA under the oil and gas exploration and production exemption and are considered
to be solid wastes. Compliance with all applicable state and federal hazardous substance and wastemanagement regulations should minimize the threats to human health and the environment from
generated waste streams (refer to Section 3.20.1).

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

4-223

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Drilling wastes (mud and cuttings) would be generated from the drilling of each well. Fresh water/gel
drilling mud would be used and reserve pits lined when site-specific conditions dictate. Oil-based fluid
drilling would occur minimally and only in closed-loop drilling fluid systems. Reserve pit fluids (mud
and water) would be recycled as much as possible to reduce water consumption and conserve mud
products. Typically reusable fluids are transported and used to drill additional wells while the cuttings or
solids are allowed to dry in the reserve pit before being buried onsite. If used, liners would also be buried
onsite. In some situations the cuttings are solidified prior to burial, as allowed in the WOGCC regulations
and with BLM approval. On multi-well pad sites the reserve pit would be used for all wells on the pad
before being closed. Some Operators use closed-loop drilling fluids systems that reduce the need for
reserve pit capacity and facilitate more efficient recycling and reuse of mud products. Reserve-pit
management varies by Operator, contractor, and location. Commercial drilling mud-disposal facilities are
limited and are experiencing disposal capacity problems. Reserve pits are fenced on three sides during
operations and on the fourth side once the drilling rig moves off the location.
Completion/stimulation fluids recovered during flow-back and subsequent production operations would
be temporarily contained in completion, flare, or reserve pits, depending on site design and APD approval
conditions. These fluids would ultimately be disposed of at evaporation ponds or disposal wells or
evaporated onsite. Well bore construction (cement, casing, perforation, pressure testing, etc.) is designed
and authorized to preclude the opportunity for completion fluids to impact groundwater or non-target
hydrocarbon-bearing zones.
Produced water from conventional wells would continue to be managed as described in Section 3.21.1.
Produced-water injection is currently used on a limited basis in the project area. The anticipated volume
of water produced per well is relatively low at an average of 18 barrels of water per day. However, given
the number of additional wells to be drilled, the volumes anticipated are significant. The BLM considered
requiring injection of produced water as the preferred method of management; however, the Operators
have not been able to identify a reservoir that is capable of taking water at the volumes needed by the
production rates projected in the area. Thirty additional water-injection wells are planned by the
Operators to handle the anticipated volume of produced water, but injection appears to have limited
potential for use within the overall project area. Some Operators currently have water evaporation ponds,
which may need to be enlarged due to the increased volume of water produced. An additional 20
produced-water management facilities (i.e. evaporation ponds) are anticipated. Commercial waterdisposal operations may also need to enlarge their facilities, as capacity is already limited. Produced water
would be transported to off-site facilities by pipeline or truck when not managed at the well site. Produced
water of appropriate quality would be used in drilling-mud systems and completion operations; this would
reduce the volume of water to be disposed as well as the volume of fresh make-up water needed from
other sources (water wells, etc.). Other produced-water disposal and re-use options, such as sub-irrigation
drip systems, are being developed and would be considered by the BLM on a case-by-case basis. CBNG
produced-water disposal considerations are discussed below.
Avian mortality can be an issue in produced-water disposal pits due to salinity in the water and possible
hydrocarbon contamination from condensate carryover. Typically, these facilities are fenced to preclude
entry by wildlife. Flagging, netting, or other bird-deterrent devices are the most commonly used methods
for achieving compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and WOGCC regulations. Concern
continues as to the effectiveness of these deterrents; the BLM staff advocates the use of netting to
preclude or reduce avian losses.
Solid, non-hazardous wastes generated at drilling locations, man camps, and construction sites would
continue to be handled as they are currently. Non-hazardous solid wastes would be accumulated in
containers (dumpsters, trash cages, etc.) and hauled by commercial contractor to permitted disposal
facilities. Alternative WDEQ-permitted disposal sites would need to be identified as local municipal
solid-waste disposal facilities are experiencing capacity shortages and some are no longer accepting nonhousehold waste. The need to access alternative disposal sites located further from the development area

4-224

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 4—ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES—WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

results in waste being hauled longer distances at greater cost to the companies and risk to the traveling
public.
Industrial non-hazardous and/or exempt hazardous waste such as used glycol, antifreeze, lubricating oil,
and batteries are recycled through third-party permitted companies or, as in the case of used lube oils, are
legitimately recycled into crude-oil streams, when applicable and appropriate.
In the rare instance that hazardous waste is produced it would be managed as required in the RCRA
regulations. The BLM does not allow disposal of hazardous waste on federally managed lands; the
WDEQ Solid and Hazardous Waste Disposal (WDEQ SHWD) program is the appropriate regulatory
authority for these waste streams. Disposal of hazardous wastes in reserve pits is not allowed by any
agency.
Sanitary wastes would be transported by commercial contractors to permitted facilities. Alternatively,
some permanent and long-term temporary facilities (such as man camps and field offices) would have
approved septic systems in place. It can be anticipated that capacity concerns would arise relative to local
municipal sanitary-waste disposal facilities.
Commercial disposal facilities are typically located on privately owned lands and are permitted through
the WOGCC and/or WDEQ. The current and anticipated levels of development activity and the resultant
waste-disposal demand would result in a reduced design life for permitted facilities (municipal or
commercial), necessitating the enlargement of existing sites or the permitting and construction of
additional facilities.
CBNG Produced-Water Management
Coalbed natural gas (CBNG) development has different produced-water management issues when
compared to conventional gas production. The greatest of these concerns are the volume of water
produced and the quality of the water, both of which depend on the producing formation. Various
produced-water management scenarios would be considered by the BLM in project-specific NEPA
analysis if and when proposals are brought forward by CBNG proponents in the project area.
Technological advances may make it possible to separate water and gas down-hole, thereby reducing the
volume of water removed and managed on the surface. As with conventional produced water, CBNG
water may be used for drilling and completion operations, if the water quality is appropriate.
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials are used in drilling, field development, construction, completion, and production
operations. Implementation of the Proposed Action would result in the increase in hazardous materials
being transported, stored, and used in the project area. IM WY-1994-081, IM WY-1997-011 and WY-94­
059 require that NEPA documents list and describe any hazardous or extremely hazardous materials that
would be produced, used, stored, transported, or disposed of as a result of a proposed project, this
compilation can be found in Appendix K, Hazardous Materials Management Summary. The
quantities of hazardous substances used in the development or operation of wells would be kept in limited
quantities on all sites and at the production facilities as needed for operations. None of the chemicals that
would be used meet the criteria for being an extremely hazardous material/substance (40 CFR 355) or
meet the quantities criteria per IM WY-93-344. Materials would not be stockpiled at well locations.
Each Operator (and its subcontractors as applicable and appropriate) is required to comply with the
following state and federal programs which are intended to reduce risk to human health and the
environment from the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials. Implementation of the
Proposed Action would require updating these program plans. Compliance with and implementation of
the required plans would reduce the risk to human health and the environment from hazardous material
releases in the project area.

A Hazard Communications Program (Haz-Com or Worker Right-to-Know) is required by OSHA
and is intended to reduce the risk of occupational exposure to hazardous materials.
A Community Right-to-Know (the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act), required by the EPA, is intended to
provide state and local emergency responders with information regarding the material hazards,
location, and volumes of material that may be encountered when responding to an emergency.
Spill Prevention, Countermeasure, and Control Plans are required by the EPA and are intended
to preclude the release of oils, such as diesel fuel, gasoline, crude oil, or condensate, into the waters
of the United States; these plans must also provide response actions to be taken, and notifications to
be made, in the event a release occurs.
Emergency Response Plans are required by the BLM; these plans provide the BLM and operations
personnel information about actions to be taken in the event an emergency situation (accidental fire,
chemical or oil releases, well blow-out, etc.) should arise. These documents would be updated to
include increased operations resulting from implementation of the Proposed Action.

4.21.2.2 Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling

The impacts of implementing Alternative A would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action with the exception that drilling 100-percent vertical wells could result in a larger volume of
drilling fluid being used in the development of the field.
4.21.2.3 Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection

The impacts of implementing Alternative B would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action except in the defined ERP areas. In these areas, stipulations for enhanced protection could result in
concentration of buried reserve pit wastes in cluster development areas and could result in a reduction of
vehicle traffic due to the consideration of pipelines to transport produced materials (condensate, produced
water, etc.) out of the ERP area.
4.21.2.4 Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low Density Development Areas

The impacts of implementing Alternative C would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action with the exception that the low-density drilling areas could realize a reduced volume of materials
produced, transported, or disposed of in those areas of the project area compared to the high-density
development areas.
4.21.2.5 Alternative D: Directional Drilling

The impacts of implementing Alternative D would be the same as those resulting from the Proposed
Action with the exception that the requirement to drill all wells directionally from a single pad or existing
location per section would likely extend the amount of time required to drill and complete each well
therefore extending the time period over which development activities occur. While a slowing in project
area development activities and associated waste generation may serve to extend the life of existing
disposal facilities, the directional requirement may increase the volume of fluids needed for drilling
operations but may also make recycling and re-use of these fluids more feasible.
4.21.2.6 Alternative E: No Action

Waste and hazardous material management activities would be greatly reduced because it is assumed that
no new wells would be drilled. Some activities would still exist in support of ongoing production
activities.

4.21.3 Impact Summary
Currently authorized and approved actions, which would continue under the No Action alternative, are
already exerting stress on the permitted and authorized disposal facilities proximal to the project area.
Authorization of the Proposed Action or Alternatives A through C would result in further stress to the
capacity of permitted waste management units used by the operating companies, including those used for
management of solid waste, produced water, and drilling mud. Alternative D may serve to extend the life
of some existing disposal facilities because the increase in directional drilling would result in greater
recycling of drilling mud and other on-site materials.
4.21.4 Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures
Implementation of the Proposed Action would result in an increase in hazardous materials being
transported, stored, and used in the project area, and therefore in an increased risk of spills or other
accidental releases of these materials. These increased risks would primarily occur during project
development. Although the BLM discourages the use of produced water pits, they can be permitted when
necessary. Avian mortality may occur in produced-water disposal pits due to salinity in the water and
possible hydrocarbon contamination from condensate carryover, despite the use of netting. This increased
risk would occur throughout the life of the project.
The operating companies and their contractors are obligated to operate in compliance with applicable
local, state, and federal regulations. The BLM recognizes these authorities and requires compliance with
the applicable regulations. In addition to required mitigation measures as set forth in the Rawlins RMP
and CD-C required Conditions of Approval and BMPs (Appendix C), the following mitigation measure
would further reduce risks resulting from the generation of waste and the use and transport of hazardous
materials:


Consider cooperatively permitting and operating in-field disposal facilities for solid waste, produced
water, drilling mud, and other activities as feasible.

5. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations require an assessment of potential cumulative
impacts. Cumulative impact is defined by those regulations at 40 CFR 1508.7 as:
the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what
agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts
can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period
of time.
Cumulative impacts for each affected resource are assessed in this section. The discussion of potential
cumulative impacts assumes the successful implementation of the environmental protection and
mitigation measures described in Appendix C and Chapter 4 of this EIS, as well as compliance with the
Rawlins RMP and all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements. The
analysis of cumulative impacts addresses both potentially adverse and beneficial impacts.
The cumulative impact analysis area for the CD-C project generally includes south-central Wyoming but
is variable for each resource. No single geographic unit would serve as a cumulative impact analysis area
for all resources. The Air Quality analysis, for example, analyzes cumulative impacts over an area that
includes all of southwestern Wyoming and parts of Colorado, Utah, and Idaho. The Geology cumulative
analysis, on the other hand, is concerned only with the CD-C project area itself. For the cumulative
analysis in this draft EIS, each resource analysis includes a definition of the area considered in its
cumulative impact analysis.
The cumulative impact analysis has an estimated future timeframe of 45 years—the 15-year period of
development plus the 30- to 40-year operational life of a producing well. As with the impact analysis
area, the time frame for cumulative impact analysis will vary from one resource to another. Each resource
analysis section describes the approximate time frame during which cumulative effects would occur.
The “past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions” most commonly associated with the CD-C
project area and south central Wyoming in general are grazing, transportation, and natural gas
development. Livestock grazing—both sheep and cattle—began in the 1870s, continues today, and is
expected to continue into the future. Sheep numbers have declined from their peak in the early part of the
20th century but cattle numbers remain high.
The area has been traversed by trails since humans first came to the area, and today includes major eastwest and north-south transportation and utility corridors used for roads, railroads, and pipelines. The
Overland and the Cherokee Trails—historic passageways—cross the area. The first transcontinental
railroad, the Union Pacific, came to the area in the 1860s and still operates today, with heavy freight
traffic crossing east and west. The nation’s first transcontinental highway, the Lincoln Highway, was built
in the same corridor as the railroad in the early part of the 20th century. It has been replaced by Interstate
80 (I-80), which will remain a major east-west transportation route into the future. WY 789 and several
county roads are the main north-south routes in the area. The Wamsutter hub is a major connection point
for the many natural gas pipelines that traverse the area east-west and north-south.
Natural gas development in the CD-C project area and the surrounding area has been ongoing since the
1950s. The Wamsutter field, the first natural gas field in the area, was established in 1958. Since then, the
rate of development has varied but has proceeded at the rate of about 200 wells per year since 2008. Prior
development and existing activities within the project area are described in the introduction to Chapter 4,
Environmental Consequences (Section 4.0.1). The 47,200 acres of new surface disturbance anticipated by
the CD-C Natural Gas Development Project would be added to 56,647 acres of surface disturbance that
has already occurred within the area. The CD-C project impacts for each of the resources and activities

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

discussed in Chapter 4 are described in the context of those disturbances and impacts that have already
occurred in the project area. Those discussions will not be repeated here. There are other defined areas in
south-central Wyoming—the Atlantic Rim and the Hiawatha project areas, for example—where natural
gas has historically been produced and will continue to be produced. Those will be discussed in this
section to the extent that they are relevant. Table 5.0-1 describes the principal natural gas projects that are
ongoing or that are in planning. Map 5.0-1 shows energy development projects that are ongoing or in the
planning stage.
In addition to natural gas activities, Table 5.0-1 also describes reasonably foreseeable future wind energy
development projects, mining activity, and major electric transmission lines and industrial development
projects.



PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT

5.1

GEOLOGY

The cumulative impact analysis area (CIAA) for geology is the CD-C project area. Geologic resources are
not expected to be impacted by activities that occur outside the project area nor would implementation of
CD-C project activities have impact outside the area. Cumulative impacts would be limited to past and
ongoing oil and gas extraction, grazing, and transportation activities within the project area. Geological
resources have not been significantly affected by past and continuing activities in the project area and are
not expected to be notably affected by any future activities if mitigation measures described in Appendix
C are implemented.

5.2

PALEONTOLOGIC RESOURCES

The CIAA for paleontology is the CD-C project area. Paleontological resources are not expected to be
impacted by activities that occur outside the project area. Cumulative impacts would be limited to past
and ongoing oil and gas extraction, grazing, and transportation activities within the project area.
Paleontological resources have not been significantly affected by past and continuing activities in the
project area and are not expected to be notably affected by any future activities if mitigation measures
described in Appendix C and Section 4.2.5, Unavoidable Adverse Impacts and Additional Mitigation
Measures, are implemented.

5.3

SOILS

The CIAA for soils is the CD-C project area. Past, present, and future actions would incrementally
increase soil disturbances and soil productivity for the lifetime of development and gas production in the
project area, approximately 45 years. The cumulative losses for soil resources would occur due to 47,200
acres of new surface disturbance in addition to 60,176 acres of historic surface disturbance related to
natural gas development and other activities. The increased surface disturbance for the Proposed Action
would represent a 78-percent increase relative to that for historic development, although the impacts
would be mitigated by successful implementation of interim and final reclamation during the life of the
project. The 47,200 acres of new disturbance under the Proposed Action is approximately 44 percent of
the cumulative disturbance for the project area soils.
Impacts to soils in the project area related to the Proposed Action and various alternatives are described in
Section 4.3.3 of the EIS. Post-reclamation disturbances for the Proposed Action and various alternatives
would be relatively low and successful reclamation would reduce the cumulative impacts to the soil
resource that may result from the Proposed Action or the alternatives. Impacts to soil productivity,
vegetation, and surface water would be more severe during development and production and would
diminish during final reclamation and the post-reclamation phase of the project. Implementation of Best
Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce erosion and sedimentation and promote revegetation would be
used to reduce cumulative impacts.
Cumulative impacts to project area soils include past, present, and future actions that would affect
surface-water quality due to erosion and sediment discharge, and increased surface disturbances that
reduce soil productivity prior to successful reclamation. The geographic area of soils-related cumulative
impacts includes surface disturbances within the project area in addition to the water quality related
impacts.
The northern 70 percent of the project area is located in the Great Divide Basin, a closed basin which is
bounded by the Continental Divide. Impacts from erosion and sediment within the basin are generally low
and dependent upon localized soils and terrain. Since surface water would not discharge outside of the

5-6

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

closed basin, impacts from erosion and sediment would not affect any other watershed. Future actions that
would result in cumulative impacts within the Great Divide Basin include the Luman Rim Natural Gas
Development located northwest of and adjacent to the project area.
The southern portion of the project area is primarily drained by Muddy Creek and its tributaries which are
part of the Little Snake River Basin. The Muddy Creek Sub-basin has been historically impacted and is
listed in the 2010 Wyoming 303(d) List as either not supporting or threatened for aquatic life, non-game
fish and cold-water game fish (WDEQ 2010). Unstable stream channels and loss of riparian function have
occurred throughout the basin due to season-long riparian grazing and accelerated erosion associated with
oil and gas activities. In upper Muddy Creek the Little Snake River Conservation District (LSRCD),
BLM, landowners, grazing permittees, Wyoming Game and Fish (WGFD), and other stakeholders have
been involved in Coordinated Resource Management since 1992 including several Section 319 watershed
improvement projects. These projects have included upland water development, cross fencing, and
vegetation and grazing management. Deferred grazing has also been implemented in the Grizzly Wildlife
Habitat Management Area to promote restoration of watershed function. LSRCD and WGFD data
indicate that improvement to stream stability, aquatic habitat and riparian areas has resulted from both of
these projects and several reaches in Muddy Creek, Littlefield Creek, and McKinney Creek are meeting
their aquatic life uses and have been removed from the 303(d) list. These projects are located in the Upper
Muddy Creek Drainage outside of the project area.
The LSRCD and other stakeholders have also implemented another watershed improvement project to
address physical degradation of the Muddy Creek stream channel, which threatens aquatic life-use
support. This project is located along Muddy Creek on the west side of WY 789 in the project area and
includes wetlands development, reestablishment of the floodplain and irrigation water management. This
project has resulted in improving trends in riparian condition and bank stability.
Future actions that would result in cumulative impacts to the Proposed Action within the Muddy Creek
Sub-basin include the Desolation Flats Natural Gas Development Project located adjacent and southwest
of the project area, and the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Field Development located east of and adjacent to
the project area.

5.4

WATER RESOURCES

The CIAA for water resources includes two components: (1) an analysis of cumulative impacts within the
CD-C project area and (2) an analysis of cumulative impacts on portions of the watersheds that are
associated with the CD-C project area. The cumulative surface water impacts analysis area includes
portions of the White-Yampa, Great Divide, and the Upper Green drainage basins. The cumulative
groundwater impact analysis area includes portions of the Green River, Great Divide, and Washakie
structural basins, the Rock Springs and Rawlins uplifts, and the Wamsutter Arch. Cumulative impacts
include water resource impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future oil and gas
developments, agriculture (irrigated crops, livestock grazing, and ranch management), recreational
activities/vehicular traffic, and other mining and industrial activities.
5.4.1

Cumulative Impacts Common to the CD-C Project-Specific and Watershed
Analysis Areas

Surface Water. All action alternatives would result in increased natural gas development in the CD-C
project area, with the difference between alternatives being the magnitude of disturbance. Including the
CD-C project, there are 12 currently operating or planned oil and gas development projects within the
CD-C larger watershed analysis area. The projects with the greatest potential to contribute to cumulative
impacts to surface water resources would be the CD-C project and the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas
Development Project. These projects are adjacent to Muddy Creek, which as discussed below, is under
special protection by the State of Wyoming. Historic development in the project area accounts for 60,176

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-7

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

acres of initial disturbance and 17,663 acres of long-term disturbance. Total historic development in the
watershed analysis area has not been calculated. The Proposed Action and the alternatives would add
disturbance of between 36,499 acres (Alternative D) and 61,696 acres (Alternative A). The long-term
disturbance would range from 14,952 to 24,133 acres. The main cumulative impacts to surface-water
resources from oil and gas development would be brought about by contamination of surface water from
both authorized and accidental surface discharge of fluids and the impacts (including sediment loading)
from surface disturbance related to project development/maintenance. These cumulative impacts would
be greatest within the CD-C analysis area but the contamination of surface water and off-site
sedimentation would extend downstream of the CD-C watershed analysis area. As part of the Atlantic
Rim project, Upper Muddy Creek is currently monitored for sediment delivery from eroding streambanks,
measurement of habitat features and stream geomorphology, and measurement of sediment concentrations
and other water quality parameters.
Agriculture (irrigated crops, livestock grazing, and ranch management) and other natural resource uses
within the cumulative impact analysis areas would result in increased surface runoff, accelerated erosion,
and off-site sedimentation that would cause channel instability and degradation of surface-water quality.
Because livestock tend to concentrate around available sources of water (stock reservoirs, stock tanks
associated with water wells, and flowing streams) there would be localized effects in these areas, which
could lead to greater erosion where anthropogenic surface disturbances and livestock concentration areas
overlap. Two portions of Muddy Creek, which is within the White-Yampa watershed (Map 3.4-1), are
now listed on the State 303(d) list of Impaired or Threatened Waterbodies due to habitat alteration,
primarily due to livestock grazing (WDEQ 2012) and exacerbated by oil and gas development. The Little
Snake River Conservation District (LSRCD) has been working through a Coordinated Resource
Management (CRM) process with the BLM, landowners, grazing permittees, WGFD, and other
stakeholders since 1992 to address these water quality and riparian habitat problems. As part of the CRM
process, LSRCD has managed several Section 319 watershed improvement projects in the upper Muddy
Creek drainage. According to WDEQ, the projects have resulted in considerable improvement to stream
stability, aquatic habitat and riparian health, especially in the upper Muddy Creek tributaries (WDEQ
2012). While the CRM process is no longer formally in place, the beneficial effects are still being
realized. Although not agricultural in nature, accelerated erosion associated with oil and gas activities
within the Muddy Creek sub-basin has been identified as having a role in exacerbating the degradation of
lower Muddy Creek. Surface water impacts would be considered significant for at least one surface-water
significance criterion through cumulative impacts if the Proposed Action or any of the action alternatives
were selected. Cumulative surface water impacts would not be considered significant for Alternative E.
Recreational activities and vehicular travel would have minimal effects on surface water, but could be
more pronounced in localized areas due to off-road travel and additional access provided by resource
development. Off-road travel in drainage areas would cause local impacts to surface waters. Impacts
could be more significant where there is continuous federal land and the project improves or creates new
access. Recreational activities and off-road travel are not expected to have significant effects on surfacewater resources and would not contribute to the significance impacts discussed in Section 4.4.4.
Other industrial activities (i.e., mining, wind energy development, and construction of power transmission
lines) would impact surface-water quality in localized areas within the cumulative impact area. The
proposed Gateway West, Gateway South, and TransWest Express transmission line projects would cross
the cumulative impact analysis areas and would have the potential to affect surface water during
construction, operation, and decommissioning of the projects, particularly where the transmission
corridors cross drainages. The BLM is the lead federal agency for the NEPA process for these proposed
projects.
Groundwater. As discussed in Section 5.0, natural gas development in the project area and the
surrounding region has been ongoing since the 1950s. Since initiation of drilling, over 4,400 natural-gas
wells have been drilled. All of the action alternatives would result in the same number of new wells

5-8

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

drilled (8,950 natural gas and 30 injection), with the difference being the number of well pads and the
extent of required access roads and pipelines needed for resource development. Cumulative groundwater
impacts would occur during the removal of groundwater; from improper drilling operations; from
accidental releases of fluids (spills) associated with drilling and fracturing operations, produced water,
and other hazardous liquids to soils and surface-water systems; and through subsurface disposal
(injection) of produced water. These impacts are the same as the project specific impacts described in
Section 4.4.4. Cumulative groundwater impacts are not expected to be significant and would not
contribute to the significance impacts discussed in Section 4.4.4.
5.4.2

Cumulative Impacts within the CD-C Project Area

Surface Water. The types of cumulative surface-water impacts would be the same as those discussed in
Section 5.4.1. Disturbance related to current oil and gas development has already occurred. Cumulative
impacts, particularly from the CD-C and Atlantic Rim projects, would exacerbate current degradation on
Muddy Creek. Since the CD-C project would be the largest contributor to cumulative impacts,
successfully utilizing BMPs and COAs listed in Appendix C would reduce the potential for adding to
cumulative impacts. Surface water impacts would be considered significant for at least one surface-water
significance criteria through cumulative impacts if the Proposed Action or any of the action alternatives
were selected. Surface water impacts would not be considered significant for Alternative E.
Groundwater. The types of cumulative groundwater impacts would be the same as those discussed in
Section 5.4.1. Using the available estimates of water use included in the NEPA analyses of projects still
in development within the project area, the total cumulative water demand over the lives of the projects
would be 40,470 ac-ft (BLM 2004, 2005e, 2006a, 2007f, 2010d, and 2011b). This amount is
approximately 0.4 percent of the estimated volume of producible groundwater available (9.67 million ac­
ft) in the Tertiary-age aquifers underlying the project area (calculated from information in Cleary et al.
2010). Available water is also found in Quaternary, Upper and Lower Cretaceous, and Jurassic age
aquifers. Fisk (1967) estimated that the amount of moderately good-quality groundwater within the Great
Divide Structural Basin was 500 million ac-ft and 300 million ac-ft within the Washakie Structural Basin.
The combined annual recharge for the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins has been estimated at
11,300 ac-ft (Fisk 1967), which is well above the estimated annual 2,700 ac-ft. of water removed for
development of the six projects. Cumulative groundwater impacts are not expected to be significant.
5.4.3

Cumulative Impacts within the Watershed Area

Surface Water. The types of cumulative surface-water impacts would be the same as those discussed in
Section 5.4.1. Surface water impacts would be considered significant for at least one surface-water
significance criteria through cumulative impacts if the Proposed Action or any of the action alternatives
were selected. Surface water impacts would not be considered significant for Alternative E.
There are two existing large-scale coal mines (Black Butte and Jim Bridger) located within the watershed
analysis area. Impacts to surface water from mining activities include increases in runoff, turbidity, and
sedimentation within the project area due to disturbances to vegetation and soil resources. Permit
requirements and compliance with rules and regulations associated with surface mining are under the
jurisdiction of the WDEQ with Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) oversight.
These mines are not expected to contribute measurably to the significance impacts discussed in Section
4.4.4.
The existing Sweetwater uranium mill (currently not operational) and the proposed Lost Creek/Lost
Soldier in situ uranium recovery (ISR) projects are located in the Great Divide Basin, just north of the
project area. These projects have the potential to impact surface water during construction/operation
through ground disturbance and vegetation removal or if leachate is accidentally discharged into surface

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-9

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

waters. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees uranium source and byproduct material
license applications and the WDEQ has authority over permits to mine for uranium operations.
Wind-energy development and industrial development projects are under the jurisdiction of the Wyoming
Industrial Siting Council and boards of county commissioners (through Wyoming HEA No. 0064). Windenergy development projects have the potential to affect surface water during construction. These projects
could result in contamination of surface water, increased surface runoff, erosion, and off-site
sedimentation that would cause channel instability and degradation of surface-water quality, particularly
where the development impacts drainage channels. The proposed Chokecherry/Sierra Madre Wind
Energy Project is the nearest wind-energy development project and is located approximately 7 miles east
of the project area in Carbon County. The proposed Sweeney Ranch Wind Park is located approximately
18 miles west of the project area in Sweetwater County and the Middlewood Wind Power Project is
located approximately 22 miles east of the project area in Carbon County.
Downstream demands for water in the Green River and Little Snake River drainages would continue to
influence water management in the Upper Green and White-Yampa basins, respectively. According to the
2010 Green River Management Plan, which provides a 50-year projection of water use in watersheds that
include the Upper Green and White-Yampa basins in Wyoming, approximately 680,000 ac-ft/year would
be depleted from the Basin from all sources (agriculture, municipal, domestic, industrial, recreational,
environmental, and evaporation) under a moderate growth scenario by 2060 (Wyoming Water
Development Office 2011). Wyoming's estimated 2060 allocation of the Upper Colorado River water
under the Colorado River Compact totals approximately 847,000 ac-ft/year, which would mean that
approximately 167,000 (847,000–680,000) ac-ft/year would remain under the Compact allocation
(Wyoming Water Development Office 2011). No surface water would be used for any part of the well
drilling or construction process so the proposed project would not contribute to surface-water depletion
within the Colorado River system.
According to the WDEQ-WQD database, there are currently 23 active coalbed natural-gas (CBNG), oil­
and-gas-related, industrial, or coal mining Wyoming Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (WYPDES)
discharge permits in the cumulative watershed area (WDEQ-WQD 2011). The Proposed Action does not
include plans for any surface discharge of produced water. It is therefore assumed that all water produced
would be injected or evaporated and no additional discharge permits would be necessary for the surface
disposal of produced water. Permitting for surface discharge of produced water related to federal land or
minerals would require a separate NEPA evaluation.
Groundwater. The types of cumulative groundwater impacts would be the same as those discussed in
Section 5.4.1. Using the available estimates of water use included in the NEPA analyses of oil and gas
projects that are still in development in the watershed analysis area, the total cumulative water demand
from oil and gas development would be approximately 46,000 ac-ft over the lives of the projects (BLM
2004, 2005e 2006a, 2007f, 2009b, 2010d, 2011b, and 2011c). This amount is approximately 0.1 percent
of the estimated volume of producible groundwater available (75.2 million ac-ft) in Tertiary-age aquifers
underlying the Greater Green River Basin (Cleary et al. 2010). Available water is also found in
Quaternary, Upper and Lower Cretaceous, and Jurassic age aquifers. Fisk (1967) estimated that the
amount of moderately good-quality groundwater within the Great Divide Structural Basin was 500
million ac-ft and 300 million ac-ft within the Washakie Structural Basin. The combined annual recharge
for the Great Divide and Washakie structural basins has been estimated at 11,300 ac-ft (Fisk 1967), which
is much greater than the estimated annual demand of 3,000 ac-ft removed for development.
The Black Butte and Jim Bridger coal mines are located within the watershed analysis area. Impacts of
mining, including cumulative hydrologic impacts, are regulated by WDEQ/LQD with oversight by OSM.
The mine pits/active workings would be completely dewatered, which would result in drawdown of
formation aquifers in the vicinity of the mining activities. These mines are not expected to contribute
measurably to contribute measurably to the significance impacts discussed in Section 4.4.4 since the

extent of drawdown would be limited due to the lack of lateral continuity of the water-bearing units in the
affected formation.
The Sweetwater Mill project has the potential to impact groundwater through accidental discharge from
the existing tailings impoundment; the impoundment is reported to have leaked several times between
1980 and 1984. Contamination did not leave the site but did enter the upper aquifer. Subsequent remedial
actions are reducing the extent of contaminated groundwater. Contaminated soil is being excavated and
placed into the existing tailings impoundment and contaminated groundwater is being extracted and
placed into the existing tailings impoundment (NRC 2011). The proposed Lost Creek/Lost Soldier project
will impact groundwater during recovery and injection well construction and completion or from spills
and leaks, excursions, wellfield development drilling, or deep well injection. The NRC oversees uranium
source and byproduct material license applications and the WDEQ has authority over permits to mine for
uranium operations.

AIR QUALITY

The CAMx model was used to quantify the impacts to regional air quality and AQRVs resulting from the
CD-C project, other proposed oil and gas developments in the study area (Reasonably Foreseeable
Development, or RFD) and all other regional emissions sources within the study area. Since the CAMx
photochemical grid model was used in the far-field air quality analysis, the impacts of emissions sources
outside the Southwest Wyoming study area were also included via transport of these emissions and their
chemical reaction products into the study area.
CAMx was used to assess the impacts to both ambient air concentrations and AQRVs from air pollutant
emissions of CO, NOx, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and VOC expected to result from CD-C Project emissions
combined with regional emissions throughout the study area. The cumulative study considers 2008 as a
baseline year for emissions and assesses impacts to air quality at peak project year emissions levels that
are expected to occur in year 2022. Air quality impacts are assessed for year 2022, and AQRV impacts
are assessed for 2022 and relative to year 2008 levels. The CAMx model was run with both 2008 and
2022 emissions (including the CD-C project area emissions) for two years (2005 and 2006) of
meteorological data.
The cumulative assessment was performed using the Proposed Action emissions. The cumulative impacts
resulting from all project development alternatives (Alternatives A through D) would be similar to
impacts of the Proposed Action. Under Alternative E (No Action) there would be no cumulative impact to
air quality or AQRVs since there would be no new development associated with the CD-C project.
5.5.1

Emissions from Regional Sources

Maximum emissions from all RFD sources within the study area were estimated. RFD is defined as (1)
air emissions from the undeveloped portions of authorized NEPA projects, and (2) air emissions from
not-yet-authorized NEPA projects (if emissions are quantified when modeling commences). RFD
information from not-yet-authorized projects was obtained from the BLM and was based on ongoing air
quality analyses for NEPA projects.
Full development of proposed projects inventoried as RFD may or may not coincide with full
development of the CD-C project. As a result, the assumption that all RFD are fully developed during the
maximum year of CD-C project development results in some conservatism in the cumulative impact
analysis. A listing of RFD projects which were included in this study, as defined in the paragraph above,
is presented in Table 5.5-1.

Tables 5.5-2 and 5.5-3 summarize the complete regional emission inventories for the study area (the 4­
km modeling domain shown in Map 4.5-1). The tables report the modeled emissions of CO, NOx, SO2,
PM10, and PM2.5, and total organic gas (TOG), for each region and emissions source category. The CD-C
project emissions that are included in these tables are for the Proposed Action. Emissions tables are
presented for 2008, 2022 and the difference between the 2022 future year and 2008 baseline inventories
(2022–2008). For each year and for the 2022–2008 difference, emissions are reported for the 2006
meteorological year. (Emissions for both the 2005 and 2006 scenarios are reported in Section 2 of the
AQTSD.)
Tables 5.5-2 and 5.5-3 contain emissions for all portions of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Idaho that
are within the 4-km modeling domain that comprised the study area. The five counties in Southwest
Wyoming covered by the detailed oil and gas emission inventory (described in Section 2 of the AQTSD)
are broken out separately from the rest of Wyoming in all of the tables. Oil and gas emissions are broken
down into drilling, compressor engine, and production emissions. In Table 5.5-3, there are zero entries
for the 2022-2008 change in biogenic or fire emissions because the 2006 actual emissions were used in
both 2008 and 2022 emission scenarios. The only trona facilities in the study area are located in
Wyoming; therefore, trona emissions for Colorado, Idaho, and Utah are zero.
Table 5.5-3 shows that on-road mobile emissions would decrease for all pollutants in all areas between
2008 and 2022 due to increasingly stringent emissions controls. Non-road emissions also decline for all
areas for all pollutants except CO. This would occur because of the implementation of non-road engine
tier standards that require increasingly cleaner-burning engines as fleet turnover occurs. Non-oil and gas
area source emissions would increase for all pollutants within Wyoming going from 2008 to 2022. NOx
and total organic gas (TOG) emissions increase for non-oil and gas area source emissions for all four
states in 2022 relative to 2008. This is reasonable because future area source emissions are often projected
using population changes as a basis for calculating changes in emissions. 2008 to 2022 changes in
electricity generating units (EGU) emissions and non-EGU (NEGU) point source emissions vary by state
and pollutant.

Criteria Pollutants Impacts

The results of the cumulative modeling showed that there would be no exceedances of the NAAQS,
WAAQS, or CAAQS for ozone or any other criteria pollutant within the study area, except in the
immediate vicinity of sources unrelated to the CD-C project. There would be predicted exceedances of the
CO (8-hour), PM10/PM2.5 (24-hour), ozone, and SO2 (1-hour) standards within the study area; however,
the CD-C project emissions would not make a significant contribution to these values. In addition, PSD
increments would not be exceeded at any Class I or sensitive Class II area within the study area.
Additional detail on the modeling results are provided in Section 4 of the AQTSD.
Mid-Field Impacts
CAMx-estimated criteria pollutant impacts from the CD-C project and regional sources, within and near
the CD-C project area and these are shown in Table 5.5-4. As indicated in Table 5.5-4, the cumulative
impacts resulting from project and regional sources would be below the WAAQS and NAAQS.

Visibility Impacts

In the cumulative analysis, changes in light extinction from CD-C project sources combined with all
cumulative emissions sources were calculated for each day at Class I and sensitive Class II areas within
the study area (Map 4.5-1). The daily average differences in modeled concentrations between the 2022
future and 2008 baseline years were calculated for each Class I/II area, and these concentration
differences were used to estimate visibility impairment following FLAG 2010 guidance. The maximum
and number of days greater than the 0.5 and 1.0 Δdv thresholds are disclosed. Two additional methods for
evaluating cumulative visibility impacts were explored and a discussion of these methods and the results
obtained from applying them are presented in Section 4.6.1 of the AQTSD.
Cumulative visibility impacts at Class I and sensitive Class II areas estimated using the FLAG 2010
method are shown in Table 5.5-5. The largest impacts would occur at Dinosaur National Monument,
which would have the greatest number of days that exceed 0.5 Δdv and 1.0 Δdv thresholds. All Class I/II
areas within the study area would have days in which the 2022–2008 concentration differences produce
changes in extinction greater than 0.5 Δdv. The Mount Zirkel, Rawah, and Savage Run Wilderness areas
would not have any days with impacts above 1.0 Δdv, but all other Class I/II areas would have days that
exceed 1.0 Δdv. Using the 98th percentile value as a threshold, impacts at the Popo Agie Wilderness area
are at the 0.5 Δdv threshold, and impacts at the Bridger, and Fitzpatrick Wilderness areas, the Wind River
Roadless area, and Dinosaur National Monument would be above the 0.5 Δdv threshold, and the 1.0 dv
threshold would be exceeded at only Dinosaur National Monument.

Atmospheric Deposition Impacts

Modeled wet and dry fluxes of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing species due to emissions from the CD-C
project and all other cumulative regional sources were processed to estimate total annual sulfur (S) and
nitrogen (N) deposition values at each PSD Class I and sensitive PSD Class II area. Maximum predicted
S and N deposition impacts were estimated for existing emissions sources within the CD-C project area
taken together with the cumulative effects of all sources in the region.
Table 5.5-6 shows maximum predicted total nitrogen and sulfur deposition impacts from all emission
sources for the year 2022. Estimated cumulative nitrogen deposition impacts at all Class I and sensitive
Class II areas within the study area would be above the critical load threshold of 1.5 kg/ha/yr. Estimated
sulfur deposition impacts would be below the 3.0 kg/ha/yr threshold at all areas except for the Mount
Zirkel Wilderness area and Dinosaur National Monument. Cumulative nitrogen deposition impacts can be
addressed by a number of mitigation or development strategies designed to minimize NOx emissions from
the project. These mitigation strategies are further described in Section 4.5.6, Unavoidable Adverse
Impacts and Additional Mitigation Measures. Deposition impacts are summarized in detail in Section
4.6.2 of the AQTSD.

Modeling results for cumulative sources indicated that there would be no ANC changes at any of the 12
analyzed lakes that exceed the 10-percent threshold or the ΔANC<1 µeq/L threshold for the two
extremely sensitive lakes. Lake ANC impacts are summarized in Section 4.6.3 of the AQTSD.
5.3.5

Climate Change Impacts

As discussed in sections 3.5 and 4.5 Air Quality, the current scientific consensus is that anthropogenic
emissions of GHGs are causing the climate system to warm, and the impacts of this warming are likely to
be larger in the 21st century than in the 20th century if emissiontrends continue unabated (IPCC, 2007).
Forecasts of changes in the climate system under differing GHG emissions scenarios are made with
global climate models. Forecasts of regional effects of global change derived from integrations of global
models are available but are highly uncertain. In North America, predicted regional impacts of global
warming include warming in western mountains, decreased snowpack, and increased frequency and
intensity of heat waves (IPCC, 2007).
The GHGs to be emitted by the Proposed Action and the action alternatives, and from other RFD projects
in the study area, are CO2, CH4, and N2O, all of which have atmospheric lifetimes on the order of years
(IPCC, 2007). Emissions of GHGs from any particular source become well-mixed throughout the global
atmosphere. GHG emissions from all sources contribute to the global atmospheric burden of GHGs, and it
is not possible to attribute a particular climate impact in any given region to GHG emissions from a
particular source. Therefore, no modeled climate change impact predictions from Proposed Action or
action alternative GHG emissions sources or cumulative GHG emissions sources in the vicinity of the
project area are available.

BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT

5.6

VEGETATION AND RIPARIAN/WETLAND COMMUNITIES

The CIAA for vegetation communities is the CD-C project area. Historic development in the project area
accounts for 60,176 acres of initial disturbance and 17,663 acres of long-term disturbance. Added to this
total, the Proposed Action and the action alternatives would disturb between 61,696 acres (Alternative A)
and 36,499 acres (Alternative D) in the short term (Table 2.4-1). The long-term disturbance would range
from 24,133 to 14,953 acres. Due to the long timeframe needed to recover shrub habitat, there would be
an increase of acreage dominated by herbaceous vegetation versus that dominated by shrubs throughout
the CD-C project area.
Factors impacting vegetation besides removal include the indirect impact of dust accumulation on
vegetation, resulting in reduced photosynthetic activity and growth and lower palatability for herbivores.
Additionally, the increase in invasive species in the project area has already affected the native vegetation
and would continue to do so. Vegetation is also impacted by other existing uses such as livestock grazing,
wildlife foraging, and wild horse grazing. These uses will continue into the future and as available
vegetation is removed, competition among these species (especially on critical winter range) could further
impact the vigor of the vegetation in those areas. Soil loss and compaction in areas of construction can
also contribute to the difficulty of reclamation.
Wetlands and riparian communities are a very small component of the vegetation cover in the CD-C area.
Protections are in place to protect these areas from physical impact, but those adjacent to gravel or dirt
roads could be impacted by dust.
Other actions within and near the CIAA could add to this impact. Roads within the project area are
utilized to travel to adjacent projects such as the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Field to the east and
Desolation Flats to the west. Secondary roads may also be used to access the Luman Rim project adjacent
to the northwest border of the project area. Additionally, three new transmission lines are proposed to
cross the project area which would increase traffic during the planning and development stages. This
additional use of the gravel and dirt roads within the project area would contribute additional dust and the
vehicles could transport seeds of noxious plant species both into and out of the project area.

5.7

INVASIVE, NON-NATIVE SPECIES

The CIAA for invasive species is the CD-C project area and adjacent areas of development that could
provide a seed source for invasive plants and also could provide sites for potential infestation by invasive
species from the CD-C project area.
Impacts to vegetation and range resources would occur on all lands in the project area under the Proposed
Action and all action alternatives, as well as on private and state lands under the No Action Alternative,
due to an increase in surface disturbance which could provide more suitable habitat for invasive weed
infestations.
Vehicles and equipment traveling from weed-infested areas, within and outside the project area, could
facilitate the spread of invasive weeds into previously weed-free areas in addition to facilitating the
spread of seeds of existing invasive populations. Surface-disturbing activities could increase the potential
for infestation and spread of invasive plant species. Invasive weed species usually thrive on newly
disturbed surfaces and out-compete more desirable native plant species. Creation of new sites for weed
infestations may occur in proximity to roads where fugitive-dust deposition on roadside plants reduces
their density due to reduced photosynthetic activity and reduced vigor, thus providing a suitable habitat
for invasive plants to establish.

5-20

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

In addition to the CD-C project, several other natural gas projects are located adjacent to the project area
and could provide potential seed sources for establishment of invasive species in the project area. They
include Atlantic Rim on the east of the project area, Desolation Flats on the southwest, and Luman Rim
on the northwest. Additionally, three transmission-line projects are proposed to cross the project area and
vehicles/equipment associated with the planning and construction of those projects provide other potential
seed sources and seed vectors.

5.8

WILDLIFE

The cumulative impact analysis areas (CIAAs) for wildlife resources differ with respect to species. This
analysis examines the proportion of the wildlife habitat within respective CIAAs that may be disturbed
from all past, present, and RFFAs. The combination of individual projects results in a large area
potentially exposed to increased fragmentation, disturbance of wildlife and their habitats, disruption of
migratory corridors, and the loss of refuge areas. Additional effects are expected on wildlife dispersal, the
reduction of non-fragmented habitats, competition with livestock, and competition with other wildlife
species. The generalized increase of human presence and associated disturbance across such a broad scale
are a concern. Remaining ranges with increased competition for forage leading to reduced carrying
capacity and juvenile survival can also be expected for some species. Mitigations, COAs, and other BMPs
would reduce the impacts of these developments, but not eliminate them. Reduced populations and
population viability can be expected in high-density development areas.
Cumulative indirect effects from the Proposed Action or alternatives and RFFAs to all wildlife species in
general would come from road/traffic impacts, including vehicle collisions, noise, and dust. As roads are
developed within and adjacent to the project area, habitat is fragmented. Roads can serve as barriers to
some animal movement. The displacement of species away from roadsides can be reasonably predicted.
Roads also provide access to the public into areas that were previously undisturbed/undeveloped. Human
encroachment in the form of casual backcountry recreation, hunting, and poaching could occur at higher
rates resulting in effects such as disturbance during sensitive periods, displacement, or increased
mortality.
Insects, birds, and amphibians all avoid dust and noise from roads, which compounds impacts to adjacent
habitats throughout the CIAA. Sagebrush-obligate species would be affected by the cumulative removal
of habitat (reduction or fragmentation of patch size or vertical habitat structure) and the expanded road
system throughout the area.
For raptors, small mammals, and neotropical migratory birds, the impacts anticipated from the Proposed
Action, alternatives, and RFFAs would be similar with the exception of Alternative A (100-Percent
Vertical Drilling) which would disturb more acreage over the long term. The Proposed Action and the
action alternatives provide a variety of mitigations and protections for various wildlife species.
Alternative B, with enhanced mitigations and protections, would enhance habitat for prey and grassland
species. Alternative D, with required directional drilling on federal mineral estate, would reduce surface
disturbance, and associated shrub habitat removal, by about 23 percent when compared to the Proposed
Action. Under all Alternatives, with the exception of Alternative E (No Action), sagebrush obligates
would experience an overall reduction in suitable habitat for the life of the various projects within the
CIAA.
5.8.1

Big Game

Disturbance during construction and production, such as human presence, dust, and noise may displace or
preclude big game use during all seasons. Prohibiting construction, drilling, and other activities
potentially disruptive to wildlife during sensitive time periods (e.g. winter) would minimize the
probability of displacement during these critical times. The extent of displacement would be related to the
duration, magnitude, and visual prominence of the activity, as well as the extent of construction and

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-21

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

operational noise levels above existing background levels. Displacement would result in local reductions
in wildlife populations if adjacent, undisturbed habitats are at carrying capacity. In this situation animals
are either forced into less-optimal habitats or they compete with other animals that already occupy
unaffected habitats. Possible consequences of such displacement are lower survival, lower reproductive
success, lower recruitment, and ultimately lower carrying capacity and reduced populations (WGFD
2010). Refer to Section 4.8.3 for a more in-depth discussion of possible direct and indirect impacts of the
CD-C project or other CIAA projects to big game.
Construction, such as building well pads and roads, reduces forage available to big game. The
significance of this forage reduction is greater in big game CWR, especially as development cumulatively
and concurrently occurs outside the project area in adjacent oil and gas development areas. The
application of seasonal restrictions intended to minimize CWR disturbance could serve to further
concentrate big game in those refuge areas. These seasonal restrictions are not generally applied in state
and fee energy development areas. In addition, new gas field-related roads provide unconstrained access
to the general public which could result in increased human presence during sensitive periods such as
winter. Recreational “antler hunting” has been identified by WGFD as an issue in CWR in some areas of
the state.
Big game populations are managed within Herd Units designated for each species and cumulative impacts
are discussed in the context of these areas. Implementation of the proposed project would affect crucial
winter/winter yearlong range for these big game species. Elk are not considered in this cumulative impact
analysis as CWR for the species would not be impacted by the CD-C project. The specific locations of
future disturbances within the CD-C project area and the other RFFAs (Section 5.0) that fall within the
Herd Units and crucial seasonal habitats are unknown; therefore, the exact location of each seasonal big
game range or migration route that may be affected by development activity is unknown. The cumulative
portion of each CD-C big game CWR that could be affected by the combination of existing, proposed,
and RFFA disturbances for pronghorn and mule deer is discussed below. Cumulative impacts to big game
would include permanent, short-term, and long-term loss of habitat, as well as increased stress due to
human/wildlife encounters, potential reductions in birth/survival rates, and possible alterations of
migration routes.
Pronghorn. The cumulative impact analysis area for pronghorn comprises the Herd Units impacted by
the CD-C project (Map 5.8-1). Cumulative impacts to pronghorn migration routes are unknown at this
time; however, the current fencing along WY 789 creates a barrier to pronghorn attempting to migrate
across this highway. The WGFD has constructed highway underpasses along WY 789 in an effort to
provide safe access during migration and reduce the frequency of vehicle collision; however, pronghorn
do not appear to use these accommodations (WYDOT 2012, J. Gregson pers. com. January 2012). I-80
constitutes a significant barrier to pronghorn seasonal movements. Dependent on the severity of the
winter, there are miles of rangeland fence that also create migration barriers for pronghorn.
It is assumed that most, if not all, of the Baggs herd transition range is located within the interface of the
CD-C and Atlantic Rim project areas (BLM 2007) along WY 789. Approximately 76 percent of the
Baggs Herd Unit crucial winter/yearlong range could be affected by long-term development in the
following areas: 30 percent within the CD-C project area, 42.6 percent within the Atlantic Rim project
area, and 3.4 percent within new transmission line corridors. Virtually all of the Baggs pronghorn crucial
winter range lies within one or more oil and gas project boundary.
Approximately 44.5 percent of the Bitter Creek Herd Unit CWR is located within the project area for the
Proposed Action and other RFFAs including Hiawatha (22.7 percent), CD-C (10 percent), Desolation
Flats (6.5 percent), and new transmission line corridors (3 percent), as well as other existing oil and gas
development actions. The CD-C project and new transmission line corridors could affect approximately
19 percent of the Red Desert Herd Unit CWR. It is anticipated that the CWR in the Red Desert Herd Unit
would also be affected by scattered oil and gas development activities.

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Mule deer. The cumulative impact analysis area for mule deer comprises the Herd Units impacted by the
CD-C project (Map 5.8-2). Cumulative impacts upon mule deer migration routes within the Baggs Herd
Unit are unknown; however, WGFD and the Wyoming Department of Transportation have constructed
highway underpasses along WY 789 in an effort to provide safe access during migration and reduce the
frequency of vehicle collision. Mule deer are successfully using these underpasses (WYDOT 2012, J.
Gregson pers. com. January 2012).
As with pronghorn, it is assumed that most, if not all, of this herd’s transition range is located within the
interface of CD-C and Atlantic Rim project areas (BLM 2007) along WY 789. Approximately 6 percent
of the Baggs Herd Unit crucial winter/year-long range could be affected by long-term development within
the CD-C project area, another 26 percent falls within the Atlantic Rim project area, 7 percent would be
affected by the Desolation Flats project, and approximately 4 percent is located within 0.5 mile of
proposed new transmission-line corridors. Over 44 percent of the Baggs mule deer CWR may lie within
one or more reasonably foreseeable oil and gas project or transmission line corridors. As discussed in
Section 4.8.3.1, predictive maps suggest some habitats considered “high probability of use” areas prior to
development would change to “low probability of use” areas as development progresses. These impacts
would be increased as the CD-C, Atlantic Rim, and Desolation Flats projects are developed.
Approximately 31 acres of mule deer CWR are identified in the Chain Lakes Herd Unit, none of which
would be affected by the CD-C project or other RFFAs. None of the CWR in the Steamboat Herd Unit
would be affected by the CD-C project; approximately 2 percent could be influenced by new transmission
line corridors.
Elk. The cumulative impact analysis area for elk comprises the Herd Units impacted by the CD-C project.
No elk CWR or migrations routes have been identified in the CD-C project area.
Overlapping big game crucial winter ranges are located at the interface of the CD-C project area and
the Atlantic Rim project area along WY 789 (Map 3.8-7). As discussed above, this area is expected to see
additional development and production activity resulting in additional stress and displacement of
pronghorn and mule deer, as well as reduced winter forage as a result of increased surface disturbance.
Impacts to these herds would be exacerbated by the current fair to poor condition of forage in crucial
winter habitat designated areas (see Section 4.8.3.1). Over the long term, the impacts anticipated from the
CD-C project and RFFAs would be similar for the various CD-C project area development alternatives
with the exception of Alternative A (100-Percent Vertical Drilling) which would disturb more acres over
the long term, and Alternative D which would reduce total surface disturbance, and associated shrub
habitats, by approximately 23 percent, when compared to the Proposed Action. Alternative B (Enhanced
Resource Protection) and Alternative C (Surface Disturbance Cap with High and Low Density
Development Areas) would both provide protection to big game CWR areas over the life of the project.
The ERP provides a variety of impact thresholds, each of which enhances the mitigation and protection
for wildlife species and their respective critical seasonal ranges. BLM seasonal restrictions and those
enhancement provided under Alternative B are not generally applied in state and fee energy development
areas.
An indirect impact of these CIAA actions includes unrestricted access by the general public using gas
field-related roads which could result in increased human presence in CWR during sensitive periods.
Recreational “antler hunting” has been identified by WGFD as an issue in CWR in some areas of the
state.

5.8.2

Raptors

The CIAA for raptors includes the CD-C project area plus a 1-mile buffer (Map 5.8-3). This area covers
approximately 1,226,825 acres, all of which would be considered raptor foraging habitat. Approximately
939 nests are known to occur in the CIAA; 780 known nests (83 percent) are within the project area, 122
nest sites are located in the CIAA of overlap between Atlantic Rim and CD-C project area, 14 would
possibly be affected by transmission lines, and another 14 lie in the overlap area between Desolation Flats
and the CD-C project area. Approximately 61 percent of the known nests are ferruginous hawk, 10
percent are golden eagle, and 5 percent are red-tailed hawk; the remaining 25 percent are various species
including burrowing owl, prairie falcon, American kestrel, and unknowns. Potentially positive cumulative
impacts from the creation of additional nesting sites (i.e., artificial nesting structures including
hydrocarbon stock tanks) are known from other conventional oil and gas projects in the vicinity of the
CD-C project area.
As with the Proposed Action and the various alternatives analyzed, the required buffers and restrictions
on activity around active raptor nests and the fact that most of the prey utilize habitat that can be
reclaimed in a timely fashion, the impacts on most raptor species in the CD-C project area and associated
RFFA overlap areas is not expected to exceed the significance criteria. However, the BLM timing
stipulations for protection of raptor nests is not applied on State and fee energy development actions.
Refer to Section 5.9.3 for a discussion of CIAA on the ferruginous hawk.
5.8.3

Fish

Cumulative impacts to fish species would include the effects of the CD-C project and other developments
upstream in Muddy Creek, the most notable of which is the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Project. At this
time there are no known additional proposals to analyze or assess.
About 10 game-fish species and 20 non-game fish species may occur within or upstream/downstream
from these two project areas. Of these, about 14 species, including six native species, are likely to be
present within the project areas. Of the 14, four are BLM Sensitive Species and 10 are not. All of the 10
species that are not BLM sensitive would be subject to the same types of impacts described in Section
4.9.3.1. Sensitive Fish Species; however, they have a wide distribution within Wyoming (Baxter and
Stone 1995). Consequently, the project area and other human activities within the Muddy Creek and
Great Basin watersheds may have localized population impacts, but these impacts should not impact their
status range-wide.

SPECIAL STATUS PLANT, WILDLIFE, AND FISH SPECIES

The CIAAs for wildlife resources differ with respect to species. The combination of the individual
projects could result in a large area of increased fragmentation, disturbance of wildlife and their habitats,
disruption of migratory corridors, and the loss of refuge areas. Additional effects could be wildlife
dispersal, the reduction of non-fragmented habitats, competition with livestock, and inter-specific
competition. The generalized increase in human presence and associated disturbance across such a broad
scale are a concern. It can also be expected that competition for forage would increase in the remaining
habitats leading to reduced carrying capacity and juvenile survival for some species; see Section 4.9.3 for
a more detailed discussion of potential impacts to special status species. Mitigations, COAs, and other
BMPs would reduce the impacts of these developments, but not eliminate them. Reduced populations and
population viability for some species can be expected in high density development areas. However, the
BLM mitigations, COAs, BMPs etc., are not generally applied on state and fee energy development
actions.

Threatened, Endangered, Proposed or Candidate Wildlife Species

Threatened and Endangered Wildlife Species
Black-footed ferret. The presence of black-footed ferret in the CD-C project area is very unlikely (see
Section 3.9.1.1). The various CD-C alternatives would likely disturb colonies of white-tailed prairie-dogs,
which are the black-footed ferret’s primary habitat and prey source in this area. Surveys for black-footed
ferrets may be required before ground-disturbing activities within identified prairie-dog complexes
located in the Continental Divide, Dad, and Desolation Flats non-block clearance areas for all RFFAs
potentially affecting those areas (Map 5.9-1). Without pre-disturbance surveys, significant impacts could
occur in the non-block cleared areas; for example, almost 95 percent of the Dad and 80 percent of the
Desolation Flats non-block clearance areas could be affected by the CD-C project area and other RFFAs.
However, of the white-tailed prairie dog complexes identified as potential black-footed ferret habitat
(Map 5.9-1), it is anticipated that only Complex 1 would be impacted and only by the CD-C project.
Complexes 2 and 3 are located to the west of CD-C and are not encroached upon by any of the other
CIAA project boundaries.
The remaining white-tailed prairie-dog colonies within the CD-C project are in the “Block clearance”
area, where surveys for black-footed ferrets are no longer warranted. The CD-C project area and RFFAs
are not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria for black-footed ferret populations.

Greater sage-grouse. Approximately 60 percent of the CD-C project area is comprised of sagebrush and
other shrub species, which represents potential greater sage-grouse nesting habitat. Recovery of shrubs, in
locations that have been disturbed by development, to pre-disturbance levels is not expected to occur
during the life of the project. Therefore, even locations that are successfully reclaimed would represent a
long-term loss of nesting habitat; however, these areas would be used as early brood-rearing and foraging
habitats throughout the seral stages.
Per IM WY-2012-019, an 11-mile analysis area buffer is required around the project boundary for largescale proposed actions (e.g. oil and gas full-field developments). This 11-mile buffer (Map 5.9-2) was
used as the CIAA for greater sage-grouse breeding and nesting habitats potentially affected by the CD-C
project and associated RFFAs, including the Luman Rim, Lost Creek, Desolation Flats, South Baggs, and
Atlantic Rim projects. This area encompasses portions of the South Rawlins, Greater South Pass,
Continental Divide, and Salt Wells Core Population Areas. Of these only the Greater South Pass and
South Rawlins Core Population Areas would be directly affected by the CD-C project or RFFAs.
One-hundred ninety-two (192) known leks are located within 11 miles of the CD-C project area; 105 are
occupied, 13 are unoccupied, and 74 have undetermined status (see Map 3.9-2). Another 67 known sagegrouse leks are located within the CD-C project area, for a total of 259 leks within the CD-C project
CIAA. One-hundred sixty-eight (168) of these leks are occupied. All 259 leks would potentially be
affected by the CD-C project or RFFAs as indicated on Map 5.9-2. Sixty-three (63) would possibly be
directly affected by the CD-C project, 44 by Atlantic Rim, 18 by transmission line corridors and another 7
by various oil and gas projects. Other areas within the 11-mile buffer and associated Core Population
Areas would be affected by scattered energy developments and anthropogenic features on the landscape.
Greater sage-grouse inhabit the CD-C project area and surrounding area year-round and require a wide
range of seasonal habitats. The area of highest sage-grouse lek concentration in the 11-mile CIAA falls to
the south of I-80 and east of WY 789, along the interface of CD-C and Atlantic Rim (Map 3.9-2).
Approximately 81 occupied leks are known to be located in this area of high-quality/high-potential
nesting and brood-rearing habitat. This area also contains large expanses of high-quality/high-potential
severe winter use habitat.
Development activity may result in bird displacement and nest abandonment from direct and indirect
impacts, such as long-term habitat fragmentation; loss of nesting or brood-rearing habitat; displacement or
additional stress due to increased human activities including increased vehicle traffic, dust, excessive
noise levels proximal to occupied leks; removal or modification of winter habitats; and increased
predation due to an increased number of roosting sites available for raptors on power poles, tanks, and
other man-made structures (see Section 4.9.3), especially in high-density development areas.
Regardless of the alternative selected, application of the Core Population Area density and disturbance
limitations and mitigations (IM WY-2012-019 and SWED 2011) is intended to reduce disturbance to the
habitat and the species to the point that sage-grouse populations within Core Population Areas are not
negatively impacted. These restrictions would apply on all surface ownerships. Alternative D (100­
Percent Directional Drilling) would reduce surface disturbance from road and well site locations by about
23 percent compared to the Proposed Action. Alternative E (No Action) would limit CD-C development
activities to private and state mineral estates, thereby limiting additional impacts sage-grouse habitat and
populations within the CD-C project area.

In non-core areas, application of applicable IM WY-2012-019 and SGEO (Greater Sage-grouse Core
Area Protection program) standards for avoidance of potential nesting and brood-rearing habitat as well as
the Rawlins RMP (BLM 2008a) standard COAs, BMPs, Timing Limitations, and mitigation would
reduce the potential impact to sage-grouse but impact to those populations would still be anticipated.
Alternative A would have the greatest potential for impact to non-core sage-grouse populations.
Alternative B would provide enhanced mitigations and protections for sage-grouse as well as other highvalue resources. Under Alternative C, the disturbance cap would place a limit on the amount of
unreclaimed surface at any one time in a section of public land. Alternative D (required directional
drilling on federal mineral estate) would reduce surface disturbance from road and well-site locations by
about 23 percent compared to the Proposed Action. Restrictions applied for protection of sage-grouse
habitat in non-core areas, found in IM WY-2012-019 and SGEO, would apply on state, fee, and federal
lands. Alternative E (No Action) would limit CD-C development activities to individually permitted
federal activities and private and state mineral estates, thereby limiting additional impacts to project area
sage-grouse habitat and populations.
5.9.2

Threatened and Endangered Fish Species

Cumulative impacts to Threatened and Endangered fish species would include the effects of the CD-C
project and other developments upstream in Muddy Creek, of which the most notable is the Atlantic Rim
Natural Gas Project. At this time there are no known additional proposals to analyze or assess.
Four federally endangered fish species may occur as downstream residents of the Colorado River system:
Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius), bonytail (Gila elegans), humpback chub (Gila cypha),
and razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) (USFWS 2003). Suitable habitat for these species does exist
downstream of the CD-C and Atlantic Rim project areas in the Little Snake, Yampa, and Green Rivers.
Because the Colorado pikeminnow is found in the Little Snake River, it could migrate into Muddy Creek,
which makes Muddy Creek potential habitat for this species. Muddy Creek, however, is not suitable
habitat for this species. Neither of the action alternatives for these projects is expected to affect this
habitat, provided that mitigation measures for water resources and soils outlined in this document are
implemented. Though they currently exist only downstream of the project area, water draining from the
project area affects the downstream habitat for these species. Under the Proposed Action, the sources of
potential risks to these fish species are water depletions, discharges of produced water, and spills of toxic
materials.
Water Depletions. Under the Recovery and Implementation Program for Endangered Fish Species in the
Upper Colorado River Basin, “any water depletions from tributary waters within the Colorado River
drainage are considered as jeopardizing the continued existence of these fish.” A small amount of water
depletion may occur for the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Project, and the Proposed Action may deplete an
average of 510 acre-feet of water per year from aquifers in the Wasatch formation that may have contact
with and contribute to the Little Snake River and its tributaries, including Muddy Creek.
Discharges of Produced Water and Spills of Toxic Chemicals. Produced water from the CD-C project
area will not be discharged to Muddy Creek within the Little Snake River drainage; therefore, producedwater discharges will not pose a potential risk to these species. The Atlantic Rim project, however, has
produced-water discharges to Muddy Creek that may be altering the hydrology of the creek.
Accidental releases (e.g., spills) of toxic chemicals also could occur. However, accidental releases of
toxic chemicals should become highly diluted before they would reach any downstream waters where
these species occur; consequently, the potential risks from such occurrences are negligible (BLM 2007).
5.9.3

Threatened and Endangered Plant Species

The CIAA for Threatened and Endangered Plants is the CD-C project area. As described in Section 4.9.3,
direct impacts to the threatened Ute ladies’-tresses (Spiranthes diluvialis) are not anticipated to occur. The

5-32

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

application of the 500-foot buffer for riparian areas would provide protection for this species. If suitable
habitat (i.e. riparian areas) were present, the proposal would be modified so impacts were avoided. The
BLM stipulation for avoidance of riparian areas is not applied to state and fee energy development
actions.
5.9.4

Sensitive Wildlife Species

Chapter 4 analyses determined that implementation of the Proposed Action or other analyzed alternatives
is not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria for pygmy rabbit, swift fox, white-tailed prairie
dog, Wyoming pocket gopher, bald eagle, burrowing owl, sagebrush obligate avian species, or mountain
plover with the caveat that BLM mitigation measures be applied regardless of alternative selected. In
addition, Alternative B provides enhanced protections for: greater sage-grouse leks, nesting/brood-rearing
habitat, and winter concentration areas (Section 4.9.3) and ferruginous hawk nesting habitat. Alternative
D reduces surface-disturbing activity by almost 23 percent compared to the Proposed Action.
The caveat regarding application of BLM mitigation measures for special status species would apply to
all RFFAs as well as the CD-C project but would not apply to privately-owned checkerboard lands or
state or private mineral estate in the CIAA. While some disturbance of these species would likely occur
on private lands, it is not expected that impact significance criteria would be exceeded.
Ferruginous hawk. Concerns are identified (Section 4.9.3) regarding potential impacts to ferruginous
hawk from disturbance to nesting/foraging habitats. The CIAA for raptors includes the CD-C project area
plus a 1-mile buffer (see Map 5.8-3). This area covers approximately 1,226,825 acres, all of which would
be considered raptor foraging habitat. Approximately 577 ferruginous hawk nests are known to occur in
the buffered CD-C project area. Potentially positive cumulative impacts from the creation of additional
nesting sites (i.e., artificial nesting structures including hydrocarbon stock tanks) are known from other
conventional oil and gas projects in the vicinity of the CD-C project area. However, an undetermined
number of active nest sites would not be protected by application of the BLM timing stipulation and 1­
mile buffer on state and fee lands/minerals, especially in the “checkerboard.” Overall, because of the
required buffers and restrictions on activity around raptor nests and because of the fact that most of the
prey utilize habitat that can be reclaimed in a timely fashion, the impact on ferruginous hawks in the
project area and associated RFFA overlap areas is not expected to exceed the significance criteria.
Sensitive Fish Species. Cumulative impacts to sensitive fish species would include the effects of the CD­
C project and other developments upstream in Muddy Creek, of which the most notable is the Atlantic
Rim Natural Gas Project. At this time there are no known additional proposals to analyze or assess.
Sensitive fish, described in Section 4.9, would be significantly impacted by both the CD-C and Atlantic
Rim projects (Criteria 3 and 4). The types of impacts resulting from both projects would be similar and
cumulative in their effects. The primary cause of impacts would be increases in suspended sediments and
sedimentation. One difference in the Atlantic Rim project as compared to the CD-C project is that
Atlantic Rim has produced-water discharges to Muddy Creek that may be altering the hydrology of the
creek.
Impoundments downstream of the CD-C project may be blocking sensitive fish movement into Muddy
Creek, but are not attributable to the CD-C project. As detailed in Chapter 4, additional impoundments
and alterations to natural flow characteristics (such as crossings) within Muddy Creek could have serious
additional impacts to fish populations. Alteration of hydrology from roads, culverts, and other
disturbances that result in re-channeling of overland flows into new channels or increasing the
intensity/volume of flows within existing channels can affect sensitive fish. Blockage of fish migration
within the CD-C project area as a result of channel crossings would seriously impact the viability of fish
populations if it should occur.

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Alternative B, the Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative for the Muddy Creek Corridor/ Watershed
described in Section 2.2.3.4 could significantly reduce project impacts to sensitive fish species, if they
were applied to both BLM and private and state land within the CD-C project area. Without the
application of these protections to private and state land, however, the benefits of these enhanced resource
protections could be negated by increased drilling activities on private and state land. Consequently,
alteration of fish habitat suitability from increases in suspended sediments and sedimentation could result
in significant impacts to sensitive fish species.
5.9.5

Sensitive Plant Species

The CIAA for sensitive plants is the CD-C project area. As described in Section 4.9.3, direct impacts to
sensitive plant species on federal land are unlikely to occur because the potential presence of these species
would be determined by soils survey or rare-plant surveys prior to site development. Management
practices identified on a case-by-case basis would be applied to surface-disturbing activities to maintain
or enhance Special Status Plant Species and their habitats (BLM 2008b, p. 2-47). Indirect impacts include
dust affecting plant health and reproduction and invasive species being introduced in the adjacent habitat
and competing with the sensitive plants.
Adjacent projects that could increase the dust and invasive species problem within the CD-C project area
include Atlantic Rim on the east of the project area, Desolation Flats on the southwest, and Luman Rim
on the northwest. Additionally, three transmission-line projects are proposed to cross the project area and
vehicles/equipment associated with the planning and construction of those projects would provide other
potential sources of dust and seed. The only sensitive plant that might be encountered during
transmission-line construction is the Gibben’s beardtongue. The surveys mentioned above should ensure
that these plants, if encountered, would be avoided. The protections applied to sensitive species plants
relative to BLM actions are not applicable to state and fee energy development actions.

5.10

WILD HORSES

The CIAA for wild horses includes the Lost Creek and Adobe Creek Herd Management Areas (HMAs).
Impacts to wild horses associated with the CD-C project would include disturbed land and associated loss
of available forage along with dust affecting forage palatability. There is also the potential for
horse/vehicle collisions.
The Adobe Town HMA is generally located within the Desolation Flats Natural Gas Project area and
impacts to the herd are more likely to happen in that area than in the CD-C project area. Two of the
proposed transmission lines have potential routes through the Adobe Town HMA. During planning and
construction, increased activity along their alignments would increase chances for collisions and
generation of dust and remove small amounts of forage at the tower sites.
The Lost Creek HMA is located in the northwestern portion of the CD-C project area. It continues north
from the CD-C boundary. The Luman Rim field is located to the west of the HMA and effects from
vehicles accessing that field through the CD-C are possible. The Lost Creek HMA may also receive
impacts from traffic associated with the Lost Creek Uranium Project.

5.11

VISUAL RESOURCES

The CIAA for visual resources is the VRM Class III area within the CD-C project area. At roughly 1.1
million acres, the project area is large enough to enclose virtually all the potential foreground to
middleground views of VRM Class III.
VRM Class III is the highest management classification within the project area. For the combination of
landscape quality and viewer sensitivities prevalent within the project area, identifying visual impacts that
might dominate a foreground to middleground view is critical to evaluating management actions for
compliance with the VRM Class III standard. As described in Section 4.11.2, the RFO manages VRM
Class III land for moderate change to visual resources by mitigating impacts through the use of BMPs as
conditions of approval to APDs and right-of-way permits.
Cumulative actions that could affect VRM Class III in the CD-C project area are oil and gas development
and electrical transmission line systems and rights-of-way. Development on BLM land combined with the
same or similar actions on state and private land would result in cumulative visual impacts. Cumulative
impacts would be especially likely to occur in the checkerboard and other areas of mixed ownership
because BLM does not have the jurisdiction to mitigate these actions.
Cumulative impacts due to oil and gas development
Cumulative impacts due to oil and gas development would occur within the CIAA solely because of the
CD-C project alternatives. No major oil and gas developments listed in Table 5.0-1 overlap the CIAA.
Consistent with the analysis in Chapter 4, the greatest potential for cumulative impacts to visual resources
from oil and gas development in the CIAA would occur under Alternative A, which would allow the
highest level of surface disturbance.
Alternatives B through D would reduce the amount of surface disturbance due to oil and gas
development. Alternative E, No Action, would generate no new surface disturbance. Alternative D would
cause the least amount of surface disturbance among the action alternatives (as described in Section
4.11.3.5) by requiring the Operators to drill multiple wells from a single pad; multiple-well pads would
not be required under the Proposed Action or other alternatives. Under Alternative E, much of the project
area now affected by oil and gas development could gradually return to a reclaimed condition as oil and
gas facilities on BLM land gradually become obsolete over time; therefore, the cumulative effect of
Alternative E to scenic quality could be neutral to positive over the long term.
The actual visual contrast rating of wells, roads, and other facilities of the Proposed Action and action
alternatives would be conducted after approval of the CD-C project, when development targets are
identified and as the required site-specific APDs and right-of-way permits are evaluated. It is the sitespecific location and intensity of development that actually determines the level of contrast perceived
from a given view of the foreground to middle distance from a sensitive observation point. Site-specific
location and intensity of development also determine the amount and type of mitigation required to
achieve the management objective required by VRM Class III. This means that there is likely to be
uncertainty for sometime as to whether cumulative impacts to specific viewsheds within the CIAA can be
managed to a VRM Class III standard for the long term.
Even on federal land, the Operators’ desired intensity and specific location of development could prevail
over attempts to mitigate to a VRM Class III objective. This could occur despite BLM’s mandate to
implement measures to manage VRM Class III viewsheds. The BLM’s authority to manage visual
impacts in particular cases could be precluded when valid existing lease rights protect Operator activities.
This limitation could leave a residual of unmitigated impact. In addition, parts of the CD-C project that
target private and non-federal lands in areas of mixed land ownership are beyond BLM jurisdiction and

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

could develop without adequate mitigation, leading to indirect impacts to visual resources on adjacent
federal land
Developed areas where roads, well pads, tanks, and drill rigs dominate a view may accumulate within the
project area to the detriment of existing rural landscapes that were previously intact. If this level of
disturbance occurs and is viewable from sensitive observation points, the VRM Class III standard would
be exceeded.
Cumulative impacts due to transmission lines
Two electrical transmission line projects listed in Table 5.0-1 would cross VRM Class III parts of the
CD-C project area: the Energy Gateway South Transmission Line Project (Gateway South) and the
TransWest Express 600kV Project (TransWest). A third reasonably foreseeable transmission line from
Table 5.0-1, Energy Gateway West, would cross only VRM Class IV land. Class IV land accommodates
transmission lines by allowing a high level of modification to the existing landscape. Gateway South and
TransWest are extended corridors that potentially would enter into many views as they traverse the CD-C
project area. The three reasonably foreseeable transmission line projects are illustrated in Figure 5.0-1.
The Approved Rawlins RMP has provided for future utility development by designating the routes of
existing transportation and utility lines as corridors that would be suitable for new transportation and
utility ROW systems (ROD Map 2-2). The RMP also recommends the exclusion from the designated
corridors of incompatible uses, among which are range and wildlife habitat improvements and any
facilities “that would attract public use” (ROD p. 2-17). As they are shown on Figure 5.0-1, the
preliminary alternatives for the proposed Gateway South and TransWest fall within designated corridors
identified by the Rawlins RMP (ROD Map 2-2).
Although generally provided for by the Rawlins RMP, specific proposals for the Gateway South and
TransWest projects would require site-specific environmental analysis and compliance with established
permitting processes. Site-specific mitigation measures that could be applied during permitting to reduce
the impact of transmission lines to a viewshed or to a specific observation point within the CD-C project
area include properly siting latticed or appropriately colored towers against existing backgrounds or using
topographical features to reduce visibility.
While effective when available, site-specific mitigation treatments are in fact limited in their utility for
transmission lines because of what is typically the sparse, low-lying vegetation and flatness of the terrain
in the CD-C project area. Therefore, the development of the Gateway South and TransWest projects
would likely introduce strong vertical elements of an industrial character (tower structures) which would
clash with the strong horizontal, natural elements (plains, rims, low vegetation and wide horizons) of
existing settings within the CD-C project area.
The impact of the Gateway South and TransWest projects would likely be greatest where the utility ROW
crosses or parallels travel routes. As shown on Figure 5.0-1, the southern extent of the western-most
route alternative of the two transmission lines would cross interior BLM roads and the corridors of two
historic trails, the Overland Trail and the Cherokee Trail. At those crossings, the transmission lines would
adversely affect the viewshed of the roads and historic trails. Although the historic trail corridors are
designated as “avoidance areas” for linear utility systems by the Rawlins RMP (Map 2-33b), a crossing of
these corridors by a long-distance, north-south transmission line corridor is not explicitly excluded and
may be impossible to avoid.
In addition, the southern extent of the easternmost route alternative of the Gateway South project would
co-locate with the WY 789 corridor. The WY 789 corridor includes, at its south end within the CD-C
project area, two topographical features known as Flat Top Mountain and The Bluffs. Although they are
mostly of local interest to residents of Carbon and Sweetwater counties, these prominent features
contribute to settings of moderate scenic quality, which is the highest level of scenic quality found within
the CD-C project area (BLM 2011a). As prominent features, Flat Top Mountain and The Bluffs are focal

5-36

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

points of foreground to middleground views that present themselves to travelers on WY 789 between
Rawlins and Baggs, Wyoming.
The typical adverse impacts caused by a transmission line project are visual clutter in the foreground to
middleground of a view and the visibility of the tall towers, which are 140 to 190 feet high for highvoltage lines of this type. From many perspectives, tower structures would rise above the CD-C project
area’s horizontal landforms and would likely appear prominently above the project area’s wide skylines,
perhaps competing with prominent natural features. Since high-voltage transmission lines are industrial in
character, introducing such facilities would alter the scenic quality of existing VRM Class III viewsheds
that would be affected by the Gateway South or TransWest projects within the CD-C project area.
Cumulative impacts conclusion
The combination of CD-C project oil and gas development and the development of the Gateway South
and TransWest transmission line right-of-way systems in the area south of I-80 and west of WY 789
could combine to create a high cumulative impact in some viewsheds in the VRM Class III parts of the
CD-C project area. In addition, development of oil and gas facilities throughout the CD-C project area
may expose existing VRM Class III areas to under-mitigated, site-specific visual impacts. These could
accumulate within a given viewshed because of minerals lease terms that limit the BLM’s ability to
mitigate visual impacts or because of the BLM’s lack of jurisdiction over visual resources management in
mixed ownership areas.
Visual impacts from these two kinds of planned or reasonably foreseeable development may add up to a
high enough level of incompatible contrast with existing settings to be non-compliant with VRM Class
III. If this occurs repeatedly in a number of VRM Class III areas of the CIAA, BLM may find it necessary
to reconsider its resource allocation decisions through an RMP amendment process. This could lead in the
future to an amendment of the RMP and a new set of resource allocations that would expressly lower
VRM management classifications as needed to reflect the cumulative impact of development on the
condition of the visual resources of the CIAA.

5.12

RECREATION

The CIAA for recreation is the Western Extensive Recreation Management Area (ERMA) of the RFO.
The CIAA/ERMA covers all public land in the RFO west of Rawlins.
The recreation resources of the CIAA are those of the CD-C project area plus areas beyond the project
area that include more of the same Hunt Areas, big game Herd Units, wild-horse management areas,
contiguous blocks of public lands, and interconnected public roads. These combined resources support the
recreation values of concern for the cumulative impacts analysis, namely big game hunting and dispersed,
non-consumptive recreational uses that center on wild horses, other wildlife, and the character of the
landscape.
Projects potentially affecting recreation in the CIAA are the CD-C project and other projects identified in
Table 5.0-1. Other existing and reasonably foreseeable future projects are the Atlantic Rim Natural Gas
Field Development, the Desolation Flats Natural Gas Development, the Luman Rim natural gas project
and the Sierra Madre part of the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project.
Cumulative impact to hunting, which is the main recreation activity in the CIAA, would occur as surface
disturbance from development of the CD-C and other projects accumulates. Cumulative impact to hunting
recreation begins with displacement of big game species within Hunt Areas because of disturbance to
critical habitat and development activity within those habitats at key times of year. Cumulative impacts to
hunting recreation also may include impacts to big game populations at the herd level of the primary big
game targets in the CD-C project area, pronghorn and mule deer, because of long-term disturbance to
sagebrush habitat.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-37

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

When big game species leave a Hunt Area, hunters soon leave as well, because hunting success declines.
If Herd Units are affected, the animals available for harvest and therefore the supply of hunting
recreation, as reflected in the number of licenses issued, may decline. The potential for cumulative effects
to Hunt Area displacement and potentially reduced availability from the herd is perhaps highest for
pronghorn pronghorn hunting. As indicated by Table 3.8-1, estimated populations in the largest
pronghorn Herd Units of the CIAA (Red Desert Herd Unit north of I-80 and Bitter Creek Herd Unit south
of I-80) had a slightly decreasing population trend from 2001 to 2009 and an estimated population lower
than the objective in 2009. Mule deer also may be affected by cumulative, long-term disturbance of
habitat.
There are also indirect impacts associated with hunting in the CIAA that may arise as development
disturbance and activity accumulate. One is the potential for financial impact to big game outfitters whose
commercial success depends on access to, and hunter success in, the CIAA. Another is potentially lower
hunter safety because of higher accident risk as hunter density rises where displaced game has
concentrated. Finally, some hunters wishing to avoid industrial facilities locations for safety and aesthetic
reasons may find it more difficult to do so as development density rises in the CIAA; this would raise the
likelihood of a lower-quality experience for some recreational hunters.
Relatively undisturbed scenery is an integral part of the recreation experience for activities such as
wildlife viewing. Accumulating development would decrease the availability of this type of recreational
setting throughout the CIAA, so recreationists seeking natural-appearing landscapes would have to travel
elsewhere and perhaps for greater distances as the CD-C and other projects are fully developed over time
and before landscapes are fully reclaimed.
The re-establishment of mature vegetation after final reclamation would take as much as 30 years in some
parts of the CIAA. Localized areas may not achieve successful revegetation for much longer. With project
lives of 45 to 55 years underway or reasonably foreseeable, the CIAA is not likely to be fully reclaimed
for habitat or appearance for 70 to 80 years from its initial status. Long-term cumulative impacts in the
CIAA would be likely to affect from two to four generations of hunters, wildlife viewers, and dispersed
recreational users that value solitude in a natural-appearing landscape.
The greatest cumulative impacts to recreation would occur under Alternative A because of increased
surface disturbance and less protection to visual resources, which contribute to the recreation setting.
Cumulative impacts to recreation would be less under all other action alternatives within the CD-C
project area, which implies lesser impact to the recreation resources of the CIAA as a whole.
Under Alternative E, No Action, the recreation resources of the CD-C project area, which in turn is a
large part of the CIAA for recreation as a whole, could gradually improve as new oil and gas development
is avoided and as existing oil and gas facilities gradually become obsolete over time and are reclaimed.
Under Alternative E, No Action, the recreation resources of the CD-C project area, which in turn is a
large part of the CIAA for recreation as a whole, could gradually improve as new oil and gas development

the project area could occur as a result of the following mineral development projects which overlap the
CD-C project area: Continental Divide, Continental Divide/Wamsutter II, Creston/Blue Gap, and Patrick
Draw. In addition to the Proposed Action, impacts from reasonably foreseeable future actions (Table 5.01) include three transmission lines: the TransWest Express, Gateway West, and Gateway South. The
TransWest Express is proposed to run from Sinclair, Wyoming to southern Nevada. The proposed route
would begin just south of I-80 and east of Rawlins, heading west-southwest into the project area, and
turning south in Sweetwater County toward the Wyoming/Colorado border. In all, the proposed route
would traverse approximately 45–50 miles within the project area. The Gateway West transmission line
from Glenrock, WY to Idaho would bisect the project area from east to west, running to the south of and
roughly paralleling I-80 until approximately 10 miles from the western boundary, where it would turn
northwest across I-80, and then west toward Rock Springs. Approximately 72 miles of the route would lie
within the project area. The Gateway South transmission lines would also originate in Glenrock,
following the same route as Gateway West into the project area, and then splitting into multiple routes
running south toward Nevada (Map 5.0-1). In all, approximately 140 miles of routes would cross the
southern portion of the project area. Assessment of impacts from these transmission lines would be
speculative at this time since the final routes have not been approved.
Given the average site density of .04 cultural sites per acre, approximately 1,888 sites could be located
within accumulated disturbance areas for the Proposed Action compared to 2,467 for Alternative A; 1,821
sites for Alternative B; 1,718 sites for Alternative C; 1,458 sites for Alternative D; and no sites for
Alternative E, No Action. It should be noted that sites are not evenly dispersed throughout the study area,
but are typically found along the major drainages and lower benches of escarpments that dominate the
terrain in the project area.
In addition, segments of the Cherokee and Overland Trails, the Lincoln Highway/Union Pacific Grade,
and the historic Rawlins-Baggs Road traverse the project area. These segments, including those that
contribute to overall eligibility for listing on the NRHP, are summarized in Table 5.14-1.

As directed by law, cultural resources inventories and consultations would be conducted for any projects
involving federal lands, and adverse effects to NRHP-eligible sites would be avoided or mitigated as
appropriate. All activities associated with the Proposed Action would be in accordance with federal laws
and agency guidelines. Impacts to any previously unknown NRHP-eligible sites that may be discovered
during construction activities would be mitigated in accordance with this EIS. Although sites located
within disturbance areas are avoided or mitigated, sites located outside of and adjacent to disturbance
areas are vulnerable to indirect impacts such as vandalism, illegal collection, dust, and erosion. It is
anticipated that there would be a cumulative increase in vandalism, illegal collection, and dust due to the
increase in roads throughout the entire natural gas field, and increased erosion at sites located in the
vicinity of well pads and associated pipelines where vegetation cover has been reduced or eliminated.

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

5.15

SOCIOECONOMICS

The CIAA for socioeconomic conditions includes Carbon and Sweetwater Counties. Given Rock Springs’
position as a regional service center for the natural gas industry in southwest Wyoming, the indirect
effects of past, ongoing, and reasonably foreseeable future effects of regional natural gas development are
also considered.
Within the project area, 224 new wells were drilled during 2010 and an estimated 3,738 wells were in
production at the end of 2010. Production activities, maintenance and workover expenditures,
employment, and tax revenue generation associated with these wells will be ongoing, regardless of which
alternative is selected by the BLM. Because much of the infrastructure to support this level of drilling and
production is in place, ongoing production activities, expenditures, and employment associated with wells
currently in production are considered part of both the baseline and cumulative effects analyses.
Past and current natural gas drilling and production in the project area and elsewhere in the CIAA have
resulted in the development of substantial infrastructure capable of supporting future development and
production. In some cases this infrastructure has excess capacity relative to the current (mid-2011) levels
of development. Examples of infrastructure put in place to support past and ongoing development include
the natural gas operator and service company operations yards in Rock Springs, Wamsutter, Rawlins and
Baggs, described in Section 3.15.1.1, as well as pipelines, service roads, and other ancillary facilities.
Past and ongoing activities have also resulted in human resource development, such as a cadre of
employees in natural gas drilling, production, and support companies. Finally, natural-resource and other
industrial development has supported construction and operation of substantial commercial and public
infrastructure in communities in the CIAA. This industrial, human, commercial, and public infrastructure
is capable of supporting a certain level of ongoing and future natural resource and industrial development
activity and serves as a base for expansion of capacities to support higher levels of development.
A number of the reasonably foreseeable projects identified in Table 5.0-1 require regulatory approval to
proceed. If approved, the wind energy, transmission line, and other projects could contribute to
cumulative socioeconomic effects in specific areas of the CIAA. The potential for adverse cumulative
effects such as labor force competition, housing shortages, and strained community infrastructure and
services would occur primarily in the event of concurrent construction of these projects. The potential
beneficial cumulative effects, including increases in tax revenues, would be longer-term.
In contrast, the reasonably foreseeable natural gas projects, both currently approved and as yet
unapproved, would contribute to cumulative socioeconomic effects over longer time periods and would
affect socioeconomic conditions in a broader portion of the CIAA.
Although each of the natural gas projects identified in Table 5.0-1 has or will have an assumed pace of
drilling and development identified in the relevant NEPA document, as noted in Section 4.15.2, the actual
pace of natural gas development in southwest Wyoming is variable and unpredictable because
development depends on a variety of factors including energy demand, pricing, regulatory approvals, rig
and manpower availability, transmission pipeline capacity, weather, and the investment and development
strategies of individual energy companies. Consequently, the potential for cumulative socioeconomic
effects would be greater during extended periods of natural gas demand.
In the eastern portion of the CIAA, identified cumulative projects by 2020 include construction of the
proposed Chokecherry and Sierra Madre (CCSM) Wind Energy Project, the Gateway West, Gateway
South and TransWest Express transmission line projects, the Lost Creek In Situ Uranium Project, and the
Medicine Bow Fuel & Power Coal-to-Liquids (CTL) Project.
The proposed CCSM Wind Project would primarily affect the Rawlins portion of the socioeconomic
CIAA, although some construction workers might also seek housing in Rock Springs and the Wamsutter
and Baggs areas. Due to timing stipulations related to wildlife, active construction would likely occur

5-40

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

during a six-month period of three or four consecutive years, with 800 to 1,200 construction workers
during the peak periods. Consequently, the potential for adverse temporary and short-term cumulative
socioeconomic effects during construction would be high. Once construction is complete, socioeconomic
effects would be largely beneficial.
Construction of the TransWest Express, Gateway West and Gateway South transmission line projects
could each affect one or more communities in the region, depending on routing, as the construction
workforce moves through the area over one or two construction seasons. The effects would again be
associated with demand for housing, community services, and fiscal effects related to project activity and
the construction workforces. Operating work-force requirements of the wind energy and transmission
lines are substantially smaller than the construction workforce needs.
The Lost Creek In Situ Uranium Project would affect Bairoil and Rawlins during construction and
operation.
The Medicine Bow Fuel & Power CTL Project, a combination mining and industrial project, could create
cumulative socioeconomic effects in Rawlins and other communities in Carbon and Albany Counties
located outside the CIAA. This large project poses a potential for cumulative socioeconomic effects in
Rawlins during the multi-year construction phase and initial staffing period for project operation. Once
full-scale operations begin and housing and public infrastructure and services are in place to serve
demand, the socioeconomic effects would be largely beneficial.
The Bridger Mine expansion and proposed Sweeney Ranch, White Mountain, and Bridger Butte wind
energy projects would primarily affect western Sweetwater County and the communities of Rock Springs
and Green River. In the case of the Bridger Butte project, Uinta County and its communities could also be
affected. The expansion of the Bridger Mine is ongoing and most socioeconomic effects of the project
were considered in the baseline. Adverse socioeconomic effects of the wind energy projects would occur
primarily during construction, with beneficial effects occurring as tax revenues began to flow to local and
state governments.
The final construction schedules for the proposed wind energy, transmission line, mining and other
projects listed in Table 5.0-1 will not be known until they receive the required authorizations, approvals,
and financing. It is also not possible to predict with accuracy the level of natural gas drilling that will
occur in southwest Wyoming during the construction period for these projects.
If construction for all or some of these projects were to overlap concurrently with an increase in natural
gas drilling levels to 2007–2008 levels, another “boom” could ensue in the CIAA. In that case,
cumulative impacts on area socioeconomic conditions would include short-term and long-term positive
effects on local economic conditions, increased employment opportunities and increased local and state
government tax royalties.
Adverse effects would include demand for temporary and long-term housing resources that substantially
exceed local supplies, demand for local government services that exceed some service capacities, and
changes in local social conditions that could include social disruption in some communities. Increased
employment opportunities in relatively high-paying construction and energy-development jobs would
result in competition for workers to the detriment of existing businesses and government agencies that
could lose existing employees and experience difficulty recruiting new employees. On the other hand,
workers would benefit from the increased wages that would result from this competition, while
simultaneously potentially facing higher costs of living.
Shortfalls in temporary housing availability could be mitigated by development of temporary housing
facilities. Medicine Bow Fuel & Power has proposed such facilities to accommodate construction workers
on its CTL Project and the Power Company of Wyoming has indicated it would consider providing such
facilities for CCSM. It is also becoming increasingly common for natural gas Operators and drilling

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-41

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

companies to develop temporary housing; three such facilities, several rig camps, and the placement of
dormitory units in local mobile-home parks were operational near the project area in 2007–2008.
The pace of residential construction in most communities in the CIAA would need to increase
substantially to accommodate cumulative demand for longer-term housing units, were several of the
projects listed in Table 5.0-1 to overlap with an increase in natural gas development activities.
Demands on housing and local government services associated with some of the wind energy and
transmission line projects and natural gas development would be seasonal, presenting staffing challenges
for counties and communities. Excess capacity exists in many public-utility infrastructure systems (e.g.,
water and wastewater systems) in the communities that would likely host the bulk of the construction and
natural gas development workforce. Recent experience in the CIAA has been that relatively few families
and school-age children have accompanied construction and natural gas workers to the area;
consequently, local school districts could likely accommodate cumulative enrollment with existing
facilities in the near term. In the longer term some schools may need to add or expand facilities and the
lead-time to secure approval and funding from the Wyoming School Facilities Commission and plan and
construct school facilities could mean that certain facilities would experience crowding until new
facilities are available.
Community services such as law enforcement, emergency response, social services, and road and bridge
departments, which in some cases experienced reductions in funding levels, service provision, and staff
cutbacks in recent years, would initially face constraints in responding to increased demand. For most
projects, local receipts of sales and use tax revenues lag the increases in demand. In other cases, a
jurisdictional mismatch could occur between jurisdictions benefitting from tax revenue accrual and those
facing the demands. This lack of revenue, coupled with competition for workers and the difficulty in
staffing for seasonal demand, would present substantial challenges for local governments in the early
years of a boom.
When ad valorem and production-related revenues—and for wind energy projects, energy production tax
revenues—begin to flow from the cumulative projects, counties and special districts (and in some
instances, school districts) will benefit from substantially increased revenues. However, municipalities
will not benefit directly from these revenues.
Cumulative development in the CIAA also holds potential to affect local attitudes, opinions, and lifestyles
and these effects are likely to be mixed. Development of the wind energy, transmission line, mining, and
other projects listed in Table 5.0-1, coupled with a moderate increase in natural gas development, would
result in economic growth and increased employment opportunities in relatively high-paying jobs. These
changes would create the prospect for improved financial status of many residents, which would
correspondingly increase support for cumulative development activities, particularly among those
segments of the community that would benefit directly or indirectly from the increased economic activity.
On the other hand, dissatisfaction may occur among those residents whose economic activities and/or
recreation activities rely on use of the same geographical areas as the Proposed Action and projects listed
in Table 5.0-1, including ranchers, grazing operators, outfitters, hunters, and other recreationists.
Moreover, if area residents perceive that wildlife habitat, scenic vistas, and other resources are being
degraded by development, levels of dissatisfaction could become greater and more widespread.
Given the cyclical nature of natural gas development and the potential for other energy development to
occur, it is difficult to predict development and associated population levels with any certainty. Following
population gains in response to cumulative construction activities, population in the CIAA would decline
as construction is completed, perhaps dramatically in the event of multiple concurrent construction
schedules. Exceptions to this pattern would include the mining projects and the Medicine Bow Fuel &
Power CTL project, which have relatively large operating workforce requirements. If employment and
population were to fall dramatically, businesses that expanded or opened to accommodate the temporary
population influx would need to transition to accommodate the decreased demand. Some business

5-42

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

closures would be likely. Effects on area housing conditions could range from moderate to severe,
depending on whether the construction and natural gas development demands were accommodated in
temporary housing or if housing to accommodate the temporary workforce was developed with a postboom use in mind. In those cases, communities in the CIAA could reduce the amount of unoccupied
temporary housing after construction is completed or if a slowdown in natural gas development were to
occur. Similarly, the fact that most community infrastructure including water and sewer systems is
already in place should help communities avoid substantial debt that would be difficult to service when
population levels decrease.

5.16

TRANSPORTATION

The CIAA for transportation includes western Carbon County, eastern Sweetwater County, and the
highway transportation network providing access to and within the project area. Cumulative effects on
transportation would include changes in traffic volumes. These changes, when combined with traffic
associated with the CD-C project, would affect overall travel conditions on the CIAA transportation
network. Past, ongoing, and reasonably foreseeable activities expected to produce incremental and
cumulative impacts within the CIAA are summarized in Table 5.0-1.
Historic and ongoing traffic within the project area is associated primarily with natural gas drilling and
production, grazing, and outdoor recreation. Within the project area, 224 new wells were drilled during
2010 and an estimated 3,738 wells were in production at the end of 2010. Production-related traffic
associated with these wells will continue for their remaining productive life and during abandonment and
reclamation, regardless of which alternative is selected by the BLM. Using the trip-generation factors
developed for this assessment, an estimated 726 AADT would be associated with drilling under the
Proposed Action in the peak year and an estimated 798 AADT associated with production activities in the
peak year.
Within the project area, the reasonably foreseeable actions that could result in cumulative transportation
impacts would be the previously authorized Desolation Flats and Luman Rim natural gas projects.
Two county roads serving the project area also provide access to the Desolation Flats project area
(DFPA): SCR 23/CCR 701 (Wamsutter–Dad Road) and CCR 700. Although these two roads have served
development in both the project area and the DFPA for years, incremental increases in traffic on these
roads could occur if natural gas demand and prices support an acceleration of drilling and fielddevelopment activities.
Cumulative effects on county roads associated with the Luman Rim project are not anticipated. Primary
access to the Luman Rim project area (LRPA) from I-80 is via SCR 21, which is outside the project area.
It is possible to access the LRPA via two roads that traverse the CD-C project area; SCR 67 travels north
from I-80 and intersects with SCR 20, which then exits the project area to the west and intersects with
SCR 21 south of the LRPA. However, the longer travel distance from I-80 associated with this route
discourages its use to access the LRPA for all but contractors and vendors who may be traveling to/from
the LRPA from other job worksites within the CD-C project area.
All of the projects listed in Table 5.0-1 could generate traffic increases on I-80, particularly during
construction, although some of the affected sections of I-80 would be outside of the CIAA. Under an
accelerated drilling scenario, periods of traffic impedance and congestion could be anticipated, and some
increases in the number of accidents could be anticipated. Cumulative traffic effects could also increase
road maintenance requirements for WYDOT and for both county road and bridge departments.
The highest volume of incremental traffic on I-80 would likely be in conjunction with the CCSM Wind
Energy project, proposed for development south of Rawlins. Materials, equipment and supplies deliveries
for the CCSM project are anticipated to arrive by rail and be offloaded at an intermodal facility located

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-43

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

either southeast of Sinclair or on the south side of I-80 west of Sinclair, which would result in relatively
little cumulative truck traffic on I-80. However, daily commuting by workers and others, including trips
by contractors, would result in incremental traffic on I-80. One option under consideration by the Power
Company of Wyoming includes housing construction workers in Rock Springs and Laramie. Workers
commuting from/to these communities to the CCSM project area would contribute to cumulative traffic
effects on I-80 between Rock Springs and Rawlins or east of Rawlins for six to eight months during each
of the anticipated four-year construction periods. These effects would be minimal given the substantial
baseline volumes of traffic on I-80 in these locations.
The Medicine Bow Fuel & Power CTL Project and the Sweeney Ranch, White Mountain, and Bridger
Butte wind energy projects are all located some distance from the project area. The TransWest Express,
Gateway West and Gateway South transmission line corridors projects pass through the project area, and
some substations and ancillary facilities may also be located within the project area. Construction
equipment, supplies, and materials for these projects could be transported by rail or, for the CTL project
and some segments of the transmission projects, via US 30 from Laramie. Transport of materials,
equipment, and supplies to these projects would also occur on I-80 and, when considered in conjunction
with the forecast traffic for CD-C, would generate cumulative traffic increases on the highway. Large
increases would occur primarily during construction of these projects and would therefore be temporary
and short-term in nature.
Construction and operations of the Lost Creek In-Situ Uranium Project could contribute to cumulative
traffic impacts along I-80, although materials coming from the north—e.g., from Casper—would likely
access the Lost Creek project via US 287. Construction and operations materials coming from the east or
west on I-80 would travel through Rawlins to access US 287, and a portion of the project’s construction
and operations workforce would likely reside in Rawlins. Both of these scenarios would result in
cumulative transportation effects within the city if the Lost Creek project’s construction schedules were to
coincide with natural gas development within the CD-C project area. Given the relatively minor increases
in CD-C-related traffic anticipated for US 287, no substantial adverse cumulative impacts are anticipated.
Development associated with the previously approved Atlantic Rim Natural Gas Field Development
Project would also use WY 789 to access the western portions of its project area. Cumulative
transportation impacts would be anticipated for WY 789 between Creston Junction and Baggs,
particularly during periods when market conditions promote higher levels of new development activity in
the Atlantic Rim and CD-C project areas. Under an accelerated drilling scenario, periods of traffic
impedance and congestion could be anticipated, particularly around the Dad area.
All of the natural gas projects listed in Table 5.0-1 would generate additional traffic on I-80. If there were
a regional acceleration of drilling and development in response to sustained high sales prices for natural
gas, those increases could be substantial.

5.17

NOISE

The CIAA for the discussion of Noise is limited to the CD-C project area due to the localized nature of
this issue. Noise will continue to be generated by project area operations for the life of the field.
Cumulative impacts of the Proposed Action and action alternatives include the addition of developmentand production-related noise sources to those that already exist within the project area. These noise
sources include, but are not limited to the I-80 corridor, the railroad, gas compression, fluid transport by
truck, gas-stabilization equipment, hydrocarbon production, and maintenance activities. In some areas the
density of development could be considered by some individuals to be “noisy.” This continual (though
likely low-level) noise may be disruptive or objectionable to individuals such as recreationists or livestock
operators and may result in displacement of such activities. Displacement of wildlife in general and

5-44

sensitive wildlife species may also occur in “busy” or “noisy” areas in the greater CD-C fielddevelopment area; refer to Sections 5.8 and 5.9 for this discussion.



MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT

5.18

RANGE RESOURCES

The CIAA for range management includes the entire area of all of the allotments that are located within or
partially within the CD-C project area. The number of well pads projected for the action alternatives
varies from a high of 8,950 under Alternative A (100-Percent Vertical Drilling) to a low of 4,032 in
Alternative D (Directional Drilling). Many of the allotments in the southern portion of the CD-C project
area cross the project boundary into other natural gas developments (Atlantic Rim on the east and
Desolation Flats on the west). One allotment managed by the Rock Springs Field Office has minimal
acreage within the CD-C project area, as well as acreage in the Luman Rim natural gas project.
Those allotments that cross into the other project areas would have impacts from both natural gas projects
including forage loss, reduced palatability of forage from dust, potential damage to fences and other
improvements, possible increase in invasive plant species that can out-compete native vegetation and
poison sheep, possible collisions, and increased difficulty in management of stock (gates left open, etc.).
Depending on the location of well pads and the number of locations and associated facilities, some of the
allotments may reach the level of significance for loss of AUMs described in Section 4.18.2. Surfacedisturbance totals described in Table 3.18-2 would likely be higher for allotments that are affected by
developments in addition to the CD-C project. It is possible that in these allotments, the combination of
impacts from several projects could result in the loss of AUMs that reached the level of significance,
which if not mitigated by range-improvement projects, could result in a reduced number of livestock
being permitted on the allotment.
Construction of the three transmission lines planned to cross the CD-C project area and development of
adjacent oil and gas fields may cause many of the same indirect impacts identified above and would
increase overall impacts on the affected allotments.

5.19

OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERALS

The CIAA for oil and gas and other minerals is southwestern Wyoming. The natural gas fields of the CD­
C project area make up the largest single—but not the only—source of oil and gas in the analysis area.
The Atlantic Rim, Desolation Flats, Luman Rim, Table Rock, Moxa Arch, and Hiawatha project areas are
among the other sites of fluid mineral development in the analysis area. The production from all these
project areas is transported out of the analysis area by pipeline to national markets. Many of the same
Operators that develop natural gas in the CD-C project area also work in other fields in the analysis area.
Employees, facilities, and infrastructure of one Operator are often utilized in support of various projects
within the analysis area.

5.20

HEALTH AND SAFETY

The cumulative impacts analysis area for the discussion of Health and Safety includes all Reasonably
Foreseeable Future Actions listed in Table 5.0-1. Two aspects of safety—increased traffic and additional
natural gas pipeline construction—are common to all activities across southern Wyoming. These issues
are long-term in duration and would continue as part of project area operations for the life of the field,
approximately 45 to 55 years.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

5-45

CHAPTER 5—CUMULATIVE IMPACTS

Cumulative impacts of the Proposed Action would include the addition of vehicles associated with natural
gas development and the other reasonably foreseeable activities to the interstate highway and local road
systems. The additive number of semi-truck rigs and passenger vehicles would add to the risk of collision
for the project workforce as well as the general public. I-80 will continue to be a major east/west
transportation corridor for all aspects of transportation including materials needed for continued gas-field
development and operations, as well as transportation of materials from the field including produced
condensate, produced water, and solid wastes; refer to Section 5.16 Transportation and Access for this
discussion.
Natural gas pipelines may be constructed or enlarged to accommodate the volume of gas being produced
across the southern tier of Wyoming. Conversely, as fields are depleted, gas production declines and
pipelines may be abandoned; refer to Section 5.16 for this discussion.

5.21

WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT

The cumulative impacts analysis area for the discussion of Waste and Hazardous Materials Management
includes all Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions listed in Table 5.0-1. Wastes will continue to be
generated and hazardous materials will continue to be used in the project area operations for
approximately 45 to 55 years, the anticipated life of the field.
Cumulative impacts of the Proposed Action include: the addition of wastes generated from 15 years of
operating man camps, drilling and completion of 8,950 additional wells, and the associated produced
water. Over its lifetime the project would add significantly to the volume of solid waste, drilling and
completion operations wastes, and produced water, as well as to the wastes generated from well-site and
pipeline compression and liquids stabilization facilities. The need to appropriately dispose of these wastes
would significantly stress the existing permitted capacity of local municipal and third-party disposal
facilities and would necessitate the permitting and construction of additional disposal facilities in
proximity to the project area. The cumulative impacts would be similar for all the analyzed alternatives,
although at a reduced level for the No Action alternative.

6. CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION
6.1

INTRODUCTION

An EIS must be prepared when a federal government agency considers approving an action within its
jurisdiction that may impact the human environment. An EIS aids federal officials in making decisions by
presenting information on the physical, biological, and social environment of a proposed project and its
alternatives. The first step in preparing an EIS is to determine the scope of the project, the range of action
alternatives, and the impacts to be included in the document.
The Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500–1508) require an early scoping
process to determine the issues related to the Proposed Action and alternatives that the EIS should
address. The purpose of the scoping process is to identify important issues, concerns, and potential
impacts that require analysis in the EIS and to eliminate insignificant issues and alternatives from detailed
analysis.
This EIS was prepared by the BLM RFO in Rawlins, Wyoming. A third-party contractor was used by the
BLM to conduct studies, gather data, and prepare documents. Cooperating agencies for the Continental
Divide-Creston project include the State of Wyoming, Sweetwater County, Little Snake River
Conservation District, and the Sweetwater County Conservation District.

6.2

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

The scoping process for this project is described in detail in Section 1.9, Public Participation, beginning
on page 1-12 of this EIS.
During preparation of the EIS, the BLM and the consultant interdisciplinary team (IDT) have
communicated with, and received or solicited input from, cooperating agencies; other federal, state,
county, and local agencies; elected representatives; environmental and citizen groups; industries; and
individuals potentially concerned with issues regarding the Proposed Action. The contacts made are
summarized in the following sections. The following organizations/individuals either provided comment

and land use effects that typify a land unit and influence the visual appeal the unit may have for viewers.
Visual Resource Management (VRM): A system of visual management used by the BLM. The program
has a dual purpose—to manage the quality of the visual environment, and to reduce the visual impact of
development activities while maintaining effectiveness in all BLM resource programs. VRM also
identifies scenic areas that warrant protection through special management attention. The system uses
four classes for categorizing visual resources.
Class I —Natural ecological changes and limited management activity are allowed. Any contrasts
created within the characteristic landscape must not attract attention. This classification is applied to
wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, and other similar situations.

Class II —Changes in any of the basic elements (form, line, color, texture) caused by a management
activity should not be evident in the characteristic landscape. Contrasts are seen but must not attract
attention.
Class III—Contrasts to the basic elements caused by a management activity are evident but should
remain subordinate to the existing landscape.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BP America Production Company (BP), representing itself and more than 20 other natural gas
development companies (collectively referred to as the “Operators”), has submitted a proposal to the U.S.
Department of the Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Rawlins Field Office (RFO) to
expand development of natural gas and condensate resources within two previously developed project
areas described as the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II and Creston/Blue Gap project areas. The BLM
has designated the new consolidated proposal the Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) Natural Gas
Development Project.
The RFO has determined that the proposed project constitutes a major federal action requiring preparation
of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This EIS serves the purpose of disclosing and analyzing
impacts resulting from the development proposed within the CD-C project area with consideration of
identified and applied Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Conditions of Approval (COAs). A
summary of these BMPs and COAs is included in Appendix C.
The CD-C project area consists of approximately 1.1 million acres (1,672 square miles) in an existing
gas-producing region between Rock Springs and Rawlins, Wyoming and bisected by Interstate 80 (Map
ES-1). The project area is located on lands administered by the federal government (626,932 acres, 58.6
percent) and the State of Wyoming (48,684 acres, 4.5 percent), as well as private lands (394,470 acres,
36.9 percent), in Carbon and Sweetwater Counties. The central portion of the CD-C project area has a
checkerboard pattern of mixed land ownership produced by grants made by the federal government in the
19th century to the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) Company to spur construction of the transcontinental
railroad.
The Operators propose drilling up to 8,950 infill natural gas wells with a potential surface disturbance of
47,200 acres (4.4 percent of the project area). The precise locations of the wells have not been identified
at this time but the Operators anticipate drilling at well densities of up to one well per 40 acres. Wells
may be drilled conventionally with a vertical well bore on a single pad or with multiple directional bores
from a single pad. The proposed project includes construction and operation of ancillary facilities such as:
roads; gas, water, and condensate-gathering pipelines; overhead and buried power lines; and separation,
dehydration, metering, and fluid-storage facilities.
More than 4,400 wells have already been drilled within the CD-C project area under previously
authorized drilling programs; over 500 of those have been plugged and abandoned. Supporting
infrastructure associated with the existing development includes access roads, compressor stations, a
central gas-processing plant, water management facilities (fresh-water wells and evaporation pits,
recycling facilities, and injection wells for produced water disposal), gas and water pipelines, and electric
power lines. Total existing surface disturbance in the project area, including that associated with natural
gas and other development, is estimated at 60,176 acres (5.6 percent of the project area).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PURPOSE AND NEED FOR THE ACTION
The BLM’s purpose and need is to determine the conditions under which the applicant’s exercise of valid
existing rights from federal oil and gas leases within the CD-C project area may be developed in
accordance with its multiple-use mandate, the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) of 1920 as amended by the
Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), and the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Reform Act of 1987. The MLA, as amended, provides that exploration and development of
domestic oil and gas is in the best interest of the United States. The intent of the MLA and its
implementing regulations is to allow, and essentially encourage, lessees or potential lessees to explore for
oil and gas or other mineral reserves on federally-administered lands. The BLM will consider approval of
the proposed drilling in a manner that reduces impacts on water, wildlife, and other resources throughout
the CD-C project area, consistent with the lease rights granted to the applicant.

SCOPING AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
The BLM conducted two public and internal scoping processes to solicit input and identify environmental
issues and concerns associated with the proposed project. The first responded to a proposal by operators
of the Creston/Blue Gap project to expand drilling in that project area, under what was titled the
Creston/Blue Gap II project. A Notice of Intent (NOI) for the Creston/Blue Gap II proposal was published
in the Federal Register on September 8, 2005. A public meeting was held at the Jeffrey Center in Rawlins
on October 13, 2005, and the official scoping period ended November 15, 2005.
Shortly after the Creston/Blue Gap II scoping process was completed, BP submitted a proposal for
additional drilling in the Continental Divide/Wamsutter II project area. The BLM decided to combine the
two projects and prepare a single EIS. The NOI for the combined Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas
Development Project was published in the Federal Register on March 3, 2006. The BLM prepared a
scoping notice and provided copies to the public, other government agencies, and Tribes. The notice
included information on scoping and announcement of an open house, which was held at the Jeffrey
Center in Rawlins on April 6, 2006. The official scoping period ended May 5, 2006.
The BLM also invited other federal, state, and local government agencies to participate in the EIS process
as cooperating agencies. The State of Wyoming, Sweetwater County, the Little Snake River Conservation
District, and the Sweetwater County Conservation District requested and received Cooperating Agency
status.
Written comments received during both public scoping periods consisted of 50 comment letters from
federal and state agencies, non-government organizations, and one Tribe, as well as individuals and
private corporations.
Key issues and concerns identified through scoping are discussed and addressed in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of
this document, and include the following:





Air Quality: What are the potential project and cumulative impacts on air quality, including Air
Quality Related Values (AQRV)?
Cultural resources: Estimate the effects on the historic trails and transportation corridors in the
project area.
Water resources: What is the potential for degradation of water quality by project construction and
drilling activities? What are the issues related to disposal of produced water associated with coalbed
methane production?
Land ownership as it affects mitigation: Opportunities to reduce impacts through mitigation may be
complicated by land ownership patterns in the checkerboard.

will use the public comment process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to comply
with the public consultation requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES
Chapter 2 of the EIS describes the Operators’ Proposed Action, four development alternatives, and the No
Action alternative that are analyzed in the document. In addition to the four development alternatives
carried forward for analysis in this EIS, two other development alternatives were considered but
dismissed from detailed analysis.
Proposed Action. Under the Proposed Action, up to 8,950 additional natural gas wells would be drilled
from an estimated 6,126 well pads. Spacing of well pads would vary according to location within the
project area. An estimated 42 percent of the future wells would be located on multiple-well pads and
drilled to formation directionally. To fully develop the targeted resources, the Operators would
collectively drill the new wells at the rate of approximately 600 wells per year over a period of 15 years.
The productive life of each well is estimated to be 30 to 40 years. Combining well life with a 15-year
production period produces a potential project life of 45 to 55 years. In support of the new wells, the
Operators would construct additional access roads, pipelines, overhead and buried electric power lines, a
gas processing facility, water management and disposal facilities, and equipment storage facilities. The
total new surface disturbance for the Proposed Action would be an estimated 47,200 acres, or about 4.4
percent of the project area.
Alternative A: 100-Percent Vertical Drilling. Alternative A examines the possibility that all 8,950 wells
would be drilled vertically from single-well pads. All ancillary elements of the new development would
be the same as the Proposed Action. The estimated surface disturbance for Alternative A is 61,696 acres
(5.8 percent of the project area), a 31-percent increase over the Proposed Action.
Alternative B: Enhanced Resource Protection. The premise of this alternative is that some resources
may be more at risk from intensive natural gas development and thus may require protections and
mitigations beyond the basic measures ordinarily applied. The alternative identifies the following
resources that may be more at risk from natural gas development:


Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




The Muddy Creek and Bitter Creek corridors and watersheds,
Chain Lakes alkaline wetland communities and other playas, and
Livestock forage.

Each resource has basic protections provided by RFO Resource Management Plan (RMP) requirements,
BMPs, COAs, and on right-of-way grants. This alternative would add enhanced protections to each
Application for Permit to Drill (APD) or right-of-way grant on BLM-administered lands and federal
mineral estate in the appropriate habitat or area of the identified resource. One of the enhanced
protections would require that APDs in most of the identified habitats above be submitted as part of a
development plan whose aim is to limit overall impacts. For some resources, further protections and
mitigations would be applied only if a threshold were reached. These thresholds are defined for a specific
percentage of habitat loss—usually 5 or 10 percent of a lease—and for a reduction of a species population
to an unacceptable level.
The estimated surface disturbance for the Enhanced Resource Protection Alternative is 45,516 acres
(about 4.3 percent of the project area), slightly less than the Proposed Action.
Alternative C: Surface Disturbance Cap – High and Low Density Development Areas. Under this
alternative the portions of the CD-C project area that have seen the most intensive natural gas
development to date would be designated as high-density development areas (Map 2-1 in the EIS). The
amount of unreclaimed surface disturbance allowed per section of public land in these areas would be
capped at 60 acres at any one time. The remainder of the project area would be designated as low-density
development areas, with an unreclaimed surface disturbance cap of 30 acres per section at any one time.
The 60-acre cap represents the disturbance associated with a 9-well per section drilling program (80-acre
spacing) achieved with vertical wells only, a typical development in the high-density area; a 30-acre cap
represents the disturbance associated with a 16-well per section drilling program (40-acre spacing)
achieved with directional drilling. All prior natural gas surface disturbance committed to long-term use
for roads or on-pad production facilities and all disturbance that had not been successfully reclaimed
would count against the cap. Successfully reclaimed acreage would not count against the cap.
About 44 percent of the CD-C project area would be within the high-density development area. The
average historic surface disturbance within the high-density area is 33 acres per section, with an average
of 5 wells per section. In the low-density areas, the average disturbance is 4.5 acres per section with an
average of less than 1 well per section. About 24 percent of the CD-C project area has had no
development to date.
Only BLM-administered lands and mineral estate in the CD-C project area would be subject to the cap.
The estimated surface disturbance of this alternative is 42,955 acres (about 4 percent of the project area),
a 9-percent decrease from the Proposed Action.
Alternative D: Directional Drilling. This alternative would require all future natural gas wells on BLMadministered lands and federal mineral estate to be drilled from multi-well pads. In areas with no existing
oil and gas development, one multi-well pad would be permitted per section (or per lease if the lease area
is less than a section). A single access corridor would be permitted for required roads, pipelines, and
electrical power distribution for each new multi-well pad. In sections with existing oil and gas
development, enlargement of one existing well pad would be permitted and that pad would serve as the
multi-well pad for all future drilling in that section.
Proposals for access across federal lands for oil and gas development on adjacent private and state lands
would continue to be considered by the BLM. Operators may request that an APD be exempted from the
general rule when an extraordinary situation exists that could limit full development of the natural gas
resource.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

ES-5

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The estimated surface disturbance for this alternative is 36,449 acres (about 3.4 percent of the project
area), a 23-percent decrease from the Proposed Action.
Alternative E: No Action. Under the No Action Alternative, it is assumed that none of the development
activities proposed by the CD-C Operators would be approved or authorized. The analysis of the No
Action alternative assumes that previously authorized activities would continue but that no new
development would occur.
Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Analysis. The BLM considered two
alternatives to the Proposed Action that were not carried forward for detailed analysis in this EIS—a
Surface Disturbance Cap with Reclamation Credits and Debits alternative and a Focused Development
alternative.
The Surface Disturbance Cap with Reclamation Credits and Debits would have placed a 30-acre cap on
the amount of future surface disturbance at any one time in a section of public land, with credits and
debits for successful or failed reclamation of previous disturbance. Operators would have received a
credit for each acre of land successfully reclaimed and a debit for each acre not yet reclaimed, thereby
providing a reward for successful reclamation and a penalty for slow or failed reclamation. The BLM
determined the operation of this alternative would be unpredictable and that neither the BLM nor the
operators could rely on its results. In certain instances, the formulation could yield a cap in one section of
perhaps 90 acres and in an adjacent section of minus 30 acres. The complexity of the alternative and the
uncertainty of its results would promote contention between the BLM and the Operators over the meaning
of and the operation of the cap. Because of the complexity and the uncertainty about its effects, and
because Alternative C already satisfied all the criteria for a surface disturbance cap, the BLM decided that
the Surface Disturbance Cap with Reclamation Credits and Debits would not be carried forward for
analysis in the EIS.
Several variations of a Focused Development alternative were considered during discussions between the
Operators and the CD-C cooperating agencies between 2007 and 2009. The BLM was not a participant in
those discussions. The concept of focused development is that drilling would be phased over time,
focusing on completion of development within a defined area before moving to another defined area. This
alternative would have provided opportunities to leave large tracts of wildlife habitat undeveloped for
extended periods of time in exchange for relaxing some seasonal wildlife stipulations in the areas of
focused development. Upon completion of development in a focus area, it would become an area with no
activity and development would shift to the previously undeveloped area. This alternative would have
required that the leaseholders in both the focus and undeveloped areas have a shared interest in
developing or delaying development of their leases. With the large number of leaseholders and the
fractured nature of land ownership in the project area, it proved impossible to reach agreement among a
sufficient number of parties as to which properties should be developed first. The BLM concluded that
unitization of the leases over such a large area would not be viable and thus could not provide a
framework for focusing development. The BLM also concluded that relaxation of seasonal wildlife
stipulations in focus areas—an essential element of such an alternative—was not appropriate.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
Chapter 3 of the EIS describes the affected physical, biological, human, and management environment of
the CD-C project area. The identified resources present within the project area provide the basis to
address substantive issues of concern brought forward during internal and public scoping. Chapter 3
provides quantitative data and spatial information where appropriate to the resource, which serves as a
baseline for comparison of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of each of the alternatives.
Following Table ES-2 is a summary description of the Affected Environment and the Environmental
Impacts by discipline.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS: OVERVIEW
Chapter 4 of the EIS describes the environmental effects of implementing the Proposed Action and
alternatives on the affected environment described in Chapter 3. The chapter is divided into subsections
that address the impacts for the resources identified during scoping. Much of the analysis of impacts for
each resource is related to the surface disturbance associated with the Proposed Action and Alternatives A
through D, which is over and above the existing disturbance in the project area. For Alternative E, there
are no new impacts. The resource-specific effects of the alternatives are evaluated quantitatively and
qualitatively, as appropriate, based on available data and the nature of the resource analyzed.

The intensity of impacts on geologic resources would vary in relation to the surface disturbance by alternative, but would be low
in all cases providing that best management practices are followed. Impacts would not be significant.
Paleontological resources have been identified in over 30 localities within the project area. Implementation of the Proposed
Action or any of the action alternatives may impact paleontological resources—in a negative way by destroying or damaging
them and making them unavailable for scientific inquiry—to the extent that the ground is disturbed by development activities,
(see Table ES-1 above). Disturbance could be beneficial by resulting in the discovery and preservation of fossils that add to
scientific knowledge. Pre-disturbance surveys and disturbance mitigation where appropriate would minimize adverse impacts.
The impact significance criterion would not be exceeded.

Water Resources:
Surface Water

Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, surface water impacts could include contamination of surface water
from the authorized and accidental discharge (spill) of fluids and produced water and the impacts (including sediment loading)
from surface disturbance related to the construction of pad sites, roads, and pipelines. The degree of potential impact and the
risk of adverse impacts is related directly to the amount of initial surface disturbance in each alternative. Each action alternative
exceeds at least one of the 8 significance criteria. The number of criteria exceeded for each alternative is displayed below:

Water Resources:
Groundwater

Significant impacts to groundwater are not expected under the Proposed Action or Alternatives because the formations
targeted for gas development and produced water disposal are stratigraphically isolated from aquifers that host springs and
flowing wells used for stock and domestic purposes, because of state-of-the-art construction techniques, and because of
implementation of BMPs and COAs related to drilling.

Air Quality

Impacts from the Proposed Action and all action alternatives would not cause an exceedance of any ambient air quality
standard and would not exceed the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Class II Increments at a 250-meter distance
from project sources. However, modeled impacts at a100-meter distance from field development project sources did result in
short-term concentrations that were predicted to be above the 1-hour NO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the
24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and the 24-hour PM10 Wyoming Ambient Air Quality Standard (WAAQS). Impacts would not exceed the
PSD Class I or Class II increments at any of the Class I and sensitive Class II areas. The visibility analysis indicated a
maximum of 5 days with project emissions resulting in impacts greater than the 0.5 delta deciview (Δdv) threshold at any of the
th
Class I and sensitive Class II areas; using the 98 percentile value as a threshold, there are zero days above the 0.5 Δdv
threshold. There would be no nitrogen and sulfur deposition impacts that exceed BLM critical load values at any Class I or
sensitive Class II area. In addition there would be no impacts to sensitive lakes that exceed threshold values. All BLM-approved
energy development projects will comply with applicable air quality regulations and standards, as determined by the WDEQ.
Biological Environment

Vegetation

Vegetation has already been strongly affected; historic disturbance equivalent to 5.6% of the area’s surface has already
occurred. Additional disturbance would produce combined historic and project-related disturbance for the Proposed Action and
each action alternative equivalent to the surface area percentages shown below. Even with successful implementation of
reclamation practices, about 40 percent of the disturbed area would remain in an unvegetated state during the production period
for the project—45-55 years. The remaining 60 percent of the disturbed area would have reduced productivity while reclamation
is in progress and would have an altered species composition and density for the life of the project and beyond, including a longterm loss of shrubs. Estimated percentage vegetation disturbance by alternative, including the historical 5.6% disturbance, is:

mule deer. Significant impact can be reached by actions that result in disruption or irreplaceable loss of vital and high-value
habitats such as crucial winter range and migration corridors, resulting in impacts that exceed the High or Extreme impact
definitions. Big game species in the area are expected to be significantly affected by the Proposed Action and Alternatives A,
B, and C but not by Alternative D.

Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, adequate visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and conditions of
approval would allow oil and gas development to be compatible with the management objectives for VRM Class III landscapes in
the project area by partially retaining the existing character of the landscape. Development would be compatible per se with
VRM Class IV objectives because VRM Class IV is meant to allow for major modification of the existing character of the
landscape. There would be no new impacts under Alternative E, No Action.

Socioeconomics

Transportation

The Proposed Action and the action alternatives would generate similar effects with minor differences. About 1,600 direct
project-related jobs would be created by Year 15 of development. Total project-related employment (direct, indirect, and induced
jobs) would climb to a peak of around 4,000 jobs in Year 14, an addition to existing project employment. Employment effects
would continue during production after the field is fully developed, but be lower than those during development. Following
completion of development and production, regional employment would decrease by over 4,300 jobs, including both new and
existing jobs, a net job loss. Population changes would closely follow employment gains and losses, peaking at about 3,700 new
residents and almost 1,000 temporary workers during Year 15 of development and falling to about 700 residents by Year 20.
Community facilities should be adequate to accommodate the added population but may require expansion during the latter part
of the 15-year development cycle. Demand for community facilities would substantially diminish after development is completed.
Substantial government revenues would be generated by the natural-gas production—about $3.8 billion in federal royalties, an
estimated $530 million in state mineral royalties, and $3.1 billion in ad valorem and gross products taxes. Project-related
employment, population, and revenue generation effects would not occur under Alternative E, No Action.
Development-related estimated peak annual average daily traffic (AADT) by alternative is as follows (estimated long-term
production-related AADT is the same for all alternatives, 1,360):

Oil and Gas and Other
Minerals

Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, the natural gas resources of the project area would be developed fully.
Natural gas reserves produced over the life of the project are estimated at 12.02 trillion cubic feet. Under Alternative E, the
Operators would still possess lease development rights but it is assumed that fluid mineral resources would not be developed
under this proposal.

Health and Safety

The Proposed Action and all action alternatives would result in similar impacts to the public and site workers, including
increased risk of vehicle collisions on interstate highways and local road systems.

Waste and Hazardous
Materials

Currently authorized and approved actions are already exerting stress on the permitted and authorized disposal facilities
proximal to the project area. Authorization of the Proposed Action or Alternatives A through C would result in further stress to
the capacity of permitted waste management units used by the operating companies, including those used for management of
solid waste, produced water, and drilling mud. Alternative D may serve to extend the life of some existing disposal facilities.

ES-14

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SUMMARY DESCRIPTIONS: IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTION AND
ALTERNATIVES
Geology. The project area straddles the Continental Divide and lies within the southern and eastern parts
of the Great Divide and Washakie sub-basins of the Greater Green River Basin. The project area has
surface sedimentary exposures of Quaternary, Tertiary, and Late Cretaceous age including the Green
River, Battle Spring, Wasatch, Fort Union, and Lance Formations. These deposits are underlain by
sedimentary rocks of the Late Cretaceous age, including Fox Hills Sandstone, Lewis Shale, Mesaverde
Group, Steele Shale, Niobrara, Frontier, and Mowry Shale. Petroleum products are generally targeted
within the Almond, Ericson, Rock Springs, and Blair formations of the Mesaverde Group.
Under the Proposed Action and action alternatives, there is a remote possibility that alteration of existing
topography for well pad and access road construction could result in initiation of mass movement and
landslides. Removal of surface vegetation and soil could accelerate erosion of surface features and result
in gullying and siltation. The extent of impacts would be directly proportional to the amount of surface
disturbance and would therefore vary by alternative, but would be low in all cases and would not be
significant. Alternative A has the potential for the most impact, followed by the Proposed Action, and
Alternatives, B, C, D, and E (No Action).
Paleontology. The CD-C project area is underlain by geological units that have a moderate to very high
potential to produce scientifically important fossils: the Battle Spring and Fort Union formations
(moderate) and the Green River and Wasatch formations (very high). Paleontological resources have been
identified in over 30 localities within the project area. Excavation of pipeline trenches and construction of
well pads, access roads, and ancillary facilities associated with the Proposed Action or its alternatives
could result in the exposure and destruction of these resources, either directly as a consequence of
construction or indirectly as a result of increased erosion rates. If these newly discovered resources are
properly recovered and catalogued, the Proposed Action and its alternatives could result in a better
understanding and knowledge of this resource. Increased access would be available to professional,
permitted paleontologists and geologists but could lead to increased illegal collection. Impacts to
paleontological resources would be more likely with alternatives that have the greatest amount of
concentrated surface disturbance, both spatially and temporally. Alternative A has the potential for the
most impact, followed by the Proposed Action, and Alternatives, B, C, D, and E (No Action). The impact
significance criterion would not be exceeded.
Soils. Soils in the project area were formed from erosion of bedrock exposed at the surface and from
lacustrine, alluvium, loess, and eolian deposits. The parent material is dominated by tertiary shales and
sandstones and uplifted cretaceous sedimentary rock. Soils on the tertiary bedrock are poorly developed
with little clay accumulation. Sandy soils occur on stabilized sand dunes and in areas with active dunes.
Saline soils exist in playas, and sodic soils occur on alluvial fans derived from high-sodium parent
materials.
The analysis in the EIS focuses on five potential soil limitations: water erosion, wind erosion, road
construction, runoff potential, and reclamation potential. For the first three of these limitations, soils in
the project area were generally rated as having slight or low to moderate limitation. Nearly 70 percent of
the project area soils are rated as having Slight potential for water erosion, 80 percent as having Moderate
potential for wind erosion, and 63.5 percent as having a Moderate limitation for road construction. About
half the area soils have a Moderate to High runoff potential. The most severe potential soil limitation is
the reclamation potential. Fifty percent of the project area has Poor reclamation potential and only 21
percent is rated as Good. The principal reasons for the Poor reclamation potential are High Soil Salinity
(42 percent) and Soils Too Clayey (27 percent). To date, 57 percent of the wells that have been drilled
within the CD-C project area are located within soils with poor reclamation potential.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

ES-15

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Impacts of the Proposed Action and the action alternatives on soils would be directly related to the
amount of surface disturbance created. In decreasing order of magnitude, impacts would be greatest for
Alternative A with an estimated 61,696-acre disturbance, and then sequentially less for the Proposed
Action (47,200 acres), Alternative B (45,516 acres), Alternative C (42,955 acres), and Alternative D
(36,449 acres). Alternative E would have no new disturbance. Full and successful implementation of
required mitigation measures and BMPs would insure that the significance criteria would not be
exceeded.
Water Resources. Approximately 70 percent of the project area is within the Great Divide Basin, a
closed basin that is bounded by the Continental Divide on all sides and has no surface hydrologic outlet;
29 percent is within the White-Yampa Basin that includes the Muddy Creek Sub-basin; and 1 percent is
within the Upper Green Basin. Muddy Creek is a high-elevation, cold-desert stream and a major drainage
system within the project area. Streamflow varies with location along the drainage. Muddy Creek exhibits
perennial flow for the majority of its length, and in some years flows intermittently because of irrigation
water removal south of the George Dew/Red Wash wetlands complex. In years with high runoff amounts,
Muddy Creek flows perennially throughout its length. Flow in the tributaries to Muddy Creek is
predominantly ephemeral, responding to localized snowmelt and rainfall events, but tributaries may also
experience some intermittent flow due to contributions from springs and seeps. Tributary channels are
generally dry and prone to flashy, periodic flood events from isolated thunderstorm systems from May to
October.
The Upper Muddy Creek Watershed/Grizzly Wildlife Habitat Management Area (WHMA) is located
primarily east of the CD-C project area but the western-most portion lies within the CD-C project area.
The goal of the WHMA is to “manage habitat for the Colorado River fish species unique to the Muddy
Creek watershed” In the Grizzly WHMA, the WGFD has been working with the BLM, the grazing
permittee, and the Little Snake River Conservation District (LSRCD) to implement similar measures.
According to the Rawlins RMP, the area is open to oil and gas leasing with intensive management of
surface-disturbing and disruptive activities.
Few streams in the Great Divide Basin exhibit perennial flow. Numerous ephemeral streams flow toward
the center of the Basin and terminate in natural or artificially constructed impoundments or disappear
because of losses to diversions, evaporation, and/or infiltration. Since a majority of the project area is
within this closed basin, a majority of the surface water flow originating in the CD-C project area
terminates within the project boundary. The Chain Lakes wetlands are located in the Basin, in the north
central portion of the CD-C project area. The Chain Lakes WHMA consists of 30,560 acres of public
lands surface in a checkerboard pattern.
Groundwater resources in the project area include unconfined aquifers, generally shallow, blanket-type
deposits of Quaternary or Tertiary age found within 400–600 feet of the ground surface, and confined
aquifers, bound by relatively impermeable rocks and in the deeper formations. The project area is located
over the Great Divide (northern half of the project area) and Washakie (southern half) structural basins,
with the Wamsutter Arch separating the two.
Quaternary age aquifers within the CD-C project area likely do not qualify as Underground Sources of
Drinking Water (USDW) since there are no wells designated for such use. The yields from these aquifers
are not likely sufficient to sustain a public water system. Tertiary age aquifers within the CD-C project
area qualify as USDW based on the presence of Wamsutter municipal wells and on the suitability of the
groundwater quality. Upper Cretaceous, Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Pennsylvanian age and older
aquifers may qualify as USDW based on water quality and on the quantity. However, due to the depth of
the aquifers in the CD-C area (2,000 to 18,000 feet) and the low population density of the area, these
aquifers are not likely to be the target for domestic or public water system wells.
Impacts to water resources resulting from project construction and operation could include: increased
water runoff and downstream sediment loading as a result of surface disturbance; contamination from

ES-16

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

accidental releases of fluids associated with exploration and production operations, produced water, and
other hazardous liquids to soils and surface-water systems; removal of groundwater; improper drilling and
completion operations; and subsurface disposal of produced water.
Impacts to surface water resulting from the Proposed Action and the action alternatives would be
considered significant under at least one and as many as seven of the eight significance criteria,
depending on the amount of overall surface disturbance and the locations of drill pads and associated
roads and pipelines. Impacts for Alternative A would be the most severe and would be reduced for the
Proposed Action and Alternative B, C, and D. Alternative D, with the least surface disturbance of the
action alternatives and the fewest disturbance locations, would have the least significant impact.
Impacts to groundwater are not expected to be significant because the aquifers targeted for gas
development and produced-water disposal are located in formations below and isolated from the aquifers
that produce springs and flowing wells utilized for stock and domestic purposes. In addition, existing
federal and state laws and regulations provide protections that limit the potential for significant impacts
on groundwater.
Air Quality. The CD-C air quality analysis addressed the impacts on ambient air quality and Air Quality
Related Values (AQRVs) from potential air emissions due to the Proposed Action and alternatives and
from other regional emissions sources within a defined study area. Potential ambient air quality impacts
were quantified and compared to applicable state and federal ambient air quality standards and Prevention
of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increments, hazardous air pollutant (HAP) thresholds, and AQRV
impacts (impacts on visibility, atmospheric deposition, and potential increases in acidification to acidsensitive lakes).
A near-field ambient air quality impact assessment was performed to evaluate maximum pollutant
impacts within and near the CD-C project area using EPA’s Guideline (EPA 2005) model, AERMOD, to
estimate maximum potential impacts of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide
(SO2), particulate matter greater than 10 microns or 2.5 microns in diameter (PM10, and PM2.5) from
project emissions sources. Near-field HAP (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, n-hexane and
formaldehyde) concentrations were calculated for assessing impacts both in the immediate vicinity of
project area emission sources for short-term (acute) exposure assessment and for calculation of long-term
risk.
A far-field ambient air quality impact assessment was carried out using CAMx (Comprehensive Air
Quality Model with Extensions) to quantify potential air quality impacts to both ambient air
concentrations of CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and ozone, and AQRVs from air pollutant emissions of
CO, nitrogen oxides (NOx), SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) expected to result
from the development of the CD-C project as well as the combined effects of the CD-C project and other
new sources of emissions in the region.
The modeling relied on an emission inventory developed for the project for each year over the expected
life of the project. Emission inventories for all regional emissions sources from human activities and
natural sources (e.g. wildfires) were compiled for use in the far-field modeling.
Near-field modeling indicated that production and field development source emissions of the Proposed
Action and alternatives would not cause an exceedance of any ambient air quality standard and would not
exceed the PSD Class II Increments at a 250-meter distance from project sources. However, modeled
impacts at a100-meter distance from field development project sources did result in short-term
concentrations that were predicted to be above the 1-hour NO2 NAAQS, the 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS, and
the 24-hour PM10 WAAQS. Far-field and mid-field modeling using CAMx showed that the Proposed
Action and alternatives would not cause any exceedances of the ambient air quality standards for ozone or
any other criteria pollutant and would not exceed the PSD Class I or Class II increments at any of the
Class I and sensitive Class II areas. The visibility analysis indicated a maximum of 5 days with project

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

emissions resulting in impacts greater the 0.5 delta deciview (Δdv) threshold at any of the Class I and
sensitive Class II areas; using the 98th percentile value as a threshold, there would be zero days above the
0.5 Δdv threshold.
Vegetation. The CD-C project area is located within the Omernik Level III “Wyoming Basin” Ecoregion
18, described generally as a broad intermontane basin dominated by arid grasslands and shrublands and
interrupted by high hills and low mountains. Three vegetative cover types make up 78 percent of the
project area: Wyoming Big Sagebrush (the most common at 39 percent), greasewood flats and fans (23
percent), and saltbush flats and fans (16 percent).
Within the project area, the ecoregion is further divided into two Level IV ecoregions: Rolling Sagebrush
Steppe and Salt Desert Shrub Basins. The Rolling Sagebrush Steppe is a semiarid region of rolling plains,
alluvial and outwash fans, hills, cuestas, mesas, and terraces, with average annual precipitation from 10–
12 inches. The dominant vegetation in this ecoregion is sagebrush, often associated with various
wheatgrasses or fescue. The ecoregion is interspersed with desert shrublands, dunes, and barren area in
more arid regions (e.g., Red Desert); and with mixed-grass prairie at the eastern limit. The Salt Desert
Shrub ecoregion includes disjunct playas and isolated sand dunes. The plains, terraces, and rolling alluvial
fans of this ecoregion have soils that tend to be more alkaline and less permeable than soils in the Rolling
Sagebrush Steppe. Vegetation is a sparse cover of xeric-adapted species such as shadscale, greasewood,
and Gardner’s saltbush. This arid region is sensitive to grazing pressure, which may promote the spread of
invasive weeds.
Direct impacts to native shrub/grassland communities within the CD-C project area would be similar
under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives—an initial reduction of herbaceous vegetation and a
long-term loss of shrubs due to soil disturbance and related construction activities. These impacts could
be mitigated by successful implementation of reclamation practices, but about 40 percent of the
disturbance would remain in an unvegetated state for the life of the project—30–40 years at each
individual well site—while used for access roads and well pad facilities. The remaining 60 percent would
have reduced productivity while reclamation is in progress and would have an altered species composition
and density for the life of the project and beyond, including a long-term loss of shrubs.
Vegetation could be impacted indirectly as a result of soil compaction, mixing of soil horizons, loss of
topsoil productivity, and increased soil-surface exposure resulting in soil loss due to wind and water
erosion. Other indirect impacts could occur as a result of altered runoff hydrology due to roads, well pads,
and other facilities, particularly on moderate to steep slopes. Additional indirect impacts would occur due
to deposition of dust on vegetation near roads and construction sites, reducing plant productivity and
vitality. The increased surface disturbance produced by project implementation would also provide
opportunities for invasive plant species to establish and spread.
As with soils, the principal difference in impacts among alternatives is related to the amount of surface
disturbance that would initially occur for each. In decreasing order of magnitude, impacts would be
greatest for Alternative A with an estimated 61,696-acre disturbance, and sequentially less for the
Proposed Action (47,200 acres), Alternative B (45,516 acres), Alternative C (42,955 acres), and
Alternative D (36,449 acres). Alternative E, with no new development, would have no new disturbance.
Non-native, Invasive Plant Species. The principal invasive weeds known to occur on or near, or which
have been treated within, the CD-C project area include: Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens),
houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale), halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus), hoary cress (whitetop)
(Cardaria draba and Cardaria pubescens), perennial pepperweed (giant whitetop, Lepidium latifolium),
spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), common burdock (Arctium minus), and saltcedar (Tamarix
spp.). The primary impact of these invasive species to the range resource is their ability to out-compete
native species, reducing the quality of available forage for wildlife and livestock and also diminishing the
long-term productivity, diversity, and aesthetic values of lands within the project area. In addition to their
competitive nature, leafy spurge, Russian knapweed, halogeton, and houndstongue are poisonous.

ES-18

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Halogeton was selected as a worst-case example of non-native invasive species known to exist in the CD­
C project area and a survey was conducted in 2007. At that time an estimated 13,353 acres (about 1.2
percent of the project area) were infested with halogeton. Halogeton has continued to spread since the
survey was made and the infestation as of 2012 is likely greater.
Impacts to vegetation and range resources would occur on public lands under the Proposed Action and all
action alternatives, due to an increase in surface disturbance that could provide more suitable habitat for
invasive weed infestations. The risk of infestation and spread of invasive, non-native plant species within
the CD-C project area would be similar under all alternatives because initial surface disturbance would
create opportunities for new infestations and new development activity would increase the degree to
which such species spread throughout the project area. The extent of impact from invasive, non-native
species is directly related to the amount of surface disturbance that would initially occur for each
alternative. Alternative A has the potential for the most impact, followed by the Proposed Action and
Alternatives B, C, D, and E (No Action). In addition to the CD-C project, several other natural gas
projects located adjacent to the project area could provide cumulative invasive species impacts.
Additionally, three transmission-line projects are proposed to cross the project area and vehicles/
equipment associated with the planning and construction of those projects provide other potential seed
sources and seed vectors.
Wildlife. At least 396 wildlife species occur in and around the project area including: 77 mammal, 273
bird, six amphibian, 10 reptile, and 30 fish species. Most are common and have wide distribution in the
region. Species considered in the EIS include big game species, upland game birds, raptors, neotropical
birds, and fish. The big game species in the project area are pronghorn, mule deer, and elk. Crucial winter
and crucial winter/yearlong ranges of pronghorn and mule deer collectively comprise approximately
92,842 acres (8.7 percent) of the project area. Greater sage-grouse, Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, and
mourning doves occur within the project area. Twenty-six raptor species are known to occur in or around
the project area, including 14 that breed or potentially breed in the project area, two that over-winter, and
ten that have been recorded as transients or migrants. Many species of neotropical songbirds utilize the
project area for breeding, feeding, migration, and as year-round habitats. About 30 species of fish may
occur in the project area or in streams upstream or downstream of the project area, including ten gamefish species and 20 non-game fish species.
Because of the long timeframe for recovery of shrub habitats after vegetation removal, terrestrial wildlife
dependent on shrub habitats would be impacted most by habitat loss. In addition to the physical removal
of habitat, disturbance during construction and production can displace or preclude wildlife use during all
seasons. Timing restrictions for critical times of year have been developed for the most sensitive species
and would generally be implemented during the development phase, but no restrictions would apply
during the production phase. Other impacts from natural gas development include habitat fragmentation,
reduced availability and palatability of forage due to dust, and mortality from collisions involving
vehicles and wildlife.
Pronghorn and mule deer are the wildlife species most impacted by development, particularly in their
winter range where previous development has already reduced the quality of the habitat. Impacts from the
Proposed Action and Alternatives A and C are likely to reach the level of significance for pronghorn and
mule deer CWR and associated migration routes.
Because the BLM places buffers around active raptor nest sites and restricts other activities around raptor
nests and because most raptor prey use habitat that can be reclaimed in a timely fashion, the impact from
the Proposed Action or the action alternatives is not expected to exceed the significance criteria.
The project could result in some unintentional, direct mortality of small birds and small mammals from
vehicle collisions; however, this mortality is expected to be negligible and is not likely to reduce
populations within the project area. If standard prescribed environmental protection measures and BMPs

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

ES-19

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

are implemented under the Proposed Action or the action alternatives, the impacts on songbird and smallmammal populations are not expected to exceed the impact significance criteria.
All of the fish species that are not BLM Sensitive Species have wide distribution within Wyoming.
Consequently, the project and other human activities within the Muddy Creek and Great Basin watersheds
may have localized population impacts but should not impact their status range-wide.
The cumulative impact of multiple individual projects may result in a large area potentially exposed to
increased fragmentation, disturbance of wildlife and their habitats, disruption of migratory corridors, and
the loss of refuge areas. Additional effects are expected on wildlife dispersal, the reduction of nonfragmented habitats, competition with livestock, and competition with other wildlife species. The
generalized increase of human presence and associated disturbance across such a broad scale are a
concern.
Special Status Species. The greater sage-grouse, a candidate for federal listing as Threatened or
Endangered, is present within the CD-C project area. Four species of Endangered fish are present
downstream of the project area, including the Bonytail (Gila elegans), Colorado pikeminnow
(Ptychocheilus lucius), humpback chub (Gila cypha), and razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus).
Potential habitats for the Endangered blowout penstemon (penstemon haydenii) and the Threatened Ute
ladies’-tresses (spiranthes diluvialis) are present, and therefore the species are potentially present. The
Endangered black-footed ferret is unlikely to occur within the project area; however, white-tailed prairie
dog colonies in the Continental Divide, Dad, and Desolation Flats areas provide potential habitat and prey
for this species and those areas have not been surveyed to confirm whether black-footed ferrets are
present.
The following species listed by the BLM as Sensitive are present or potentially present within the CD-C
project area: pygmy rabbit, swift fox, white-tailed prairie dog, Wyoming pocket gopher, bald eagle,
Brewer’s sparrow, loggerhead shrike, sage sparrow, sage thrasher, burrowing owl, ferruginous hawk,
long-billed curlew, mountain plover, trumpeter swan, white-faced ibis, Great Basin spadefoot, northern
leopard frog, roundtail chub, bluehead sucker, and flannelmouth sucker.
The Proposed Action and action alternatives would disturb and alter wildlife habitat during the 15-year
development period, in addition to the 60,176 acres previously disturbed by natural gas and other
development. Reclamation of disturbed habitats should recover grass-dominated habitats in one to several
years, depending on precipitation. Shrub habitats would not reach pre-disturbance levels during the life of
the project. The greater sage-grouse, loggerhead shrike, sage sparrow, and sage thrasher, which are
dependent on shrub habitats, would be impacted most by habitat loss.
In addition to the physical removal of habitat, disturbance during construction and production can
displace or preclude wildlife use during all seasons. Timing restrictions for the critical times of year have
been developed for the most sensitive species and would generally be implemented during the
development phase, but no restrictions would be in place during the production phase. Other impacts from
natural gas development include habitat fragmentation, reduced availability and palatability of forage due
to dust, and mortality from collision between vehicles and wildlife. The measures aimed at avoiding and
protecting special status plants that would be implemented under the Proposed Action and all alternatives
would insure that potential impacts to special status plants would be minimized or eliminated.
Because of the protections provided by the BMPs, COAs, and occupancy/timing restrictions required for
many special status species, the impact level of significance would likely only be reached under one or
more of the action alternatives, but not all, for sage-grouse in non-core areas, and sensitive fish. Sagegrouse in core areas would not be significantly affected under any alternative because impacts would be
substantially ameliorated by the application of the Core Population Area density and disturbance
limitations and mitigations (IM WY-2012-019 and Statewide Executive Directive 2011-05 for protection
of Greater Sage-grouse Core Areas [SWED 2011]) on private and state lands as well as federal. Given the

ES-20

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

application of this guidance, development activity would not lead to a significant impact on the sagegrouse core area populations.
It is expected that for the Proposed Action and Alternatives A and C, significance criteria could be
exceeded for sage-grouse outside the core area. Ferruginous hawk nests located near private or state
surface in the checkerboard would not benefit from the entire 1-mile seasonal buffer zone but it is not
expected that significance criteria would be exceeded as other factors such as topography could decrease
the size of the needed buffer around nests. Other special status species should be protected sufficiently by
the COAs, RMP requirements, and BMPs to avoid exceeding the significance level.
Alteration of sensitive fish habitat suitability from sedimentation would result in significant impacts to
sensitive fishes under the Proposes Action and Alternatives A and C, but not under Alternative B and
possibly not under Alternative D.
The cumulative effect of the CD-C project and other reasonably foreseeable future projects on greater
sage-grouse would be substantially ameliorated by the application of the Core Population Area density
and disturbance limitations and mitigations on private and state lands as well as federal.
Wild Horses. The BLM protects, manages, and controls wild horses within Herd Management Areas
(HMAs). Portions of two HMAs are located within the CD-C project area: 119,600 acres of the 251,000­
acre Lost Creek HMA in the northwest corner, and 5,826 acres of the 472,812-acre Adobe Town HMA
along the southwest perimeter west of Baggs. Both HMAs are located within livestock grazing
allotments, and each allotment has an allocated number of Animal Unit Months (AUMs). The primary
direct impact to wild horses would be loss of available forage as a result of surface disturbance. Indirect
impacts could result from increased potential for horse/vehicle collisions and increased dust as a result of
increased traffic. Alternative A has the potential for the most impact to wild horses, followed by the
Proposed Action, and Alternatives, B, C, D, and E (No Action). For both the Proposed Action and
Alternative A, long-term loss of forage is estimated at less than 0.2 percent of the total forage in the
allotment for the Lost Creek HMA and less than 0.1 percent for the Adobe Town HMA. Because the
relative loss of forage would be so small, however, none of the grazing allotments in either HMA would
undergo a reduction in the amount of AUMs allocated.
Visual Resources. The CD-C project area is part of a semiarid desert dominated by patches and thickets
of sagebrush. Colors of gray, brown, and olive characterize the vegetation, with grasses and forbs
changing to shades of brown as they cure in the summer and fall. Soils and rock strata are shades of red,
gray, and brown. The landscape is generally unbroken, so visual contrast draws attention wherever it
occurs. Dune fields, playas, cuestas, occasional escarpments, and eroded streambeds create some visual
contrast.
Visually prominent features in the project area are the Red Desert Basin, the Chain Lakes Basin, the
extended Delaney Rim-Wamsutter Rim cuesta-and-valley complex, and North Flat Top, the high point in
the project area. North Flat Top, Little Robbers Gulch, and The Bluffs are prominent geologic features
visible from Wyoming Highway (WY) 789, the major north-south road through the southern part of the
project area. Interstate 80 (I-80) bisects the project area from east to west. Because of high traffic
volumes, I-80 is the vantage point from which potentially the most viewers see the project area. Because
of the extensive road network, all land within the project area is in the foreground or middle ground of
major or other roads.
The potentially affected scenic quality in the project area is currently low to moderate overall. Cultural
modification due to oil and gas development has negatively affected scenic quality in seven of 15
identified landscape-rating units that are contained wholly or in part within the project area. This is
generally because oil and gas development disturbs existing vegetation and introduces structures whose
unnatural forms, lines, colors, and textures contrast with the natural landscape character.

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

ES-21

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Sixty percent of the project area is classified by the BLM as Visual Resource Management (VRM) Class
III. The objective of Class III is to partially retain the existing character of the landscape. The level of
change to the landscape should be moderate; management activities may attract the attention of the casual
observer but should not dominate the view of the casual observer. The remainder of the project area is
classified as VRM Class IV, where the objective is to provide for management activities that require
major modifications to the existing character of the landscape and the level of change to the landscape can
be high.
Visual mitigation in the form of BMPs and COAs would allow oil and gas development to be compatible
with the management objectives for VRM Class III landscapes in the project area. Development would be
compatible per se with VRM Class IV objectives because VRM Class IV is meant to allow for major
modification of the existing character of the landscape. Less degradation of landscape quality would
potentially occur under Alternatives B, C, and D and more would occur under Alternative A, when
compared to the Proposed Action. The combination of CD-C project impacts and the Gateway South and
TransWest transmission line right-of-way systems could create a high cumulative impact in some
viewsheds in the VRM Class III parts of the CD-C project area. Visual impacts from CD-C and other
planned or reasonably foreseeable development may add up to a high enough level of incompatible
contrast with existing settings to be non-compliant with VRM Class III.
Recreation. Big game hunting and associated off-highway vehicle use constitute the primary recreational
uses of public lands within the project area. Pleasure driving to view wildlife, especially wild horses, is a
secondary use that occurs mainly within the Red Desert area. There is one undeveloped recreation site at
Little Robbers Gulch Reservoir near the southern boundary of the project area that has been in historical
use as a group hunting camp and fishing hole.
Impacts to recreation resulting from the Proposed Action and action alternatives would directly correlate
to impacts to wildlife, wild horses, the visual setting, traffic, and noise. In turn, these impacts would be
directly related to the amount of surface disturbance and the increase in surface disturbance in relation to
existing disturbance. Overall, Alternative A has the potential for the greatest amount of impact to
recreation, followed by the Proposed Action, and Alternatives, B, C, D, and E (No Action). The intensity
of impacts to recreation would potentially be highest in the northern part of the project area, where natural
gas development is less dense to date and where the Chain Lakes Wildlife Habitat Management Area and
the large block of public land to the northwest are a resource for big game hunting and other wildlifebased recreation.
Lands with Wilderness Characteristics (LWCs). The RFO maintains an inventory of LWCs on a
continuing basis and relies on this inventory in the development and revision of land use plans and when
making subsequent project level-decisions. No LWCs are located within the boundaries of the CD-C
project area.
Cultural and Historical Resources. Portions of the Overland and Cherokee Trails, the 1868 Union
Pacific Railroad Grade, and the Lincoln Highway (US 30 and I-80 corridor) are located within the CD-C
project area and eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The BLM has
designated a quarter-mile buffer around these linear resources and associated sites as highly sensitive.
Natural gas development within this buffer would not be permitted. A 2-mile analysis area surrounding
these trails and associated sites is considered as the setting. Where the setting of historic trails and
associated sites contributes to eligibility for listing on the NRHP, actions resulting in the introduction of
visual elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features would be
mitigated. BMPs would be implemented to reduce visual impacts to the setting, such as consolidation of
facilities, use of low-profile tanks, and paint colors that blend with surrounding terrain. Increased access
to and activity within the project area during construction associated with the Proposed Action and
alternatives could result in increased indirect impacts to archaeological sites such as changes in erosion

ES-22

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

patterns, soil compaction, or vegetation removal; fugitive dust; off-road vehicle traffic associated with
construction or maintenance activities; and increased vandalism, including illegal artifact collection.
The amount of potential impact to historic and archaeological resources is related to the amount of surface
disturbance. Impacts under Alternative A would be the greatest, with a potential 2,467 sites that could be
affected. Impacts would decrease proportionately for the Proposed Action (1,888 potentially affected
sites), followed by Alternatives B (1,821 potentially affected sites), C (1,718 potentially affected sites),
and D (1,458 potentially affected sites). No impacts would occur under Alternative E, No Action, because
there would be no new surface disturbance. Avoidance and mitigation would remove the potential for
significant impacts on public lands for all alternatives.
Socioeconomics. Implementation of the Proposed Action or other action alternatives would allow
substantially more and higher-paced development and production activity in the CD-C project area. The
additional development activity is assumed to extend over 15 years, and production would continue for
30–40 years thereafter. This activity would be accompanied by increased employment associated with
development and production activities for companies that service gas field development and production
activities, and in other sectors of the local economy. The additional employment would result in
concurrent increases in temporary and long-term population for communities in Carbon and Sweetwater
counties. In turn, the additional population would require temporary and long-term housing, place
demands on local public facilities and services, and generate increases in revenues for local business
establishments.
The added development and production would generate substantial tax revenues for local and state
governments, which could fund higher public-sector operating costs and facility and service expansion in
response to development-related demands. But the timing of the receipt of those revenues and their
distribution would not in all cases coincide with the timing and location of demand.
Continued natural gas development within the CD-C project area would also increase the potential for
conflicts between natural resource development and outdoor recreation and grazing activities. Given the
existing level of development, the incremental effects of potential conflicts and displacement are likely to
be minor to moderate across most of the project area. However, conflicts with important environmental
values could arise in several areas.
All action alternatives have the potential to both positively and adversely affect local and regional
economic diversity. Positive effects would include sustained support for existing businesses and possible
expansion of the commercial and service sectors in response to natural gas-related increased demand;
such expansion could also serve increases in tourism, outdoor recreation, and interstate travel. Similarly,
the development of community and commercial infrastructure to support development-related demand
would enhance the capacity to accommodate other economic activities in the long run. Adverse effects
that could limit economic diversification would include increased competition for labor, increased
housing costs, and potential effects on regional environmental amenities, particularly during the 15-year
development period.
The level of development contemplated by the Proposed Action and other action alternatives is contingent
upon natural gas prices being sufficiently high to support that level of development from an economic
perspective. The natural-gas reserves in the project area are part of a larger regional resource base.
Consequently, periods of faster or slower-paced development would generally occur in the context of
regional energy development expansion and decline in southwest Wyoming and indeed across much of
the Rocky Mountain west. In other words, extended periods of elevated demand for natural gas and
resultant high gas sales prices would generally correlate with periods of accelerated development activity
in the project area and in other natural-gas fields in Carbon, Sweetwater, and adjacent counties.
Conversely, extended periods of lower natural-gas demand or relatively higher availability of gas from
other sources would result in regional slowdowns in development activity. The effects of such regional

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

ES-23

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

potentials are discussed in the 2008 Baseline Socioeconomic Technical Report and in Chapter 5 of this
EIS.
The BLM and Operators consider the natural gas production volumes forecast for this assessment
technically recoverable given current technology and knowledge. The ultimate level of recovery would
depend on natural gas prices, future improvements in technology for developing and producing gas
resources, markets for the gas, and delivery capacity to collect, process, and deliver the gas to market.
This assessment assumes that the forecast natural gas production volumes would be recovered, while
acknowledging the potential for lower gas prices and corresponding lower levels of development and
production. This assumption provides a basis for assessing reasonable potential upper bounds of effects
on socioeconomic conditions including the fact that natural gas sales prices to support this level of
development would also provide tax revenues to aid the state and communities in responding to
development-related effects, as well as continued support for existing programs and services locally and
throughout the state.
Transportation and Access. The Proposed Action and all action alternatives would result in natural gas
development and production-related increases in traffic on federal and state highways and county and
BLM roads that provide access to and within the CD-C project area. The pattern of traffic increases would
be similar for all alternatives but the level of increase would vary moderately by alternative. Each action
alternative would result in temporary increases in annual average daily traffic on federal and state
highways resulting from construction of ancillary facilities such as field compression facilities, a central
pipeline compression facility, a central gas-processing/stabilization facility, and a high-pressure gas line.
For I-80, the level of increase would be relatively modest compared to existing levels of traffic. A number
of other reasonably foreseeable projects could generate cumulative effects on I-80; wind farm
construction; other, smaller oil and gas development projects; power transmission lines; and an in-situ
uranium project. The effect would be greatest during construction of the projects and the overall effect
would depend greatly on the relative timing of the construction of the projects.
The Proposed Action and all action alternatives would accelerate highway maintenance requirements on
county, BLM, and private roads. The timing and level of improvements and maintenance requirements
would be driven by the magnitude and characteristics of traffic increases on specific highways and roads.
Some temporary increases in congestion could occur on local streets in some communities in Carbon and
Sweetwater counties and there would be a statistical potential for increases in motor vehicle accidents,
primarily during the 15-year development period. All action alternatives would generate similar amounts
of revenue that could be used to fund highway and road-maintenance needs.
Noise. Existing sources of noise in the CD-C project area include gas compression stations, livestock
grazing operations, wind, well workover operations, and traffic along area access roads, state highways,
and I-80. Additional noise would be generated under the Proposed Action and action alternatives by well
site and access road construction, drilling and completion, pipeline construction, and surface-disturbing
reclamation operations. Noise levels may at times temporarily exceed EPA thresholds in specific
locations. The duration of noise-generating activity and dispersal of noise-generating equipment across
the project area would be greatest under the Proposed Action.
Directional wells are considered in the Proposed Action and Alternatives B, C, and D. Directional drilling
may require a larger rig with larger engines operating at higher decibel and lower frequency levels
compared to rigs for vertical drilling. Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling, would result in the
greatest number of generation sources. The number of days needed for drilling and completion may be
slightly fewer compared to directional wells; however, the time savings could be negated by the amount
of time required for a rig move. Design features of Alternative B (Enhanced Resource Protection) would
serve to reduce noise in sensitive environments, but these reductions could be negated by the noise of
semi/haul trucks moving drilling rigs. Alternative C could result in areas with concentrated development
activity, where noise levels would be greater than those found in areas of more dispersed operations. The

ES-24

Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas Development Project Draft EIS  November 2012

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

surface disturbance cap could slow the pace of development, especially in the high-density development
areas, and extend development noise levels over a longer time than the Proposed Action. Alternative D
(Directional Drilling) would result in an overall reduction in well pads and roads built and provide only
localized areas of noise.
Range Resources. Impacts to livestock and grazing resources would occur under the Proposed Action
and all action alternatives. Impacts could include those caused by a reduction of total available forage due
to road, well pad, and pipeline construction and maintenance; improperly fenced open pits; vehicle traffic;
fugitive dust deposited on potential forage; accidental spills of potentially hazardous materials; and
creation of suitable habitat for invasive/noxious weed infestations. Livestock may be injured or killed by
vehicle collision, become trapped in open pipeline trenches, stray from pastures through gates left open,
and ingest poisonous invasive species. Additionally, existing range improvements can be damaged by
equipment and vehicles. The level of impact resulting from the Proposed Action and action alternatives
would be related to the amount of surface disturbance that would initially occur for each alternative.
Loss of forage in a grazing allotment due to oil and gas development could result in a long-term reduction
of the stocking rate for the allotment if the total long-term surface disturbance exceeds 10 percent of the
allotment area. Of the 44 allotments within or overlapping the CD-C project area, two already have
disturbance in excess of 9 percent, and nine more have disturbance in excess of 5 percent. The Proposed
Action and alternatives have the potential to result in a long-term reduction in the stocking rate for these
allotments until existing and new disturbance is successfully reclaimed. For the Proposed Action, it is
estimated that an initial forage loss equivalent to 5,488 of the total 123,910 AUMs within the CD-C
project area could occur. AUMs lost would be recovered with successful reclamation of initial
disturbance. Estimated forage equivalent lost for Alternative A would be 7,174 AUMs; for Alternative B,
5,293 AUMs; for Alternative C, 4,995 AUMs; and for Alternative D, 4,238 AUMs. Under Alternative E,
No Action, no forage loss would occur.
Oil and Gas and Other Minerals. Under the Proposed Action and all action alternatives, recoverable
natural gas reserves produced over the life of the project are estimated at 12.02 trillion cubic feet (Tcf);
liquid condensate is estimated at 167.3 million barrels. With this amount of production from the target
formations, it is expected that the oil and natural gas resource in the CD-C project area would have been
substantially depleted, pending new technology or the discovery of new reserves. Under Alternative E,
No Action, no more natural gas or liquid condensate would be produced in the CD-C project area.
Health and Safety. Implementation of the Proposed Action and all action alternatives would likely result
in an increased risk to the workforce due to the increased number of personnel in the field, the increase in
heavy equipment use and drilling operations, and the resultant increase in vehicle traffic. Compliance
with the State of Wyoming Department of Employment Workers Occupational Health and Safety
(WOSHA) program rules and regulations for construction and oil and gas well drilling, well servicing,
and well special servicing operations would aid in reducing project-related occupational hazards. Risks to
the project workforce would decline substantially once construction, drilling, and completion are
concluded and the project enters the production phase. The Proposed Action and all action alternatives
would result in similar impacts to the public and site workers with regard to increased risk of vehicle
collisions on interstate highways and local road systems during the development and production phases.
Waste and Hazardous Materials. With the exception of produced water, most waste materials that
would be generated at project locations are considered to be solid and classified as non-hazardous, and are
disposed of at approved facilities offsite. Some operators recycle drilling mud between wells for re-use,
reducing the volume to be disposed of. Completion fluids are also recycled to the extent possible to
minimize waste disposal but are generally produced to an open pit onsite for disposal. Produced water
within the project area would continue to be managed through the use of private and commercially
permitted evaporation ponds and injection/disposal wells. Hazardous wastes and disposal sites are
permitted and managed in compliance with Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality regulations.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Currently authorized and approved actions are already exerting stress on the permitted and authorized
disposal facilities near to the project area. Authorization of the Proposed Action or Alternatives A, B, or C
would result in further stress to the capacity of permitted waste management units, including those used
for management of solid waste, produced water, and drilling mud. Alternative D may serve to extend the
life of some existing disposal facilities if it results in higher levels of recycling and reuse of drilling
materials.

Abstract

The Operators propose to develop oil and gas resources within the 1.1 million-acre Continental DivideCreston (CD-C) project area located in Carbon and Sweetwater Counties west of Rawlins, Wyoming. The
CD-C project is an in-fill project with over 4,400 existing oil and gas wells and associated infrastructure.
The Proposed Action would include the development of an additional 8,950 gas wells at down to 40-acre
downhole spacing. Construction would begin after the issuance of the Final EIS and Record of Decision
and approval of individual Applications for Permit to Drill and/or approved right-of-way grants.
Construction would require approximately 15 years. The productive life of the project would extend an
estimated 30 to 40 years beyond that.
The Proposed Action and five alternatives were analyzed in detail in this Draft EIS. The alternatives are:







The Proposed Action;
Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling;
Alternative B, Enhanced Resource Protection;
Alternative C, Surface Disturbance Cap—High and Low Density Development Areas;
Alternative D, Directional Drilling; and
Alternative E, No Action.

Under all the action alternatives, the analysis includes impacts produced by development activities on
federal, state, and private mineral estate. In addition to the applicable BLM environmental protection
measures listed in Appendix C of the EIS document, mitigation is recommended that would lessen the
environmental effects of the proposed project.
Written comments on the Draft EIS will be accepted by the Rawlins Field Office of the BLM throughout
a 45-day public comment period beginning on the date the United States Environmental Protection
Agency publishes a Notice of Availability for this EIS. A summary of the comments and responses to the
comments will be provided in the Final EIS.

Dear Reader:
The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Continental Divide-Creston Natural Gas
Development Project is available for your review and comment. It was prepared to analyze the potential
impacts of a proposal from BP America Production Company and others for natural gas field
development. The Continental Divide-Creston (CD-C) project area encompasses approximately 1.1
million acres (1,672 square miles) in an existing gas-producing area located west of Rawlins, Wyoming in
Carbon and Sweetwater Counties.
The CD-C project is an in-fill project with over 4,400 existing oil and gas wells. The Proposed Action
includes the development of an additional 8,950 gas wells, including construction of supporting
infrastructure—access roads, pipelines, electrical power lines, a central gas-processing plant, and water
management and disposal facilities. Construction would begin after the issuance of the Final EIS and
Record of Decision and approval of individual Applications for Permit to Drill and/or approved right-of­
way grants. Construction would require approximately 15 years. The productive life of the project would
extend an estimated 30 to 40 years beyond that, for a combined total project life of 45 to 55 years.
This Draft EIS analyzes the Proposed Action and the following five alternatives in detail:






Alternative A, 100-Percent Vertical Drilling;
Alternative B, Enhanced Resource Protection;
Alternative C, Surface Disturbance Cap—High and Low Density Development Areas;
Alternative D, Directional Drilling; and
Alternative E, No Action.

Total new surface disturbance under the Proposed Action would be approximately 47,200 acres, or 4.4
percent of the CD-C project area.
The Draft EIS was prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as well as other
regulations and statutes, to address possible environmental and socioeconomic impacts that could result
from implementation of the project. The Draft EIS is not a decision document. Its purpose is to inform the
public and the decision maker of the impacts associated with implementing the proponent’s proposal, to
evaluate alternatives to the proposal, and to solicit comments from other agencies and the public.
Comments are being sought to ensure that the EIS includes an appropriate range of alternatives to the
Proposed Action and that the analysis of environmental effect is appropriate and complete.
