Intent To Prepare a Draft
Environmental Impact Statement for
the Proposed Balanced Vision Plan, a
Multipurpose Project Containing
Ecosystem Restoration, Flood Risk
Management, and Recreational
Enhancement Alternatives Along the
Trinity River Within and Adjacent to
the Existing Dallas Floodway in Dallas
County, Dallas, TX

SUMMARY: The U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District,
in partnership with the City of Dallas
recommends the incorporation of
various flood risk management
measures, ecosystem restoration
features, and recreational enhancements
to the Dallas Floodway, located along
the Trinity River in Dallas County,
Dallas, TX. The Balanced Vision Plan
(BVP) project aims to achieve the
designed Standard Project Flood
protection, maximize ecosystem
restoration outputs for priority resource
categories, and optimize recreational
opportunities, to include providing trail
connectivity to other regional visions/
plans.
The USACE is preparing a Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
in response to the authority contained
in the United States Senate Committee
on Environment and Public Works
Resolution dated April 22, 1988, and
Section 5141 of the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA) of 2007. The
USACE must determine the technical
soundness and environmental
acceptability of the authorized project.
Thus, in accordance with Section 102 of
the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) as implemented by the
regulations promulgated by the Council
on Environmental Quality (40 Code of
Federal Regulations Parts 1500–1508
and USACE Engineering Regulation
200–2–2), the USACE will prepare the
DEIS to evaluate and compare flood risk
management, ecosystem restoration, and
recreation alternatives along the Trinity
River within and adjacent to the existing
Dallas Floodway, Dallas, TX.
The BVP project study area is located
within the Dallas Floodway along the
Trinity River, in Dallas, TX. The study
area is bounded on the upstream by the
Loop 12 crossings of the West and Elm
Forks and at the downstream end by the
existing terminus of the Dallas

Floodway approximated by the existing
Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART)
Bridge. Of the 22.6 miles of levees
within the study area, the East Levee is
11.7 miles in length and the West Levee
is 10.9 miles in length. In addition to
the levees, the Floodway includes the
modified channel, six pumping plants
and seven pressure conduits. There are
approximately 1,422 acres of land in the
study area.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For
questions regarding the BVP EIS or to
add your contact information to the
project mailing database, please contact
Mr. Jeffry A. Tripe, Regional Technical
Specialist, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District, P.O. Box
17300, Fort Worth, TX, 76102–0300,
(817) 886–1716, or via e-mail at
Jeffry.A.Tripe@usace.army.mil.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Dallas
County Levee Improvement District
(DCLID) constructed the original Dallas
Floodway levees between 1928 and
1931. The DCLID rerouted the Trinity
River by constructing a channel within
the leveed floodway and filled the
original river channel or used it for
sump storage. In the mid-forties, major
floods, compounded by continued
urbanization in the watershed, resulted
in increased drainage into the Dallas
Floodway and severe flooding. To
reduce flooding within the Dallas
Floodway project area, Congress
authorized the Dallas Floodway flood
control project in 1945 and 1950. This
resulted in several USACE
improvements to the Dallas Floodway,
completed in 1958.
The existing Upper Trinity River
Feasibility Study (UTRFS) serves as an
umbrella study to all USACE projects in
the basin. The USACE initiated the
UTRFS in response to the authority
contained in the United States Senate
Committee on Environment and Public
Works Resolution dated April 22, 1988.
This authorizing legislation for the
overall study defines the area of
investigations as the Upper Trinity
River Basin, with specific emphasis on
the Dallas—Fort Worth Metroplex. The
UTRFS identified approximately 90
potential projects addressing flood risk
management, ecosystem restoration, and
recreation within the study area.
In May 1996, acting as the nonFederal sponsor on the on-going UTRFS,
the North Central Texas Council of
Governments coordinated with the
USACE and City of Dallas to modify the
UTRFS Cost Sharing Agreement to
include an Interim Feasibility Study of
the existing Dallas Floodway as part of
the on-going UTRFS. The team assessed
several flood risk management

alternatives in the Dallas Floodway
Interim Feasibility Study. The USACE
and City of Dallas also developed
additional environmental quality
alternatives to benefit fish and wildlife
habitat, water quality, and aesthetic
properties while minimizing adverse
impacts to existing cultural resources
and flood risk management benefits. On
November 29, 2005, the USACE
published a Notice of Intent (NOI) in the
Federal Register (70 FR 71477) to
prepare a DEIS for proposed
modifications to the existing Dallas
Floodway based on the Interim
Feasibility Study and held a public
scoping meeting on December 13, 2005.
During this time, the City of Dallas
developed another variation to the
Trinity River Corridor Master
Implementation Plan that included
similar environmental quality measures
and interior drainage system
improvements to the Dallas Floodway,
referred to as the BVP. During
development of the various alternatives
for the Dallas Floodway Interim
Feasibility Study, the 2007 WRDA
authorized the City of Dallas BVP. This
authorization superseded the need to
continue development of the Interim
Feasibility Study and allowed
implementation of the BVP and interior
drainage system components if the
USACE determines they are technically
sound and environmentally acceptable.
In accordance with NEPA, a DEIS will
be prepared to evaluate and compare
ecosystem restoration, flood risk
management, and recreation alternatives
within and along the Dallas Floodway.
The DEIS will also assess the impacts to
the quality of the human environment
associated with each alternative. Past
channelization and clearing of the
Dallas Floodway, along with
urbanization, has significantly degraded
the terrestrial and aquatic habitat along
and within the Trinity River.
Consequently, ecosystem restoration
measures will be developed and
evaluated to address the degraded
habitats. In addition, recreation
measures will be developed and
evaluated as complements to proposed
ecosystem restoration measures.
Alternatives for ecosystem restoration,
flood risk management, and recreation
enhancement will be developed and
evaluated based on ongoing fieldwork
and data collection and past studies
conducted by the Corps of Engineers,
the City of Dallas, and regulatory
agencies. Ecosystem restoration
alternatives that will be evaluated
include creating meanders within the
Trinity River, restoring, protecting and
expanding the riparian corridor,
improving aquatic habitat, creating

Jkt 217001

riffle-pool complexes, and constructing
wetlands. It is anticipated that
ecosystem restoration measures would
help improve water quality, enhance
aquatic and terrestrial habitat, and
minimize erosion and scouring along
and within the river.
Alternatives for flood risk
management measures will be evaluated
from both a non-structural and
structural aspect. Non-structural
measures that will be evaluated include
acquisition and removal of structures or
flood proofing of structures for
protection from potential future flood
damage. Structural measures that will
be evaluated include levee height
modification by fill or addition of flood
walls, changes in interior drainage by
enlarging storage areas or increasing
widths and depths and/or a
combination of these measures.
Recreation measures that will be
evaluated include the West, Natural,
and Urban lakes, terraced playing fields,
multipurpose trails, whitewater
facilities, pedestrian bridges, utilities,
parking facilities, amphitheaters,
promenade, concession pads, boat/
canoe access points, and passive
recreation features, such as interpretive
guidance, media, and picnic areas.
Recreation measures will be developed
to a scope and scale compatible with
proposed ecosystem restoration
measures without significantly
diminishing ecosystem benefits.
The USACE will coordinate with the
public and regulatory agencies to ensure
full and open participation in the NEPA
process and aid in the development of
the DEIS. The USACE requests that all
affected Federal, state, and local
agencies, affected Indian tribes, and
other interested parties participate in
the NEPA process. The public will be
invited to participate in the scoping
process, invited to attend public
meetings, and given the opportunity to
review the DEIS. The location and time
of the first public scoping meeting will
be announced in the local news media.
Release of the DEIS for public comment
is scheduled for summer 2010. The
exact release date, once established, will
be announced in the local news media.
Furthermore, a project Web site
containing project information is
available at http://
www.dallasbvpeis.com.

Notice of Availability of the Final 1999
Programmatic Environmental Impact
Statement for the Dredged Material
Management Plan for the Port of New
York and New Jersey
AGENCY: Department of the Army, U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, DoD.
ACTION: Updated information on the
original Notice of Availability listing.
SUMMARY: The responsible lead agency
is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers—
New York District (District). The
Dredged Material Management Plan
(DMMP) project area is in the Port of
New York/New Jersey and includes the
New York Bight Apex, the Lower Bay
Complex (Lower Bay, Raritian and
Sandy Hook Bays), the Upper Bay
Complex (Hudson and East Rivers, Kill
Van Kull, and Newark Bay), and the
lands contiguous to these water bodies
for a radius of approximately 20 miles.
The study area approximates the
boundaries of the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey (PANY/NJ). The
Final Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement (PEIS) that was listed
in the October 31, 2008 Federal Register
(73 FR 64944) completed the NEPA
process, laying out the goals and generic
impacts of the alternatives considered in
preparing the overall DMMP. This
finalized PEIS includes Appendix (D)
which lists the comments received
during the draft PEIS comment period.
Comments, if warranted, were
incorporated into the main text of the
final PEIS as well.
It should be noted that the DMMP
outlines a series of goals and an overall
master plan on meeting the dredged
material needs of the Port through 2062.
Its alternatives analysis is, as of
necessity, generic in nature, identifying
potential concerns, generic impacts and
overall issues to be considered in greater
site-specific detail before implementing
any alternative in a given location. As
such, it does not recommend or
prioritize any site-specific alternative,
but clearly sets out the process to be
followed should any of the alternatives
be implemented. Since no sustentative
changes or addition of new alternatives
to the DMMP have been identified that
would alter the discussion or
conclusion of generic impacts in the
FPEIS, a supplemental PEIS was not
deemed warranted. However, separate
2005 and 2008 DMMP Update reports
are available tracking the progress in
meeting the DMMP goals and a copy of

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

1.1

INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has identified a broad spectrum of general and projectspecific criteria, the “environmental impact analysis criteria” with which to analyze the potential effects
from implementation of each of the action alternatives. These criteria, organized into four groups, serve as
the basis for the impact analysis presented in Chapter 4:





1.2

Institutional Criteria;
Public Criteria;
Technical Criteria; and
Scientific Criteria.

INSTITUTIONAL CRITERIA

Institutional criteria include those criteria required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for
federal agencies to take into consideration when assessing the potential environmental consequences of
proposed actions in their decision-making process. The intent of NEPA is to protect, restore, or enhance
the environment through well-informed federal decisions. The USACE has prepared this Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with the requirements as outlined in the following sections.

1.2.1

National Environmental Policy Act

This EIS was prepared by the USACE in accordance with the NEPA of 1969 (42 U.S. Code [USC] §
4321), as implemented by Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 Code of Federal
Regulations [CFR] §§ 1500-1508), and USACE Engineer Regulations (ER) 200-2-2. This EIS analyzes
the potential impacts of the Proposed Action and reasonable alternatives, and aims to provide sufficient
evidence for a Record of Decision (ROD), should the decision maker choose to sign a ROD.

1.2.2

Council on Environmental Quality Regulations

The CEQ, established under NEPA, implements and oversees federal processes. The CEQ regulations
implement the procedural provisions of NEPA to ensure that federal programs comply with the guidelines
of NEPA. Congress established the CEQ within the Executive Office of the President as part of NEPA.
The Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970 provides additional authority for CEQ regulations.
The CEQ has issued the Regulations for Implementing Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR §§ 15001508).

1.2.3

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Regulation 200-2-2

USACE ER 200-2-2, Procedures for Implementing NEPA, dated 4 March 1988, establishes USACE
procedures for implementing NEPA and CEQ regulations. The implementing procedures in ER 200-2-2
provide a framework for complying with NEPA and CEQ requirements for all applicable USACE actions.

1.2.4

Clean Air Act

The Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970, as amended, (42 USC §§ 7401-7671q) including the 1990 General
Conformity Rule, sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards for sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen dioxide, lead, and ozone, and particulate matter with a diameter less than or equal to 10 microns
and 2.5 microns. The CAA regulates construction and operation of new stationary sources and
modifications of existing stationary sources in its New Source Review program. Non-attainment areas
require permitting of all major pollution sources, attainment areas require the installation of the best

1

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

available control technology for all major sources, and major pollution sources require an air quality
permit before construction.

1.2.5

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972, as amended (33 USC §§ 1251 et seq.), is the primary federal law
that protects the nation’s waters, including lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. The primary objective of the
CWA is to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation’s waters. Jurisdictional waters of the U.S. are
regulated resources and are subject to federal authority under Section 404 of the CWA.
The USACE broadly defines jurisdictional waters to include navigable waters, intermittent streams,
impoundments, tributary streams, and wetlands. Areas meeting the “waters of the U.S.” definition are
under the jurisdiction of the USACE. Anyone proposing to conduct a project that requires a federal permit
or involves dredge or fill activities that may result in a discharge to U.S. surface waters and/or waters of
the U.S. is required to obtain a CWA Section 401 Water Quality Certification, verifying that the project
activities will comply with water quality standards.

1.2.6

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act

Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA) (42 USC §§ 9601-9675) on December 11, 1980. This law created a tax on the chemical and
petroleum industries and provides broad federal authority to respond directly to releases or threatened
releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or the environment. CERCLA also
established “Superfund” to aid in the rehabilitation of polluted sites in which responsible parties cannot be
determined or are no longer in existence.

1.2.7

Endangered Species Act

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 USC §§ 1531 et seq.), establishes a process
for identifying and listing plant and animal species as “threatened” or “endangered.” It requires all federal
agencies to carry out programs for the conservation of federally listed endangered or threatened plants
and animals. It also prohibits actions by federal agencies that would likely jeopardize the continued
existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of
designated critical habitat.
Section 7 of the ESA requires federal agencies proposing actions that may affect listed species or critical
habitats to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and/or the National Marine Fisheries
Service to ensure that they do not jeopardize listed species or destroy critical habitat. Section 9 of the
ESA prohibits the “taking” of listed species. The ESA (§ 3[19]) defines the term “take” to mean to
“pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect” any listed species, or to attempt those
activities.

1.2.8

Executive Order 11988 – Floodplain Management

Executive Order (EO) 11988 requires federal agencies to avoid “to the extent possible the long and shortterm adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid direct
and indirect support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative.” In
accomplishing this objective, "each agency shall provide leadership and shall take action to reduce the
risk of flood loss, to minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health, and welfare, and to restore
and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains in carrying out its responsibilities"
for the following actions:

2

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria




Acquiring, managing, and disposing of federal lands and facilities;
Providing federally-undertaken, financed, or assisted construction and improvements; and
Conducting federal activities and programs affecting land use, including but not limited to water
and related land resources planning, regulation, and licensing activities.

USACE ER 1165-2-26 contains the USACE’s policy and guidance for implementing EO 11988. Per ER
1165-2-26, the USACE must first determine whether there are practicable alternatives to placing a
proposed project in a floodplain. In addition, ER 1165-2-26 specifies that all reasonable factors should be
taken into consideration when determining practicability. These factors are: conservation; economics;
visual; natural and beneficial values served by floodplains; impact of floods on human safety; locational
advantage; the functional need for locating the development in the floodplain; historic values; fish and
wildlife habitat values; endangered and threatened species; federal and state designations of wild and
scenic rivers, refuges, etc.; and in general the needs and welfare of the people.

1.2.9

Executive Order 11990 – Protection of Wetlands

The purpose of EO 11990, dated May 24, 1977, is to "minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of
wetlands and to preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands.” To meet these
objectives, EO 11990 requires federal agencies, in planning their actions, to consider alternatives to
wetland sites and limit potential damage if an activity affecting a wetland cannot be avoided. The Order
applies to:



1.2.10

Acquisition, management, and disposition of Federal lands and facilities construction and
improvement projects which are undertaken, financed or assisted by federal agencies;
Federal activities and programs affecting land use, including but not limited to water and related
land resources planning, regulation, and licensing activities.

Executive Order 12898 - Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-income Populations

EO 12989, dated February 11, 1994, aims to: 1) focus the attention of federal agencies on the human
health and environmental conditions in minority communities and low-income communities with the goal
of achieving environmental justice; 2) foster non-discrimination in federal programs that substantially
affect human health or the environment; and 3) give minority communities and low-income communities
greater opportunities for public participation in, and access to public information on, matters relating to
human health and the environment.

1.2.11

Executive Order 13045 - Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks
and Safety Risks

Issued on April 21, 1997, EO 13045 requires each federal agency to “…make it a high priority to identify
and assess environmental health and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children and
shall…ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and standards address disproportionate risks to
children…”

1.2.12

Executive Order 13112 – Invasive Species

EO 13112, issued on February 3, 1999, requires federal agencies to address invasive species concerns and
to not authorize or carry out new actions that would cause or promote the introduction of invasive species,
and established the Invasive Species Council. The intent of EO 13112 is to prevent the introduction of

3

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

invasive species; provide for their control; and minimize the economic, ecological, and human health
impacts that invasive species cause.

1.2.13

Executive Order 13175 - Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal
Governments

EO 13175, dated November 6, 2000, directs federal agencies to establish regular and meaningful
consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal
implications, to strengthen the U.S. government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes, and to
reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon Indian tribes.

1.2.14

Executive Order 13186 - Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory
Birds

EO 13186, dated January 10, 2001, directs executive departments and agencies to take certain actions to
advance the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). The U.S. recognized the critical
importance of this shared resource by ratifying international, bilateral conventions for the conservation of
migratory birds. These migratory bird conventions impose substantive obligations on the U.S. for the
conservation of migratory birds and their habitats. Through the MBTA, the U.S. has implemented these
domestic obligations under these migratory bird conventions.

1.2.15

Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act

The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA, 16 USC §§ 661-667(e)) provides the basic authority for
the USFWS’s involvement in evaluating impacts to fish and wildlife from proposed water resource
development projects. It requires that fish and wildlife resources receive equal consideration to other
project features. It also requires Federal agencies that construct, license or permit water resource
development projects to first consult with the USFWS and state fish and wildlife agency regarding the
impacts on fish and wildlife resources and measures to mitigate these impacts.

1.2.16

Historic Sites Act of 1935

The Historic Sites Act (HSA) of 1935, as amended (16 USC §§ 461-467), establishes a national policy for
the preservation of historic resources, including sites and buildings. The HSA led to the establishment of
the National Historic Landmarks program and forms the basis for the Historic American Building
Survey/Historic American Engineering Record, the program that establishes standards for conducting
architectural and engineering documentation.

1.2.17

Memorandum of Agreement between the U.S. Army and the Federal Aviation
Administration to Address Aircraft-Wildlife Strikes

The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) service to establish awareness among the signatory agencies
(which also include the U.S. Air Force, USEPA, USFWS, and U.S. Department of Agriculture) of the
risks that aircraft-wildlife strikes pose to safe aviation. This MOA establish procedures necessary to
coordinate agency missions to more effectively address existing and future environmental conditions
contributing to aircraft-wildlife strikes throughout the United States. These efforts are intended to
minimize wildlife risks to aviation and human safety, while protecting environmental resources. The
MOA relies on FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5200-338 (August 2007) to provide siting criteria for
developments that may attract wildlife that is hazardous to aviation. The MOA was signed by the U.S.
Army on 9 December 2002 and by the FAA on 17 December 2002.

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

1.2.18

Memorandum of Agreement between the U.S. Army and the USEPA Discussing
the Determination of Mitigation under the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines

The MOA provides guidance to the USACE and the EPA for implementing CWA Section 404(b)(1)
when considering mitigation requirements for standard permit applications. The USACE uses this MOA
when making determinations of compliance with CWA Section 404(b)(1) with respect to mitigation for
standard permit applications. The EPA uses this MOA in developing its position on compliance with the
CWA Section 404(b)(1) for proposed discharges and will reflect this MOA when commenting on
standard permit applications. This MOA also specifically emphasizes the requirement that the least
environmentally damaging practicable alternative be selected when planning actions subject to CWA
Section 404(b)(1). The MOA was signed by the U.S. Army and the USEPA on 6 February 1990.

1.2.19

Migratory Bird Treaty Act

The MBTA of 1918, as amended (16 USC §§ 703 et seq.), is the main regulatory mechanism for
protecting migratory birds in the U.S. Migratory birds generally include all native birds in the U.S.,
except non-migratory species such as quail and turkey. Under the provisions of the MBTA, it is unlawful
“by any means or manner to pursue, hunt, take, capture [or] kill” any migratory birds except as permitted
by regulations issued by the USFWS.

1.2.20

National Historic Preservation Act

The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (16 USC § 470), recognizes the
nation’s historic heritage and establishes a national policy for the preservation of historic properties as
well as the National Register of Historic Places. Section 106 of the NHPA requires federal agencies to
take into account the effects of federal undertakings on historic properties, and affords the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation and State Historic Preservation Officer a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such undertakings. The Section 106 process, as defined in 36 CFR § 800, provides for
identifying and evaluating historic properties, for determining the effects of proposed projects on such
properties, and for developing ways to resolve adverse effects through consultation with interested
parties.

1.2.21

Noise Control Act

The Noise Control Act (NCA) of 1972 (42 USC §§ 4901-4918) initiated a regulatory program with the
intent of protecting human health and minimizing annoyance of noise to the general public. The NCA
established mechanisms of setting emission standards for noise, including motor vehicles. The regulatory
authority of the NCA requirements lies with the USEPA.

1.2.22

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976, as amended (42 USC §§ 6901 et seq.),
authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to manage hazardous waste. This
includes the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA also
set forth a framework for the management of non-hazardous solid wastes. The 1986 amendments to
RCRA enabled the USEPA to address environmental problems that could result from underground tanks
storing petroleum and other hazardous substances.

5

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

1.2.23

Rivers and Harbors Act

Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (as amended; 33 USC § 403) regulates structures or
work that would affect navigable waters of the U.S. Structures include any pier, wharf, bulkhead, etc.
Work includes dredging, filling, excavation, or other modifications to navigable waters of the U.S. The
USACE issues permits for work or structures in navigable waters of the U.S.

1.2.24

Safe Drinking Water Act

Congress originally passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 (42 USC §§ 300 et seq.) to protect public
health by regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. The law, amended in 1986 and 1996,
requires many actions to protect drinking water and its sources.

1.3

PUBLIC CRITERIA

Public Criteria include those criteria deemed important by the public. These criteria include things such as
flood risk management, visual corridors, and recreational opportunities. As part of the public involvement
process, the USACE solicited input from the public as to public areas of concern. The following areas
were identified by the public as being of concern and worthy of consideration during the public scoping
period:









Aquatic Recreation (canoeing);
River Morphology;
Wildlife and Plant Diversity;
Geological and Paleontological Resources;
Preservation and Conservation of Natural Resources;
Flood Risk Management;
Wetland Restoration; and
Cultural Resources.

At the conclusion of the Public Scoping Period, the USACE prepared a report capturing all received
comments.

1.4

TECHNICAL CRITERIA

Technical Criteria include those criteria developed by the USACE that demonstrate consistency with the
technical aspects of the USACE mission, namely, flood risk management. These criteria will assist in
determining the “technical soundness” of the project. A project must meet the following technical criteria:
1. Proposed modifications function per intended technical purposes
2. Project complies with all relevant laws
3. Geotechnical Criteria:
a. Technical data must be provided to validate and verify side slope stability, stability of
slope protection, and constructability of excavations.
4. Civil Criteria:
a. Demolition Plans: Provide sufficient data to describe items to be removed.
b. Layout Plans: Provide adequate horizontal and vertical controls for all new project
features.

6

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

c. Grading Plans: Provide grading limits with proposed contour lines, spot elevations,
finished elevations of structures and match to adjacent existing ground surfaces.
d. Utility and Bridge Relocations: Assure that all pertinent utility or bridge details are
properly cross-referenced to be removed or relocated and not impede the function of the
project.
e. Construction Phasing and Traffic Control: Procedures and coordination for the
integration of several work items, other work in progress, utility service disconnections,
methods, and equipment for each sequence of operation, a traffic control plan complying
with local, state, and federal criteria for haul routes and existing traffic.
f.

Outfall Modification Criteria: Provide adequate location of the outfall structures to
convey the local runoff flow discharging laterally into the flood damage reduction
project.

g. Right-of-Way, Disposal, Access, and Staging Area: Right-Of-Way will be described in
sufficient detail in order for accurate project land acreage to be developed and quantified
for the local sponsors to determine the real estate requirements for this project.
h. Care of Water Criteria: Control of water in the construction area regardless of its source
or quantity, up to the project limits.
5. Hydrology and Hydraulics Criteria:
a. The project does not degrade the stream system by causing stream bank instability,
increasing sediment deposition in stream channels, increasing lateral erosion of stream
banks causing widening of the channel, or causing vertical erosion of the channel bed
leading to channel incision and head cutting.

1.4.1

1988 Upper Trinity River Environmental Impact Statement Record of Decision
Criteria

Based on the Trinity River Environmental Impact Statement (TREIS) findings, the USACE issued a ROD
in April 1988 specifying criteria the USACE would use to evaluate Section 408 permit applications in the
Trinity River Corridor (TRC), specifically, projects located within the standard project flood (SPF)
floodplain of the Elm Fork, the West Fork, and the main stem of the Trinity River. The criteria as
presented in the ROD are as follows:
1. Hydraulic Impacts: No rise in the 100-year or SPF elevation for the proposed condition will be
allowed;
2. Storage Capacity: The maximum allowable loss in storage capacity for the 100-year and SPF
discharges will be 0 percent and 5% respectively; and
3. Water Velocity: Alterations in the floodplain may not create or increase an erosive water velocity
on or off-site.
In addition, the ROD further states that an action proponent must consider the cumulative impacts of
other projects in the vicinity:
“Cumulative Impacts - The upstream, adjacent, and downstream effects of the applicant’s
proposal will be considered. The proposal will be reviewed on the assumption that
adjacent projects will be allowed to have an equitable chance to be built, such that the
cumulative impacts of both will not exceed the common criteria.”

7

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

The USACE has used the Upper Trinity River ROD hydrologic and hydraulic (H&H) criteria since the
signing of the ROD in 1988 as a measure to evaluate the impacts of proposed developments in the TREIS
study area for Section 408 permit actions. These criteria are applicable to the Dallas Floodway Project
(DFP) EIS.

1.4.2

Regional Trinity River Corridor Development Certificate Process

In response to the TREIS and ROD, the cities and counties in the TRC formed the Trinity River Steering
Committee (Steering Committee), facilitated by the North Central Texas Council of Governments
(NCTCOG). The Steering Committee adopted a Draft Statement of Principles for Common Permit
Criteria (January 1988), a Resolution for a Joint Trinity River Corridor Development Certificate (CDC)
Process (December 1988), and a Regional Policy Position on the Trinity River Corridor (January 1989).
In addition to the policy-oriented Steering Committee, a technically oriented Flood Management Task
Force comprised of city and county staff developed a process and manual based on the criteria outlined in
the USACE TREIS ROD. The result was the publication of the 1st Edition of the CDC Manual on May
23, 1991. Nearly two years later, all participating cities and counties had officially amended their
floodplain ordinances to adopt the CDC Common Regional Criteria and process. This Common Regional
Criteria is nearly identical to the H&H criteria established in the 1988 TREIS ROD with the only
difference being the statement: “No increase in the 100-year flood water surface elevation and no
significant increase in the SPF water surface elevation.”
The NCTCOG uses the Common Regional Criteria for CDC permit actions to evaluate proposed projects
within the Regulatory Zone of the Upper Trinity watershed. Although the CDC Manual serves as a guide
for the H&H analysis required for CDC development activity permit applications, the H&H technical
portions of the CDC Manual can also be used to describe the H&H evaluation and analysis procedure for
USACE Section 408 permit actions as the H&H aspects of the two programs are similar. Thus, prior to
initiation, a project must apply for and obtain a CDC from the NCTCOG.

1.4.3

Levee Stability

A project in or adjacent to the DFP must not potentially decrease levee stability and thus the protection of
areas behind the levees from riverine flooding. Components of levee stability include ensuring no levee
penetration, no ground-disturbances within 50 feet of the toe of the levee(s), and no actions that would
result in the increased potential for levee erosion, and therefore decrease the existing level of riverine
flood risk management.

1.4.4

Operational Costs

A project should minimize resulting operational costs under design conditions with the assumption that
staff will perform recommended maintenance activities.

1.4.5

Hydrologic and Hydraulic Modeling and Evaluation Process

The TREIS ROD criteria are used to ensure that projects are designed in such a way that there would be
1) no flood rises in the water surface profile, and 2) no valley storage losses for the 100-year flood and
less than 5% valley storage loss for the SPF event. The evaluation process for the hydraulic impacts of a
proposed project requires that a permit applicant secure the services of an engineer capable of preparing a
Hydrologic Engineering Center – River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) hydraulic model using the current
CDC HEC-RAS model as a base condition. The CDC HEC-RAS model is maintained and usually

8

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

distributed by the USACE to be used for evaluation of all projects that require a Section 408 Permit or a
CDC Permit.
1.4.5.1

Modeling

Often the development of a With-Project HEC-RAS model requires that additional cross sections be
added to the CDC Model to approximate the proposed floodplain geometry changes due to a proposed
project. In these instances, a new base model is developed with the addition of cross sections to the
original CDC HEC-RAS model. This newly developed model is referred to in the CDC Manual as the
“Revised CDC Model” and is then used for comparison to the With-Project Model to evaluate the
project’s hydraulic impacts. The Revised CDC Model and the With-Project Model are then used to
compute water surface profiles through the river reach affected by the proposed development and make a
comparison of the water surface elevations on a cross section by cross section basis.
1.4.5.2

Valley Storage

The second part of the evaluation is the valley storage computation. Valley storage is defined as the water
volume that occupies the floodplain during the passing of the flood event and in this evaluation only the
volume at the flood event peak is computed. Essentially, valley storage is a measure of floodplain volume
capacity. Changes in floodplain volume due to developments can result in changes in the timing of flood
peaks and potentially increase the flood event peak flow. A significant loss of valley storage may in turn
increase the risk of flood damage downstream of the proposed development. Valley storage change is
necessary to determine if a loss of valley storage would occur due to the project implementation, and to
quantify the magnitude of the change. As the hydraulic impact evaluation is a peak flow analysis for the
100-year and the SPF events, the valley storage evaluation is also a peak flow determination.
Valley storage change resulting from a proposed project is based on a comparison of the valley storage or
water volume that originally exists on a project site to the valley storage with the project in place for both
on-site and off-site areas (if a valley storage change occurs off-site). On-site valley storage is the peak
flow water volume below the 100-year and the SPF water surface that exists only on the project site. All
other areas upstream, downstream, and on the opposite side of the river from the project site must be
excluded in the on-site valley storage computation in order to afford adjacent property owners the same
opportunity for development.
While the ROD criteria limit the impacts of proposed projects to no rise in the water surface profile, it
does not preclude a lowering of the water surface profile. However, if a proposed project results in a
lowering of the water surface profile off-site, this would be regarded as a loss in valley storage and must
be computed in the total valley storage change.
In some cases, valley storage losses occurring on one project site may be compensated at another site if it
is within a reasonable distance with consideration for hydrologic impacts. Both sites would then be
regarded as one project and permit conditions would be contingent on both sites for as long as the permit
is valid. In this case, both sites would be used to compute the on-site valley storage. This is the normal
process for smaller projects or projects that involve one or two disconnected sites; however, for more
complex projects that involve multiple sites or may be spread out over a long river reach, defining the onsite conditions becomes more complex.

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

1.4.6

Structure Stability

Facilities constructed as part of a project must demonstrate the potential to have an expected service life
of approximately 50 years under expected conditions and with regular maintenance, without failure or
significant interruption of service.

1.5

SCIENTIFIC CRITERIA

Scientific Criteria include those criteria that represent the recognized scientific or environmental qualities
specific to the study area that will assist in determining the “environmental acceptability” of the project.
These include criteria that are important to local and state interests.

1.5.1

Texas Endangered Species

The State of Texas passed species legislation in 1973 (amended in 1981, 1985, and 1987) that established
a state regulatory mechanism for the management and protection of state listed threatened and endangered
species (in 1975 and 1981) and to regulate the taking or possession of these species. The Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department regulates the taking, possession, transport, export, processing, selling or offering for
sale, or shipping of state listed threatened or endangered fish, wildlife, or plant species.

1.5.2

Section 26 of the Texas Water Code

Section 26 of the Texas Water Code requires that a project develop and implement a Stormwater
Pollution Prevention Plan prior to and during construction activities, as required by the CWA.

1.5.3

State of Texas Water Quality Certification

A project must obtain a water quality certification from the State of Texas prior to the start of
construction, as required by the CWA.

1.5.4

No Net Negative Impact to Fish and Wildlife

A project should ensure that there are no net negative impacts to known federally or state listed fish and
wildlife within the study area. If a project cannot avoid negative impacts to a biological resource, the
project must mitigate for potential impacts at a level determined through agency coordination. Criteria
include the following:
1. Riparian Habitat Criteria: No net loss of annual habitat units as compared to the baseline
conditions.
2. Aquatic Habitat Criteria: No net loss of annual habitat units based on a reference reach using
physical attributes.

1.5.5

Acceptable Environmental Cost/Benefit Ratio

A project should ensure that the expected benefits gained from the action are worth the anticipated costs,
or impacts, to the environment.

1.5.6

Environmental Value

A project should accommodate or at least not negatively affect publicly desired features of recreation,
water quality, and habitat benefits in a safe and healthful environment.

10

Environmental Impact Assessment Criteria

1.5.7

Global System

A project should consider the potential long-term consequences to global environmental conditions and
strive to minimize potential impacts to the global climate.

1.5.8

Environmental Stewardship

A project should encourage users of proposed facilities to respect the resulting and surrounding
environment with appropriate measures such as signs, interpretive displays, and trash disposal facilities.

1.5.9

Green Design

A project should include elements that incorporate “green” features such as recycling, minimization of
uses of irretrievable resources and energy, and energy-reducing design elements.

This chapter analyzes the impacts associated with implementation of Alternative 1, 2, or 3. Alternative 1,
also referred to as the Future Without-Project Condition, is a forecast of the most likely future cumulative
conditions that would exist in the Study Area if no action is taken. The Future Without-Project Condition
incorporates past and present projects (i.e., those projects described in Section 2.9.2.1, Projects Included
in Existing Conditions), and reasonably foreseeable future projects (i.e., those projects summarized in
Section 2.9.2.2, Future Projects). The presentation of the Future Without-Project Condition will help the
decision maker understand the future conditions in the absence of the Proposed Action, and how
implementation of alternative plans may alter that future condition. In effect, Alternative 1 presents a
cumulative analysis of future conditions within the Study Area in the absence of the Proposed Action.
Unless otherwise noted, the Future Without-Project Condition is defined as the year 2065; however, some
resource areas use a different “future” year; these deviations are noted in their respective sections.
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has not developed action alternatives to the 2004
BVP Study, as doing so would be outside of the scope of Section 5141 of the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA) of 2007. The City of Dallas, recognizing that various alternatives for the
potential Trinity Parkway project are in development, has created alternative alignments of the Balanced
Vision Plan (BVP) Study features, and those alternatives are captured by Alternative 2 and 3 in this
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).
As described in detail in Section 2.5.4, Alternative 2 reflects the assumption that the Trinity Parkway is
constructed within the Dallas Floodway. In contrast, Alternative 3 would be implemented with the
assumption that the Trinity Parkway would not be constructed within the Dallas Floodway. As such,
certain BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features identified in Alternative 2 would be different under
Alternative 3. For example, Alternative 2 would be able to maximize construction efficiencies by
improving on the Trinity Parkway footprint, whereas Alternative 3 would allow for different alignments
of BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features resulting from an increase in available area within the
Floodway with the absence of the Trinity Parkway. Under Alternative 3, there would be no change to the
flood risk management (FRM) elements or Interior Drainage Plan (IDP) improvements as described under
Alternative 2.
For each resource area, impacts have been presented for each of the three main components of the
Proposed Action: the FRM elements, BVP Study features, and IDP improvements. Within each
component section, impacts have been presented at “descriptive element” level as presented in Table 2-1.
Furthermore, the descriptive elements impacts have been generally presented for the discrete construction
and operational phases; however, where it has made sense to do so, some impact discussions have been
combined. Construction impacts would not necessarily be “short-term” as construction of the Proposed
Action could take the full implementation period of approximately 15 years to complete. Operational, or
post-construction impacts are presented as being enduring or “long-term.”
A summary of impacts discussion has been provided at the end of each impact section for Alternatives 2
and 3. The summary of impacts discussion provides an overall assessment as to the potential context and
intensity of the impact to the resource area from implementation of each action alternative. Identified
mitigation measures and/or special conservation measures (SCMs) that would be implemented as part of
the selected recommended plan alternative are presented in Chapter 7.

The potential cumulative impacts associated with Alternative 2 or 3 in combination with the identified
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects are presented in this chapter (refer to Section 2.9, Past,
Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects). Under the cumulative impact analysis for Alternative 3,
the potential Trinity Parkway project is assumed to occur; it would just be constructed outside of the
Dallas Floodway but within the Study Area.

LAND USE

4.1.1

Impacts to land use occur whenever there is a change to the existing land use. As stakeholders vary in
how they value different land uses, it can be difficult to determine if a given change in land use is
beneficial, adverse, or if it is a neutral change. However, the application of zoning laws is subject to
public review, and long-range plans are created after substantial public input and workshop meetings with
the public. Thus, the zoning laws of the City of Dallas and the Trinity River Corridor Comprehensive
Land Use Plan (TRCCLUP) serve as the basis for significance threshold in the current analysis.

Approach to Analysis

Activities within the Region of Influence (ROI) include modification of existing improvements and new
construction. Modifications to existing improvements that do not change the use of that land do not
constitute an impact to land use. New construction or demolition that changes how land is used may be a
beneficial or adverse impact. If activities change the use of the land to another use within the same zoning
classification (e.g., an office park changing to a research facility within the Light Industrial zoning
district), then impact is neither adverse nor beneficial, nor is it significant. If however, the change also
requires a zoning variance, then the change may be significant. The next step of analysis would be
whether the change is counter to the TRCCLUP. Activities requiring zoning variances that are also
inconsistent with the TRCCLUP are considered significant adverse changes. Activities requiring zoning
variances that are in line with the TRCCLUP are considered beneficial changes.

30

It is relevant to note that the land use analysis does not consider the intensity of use when determining
significance. For example, an area previously designated as Open Space – Public that was simply mown
lawn may have much more intense usage if it is converted to a soccer field. However, the use itself
remains the same; the land continues to be a public recreational amenity, and thus there is minimal impact
to land use. The change in intensity and type of use within the overarching category (e.g., from picnic
field to soccer field) is captured in the analysis of the resource tied to that category. For the soccer field
improvement used in this example, the change in degree and intensity of use is captured in the analysis
under Section 3.7, Recreational Resources within this EIS.

31

4.1.2

32

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, current land use patterns within the Study Area would
generally remain the same, consistent with prevailing land use and zoning plans. The identified Future
Without-Project Condition projects would comply with existing land use and zoning requirements and
would result in compatible land uses. Several of the identified Future Without-Project Condition projects
would result in minor changes to land use. Those Future Without-Project Condition projects not listed
would not result in a change from existing land use. As summarized in Table 4.1-1, the overall changes in
land use acres would not result in a dramatic change in land use for each of the identified categories. The
largest changes are an increase in Transportation and a decrease in Open Space. The primary driver for
both of these changes would be the potential Trinity Parkway construction within the Dallas Floodway.

The comprehensive plans currently in use (e.g., TRCCLUP and forwardDallas!) incorporate many of the
elements included under the Proposed Action. The comprehensive plans represent a review of Dallas land
use goals and projections through the year 2030. Thus, the Future Without-Project Condition would be
incompatible with the plans and policies of the City of Dallas, the plans and projects for Dallas County,
and those being considered by the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG). Under the
Future Without-Project Condition, these agencies would have to modify their land use plans within the
Study Area and revise projects designed for consistency with planned future land use. Furthermore, under
the Future Without-Project Condition, those factors that have historically defined the economic activity
within the Study Area are expected to continue to do so. Specifically, physical isolation due to the levees,
the continued threat of river flooding, inadequate interior drainage, and the potential for environmental
contamination are all expected to constrain urban revitalization in the Study Area under the Future
Without-Project Condition.

4.1.3

17

Construction is considered consistent with zoning only if the ultimate, operational feature is consistent.
Thus, this land use section does not separate construction from operation, but instead considers them as
part of a single consistency analysis. Construction impacts are mentioned if they have a particular impact
separate from the operational impact.

The construction and operation of the levee modifications would not constitute changes in the use of the
land. The levees would continue to operate as flood control structures throughout construction and
operation. The modifications would not require a zoning variance, nor are the modifications contrary to
the TRCCLUP. Modifications to existing levees that do not change the use of that land do not constitute
an impact to land use.

Upon completion of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (AT&SF) Railroad Bridge modifications, the
bridge would once again be accessible to pedestrians and trail users. The land use itself would not change
with the operation of the site. Instead, it would revert to its preconstruction use by pedestrians on the
Santa Fe Trestle Trail.
Modifications to the existing AT&SF Railroad Bridge that do not change the use would not constitute an
impact to land use. The removal of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge embankments would create a new surface
under the bridge supports. Rather than having open space cut by a transportation use, the open space
would continue under the bridge and be more accessible to visitors of the Floodway. The land use
classification would remain within the Open Space – Public category.
The operation of the site for use as a public recreational amenity would be consistent with the current
zoning of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge and its embankments. Likewise, the operation would be consistent
with the TRCCLUP use for the area and would further the goals within that long range plan.
The embankments would not be accessible during demolition, and demolition may prevent access to the
river. Following embankment removal, the operation of the site for use as a public recreational amenity
would be consistent with the current zoning of embankments for industrial purposes. Likewise, the
operation would be consistent with the TRCCLUP use for the area and would further the goals within that
long range plan.
Nonstructural Flood Control Improvements

19

The nonstructural flood control improvements are policy-based. As no construction or change in land use
is proposed, there would be no impacts to land use.

The construction of the three lakes would maintain approximately of 270 acres of land designated as
Open Space - Public land use. While the designation would remain the same, the nature of the space
would change from terrestrial to aquatic open space uses (City of Dallas 2011).
The area planned for the West Dallas Lake is currently zoned Agricultural, which allows not only
agricultural development, but also public recreational amenities (City of Dallas 2012a). Therefore, the
West Dallas Lake would be consistent with current zoning. Similarly, the Urban Lake straddles the
Agricultural zoning district, the Industrial Research zoning district, and the Planned Development zoning
district for the Trinity River Corridor Special Purpose District. Development within the Trinity River
Corridor Special Purpose District is permitted if it is in support of Central Area District uses, including
recreation. Likewise, public recreational amenities are permissible within the Industrial Research zoning
district (City of Dallas 2012a). Thus, the Urban Lake would be consistent with all the zoning designations
it would overlay. The upstream end of the Natural Lake would also fall within the Trinity River Corridor
Special Purpose District; the lower end of the Natural Lake would be within the Industrial Manufacturing
zoning district, which also permits public recreational facilities (City of Dallas 2012a). Therefore, the
Natural Lake would be consistent with the current zoning. In addition, the three lakes would further the
goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area.

The river modification would convert some land previously designated as Open Space – Public into
Water, and other sections from Water to Open Space - Public. The corridor along the existing and
proposed channel footprint incorporates all zoning districts found within the Floodway, including the
Agriculture, Industrial Manufacturing, Planned Development, and Industrial Research zoning districts.
All of these zoning districts permit the construction of public recreational amenities, and thus the change
in land use would be consistent with the existing zoning (City of Dallas 2012a). In addition, the river
modification would further the goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area.

The proposed wetlands would convert some land previously designated as Open Space – Public into
Water; wetlands that are not designed to maintain water levels throughout the year may maintain their
Open Space – Public designation. The proposed wetlands would occur within all zoning districts found
within the Floodway, including the Agriculture, Industrial Manufacturing, Planned Development, and
Industrial Research zoning districts. The consistency of the wetlands with existing zoning would be
dependent on the ultimate zoning classification of the wetlands by the City of Dallas Planning
Department. If the wetlands are considered “public parks,” they would be consistent with existing zoning
(City of Dallas 2012a). Regardless of the ultimate zoning outcome, the wetlands would further the goals
stated within the TRCCLUP for the area.
Athletic Facilities

The establishment of athletic fields and associated facilities would not change the 2011 City of Dallas
land use designation (Open Space – Public). The usage of land as flex fields, playgrounds, and similar
public recreational amenities is permissible within the Agriculture zoning district (City of Dallas 2012a),
and thus the fields would be consistent with the existing zoning. In addition, the athletic fields would
further the goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area.

Proposed general features including trails, lighting, and restrooms would not result in a change in land use
from the pre-existing Open Space - Public designation. These features would all be considered public
recreation amenities and be permissible in all zoning districts, thus would be consistent with existing
zoning.
Classifying the roads and parking facilities as part of the recreational amenity would bring them into
compliance with zoning; however, the determination of whether or not that classification is appropriate is
the responsibility of the City of Dallas Planning Department. Regardless of the ultimate zoning outcome,
the roads and parking, in addition to the other general features considered, would further the goals stated
within the TRCCLUP for the area.

Modifications to the interior drainage outfalls would change land use designations from Open Space –
Public to Government – Public Facilities. Outfalls are considered public utilities under the City of Dallas
zoning code, and are permitted by Dallas City Code. Because of the size of the outfalls, they would
require completion of a “residential adjacency review” where the Floodway is zoned for Agriculture, as
Agriculture is considered a residential zoning category by the City of Dallas (City of Dallas 2012c).
While the review would be required, the outfall modifications would be consistent with the zoning code,
and would further the goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area.

The proposed improvements at the Hampton Pumping Plant would occur on land designated as Open
Space – Public (City of Dallas 2011). The construction of the New Hampton Pump Station within this
land use designation would constitute a change in land use. Pump stations are considered public utilities
under the City of Dallas zoning code, and are permitted by right in all zoning districts. Because of the size
of the proposed improvements and because the site abuts a residential parcel, a “residential adjacency
review” would be required (City of Dallas 2012b). While the review may be required, the new pump
station and associated improvements would be consistent with the zoning code, and would further the
goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area by supporting stormwater supplies to the Floodway.

The proposed improvements at the Charlie Pumping Plant would occur on land previously designated as

2011). The construction of a new pump station within this land use designation would change the land use
to Government – Public Facilities. Pump stations are considered public utilities under the City of Dallas
zoning code, and are permitted by right in all zoning districts. In this case, the residential adjacency
review may be triggered by a construction site being within the Planned Development Oak Cliff Gateway
zoning district, as this district allows for multiple uses, including residential. At the time of the 2011 City
of Dallas land use inventory; however, the proposed improvement site was not adjacent to any residential
parcels. While the review may be required, the pump station and associated improvements would be
consistent with the zoning code, and would further the goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area by
supporting stormwater supplies to the Floodway.

Government – Public Facilities. Pump stations are considered public utilities under the City of Dallas
zoning code, and are permitted by right in all zoning districts. In this case, the residential adjacency
review would be triggered by the construction site being within an Agriculture zoning district and
crossing into an area zoned dense residential (City of Dallas 2012c). While the review would be required,
the pump station and associated improvements would be consistent with the zoning code, and would
further the goals stated within the TRCCLUP for the area by supporting stormwater supplies to the
Floodway.

Under Alternative 2, the proposed FRM elements would be consistent with the current zoning and
TRCCLUP use for the area, furthering the goals of the TRCCLUP. The proposed BVP Study features
would be consistent with current zoning. In addition, the river modifications would further the goals
stated within the TRCCLUP for the area. Some areas would first require completion of a “residential
adjacency review.” However, while a review would be required, the proposed improvements would be
consistent with the zoning code and would further the goals stated within the TRCCLUP. The
comprehensive plans currently in use (e.g., TRCCLUP and forwardDallas!) incorporate many of the
elements included under Alternative 2. Thus, implementation of Alternative 2 would be compatible with
the plans and policies of the City of Dallas, the plans and projects for Dallas County, and those being
considered by the NCTCOG. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial
impacts to land use. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or
mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

4.1.3.5

15

Under Alternative 2, current land use patterns within the Study Area would generally remain the same,
consistent with prevailing land use and zoning plans. The changes anticipated from the implementation of
Alternative 2 are primarily improvements within the pre-existing land use category. For example, the
BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would occur within the Open Space land use designation.
While the recreation within the Open Space may change to more active or directed uses allowed by
improved infrastructure and recreational facilities, the categorization remains within the overall Open
Space – Public designation. Alternative 2 in combination with the identified reasonably foreseeable
projects would comply with existing land use and zoning requirements and would result in compatible
land uses. Several of the identified projects would result in minor changes to land use. Those changes are
as summarized in Table 4.1-1, including the predicted increase in Transportation and decrease in Open
Space. The primary driver for both of these changes would be the potential Trinity Parkway construction
within the Floodway.

Summary

Cumulative Impacts

The potential Trinity Parkway project includes land acquisition and the change of private commercial,
industrial, and other uses to Transportation. The Trinity Parkway right-of-way covers 559 acres. Of that
area, 100 acres are currently privately owned and used for residential, commercial, industrial, or rail
transportation purposes. The remainder is owned by the City of Dallas and is undeveloped Open Space,
including sump space. While this project would result in a substantial change in land use, the potential
Trinity Parkway is incorporated into the TRCCLUP and other land use plans (Federal Highway
Administration [FHWA] 2014).

39

The comprehensive plans currently in use (e.g., TRCCLUP and forwardDallas!) incorporate many of the
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. Thus, the cumulative contribution of Alternative 2
would substantially further the plans and policies of the City of Dallas, the plans and projects for Dallas
County, and those being considered by the NCTCOG. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in
combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in
beneficial cumulative impacts to land use.

wetlands that are not designed to maintain water levels throughout the year may maintain their Open
Space – Public designation. The consistency of the wetlands with existing zoning would be dependent on
the ultimate zoning classification of the wetlands by the City of Dallas. If the proposed wetlands are
considered “public parks,” they would be consistent with existing zoning (City of Dallas 2012a).
Regardless of the ultimate zoning outcome, the proposed wetlands would further the goals stated within

Alternative 3 includes 2.1 more miles of park roads to be constructed than in Alternative 2. As discussed
in Alternative 2, surface parking is not permitted in the Agriculture, Industrial Manufacture, or Industrial
Research zoning districts. Public roads are not included in the zoning use analysis, and private roads
likewise are not permitted in any of these zoning districts (City of Dallas 2012a). Classifying the roads
and parking facilities as part of the recreational amenity would bring them into compliance with the
zoning; however, classification of the roads and parks is the responsibility of the City of Dallas Planning
Department. Thus, Alternative 3 includes a potentially greater inconsistency with the zoning code than
does Alternative 2.

Regardless of the ultimate zoning outcome, the roads and parking, in addition to the other general features

of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would occur within the Open Space land use designation.

for changes in land use would be the construction of the Trinity Parkway outside of the Floodway.

Summary

Cumulative Impacts

The Trinity Parkway includes land acquisition and the change of private commercial, industrial, and other
uses to Transportation. If the potential Trinity Parkway is not constructed within the Floodway, the
needed right-of-way would cover between 264 and 350 acres. Of that area, between 127 and 206 acres are
currently privately owned and used for residential, commercial, industrial, or rail transportation purposes.
The remainder is owned by the City of Dallas and is undeveloped Open Space, including sump space.
While this is a substantial change in land use, the Trinity Parkway is incorporated into the TRCCLUP and

other land use plans. However, the existing land use plans, including the TRCCLUP, do not consider a
Trinity Parkway alignment outside of the Floodway. Thus, implementing a Trinity Parkway alternative
outside of the Floodway would be counter to land use planning for the existing land uses that would be
taken for the ROI, and require a revision to the existing land use plans for the region (FHWA 2014).
The comprehensive plans currently in use (e.g., TRCCLUP and forwardDallas!) incorporate many of the
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. An alignment for the potential Trinity Parkway that
would be outside of the Floodway would be inconsistent with the land uses anticipated by the plans and
policies of the City of Dallas, the plans and projects for Dallas County, and those being considered by the
NCTCOG. Under Alternative 3, these agencies would have to modify their land use plans within the ROI
and revise development plans for the areas to be overlain by the Trinity Parkway. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 3 in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects would result in less than significant impacts to land use.

The protection of topography, geomorphology, unique geologic features, soils, and siting of structures
away from potential geological hazards are considered when evaluating impacts on geological resources.
Generally, geological resource impacts can be avoided or minimized if proper construction techniques,
erosion control measures, and structural engineering components are incorporated into project design.

19

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, there would be no change to the geologic character of the
area. There are currently no prime farmlands in the Study Area; thus, there would be no impact to prime
farmlands under the Future Without-Project Condition. The topography of the area would largely go
unchanged besides on-going levee maintenance, which may slightly alter levee heights. As shrink-swell
potential within the Floodway soils would remain high, geotechnical investigations are anticipated to
occur to ensure structure stability for the identified future projects.

As the Trinity River flows year round, the natural morphological processes of erosion and siltation would
continue to occur. These changes would be typical of large a river system. Under the Future WithoutProject Condition, levee slides and erosion are anticipated to continue to occur; these areas would
continue to be addressed as part of on-going, enduring maintenance activities.

Construction activities including clearing, grading, and excavating that result in land disturbance of equal

(TXR150000), per the requirements of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPDES) program as
administered by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Construction activities that
result in land disturbance of equal to or greater than 1 acre and less than 5 acres of land are considered
“small construction activities.” Construction activities that result in land disturbance of equal to or greater
than 5 acres of land are considered “large construction activities.” Construction activities include the
disturbance of total land area that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale. Some
individual construction activities may be constructed separate from the larger common plan of

development (e.g., IDP Improvements). If this occurs, and the individual project disturbs equal to or
greater than 1 acre, then the individual would comply with the Construction General Permit
(TXR150000), as required.
Construction activities within the Floodway would be considered part of the same common plan of
development, would disturb more than 5 acres of land, and would therefore comply with the requirements
of a large construction activity. Before construction, a Notice of Intent would be submitted to TCEQ for
compliance with the General Stormwater Permit for Construction Activities and a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) would be developed. The SWPPP would outline site-specific best management
practices (BMPs) in accordance with TXR150000, which would minimize erosion and control sediment
resulting from construction activities.
BMPs include schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, structural
controls, local ordinances, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the discharge of
pollutants. BMPs also include treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control
construction site runoff, spills or leaks, waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage areas
(TCEQ 2013). The use of BMPs such as silt fencing and sediment traps, the application of water sprays,
and the prompt revegetation of disturbed areas would reduce potential impacts. Implementation of
sediment and erosion controls during construction activities would maintain runoff water quality at levels
comparable to existing conditions.
Alternative 2 would temporarily disturb soils during construction. There would be an associated risk of
increased rate of erosion and soil loss from physical disturbance with construction activity; however,
compliance with standard operating procedures and the SWPPP would minimize impacts. Soils within the
Study Area have low erosion factors and construction would not occur on steep slopes. Construction
activities under Alternative 2 would include clearing, grading, and grubbing, demolition, earthwork, and
landscaping around predominately previously disturbed areas. Whenever possible, cut soil would be used
for fill on-site or at nearby projects to minimize impacts to soil. Disturbed areas would be seeded or resodded and then would be checked periodically to ensure that grass coverage is properly maintained and,
when necessary, the site would be watered, fertilized, and reseeded or sodded. These additional actions
would help reduce erosion.

Construction

36

Surface disturbance as a result of excavating approximately 105-acres for the borrow pits would be
approximately 115 acres. The proposed access roads would be 10 feet wide and comprised of crushed
limestone aggregate to a depth of 8 inches. Beneath the limestone a geo-textile liner would be placed as
part of the road structure to prevent seepage. After completion of the access roads and levee raise
activities, scarification and seeding would finalize the levee improvements and flattening. Any remaining
cut material would be rough graded into other areas of the Floodway, and/or transported off-site to a
designated landfill.

Operation

38

Impacts to topography would result from borrow pit excavation; however, the western pit would remain
and eventually be incorporated into the proposed West Dallas Lake. The eastern borrow pit would be
incorporated into the proposed river sinuosity. The levees, which are already a prominent topographic
feature in the Floodway, would be raised in certain areas, creating greater topographic relief. Although

changes in topography would occur, those impacts would be minimal and the area would remain
relatively flat. The proposed levee raise and flattening actions would strengthen the levees.
Slope improvements by way of levee flattening would reduce riverside slopes from 3:1 to 4:1. The
flattened slopes would reduce the risk of levee erosion.
AT&SF Railroad Bridge Modifications

13

Proposed demolition activities would require grading and dirt moving to level an access road before
activities could begin. Total soil disturbance would be approximately 1.5 acres. In addition, three
embankments would be removed. As part of the removal process, the embankment material would be
evaluated for potential reuse within the Floodway. If, however, it is found to be not authorized for reuse
within the Floodway, the material would be disposed of in the nearest suitable landfill. The proposed
activities would cause sedimentation and erosion due to clearing and disturbance of soils until they are
revegetated. Disturbed areas that are seeded or resodded would be checked periodically to ensure that
coverage is properly maintained and would be watered, fertilized, and reseeded or sodded if necessary.

14

Operation

15

20

Topography would be slightly impacted from the embankment removals. However, the embankments are
not natural geologic features. The Santa Fe Trestle Trail embankment was constructed as a result of the
Santa Fe Trestle Trails Project (completed in 2012), while the earthen railroad embankment was
constructed in 1926; therefore, there would be no impacts to natural topography. No geologic units, soils,
or prime farmland would be impacted by the AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications, as none are located
in the Study Area.

Proposed construction activities would require excavation, and grading to establish desired building pads,
recreational fields, trails, lakes, river relocation, roads, wetlands, and boardwalks. Also, contractors would
remove any potential underground obstacles and place any needed fill material in the area. The relatively
flat topography of the Study Area would alleviate some excessive cut and fill excavation; however, the
nature of the construction and scale of the BVP Study features would include excavation and grading
throughout much of the Dallas Floodway, resulting in the potential for erosion. The Trinity clay and
Trinity-Urban land complex found throughout the Floodway contain a low erodibility hazard.
The excavation necessary to re-create meanders in the Trinity River, combined with the excavation of the
lakes would be approximately 6.1 million cubic yards. Concurrently, the fill needed for FRM levee raise
elements would be 860,000 cubic yards and the potential Trinity Parkway project would be 4.1 million
cubic yards. Therefore, under Alternative 2, approximately 2 million cubic yards of fill would need to be
relocated off-site to a designated landfill or re-used within the Floodway for other proposed features. The
excess fill would not be sold.

35

Topography

36

The majority of the BVP Study features would have little to no impact on the existing site topography.
However, areas nearest the proposed Urban and Natural Lakes would be transformed; formerly flat
regions of the Floodway would become lakes. Terraced playing fields would also be created upstream of

Sylvan Road. While the proposed BVP Study features would slightly alter the existing topographic setting
of the Dallas Floodway, these impacts would be minimal and remain consistent with the existing
topography.

Geology

8

Implementation of the proposed BVP Study features would not substantially affect the geologic units
underlying the Dallas Floodway. As mining operations have not taken place in the Floodway since the
1960s and quarrying efforts are not planned, the operation of the BVP Study features would not impact
quarrying operations or mining resources in the area.

Geologic Hazards

7

14

The City of Dallas is located in an area of historically low seismic activity and with no known active
faults within 60 miles of the Dallas Floodway. As soils within the Floodway have a very high shrinkswell potential, geotechnical studies would be completed at the proposed building locations during the
planning/design phase. Recommendations based on the geotechnical study should include appropriate
siting and building requirements to minimize soil shrink-swell hazards.

15

Soils

16

23

Slope stabilization measures and scour reduction would be incorporated into BVP Study features. These
measures would include but would not be limited to riprap, stone slabs/boulders, riparian buffer plantings,
articulating concrete block mats, or retaining walls. The addition of nine miles of walking/biking trails
would have the potential to increase erosion, as previously vegetated areas would have exposed soils.
However, many of the areas along the Floodway are currently sparsely vegetated and susceptible to
erosion. The proposed landscaped and engineered areas would have lower runoff rates and consequently
lower erosion levels. Overall, areas along the Floodway would likely have reductions in erosion levels
from decreases in erosion and increased vegetative cover.

24

Geomorphology

25

Alternative 2 proposes substantial physical changes to the channel and Floodway including the restoration
of channel meanders, creation of a mid-channel island, alterations to channel geometry, and general
enhancement of aquatic and riparian habitat throughout the corridor. All of the proposed meander bends
for the relocated Trinity River would fall within a naturally stable channel. However, meander bends in
rivers are typically the result of lateral channel migration driven by long-term processes of erosion and
deposition. While channel migration rates are anticipated to be relatively low, meander bends would be
protected with bank treatments designed to prevent lateral migration and channel instability. Furthermore,
where feasible, channel bank slopes would be flattened to 4:1 on the insides of the meander bends and
remain at 3:1 on the outsides of the meander bends. This configuration would approximate a more natural
geomorphic condition typical of meandering rivers. Areas upstream and downstream of the Study Area
would retain their more complex channel alignment and geometry (City of Dallas 2009).

The creation of lakes within the Floodway would create a “smoother” surface for flood waters (compared
to the vegetated surface that currently exists). Because this condition would result in downstream effects,
features such as berms and trees would be introduced into the Floodway to slow flood velocity so that
there would be no net increase or decrease in flood conveyance, resulting in a natural erosional and
depositional channel migration processes.

Levee Stability

2

Proposed river meanders and lakes could create seepage issues as water pressure would be closer to the
toe of the levees, increasing the likelihood that the levees could become destabilized. In determination of
the potential issues that could arise from seepage, the USACE Geotechnical Section has determined, in
conjunction with the geotechnical report, that a 150 foot buffer from the proposed levee toe should be
sufficient to reduce the seepage failure mechanism.

13

Moreover, there are some concerns regarding the depth to which the lakes are being excavated.
Specifically, the depth of excavation for West Dallas Lake is quite substantial at 24 feet from the existing
grade; the lake itself from top of bank to bottom depth is 22 feet in depth. Further seepage analysis may
need to be completed at this location to determine appropriate offset distances for the depth of this lake.
At this stage of feasibility there is no definitive requirement for cutoff walls pending future seepage
studies. If the footprint of the lakes changes to any extent, the cutoff wall option would have to be reevaluated at that juncture to prevent levee instability.

14

Prime Farmland Soils

15
17

As there is currently no designated prime farmland in the Study Area, implementation of proposed BVP
Study features would be exempt from the requirements of the Farmland Protection Policy Act, and a
Farmland Conversion Impact Rating Form (Form AD-1006) would not be required.

The construction the New Hampton Pump Station would minimally increase impervious surfaces, which
would increase stormwater runoff and erosion rates. However, these increases would be minimized
through engineering design and BMPs. A retaining wall would be constructed to prevent erosion and
protect the sides of the proposed New Hampton Pump Station, which would also help reduce erosion.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would include the installation of stormwater and associated runoff
management design features (e.g., catch basins and channels) to prevent potential erosion associated with
stormwater drainage. Stormwater would flow up and over the levee via dedicated pipes. The pipes would
rest on concrete pedestals and the pedestals would be connected to a reinforced concrete bedding slab that
would be “notched” into the levee in accordance with geotechnical requirements. The river side of the reconstructed embankment over the discharge pipes would be protected from erosion by an articulated
concrete revetment mat (URS 2009a).
No changes in topography would occur under the construction of the New Hampton Pump Station. As no
unique geologic features or prime farmland soils are located within the Study Area, no impact to these
geological resources would occur.

Excavation of the Charlie Pump Station would remove approximately 12,000 cubic yards of soil. Roughly

would remedy the current erosional issues of the existing old Charlie Pump Station. Furthermore, the
unstable loose soil that continually erodes from around the existing outfall structure would be stabilized
(URS 2009b). Stormwater pipes would be secured to levee as described above for the Hampton Pump
Station.
Alternative 2 would include the installation of stormwater and associated runoff management design
features (e.g., catch basins and channels) to prevent potential erosion associated with stormwater

Excavation of the Delta Pump Station would require 12,000 cubic yards of soil. Roughly 10,000 cubic

building would include installation of stormwater and associated runoff management design features (e.g.,
catch basins and channels) to prevent potential erosion associated with stormwater drainage. Stormwater
pipes would be secured to levee as described above for the Hampton Pump Station. No changes in
topography would occur under the construction of the Delta Pump Station. Also, as no unique geologic

would occur.

Similar to the Delta and Charlie Pump Stations, excavation for the Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant would

include installation of stormwater and associated runoff management design features (e.g., catch basins
and channels) to prevent potential erosion associated with stormwater drainage. As the existing area is
relatively undeveloped, construction of the Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant would result in a minor
localized change in topography. Stormwater pipes would be secured to levee as described above for the
Hampton Pump Station.

4.2.3.4

22

Construction related impacts to soils would be minimized through the use of BMPs as required and
developed through the SWPPP and engineering designs. BMPs would be implemented before, during,
and after construction activities in accordance with TXR150000. The proposed FRM elements under
Alternative 2 would reduce on-going levee erosion and remove features inconsistent with the original
topography of the Floodway. Furthermore, the resulting levees would be strengthened as compared to
existing conditions. The proposed FRM elements would include slope stabilization and erosion control
measures. The proposed IDP improvements would not affect levee stability. Also, as no unique geologic
features or prime farmland are located within the Study Area, no impacts to these geological resources
would occur.

Summary

36

Once complete, the levees with the "flattened" slopes would have less erosion potential and be more
stable, thus reducing risk associated with geologic hazards (e.g. slumps and slides). Similarly, the
proposed landscaping and recreation elements would further stabilize soils without reducing soil
productivity. Therefore, operations of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial impacts to geologic and soil
resources. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation
measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

37

4.2.3.5

38

Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in less than significant impacts to geology and soils, and
beneficial impacts to levee stability. Reasonably foreseeable projects that would result in the disturbance
of equal to or more than 1 acre would be required to develop SWPPPs in accordance with TXR150000,

thus minimizing the potential for negative impacts to soils in the ROI. Any modification to the Dallas
Floodway Levee System from a project must apply for a Section 408 Application from the USACE,
ensuring that any proposed alteration would not be injurious to the public interest and would not impair
the usefulness of the levees, limiting cumulative impacts to the levees. No cumulative impacts to unique
geologic features or prime farmland would occur.

16

Potential impacts from the implementation of the Trinity Parkway would result in changes in surface
topography due to cut and fill of slopes, embankment material, excavation, ditching, and/or trenching.
Similarly, any action within the levees would require compliance with 33 U.S. Code Section 408 and
USACE Pamphlet No. 1150-2-1. The Trinity Parkway would be subject to TXR150000 permit
compliance, mandating the use of BMPs and limiting erosion of soils, as none are located in the Study
Area. No impacts to unique geologic features or prime farmland would occur. Extensive coordination
among the project partners has occurred especially in recent years to ensure the potential Trinity Parkway
would not interrupt flood control operations or impact the existing Dallas Floodway levees (FHWA 2014).
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects would result in less than significant cumulative impacts to geology and soils, and
beneficial cumulative impacts to levee stability.

17

4.2.4

18

24

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to geology and soils from implementation of the proposed FRM
elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there would be no
change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections 4.2.3.1 and
4.2.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to geology and soils associated with implementation of the FRM
elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.2.4.1 presents the potential
impacts to geology and soils from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under Alternative 2.

25

4.2.4.1

26

34

The construction of the BVP Study features under Alternative 3 would involve the increased relocation of
cut and fill material within the Floodway, as compared with Alternative 2. Approximately 6.1 million
cubic yards would be excavated for the lakes and other features, with 860,000 cubic yards of those soils
being utilized for the levee raise modification and levee flattening. The remaining 5.2 million cubic yards
would be relocated off-site to a designated landfill and/or rough graded into other areas of the Floodway
in support of other proposed features. The excess fill would not be sold. Alternative 3 would require the
same SWPPP and BMP requirements to mitigate erosion during construction activities as described under
Alternative 2. Operational impacts under Alternative 3 would be the same as those described under
Alternative 2 and presented in Section 4.2.3.2.

35

4.2.4.2

36

Impacts to geology and soils under Alternative 3 would be slightly greater, but not substantially different,
during the construction phase as compared to Alternative 2 because a greater amount of area would be
disturbed to create the lakes. There would be no change in operational conditions between Alternatives 2
and 3. Implementation of Alternative 3 would result in less than significant impacts to geology and soils,
and beneficial impacts to levee stability. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization,
avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

The cumulative impacts of Alternative 3 would be similar to those described for Alternative 2. The
absence of the Trinity Parkway from the Dallas Floodway would reduce the amount of soil disturbance
within the Floodway. Furthermore, topography would be more consistent with existing conditions. If the
potential Trinity Parkway is constructed outside of the Floodway, it may still have the potential to modify
or alter an existing federal flood control project (i.e., the Dallas Floodway). Accordingly, the project
would be evaluated in accordance with Section 408 prior to construction (FHWA 2014). Implementation
of Alternative 3 in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
would result in less than significant cumulative impacts to geology and soils, and beneficial cumulative
impacts to levee stability.

4.3.1

12

The environmental consequences evaluation for Hydrology and Hydraulics (H&H) included the
application of criteria from the Trinity River Environmental Impact Statement (TREIS) Record of
Decision (ROD) and compliance with Executive Order (EO) 11988: Floodplain Management. The ROD
criteria were used to ensure that projects are designed in such a way that there are no flood rises in the
water surface profile for the 100-year flood and Standard Project Flood (SPF) events and that there is no
valley storage loss for the 100-year flood event and less than 5% valley storage loss for the SPF event.

13

15
16
17

Approach to Analysis

31

Water surface profiles were computed for the Revised Corridor Development Certificate (CDC) Model
and the With-Project Model through the river reach affected by the proposed development and a
comparison of the water surface elevations is made on a cross section by cross section basis. The changes
in valley storage represent changes in floodplain volume due to developments that can result in changes in
the timing of flood peaks and potentially increase the flood event peak flow. A substantial loss of valley
storage may in turn increase the risk of flood damage downstream of the proposed development. The
valley storage analysis compared the valley storage that originally exists on a project site against the
predicted amount of valley storage under the Proposed Action. While the TREIS ROD criteria limit the
impacts of proposed projects to no rise in the water surface profile for the 100-year flood and SPF events,
it does not preclude a lowering of the water surface profile. However, if a proposed project would result
in a lowering of the water surface profile off-site, this would be regarded as a loss in valley storage and
must be computed in the total valley storage change. Loss in valley storage could result in an increase to
the water surface profile downstream of the project site, so this was also considered in determining
potential impacts.

The following designations were used to describe the level of project impacts:

and/or valley storage that exceeds the TREIS ROD criteria but would not substantially increase
flooding within the Study Area or downstream.
No impact: The project would meet the TREIS ROD criteria and would have no impact on
flooding potential.

Several of the projects listed for the Future Without-Project Condition are located outside of the Trinity
River floodplain and thus have no river hydraulic impact. For the projects located within the floodplain
that have detailed enough design plans, the existing channel cross section geometry in the Hydrologic
Engineering Center - River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model has been modified, as appropriate. For
some of the other projects located within the floodplain, there was no modeling information available
prior to the development of the Future Without-Project Condition model, and therefore no modifications
to the Future Without-Project Condition model were made for these projects. Future projects are required
to meet TREIS ROD criteria by demonstrating through hydraulic modeling that the project results in no
significant H&H impact to the existing floodplain.

Water Surface Elevations

The computed Future Without-Project Condition water surface elevations at specified locations in the
Study Area for the 100-year and SPF flood events are provided in Table 4.3-2. Because the future
hydrology is expected to change due to changes in land use, the surface water elevations for both existing
and future channel conditions reflects the future increases in runoff. This allows for a comparison with the
100-year flood event and the SPF based solely on changes to floodplain geometry.

As indicated in Table 4.3-2 and Table 1 in Appendix K of this EIS, water surface elevations would rise
slightly for the 100-year flood event at some locations and either remain the same or drop for the SPF
event except for small rise along a short reach upstream of the Corinth St. Bridge. There would be rises in
the water surface profile for the 100-year flood event at several locations on the main stem of the Trinity
River, with a maximum rise of 0.27 feet. This rise occurs within the Floodway on the Trinity River Main
stem where both levees provide flooding risk reduction for the 100-year flood event to the City of Dallas.
The small rise for the SPF event along a short reach upstream of the Corinth St. Bridge has been
computed to average 0.05 foot and is regarded as computationally insignificant.

18

This analysis indicates that because no rise occurs for either flood event for areas upstream of the project,
there would be no increase in flood risk for these areas upstream of the project. However, because water
surface rises occur for the 100-year flood event, this plan as currently designed fails to meet the
requirements of the TREIS ROD criteria for water surface rise.

19

Valley Storage

20

27

The valley storage change for Future Without-Project Condition has been computed at approximately
+0.80% for the 100-year flood event and -2.1% for the SPF event compared to the existing channel
conditions with future runoff (i.e., 2040 discharges). This means that the Future Without-Project
Condition would result in a valley storage loss for the SPF flood event but results in a valley storage gain
for the 100-year flood event. The Future Without-Project Condition as currently designed meets the
valley storage TREIS ROD criteria for both flood events because the valley storage loss for the SPF is
less than the 5% valley storage loss allowed in the ROD criteria and there is no valley storage loss for the
100-year flood event.

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, some projects would be located in the Floodway and require
some modifications to the Floodway, and therefore have the potential to affect (or alter) the fluvial
geomorphology of the Trinity River. However, these projects would result in minimal, if any,
modifications to the bankfull channel, which has remained relatively stable for the past 70 years (refer to
Section 3.3.2.6, Fluvial Geomorphology).

Unlike other resource areas, the analysis contained in this hydrology and hydraulics section looks at the
implementation of the BVP Study FRM elements, BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation Features, and
IDP improvements implemented as one unit and does not separate the individual main components into
separate analyses. This is due to the models and modeling requirements used to determine potential
hydrology and hydraulic impacts from implementation of Alternative 2. Therefore, impacts to hydrology
and hydraulics under Alternative 2 have been presented for the construction and operational phases and
not by the three main components.

15

4.3.3.1

16
18

The FRM elements would result in temporary and minor impacts on the H&H of the Study Area. There
would be potential for localized increase in runoff related to construction activities; however, these
temporary and minor changes would have minimal impacts on 100-year and SPF flood event levels.

19

4.3.3.2

20

The FRM elements under Alternative 2 have been designed to provide FRM for the future SPF event
estimated to be 277,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) by way of implementing the levee height
modification, AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications, levee flattening, and nonstructural flood response
improvements. Therefore, the desired level of SPF FRM would be achieved under Alternative 2. The
BVP Study features under Alternative 2 including the lakes, river channel relocations, ecosystem and
recreation features, would be primarily located within the Floodway and would directly influence the
hydraulics of the Floodway. However, the BVP Study features have been designed to minimize effects on
the hydraulics of the Floodway.

The majority of the project development would be in the Floodway and would result in minimal, if any,
changes to the hydrology of the Upper Trinity watershed. Other factors such as changes in land use of the
upstream watershed would have substantially greater effect on runoff. Changes to the hydrology of the
Upper Trinity watershed have been based on estimates of future land use conditions in the year 2040.
These land use changes are estimated to result in a change from 114,000 cfs to 119,000 cfs for the 100year flood event and from 269,300 cfs to 277,000 cfs for the SPF event (refer to Table 4.3-1).

relationship between the SPF water surface and the proposed levee crest height for both the East and West
Levees. Within the Floodway, the Alternative 2 water surface profile for the 100-year flood event is
generally below the Existing Condition water surface profile except in an area between Commerce Street
and Houston Street. Within the Floodway, the Alternative 2 water surface profile for the SPF event is also
generally below the Existing Condition water surface profile except for in the vicinity of the AT&SF

As indicated in Table 4.3-3 and Table 2 in Appendix K of this EIS, water surface elevations within the
Floodway and upstream of the ROI would rise for the 100-year flood event at some locations and there
would be no rise for the SPF event compared to the Existing Condition. The maximum rise for the 100year flood event would be 0.33 feet. This rise occurs within the Floodway on the Trinity River Main stem
where both levees provide flooding risk reduction for the 100-year flood event to the City of Dallas.
Another rise is indicated upstream of the Elm Fork and West Fork confluence on the West Fork (refer to
Table 2 in Appendix K of this EIS). The 0.06 feet rise on the West Fork is considered insignificant from
the standpoint that further design refinement could likely eliminate such as small rise upstream of the
confluence for the 100-year flood event.

24

This analysis indicates that because water surface rises occur for the 100-year flood event, this plan fails
to meet the requirements of the TREIS ROD criteria; however, the rises for the 100-year flood event
occur within the Floodway on the Trinity River Mainstem where the levees would provide FRM to the
City of Dallas. For the SPF flood event, this analysis indicates that since no rise occurs for areas upstream
of the project, there would be no increase in flood risk for these areas for the SPF flood event.

25

Valley Storage

26

The valley storage change for Alternative 2 has been computed at approximately -0.44% for the 100-year
flood event and more than -3.1% for the SPF event, as compared to the Existing Condition. This means
that implementation of Alternative 2 would result in a valley storage loss for both flood events. The
project as currently designed does not meet the TREIS ROD criteria for the 100-year flood event because
no valley storage loss is allowed for the 100-year flood event. However, the estimated valley storage loss
for the SPF is less than the 5% valley storage loss allowed in the TREIS ROD criteria.

The valley storage loss for the 100-year flood event and the SPF flood event would cause a slight rise in
water surface level of downstream of the Dallas Floodway. While this would technically be regarded as a
potential increase in flood risk, it would be considered less than significant when considering for actual
damages that potentially could be realized for the following reasons. First, the immediate areas
downstream of the Dallas Floodway are affected by the Dallas Floodway Extension (DFE) project, which
is designed to provide flood risk benefits up to the SPF flood event with completion of the proposed
levees. Because the levees have not been constructed, the very small rise estimated for the SPF flood
event may be compensated for in the final design for the DFE levees at a reasonable additional cost. If the
levee construction components for the DFE are extensively delayed or eliminated, the hydraulic benefits
currently realized by completion of the Chain of Wetlands components of the DFE project would more
than compensate for any expected rise due to the estimated valley storage loss for the Dallas Floodway
proposed projects. Secondly, downstream of the DFE project, there are few structures subject to flooding
by the 100-year or SPF flood events.

14

Summary of Hydraulic Impacts

15

Alternative 2 would support achievement of the desired level of SPF FRM for the City of Dallas. In doing
so, Alternative 2 would not meet the TREIS ROD criteria for water surface elevation rise for the 100-year
flood event and for valley storage loss for the 100-year flood event. The analysis indicates that the water
surface elevation rise indicated for the 100-year flood event would be limited to the areas of the Dallas
Floodway on the Mainstem Trinity River and the West Fork. Therefore, there would be no increased risk
of flooding for this reach of the Trinity River because the East and West Levees would be reducing flood
risk on both sides of the floodplain and the small rise (i.e., 0.06 foot) on the West Fork could be
eliminated with further design refinement. The TREIS ROD criteria for water surface rise for the SPF
flood event would be met at every location within the Dallas Floodway and upstream.

Additional design refinement efforts may be able to reduce the valley storage losses and/or reduce the
water surface rises for the 100-year flood event within the Dallas Floodway on the Mainstem Trinity
River; however, meeting the TREIS ROD criteria on every point would likely not be achievable for such
a large and complex combination of projects. Further reducing the negative impacts for valley storage loss
to some extent may be achievable, but since these estimated impacts are relatively insignificant, efforts to
further reduce them are not likely to be cost effective at this level of design. At the current level of design
for the various project components considered, the level of compliance with regard to meeting the goals
of the TREIS ROD criteria is estimated to be very nearly optimal and technically sound from a hydraulic
standpoint. Further hydraulic analysis would be prepared to ensure that these documented potential flood
risk increases do not increase further. This ongoing analysis would be utilized to further reduce or
minimize potential flood risk increases as design opportunities arise during the final design stages of the
various project components. Therefore, impacts from increased flood risk due to hydraulics would be less
than significant.

Following proposed modifications, the Dallas Floodway Levee System would provide flood risk
management to the City of Dallas for flooding from the SPF. In addition, the City of Dallas would also
have flood risk reduction during the 100-year flood event.
As discussed above under the Hydraulics impact analysis, Alternative 2 would not result in substantial
increase in downstream flooding during the 100-year flood event. The designs of the BVP Study features
would reflect the SCMs listed in Chapter 7. Implementation of these SCMs would minimize flood-related
impacts to BVP Study features. Therefore, Alternative 2 would be in compliance with EO 11988.

The river channel relocation portion of the BVP Study would result in the most substantial change to the
Trinity River channel in many decades. The existing channel appears to have remained relatively stable
since the USACE reconstruction of the channel in the 1950s. The BVP Study features proposes physical
changes to the channel and Floodway including restoration of channel meanders, creation of a midchannel island, alterations to channel geometry, and construction of three lakes in the Floodway adjacent
to the channel.
The new river channel pattern would be offset from all sensitive park features in the floodplain by a
distance sufficient to allow for channel adjustments to occur without impacting park features over the life
of the project. Where this is not possible, channel geometry should be strengthened, using bioengineering
approaches that incorporate native vegetation and other natural materials (City of Dallas 2009a). Because
channel bank erosion is a natural and ecologically valuable process in river corridors, the bank treatments
described above would not be intended to prevent all erosion throughout the project area. The proposed
bank treatments would instead be designed to manage erosion in a way that optimizes protection of park
features adjacent to the river channel and creation of aquatic and riparian habitat in areas located away
from park features.

20

The river channel design has undergone hydraulic analysis to ensure that the channel would be stable
under a range of flow conditions (City of Dallas 2009b). The final design would incorporate SCMs
identified in the Trinity River Corridor Project Fluvial Geomorphic Assessment and Basis of River
Realignment Design (City of Dallas 2009b) and listed in Chapter 7; the final design would also be subject
to review by the USACE.

Alternative 2 would support achievement of the desired level of SPF FRM for the City of Dallas. In doing
so, Alternative 2 would not meet the TREIS ROD criteria for water surface elevation rise for the 100-year
flood event and for valley storage loss for the 100-year flood event. However, water surface elevation rise
for the 100-year flood event would be limited to the areas of the Dallas Floodway and the West Fork, and
therefore contained by the levees. Furthermore, the USACE and City of Dallas would request a variance
from the TREIS ROD requirements, with the demonstration of there being no impact to public safety.

Summary

35

Increased flood risk associated with loss of valley storage would be reduced to less than significant
through either the implementation of the DFE project (which can be modified, as needed, to contain the
SPF event) or the hydraulic benefits currently realized by completion of the Chain of Wetlands
components of the DFE Project. The TREIS ROD criteria for water surface rise for the SPF flood event
would be met at every location within the Dallas Floodway and upstream. Alternative 2 would be in
compliance with EO 11988. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in less than
significant impacts to H&H. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance,
and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

future hydrology would represent conditions that include the cumulative impacts associated with

Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. Overall, 2040 land use changes
are estimated to result in a change from 114,000 cfs to 119,000 cfs for the 100-year flood event and
269,300 cfs to 277,000 cfs for the SPF event. This increase would be considered significant; however,
impacts would be reduced to less than significant through the application of FRM elements under
Alternative 2 to increase the level of FRM for the SPF event.
Hydraulics

13

A portion of the Trinity Parkway would be located within the Floodway and would be subject to meeting
the TREIS ROD criteria. The hydraulic analysis prepared for the Trinity Parkway Final EIS indicated that
there would be maximum water surface rise of 0.27 feet for the 100-year flood event within the
Floodway, no rise for the SPF event, a 0.4% gain in valley storage for the 100-year flood event, and a
4.0% loss in valley storage for the SPF event. The Trinity Parkway would not meet TREIS ROD criteria
for the rise in water surface for the 100-year flood event; however, the rise would occur within the
Floodway and present no increased risk of flood damage to existing structures. The Trinity Parkway
meets all other TREIS ROD criteria (FHWA 2014).

The water surface profiles for Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects

Forks are shown on Figures 6-30 to 6-35 of Appendix A of the USACE Feasibility Report. The profiles
shown in these figures are for the 100-year flood event and the SPF event. The profiles show the
relationship between the SPF water surface and the proposed levee crest height for both the East and West
Levees. Within the Floodway, the Alternative 2 and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
water surface profile for the 100-year flood event would be generally below the Future Without-Project
Condition water surface profile except in an area between Commerce Street and Houston Street. Within
the Floodway, the Alternative 2 and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects water surface
profile for the SPF event would also be generally below the Future Without-Project Condition water
surface profile except for in the vicinity of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge.

to the Future Without-Project Condition except in the vicinity of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge. The

The valley storage change for Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects has
been computed at approximately -2.1% for the 100-year flood event and more than -6% for the SPF
event, as compared to the Future Without-Project Condition. This means that implementation of
Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in a valley storage
loss for both flood events. Therefore, Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects would not meet the TREIS ROD criteria for valley storage for the 100-year flood event or the
SPF event.

The valley storage loss impacts would cause a rise in water surface level of 0.07 feet for the 100-year

technically be regarded as a potential increase in flood risk, it would be considered less than significant
when considering for actual damages that potentially could be realized for the following reasons. First,
the immediate areas downstream of the Dallas Floodway are affected by the DFE Project, which is

floodplain. No water surface rises would occur for the 100-year flood event upstream of the confluence.
Therefore, no increased risk of flooding would occur to areas upstream of the Dallas Floodway that do not
have levees. The TREIS ROD criteria for water surface rise for the SPF flood event would be met at
every location within the Dallas Floodway and upstream.

Additional design refinement efforts may be able to reduce the valley storage losses and/or reduce the
water surface rises for the 100-year flood event within the Dallas Floodway on the Mainstem Trinity
River; however, meeting the TREIS ROD criteria on every point would likely not be achievable for such
a large and complex combination of projects. Further reducing the negative impacts for valley storage loss

to some extent may be achievable, but since these estimated impacts are relatively insignificant, efforts to
further reduce them are not likely to be cost effective at this level of design. At the current level of design
for the various project components considered, the level of compliance with regard to meeting the goals
of the TREIS ROD criteria is estimated to be very nearly optimal. Further hydraulic analysis would be
prepared to ensure that these documented potential flood risk increases do not increase further. This
ongoing analysis would be utilized to further reduce or minimize potential flood risk increases as design
opportunities arise during the final design stages of the various project components. Therefore, impacts
from increased flood risk due to hydraulics would be less than significant.

As discussed above under the Hydraulics impact analysis, Alternative 2 and the past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would not result in substantial increase in downstream flooding during the
100-year flood event. Implementation of SCMs under Alternative 2 would minimize flood-related
impacts to BVP Study features. Reasonably foreseeable projects located within the Floodway would
follow similar conservation measures to minimize potential increases in flood risk and flood damage. The
Trinity Parkway would involve substantial encroachment into the floodplain and was subject to a
practicability analysis as required by FHWA regulations to implement EO 11988. Therefore, Alternative
2 and the reasonably foreseeable projects would be in compliance with EO 11988.

The past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects listed under Hydraulics would be located in the
Floodway and require some modifications to the Floodway, and therefore have the potential to affect (or
alter) the fluvial geomorphology of the Trinity River. However, the modification to the river channel
under Alternative 2 would provide the greatest potential for impact to the fluvial geomorphology of the
Trinity River, as described in Section 4.3.3.2. The final design of the river channel relocation would
consider any potential effects from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects on fluvial
geomorphology and would incorporate SCMs listed in Chapter 7 and be subject to review by the USACE.
Summary

25

Implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects would result in less than significant cumulative impacts to H&H.

As noted in Section 4.3.3, all main component features have been combined and analyzed as a unit in the

Alternative 3 would be very similar to Alternative 2 but has some proposed land use revisions that are
based on the assumption that the Trinity Parkway project would not be built. Specific terrain data was not
available for development of a detailed hydraulic model for Alternative 3, however, the differences
between Alternative 3 and Alternative 2 are expected to be predominantly associated with minor
relocation of access roads, trails, and parking lots. From the H&H perspective, these changes are not
expected to result in significant differences in computed water surface profiles, water surface elevations,
or valleystorage for the 100-year and SPF flood events. Therefore, the hydraulic modeling results
presented in Section 4.3.3.2 for Alternative 2 are considered valid for Alternative 3.
The summary of hydraulic impacts under Alternative 3 would be the same as under Alternative 2.
Therefore, impacts from increased flood risk due to hydraulics would be less than significant under
Alternative 3.

The SPF event extent of flooding for Alternative 3 would be essentially the same as for Alternative 2. The
City of Dallas would have flood management for the SPF event by the Dallas Floodway Levee System
following proposed modifications. In addition, the City of Dallas would also have reduced flood risk
during the 100-year flood event.
As discussed under Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would not result in substantial increase in downstream
flooding during the 100-year flood event. Implementation of SCMs would minimize flood-related impacts
to BVP Study features. Therefore, Alternative 3 would be in compliance with EO 11988.
Fluvial Geomorphology

21

The impacts to fluvial geomorphology under Alternative 3 would be the same as described under
Alternative 2; the final design of the river channel relocation would incorporate SCMs listed in Chapter 7
and be subject to review by the USACE.

4.3.4.2

30

Impacts to H&H under Alternative 3 would be similar to those described under Alternative 2. As
described for Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would also fail to meet the requirements of the TREIS ROD
criteria for changes in the water surface elevation and valley storage. The USACE and City of Dallas
would request a variance from the TREIS ROD requirements, with the demonstration of there being no
impact to public safety. Alternative 3 would support achievement of the desired level of SPF FRM.
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 would result in less than significant impacts to H&H. This
conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed
in Chapter 7.

would not impact the hydraulics of the Trinity River. The analysis below compares the Alternative 3 and

2040.

Water Surface Profiles

10

Within the Floodway, the Alternative 3 and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects water
surface profile for the 100-year flood event would generally be below the Future Without-Project
Condition water surface profile except in an area just downstream of the IH-30 Bridge. Within the
Floodway, the Alternative 3 and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects water surface profile
for the SPF event would also generally be below the Future Without-Project Condition water surface
profile except for in the vicinity of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge.

Under Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects, water surface elevations
within the Floodway and upstream of the ROI would rise for the 100-year flood event at two locations
and there would be no rise for the SPF event compared to the Future Without-Project Condition except in
the vicinity of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge. The maximum rise for the 100-year flood event would be
0.27 feet. This analysis indicates that because water surface rises occur for the 100-year flood event, this
alternative would fail to meet the requirements of the TREIS ROD criteria; however, the rises to 100-year
flood event would occur within the Floodway on the Trinity River Mainstem where the levees would
provide FRM to the City of Dallas.

23

Valley Storage

24

The valley storage change for Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects has
been computed at approximately -0.80% for the 100-year flood event and more than -5.1% for the SPF
event compared to the Future Without-Project Condition. This means that the project would result in a
loss of valley storage for both events. Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable

The summary of impacts under Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects

SCMs listed in Chapter 7. Implementation of SCMs under Alternative 3 would minimize flood-related

WATER RESOURCES

24

4.4.1

25

The environmental consequences evaluation for water resources includes a qualitative and quantitative
analysis of surface water and groundwater resources and water quality to the extent possible given
available project data. Environmental impacts were assessed and compared to baseline conditions, items
of public concern, and significance criteria to determine the magnitude of potential impacts to water
resources. The analysis of potential impacts considers both direct and indirect impacts. Direct impacts are
those that may occur during the construction phase of the project and cease when the project is complete
or those that may occur as a result of project operations following the completion of construction. Indirect
impacts are those that may occur as a result of construction or during operations but not as a direct result
of the construction or operational action. Water resources impacts can be negative or beneficial.

Approach to Analysis

Impacts to surface waters (including wetlands) were evaluated by examining the potential of the Proposed
Action to reduce area or functionality of waters. For jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S., the
loss of area was assessed by the total area that would be directly removed either through excavation or fill
or by loss of function as a result of the Proposed Action. Functionality refers to the ability of the wetland

or other waters of the U.S. to trap sediment and nutrients, maintain wildlife habitat (both flora and fauna),
provide recreational uses, and receive, retain, and/or convey water.
Impacts to groundwater were evaluated by examining the potential to alter flow pattern, recharge or
dewatering rates, or result in contamination to the aquifer as a result of the Proposed Action.

11

Negative water quality impacts were evaluated by examining the potential increase of contamination
including chemicals, heavy metals, nutrients, and/or sediments in the surface water and groundwater as a
result of construction and operation under the Proposed Action. Beneficial water quality impacts were
evaluated by examining reduction in pollutant concentrations as a result of project components. The
analysis was performed by comparing existing water quality data with possible changes in water quality
due to the Proposed Action. Generally, negative impacts to water quality can be avoided or minimized
through compliance with regulations under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

4.4.2.1

Surface Water Resources

14

22

Surface water features (i.e., river, streams, lakes, ponds, impoundments, and wetlands) in the Study Area
have already been substantially modified from their natural conditions. These modifications have reduced
the health of the streams and wetlands within the Floodway, by changing their location, vegetation,
hydrology, and surface connections, effectively lowering the functional value of the system as a whole
from pre-development conditions. The system would continue to function in this reduced state under
Future Without-Project Condition as reasonably foreseeable future projects are implemented. Within the
Study Area, most of these modifications would be subject to USACE regulatory permitting authority.
Climate change is expected to also effect surface water patterns; impacts of climate change on the
regional water resources is discussed in Chapter 6.

23

4.4.2.2

24
25

Groundwater is not extensively pumped in the ROI; under the Future Without-Project Condition, this
situation would not change. There would be no anticipated change to ground water quality.

26

4.4.2.3

27

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, increased urbanization in the Upper Trinity River watershed
and the potential for release of pollutants into stormwater runoff would increase. However, federal and
state agencies (e.g., U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] and TCEQ) would continue to
address the effects of these pollutants on water quality and designated beneficial uses. Therefore,
conditions affecting beneficial uses that are currently listed as not impaired (i.e., aquatic life use and
public water supply use) or listed as “concern” (i.e., general use), are expected to remain the same or
gradually improve over time. With the implementation of scheduled total maximum daily load
evaluations for bacteria and pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by the TCEQ, impairments to
beneficial uses in the Trinity River (i.e., fish consumption use and contact recreation) would likely be
reduced or eliminated over time. In addition, projects such as the City of Dallas Pavaho Wetlands could
potentially help improve water quality of surface waters within the Study Area. However, PCBs and
dioxins degrade slowly in the environment (Texas Department of State Health Services 2010), and
therefore the effects to the fish consumption beneficial use may be long-term.

Under Alternative 2, construction activities within the Floodway would comply with the Construction
General Permit (TXR150000) as described in Section 4.2.3. Under Alternative 2, site-specific BMPs,
special conservation, and mitigation measures would be applied to minimize potential impacts.

Excavation of material from the borrow pits would result in direct impacts (excavation) to 0.81 acres of
jurisdictional emergent palustrine wetlands. Levee flattening would result in direct impacts (fill) to 0.13
acre of jurisdictional emergent palustrine wetlands and 0.70 acre other waters of the U.S. in the Floodway
along the river-side base of the levees. There would also be direct impacts (fill) to 0.03 acre and 0.05 acre
of non-jurisdictional wetlands and other waters, respectively. However, the net gains of acreage and/or
functions of aquatic resources under the BVP Study features are intended to be sufficient to offset
temporal losses, such that no compensatory mitigation would be required for direct impacts to
jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. under Alternative 2. The negative impact associated
with construction would become a beneficial operational impact to jurisdictional wetlands and waters of
the U.S. Jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S. adjacent to the AT&SF Railroad Bridge
embankment removal areas would be flagged so workers would recognize and avoid them.

20

Groundwater Resources

21

27

Excavation would have the potential to intercept shallow groundwater found in shallow floodplain
terraces and deposits that are in hydraulic connection with the Trinity River. However, compliance with
the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of a SWPPP and associated BMPs
would protect groundwater resources during construction. The impacts to this shallow groundwater would
be localized and temporary and groundwater would return to pre-construction levels following
construction. Construction would have no impact on deeper groundwater aquifers such as the Trinity
Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer.

28

Water Quality

29

Construction activities may result in the generation of pollutants including sediment and other
construction-related constituents (e.g., nutrients, trace metals, oil and grease, miscellaneous waste, and
other toxic chemicals). Without controls, the pollutants could potentially enter receiving waters. Through
compliance with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of a project-specific
SWPPP and associated BMPs, the project would minimize potential impacts to surface water quality.

Existing emergent palustrine wetlands and waters would be modified and/or filled, and new wetlands and

subject to protection under Sections 401 and 404 of the CWA. Although a USACE Section 404 permit
would not be issued for the project (USACE cannot permit its own actions), the project has been reviewed
by the USACE (Fort Worth District Regulatory Branch) and the Least Environmentally Damaging
Practicable Alternative (i.e., Alternative 2) has been identified as consistent with Section 404(b)(1) of the
CWA. The USACE has prepared a Draft 404(b)(1) Analysis (refer to Appendix L), which identifies
Alternative 2 as the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative.

The BVP Study Ecosystem features would compensate direct impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and
waters of the U.S. through the creation of new wetlands and other water features, respectively, within the
Floodway. Figure 4.4-1 shows the proposed jurisdictional surface water features within the Floodway
with implementation of Alternative 2 (refer to Figure 3.4-2 for existing surface water features). The
modification of the river channel from the existing straightened stream to a more natural meandering
stream would require excavation of a new channel and eventual diversion of the water from the old
channel into the new channel. A portion of West Dallas Lake would already be excavated as a result of
the proposed borrow pit located south of existing Trinity River channel.
As shown in Table 4.4-1, the Alternative 2 would directly impact 38,232 linear feet/134.2 acres of the
existing Trinity River channel, 22.83 acres of other WOUS, and 166.37 acres of jurisdictional wetlands.
These impacts would be compensated increased river channel sinuosity providing 39,967 linear feet/209.7
acres of new channel; creation of new lakes and other open waters for an additional 262.81 acres; and the
enhancement/restoration of wetlands in the Floodway for an additional 178.53 acres. This would result in
an overall net gain of 1,735 linear feet/75.5 acres for the Trinity River, 239.98 acres of other waters, and
12.16 acres of wetlands.
Texas Rapid Assessment Method (TXRAM) scores were used to perform a functional analysis of impacts
to the Trinity River and wetlands as part of the Draft Section 404(b)(1) Analysis (refer to Appendix L).
The TXRAM functional analysis estimated that the design of the relocated river channel and the
enhanced/restored wetlands would result in an overall increase of riverine/wetland function. Based on the
TXRAM functional analysis, there would be a predicted net functional gain of 6,938 linear feet for the
Trinity River and 50.35 acres for wetlands, indicating an increase in both area and quality of riverine and
wetland habitats (Note: a TXRAM functional analysis equivalent to that of the Trinity River or wetlands
was not performed for the other WOUS because TXRAM only applies to streams and wetlands, but not
other aquatic features).
The net gains of acreage and/or functions of aquatic resources under the BVP Study features would offset
temporal losses, such that no compensatory mitigation would be required for direct impacts to
jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. under Alternative 2. The negative impact associated
with construction would become a beneficial operational impact to jurisdictional wetlands and waters of
the U.S. As noted in Section 4.5, Biological Resources, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in a
higher overall habitat value for emergent wetlands, as compared to the Future Without-Project Condition.

Groundwater Resources

Excavation associated with construction would have the potential to intercept shallow groundwater found
in shallow floodplain terraces and deposits that are in hydraulic connection with the Trinity River.
However, compliance with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of a
SWPPP and associated BMPs would protect groundwater resources during construction. The impacts to
this shallow groundwater would be localized and temporary and groundwater would return to preconstruction levels following construction. Construction would have no impact on deeper groundwater
aquifers such as the Trinity Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer.

The use of BMPs such as silt fencing and sediment traps, the application of water sprays, and the prompt
revegetation of disturbed areas would reduce potential impacts. Implementation of sediment and erosion
controls during construction activities would maintain runoff water quality at levels comparable to
existing conditions. Through compliance with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and
implementation of a project-specific SWPPP and associated BMPs, the project would minimize impacts
to surface water quality.
Operation

Lakes

17

Surface Water Resources: Natural Lake, Urban Lake, and West Dallas Lake would account for a total of
256 acres of open water within the Floodway, and the lakes would be surrounded by a total of 15.62 acres
of fringe wetlands. The source of water for both the Natural Lake and Urban Lake would be the treated
effluent pumped from the Dallas Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP), with approximately 60
million gallons per day (MGD) passing through the two lakes (City of Dallas 2009a). The treated effluent
discharged into the Natural Lake and Urban Lake is permitted flow that DWU is required to return to the
Trinity River and any water lost to seepage or evaporation would count against the amount of flow that
DWU could sell or use for other purposes. Therefore, the lakes would be lined with clay to prevent
seepage and satisfy water management requirements at each of the lakes (City of Dallas 2009b).

The source of water for West Dallas Lake would be fed by groundwater and rainwater and supplemented
by water drawn from the river so that the lake would have a constant level, sustaining recreation
throughout the seasons. Because the water surface elevation of West Dallas Lake would be higher than
the adjacent Trinity River, the lake would be designed to include appropriate lining and anti-seepage
protection to prevent the formation of sinkholes or slope failures in the strip of land separating the lake
from the river (City of Dallas 2009a).
Groundwater Resources: The proposed clay linings for the Natural, Urban, and West Dallas lakes would
also prevent seepage to groundwater.
Water Quality: The Natural Lake, Urban Lake, and West Dallas Lake would be designed and operated to
meet all applicable state water quality standards and additional water quality criteria, as needed, to meet
the proposed uses of the lakes (City of Dallas 2009a). The Dallas CWWTP effluent entering Natural Lake
and Urban Lake would be treated and disinfected in compliance with state and federal regulations and
would be suitable for primary contact recreation purposes. The planted riparian edges, floating wetlands,
solar-powered aerators and aeration water walls would be used to further improve and maintain the water
quality within the lakes. The floating wetland plant communities selected for use would promote aquatic
life and maximize nutrient absorption, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. The Urban Lake would be

prone to algal blooms due to its more remote location from the incoming treated water source. In addition
to the floating wetlands and aerators, water treated chemically within the park would be the method of last
resort (City of Dallas 2009a).
Within West Dallas Lake, proposed rowing lanes would be defined by 20-foot-wide intermittent bands of
floating wetlands that would also provide a nutrient-absorbing function. Other water quality improvement
methods within the lake would consist of edge marshlands; “solar bees,” which are floating and
photovoltaic-powered aeration devices; and chemical applications. Chemical applications would be
selected and implemented so as not to be a detriment to the health and vitality of edge marshlands and
floating wetlands (City of Dallas 2009a).

14

Following flood events, Natural Lake and Urban Lake may be opened as necessary to drain the lakes and
minimize the deposition of sediment within the lakes. Prior to reopening the lakes for primary contact
activities such as boating, water quality monitoring would occur as outlined in the Urban Lake and
Natural Lake management plans to ensure that bacteria levels are within water quality standards (City of
Dallas 2009a).

15

River Modification

16

Surface Water Resources: The river channel would be modified to a more natural pattern, resulting in a
beneficial impact to the Trinity River. The proposed modifications would maintain the Trinity River’s
classification as navigable under the Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act.

10

Groundwater Resources: The river modification would maintain the average slope and surface flow rates
through the length of the Floodway. This would maintain similar surface water elevations as the existing
river channel, resulting in minimal, if any changes in migration of groundwater in the shallow aquifer.
The river modification would have no impact on deeper groundwater aquifers such as the Trinity Group
Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer.

33

Water Quality: The relocated river channel would have a stable channel pattern with areas subject to
erosion being armored or strengthened, using bioengineering approaches that incorporate native
vegetation and other natural materials (City of Dallas 2009c). This would result in minimal bank erosion
and would not substantially contribute to suspended sediment concentrations. The proposed ecosystem
restoration associated with the river modification (and other BVP Study features) would diminish the
negative water quality impact of stormwater flows through reestablishment of native riparian vegetation
along banks and river terraces. Plantings in the riparian zone would act as effective vegetative filters,
reducing amounts of nutrients, sediment, and other contaminants that would otherwise flow directly into
the river and downstream, resulting in the improved water quality over existing conditions and a longterm beneficial impact to water quality.

34

Wetlands

35

Surface Water Resources: The BVP Study wetland environments would include newly constructed
stormwater management wetlands, forested wetlands, and marshland wetlands. These environments
would also include the enhancement of existing emergent wetlands already occurring in the floodplain
today, resulting in beneficial impacts to surface water resources.

Groundwater Resources: The wetland features would collect stormwater runoff from BVP Study features
that would otherwise contribute to recharging the shallow aquifer. However, a portion of water stored in
the wetland features recharge the shallow aquifer and overall shallow groundwater levels would be
maintained within the Floodway. The wetland features would have no impact on deeper groundwater
aquifers such as the Trinity Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer.

7

Water Quality: The wetland features would play a role in improving overall long-term water quality by
removing nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, and other pollutants from urban runoff.

8

Athletic Facilities and General Features

9

Surface Water Resources: The locations and types of athletic facilities and the general features have been
designed to integrate with the BVP Study water features (i.e., lakes, river, and wetlands) and would have
no impact on surface water or wetlands.

6

10
11
12
13
14

Groundwater Resources: As discussed under Wetlands, runoff from BVP Study features, including
athletic facilities and general elements, would be collected in wetlands and would have minimal effect on
the shallow groundwater and no impact on deeper groundwater aquifers.

18

Water Quality: The turf and paved areas associated with the athletic facilities and general elements would
be graded to drain into bioswales and wetlands that can receive and filter contaminants, and ultimately
drain their stormwater. The proposed boating activities would not degrade water quality below existing
conditions or affect designated uses.

19

Interior Drainage Outfall Modifications

20

Surface Water Resources: The interior drainage outfall modifications would continue to function as they
do currently, with no change to surface water resources.

Groundwater Resources: The interior drainage outfall modifications would maintain the similar surface
water elevations as the existing outfalls, resulting in minimal, if any changes in migration of groundwater
in the shallow aquifer. The interior drainage outfall modifications would have no impact on deeper
groundwater aquifers such as the Trinity Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer.

30

Water Quality: Stormwater runoff entering the Floodway from the interior drainage outfall modifications
would continue to be covered under the City of Dallas Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) (City of
Dallas 2012). The SWMP is intended to ensure compliance with Section 402 of the CWA, Chapter 26 of
the Texas Water Code, applicable USEPA and TCEQ regulations, and the requirements of the Phase I
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit (TCEQ 2013).

The following sections provide a general overview of impacts to water quality associated at each location.
Direct impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S. are presented on a site-by-site basis. No
impacts to jurisdictional wetlands are anticipated from reducing the extent of the 100-year floodplain as a
result of IDP improvements.

would have no impact on deeper groundwater aquifers. The construction contractor would prepare and
implement a project-specific SWPPP for construction associated IDP improvements in compliance with
the Construction General Permit (TXR150000). The SWPPP would implement all applicable BMPs in

accordance with the permit from initiation through completion of construction activities. Therefore, the
project would minimize potential impacts to water quality.
The pump stations would continue to convey stormwater runoff to the Trinity River and would not
contribute to long-term effects on surface water or groundwater resources. Stormwater runoff would
continue to be covered under the City of Dallas SWMP (City of Dallas 2012). The SWMP is intended to
ensure compliance with Section 402 of the CWA, Chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code, applicable

Construction of the New Hampton Pump Station would result in direct impacts to 0.11 acre and 0.06 acre
of jurisdictional emergent palustrine wetlands and other waters of the U.S., respectively, and 0.14 acre of
non-jurisdictional other waters (Figure 4.4-2).
Construction associated with the Nobles Branch Sump improvements would result in direct impacts to
0.17 acre of potentially jurisdictional waters of the U.S. (Note: a jurisdictional determination has not been
prepared for this site, but these waters are assumed to be jurisdictional as they are within the historic
creek channel) (Figure 4.4-2).
Charlie Pump Station and Sump Improvements

the footprint of the Delta Pumping Plant are already accounted for under the construction of the FRM
Elements.

Through compliance with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of projectspecific SWPPP and associated BMPs, Alternative 2 would minimize potential impacts to surface water
quality. Negative impacts (excavation and fill) to jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S. from
construction would be offset by proposed BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, which would
create or enhance jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. for a net gain of 1,735 linear
feet/75.5 acres for the Trinity River, 239.98 acres of other waters, and 12.16 acres of wetlands. Based on
the TXRAM functional analysis, there would be a predicted net functional gain of 6,938 linear feet for the
Trinity River and 50.35 acres for wetlands, indicating an increase in both area and quality of riverine and
wetland habitats. Construction would have no impact on deeper groundwater aquifers such as the Trinity
Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer. The Natural Lake, Urban Lake, and West Dallas Lake would
be designed and operated to meet all applicable state water quality standards and additional water quality
criteria, as needed, to meet the proposed uses of the lakes. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2
would result in significant adverse impacts to water resources during construction, and beneficial impacts
to water resources during operation. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization,
avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

The potential Trinity Parkway project would directly impact 65.5 acres (fill of 28.5 acres/excavation of
37.0 acres) of jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. (FHWA 2014). These direct impacts to
jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. would require a Section 404 permit, which would
include any mitigation requirements. Direct impacts to navigable waters would also be subject to and
comply with Section 10 requirements. All mitigation for impacts to jurisdictional features would occur
outside of the Dallas Floodway.
Alternative 2 and some of the other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would also directly
impact jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. However, the net gains of acreage and
functions of aquatic resources under the BVP Study features would offset temporal losses, such that no
compensatory mitigation would be required for direct impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and other waters
of the U.S. under Alternative 2. Overall, the construction-related negative impacts to wetlands and other
waters of the U.S. under Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would
become an operational beneficial impact to jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S.

The potential Trinity Parkway project has the potential to impact shallow groundwater resources during
construction and operation. However, groundwater resources would be protected through compliance
with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of a SWPPP and associated
BMPs during construction and through compliance with the MS4 permit during operation.
Construction associated with Alternative 2 and the other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
would potentially have localized and temporary impacts on shallow groundwater and no impacts on
deeper groundwater aquifers such as the Trinity Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer. Compliance
with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of a SWPPP and associated
BMPs would protect groundwater resources during construction. Shallow groundwater would return to
pre-construction levels following construction and there would be less than significant impacts to
groundwater due to construction. Operations under Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably

The potential Trinity Parkway project has the potential to impact surface water quality during
construction and operation. To minimize adverse effects to water quality during construction, the Trinity
Parkway would utilize temporary erosion and sedimentation control practices from the Texas Department
of Transportation’s (TxDOT) standard specifications for highway construction. Highway runoff
abatement measures would be incorporated into construction planning for the project in accordance with
Construction General Permit (TXR150000) requirements, which require the implementation of a SWPPP
and the use of stormwater BMPs that would control negative impacts on water quality from the project.
During operation, the Trinity Parkway project would comply with applicable MS4 requirements.
Construction associated with Alternative 2 and the other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
may result in the generation of pollutants including sediment and other construction-related constituents
(such as nutrients, trace metals, oil and grease, miscellaneous waste, and other toxic chemicals). However,
Alternative 2 and any of the other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects that disturb equal to
or greater than 1 acre would comply with the Construction General Permit (TXR150000) as described in
Section 4.2.3. Through compliance with the Construction General Permit and implementation of a
project-specific SWPPP and associated BMPs, the potential impacts to surface water quality would be
minimized and less than significant under construction associated with Alternative 2 and the past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable projects.

34

Operations under Alternative 2 and the Pavaho Wetlands would play a role in improving overall longterm water quality by removing nutrients, sediment, and other pollutants from urban runoff and river
flows. The pump stations associated with the IDP improvements and past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects (i.e., Able and Baker pumping plants) would continue to convey stormwater runoff to
the Trinity River and would be covered under the City of Dallas SWMP (City of Dallas 2012). Other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would contribute additional pollutants to urban runoff; these
would be relatively minimal and also be covered under the City of Dallas SWMP. The SWMP is intended
to ensure compliance with Section 402 of the CWA, Chapter 26 of the Texas Water Code, applicable
USEPA and TCEQ regulations, and the requirements of the Phase I MS4 permit. Increased pollutant
removal by wetlands and continued coverage under the City of Dallas SWMP would provide a long-term
beneficial impact to water quality in the Trinity River. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in
combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in
significant adverse impacts to water resources during construction, and beneficial impacts to water
resources during operation.

36

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to water resources from implementation of the proposed FRM
elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there would be
no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections 4.4.3.1
and 4.4.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to water resources associated with implementation of the FRM
elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.4.4.1 presents the potential
impacts to water resources from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under Alternative 2.

Construction impacts under Alternative 3 would be essentially the same as those described under
Alternative 2, with slight changes to impacted acreage of jurisdictional surface water features. Table 4.4-2
provides a comparison of the acreage of jurisdictional surface water features between the impacted
existing waters of the U.S. and the waters of the U.S. created or enhanced under Alternative 3. As shown
in Table 4.4-2, Alternative 3 would result in an overall net gain of 1,735 linear feet/75.5 acres for the
Trinity River and 235.23 acres of other waters and a net loss of 32.04 acres of wetlands. Based on the
TXRAM functional analysis, there would be a predicted net functional gain of 6,938 linear feet for the
Trinity River and 3.09 acres for wetlands, indicating an increase in area and quality of riverine and
wetland habitats. However, there would be greater detrimental impacts to jurisdictional surface water
features and less overall net gain in function under Alternative 3, as compared to Alternative 2.

Negative impacts (excavation and fill) to jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S. from construction
would be offset by proposed BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, which would create or
enhance jurisdictional wetlands and other waters of the U.S. for a net gain of 1,735 linear feet/75.5 acres
for the Trinity River and 235.23 acres of other waters and a net loss of 32.04 acres of wetlands. Based on
the TXRAM functional analysis, there would be a predicted net functional gain of 6,938 linear feet for the
Trinity River and 3.09 acres for wetlands, indicating an increase in area and quality of riverine and
wetland habitats. However, there would be greater detrimental impacts to jurisdictional surface water
features and less overall net gain in function under Alternative 3, as compared to Alternative 2. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse impacts to water resources during
construction, and beneficial impacts to water resources during operation. This conclusion assumes the
incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

15

4.4.4.3

16

Cumulative impacts under Alternative 3 would be the same as described under Alternative 2, except
potential impacts associated with Alternative 3 would be relatively reduced without the Trinity Parkway
included as a reasonably foreseeable project. Negative construction-related impacts to wetlands and other
waters of the U.S. under Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would
become a beneficial operational impacts to jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the U.S. Construction
and operation under Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result
in less than significant impacts to shallow groundwater and no impact on deeper groundwater aquifers
such as the Trinity Group Aquifer and the Woodbine Aquifer. Through compliance with the Construction
General Permit (TXR150000) and implementation of a project-specific SWPPP and associated BMPs, the
potential impacts to surface water quality would be minimized and less than significant during
construction associated with Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects.
Increased pollutant removal by wetlands and continued coverage under the City of Dallas SWMP would
provide a long-term beneficial impact to water quality in the Trinity River. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 3 in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would
result in significant adverse impacts to water resources during construction, and beneficial impacts to

4.5.1

33

The impacts of the alternatives have been assessed primarily through the application of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS) Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) in the Planning Aid Report (USFWS
2014) to the ROI to (a) quantitatively characterize existing fish and wildlife resources in the ROI in terms
of acreage and habitat values; and (b) to estimate the area and condition of those resources over time in
the future in order to compare quantitatively the net gains and losses of habitat that would occur under the
different alternatives.

Approach to Analysis

The HEP evaluates changes in habitat acreages and values (HSIs) over a 50-year period that begins at the
conclusion of contruction (Year “0”). Details of the HEP analysis are provided in the PAR (USFWS

Chapter 4 Environmental Consequences, Biological Resources

4-52

Dallas Floodway Project

Public Draft EIS

April 2014

2014). In addition to the broad, quantitative aspects of the HEP, the analysis also considers potential
impacts on special status species or potential impacts that may result from invasive species. The USFWS
has prepared a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act Report (CAR) (Appendix M).

16

Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the significance of project impacts is a function of
context and intensity. For biological resources, context refers to the importance (ecological, commercial,
scientific, recreational, etc.) or regulatory (i.e., legally protected) status of the resource, and intensity
refers to the magnitude – scale and duration – of the impact. Both beneficial and adverse impacts are
recognized; either can be significant. In the ROI, the habitats of greatest importance are aquatic riverine,
emergent wetlands, and bottomland hardwoods. Substantial long-term net changes in the acreage and/or
value of these habitats would represent significant adverse impacts; impacts to open water and grassland
habitats are of lesser concern and unlikely to be significant, especially if areas of these habitats are
converted to more valuable habitat. Losses or gains of population and habitat for special status species
may also be significant, depending on the magnitude of the impact relative to the population size and
distribution of the species in the region. Finally, an impact that led to new introductions or the expansion
of invasive species in the ROI would also be considered significant in terms of potential far-reaching
effects on the ecosystem as a whole.

4.5.2

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

18

4.5.2.1

Habitat Types and Values

19

Through the USFWS HEP process, habitat quality or habitat units (HUs) were determined. HUs are
determined by multiplying HSIs by the habitat acreages, which give a habitat value. The implementation
of Alternative 1, 19 Future Without-Project Condition projects, would negatively impact emergent
wetlands, grasslands, aquatic riverine, and open water (Tables 4.5-1 and Table 4.5-2) (Figure 4.5-1).
Bottomland hardwood acreages and values would increase under Alternative 1 due to the increased value
in the Confluence over 50 years.

The distribution of fish and wildlife under the Future Without-Project Condition would be similar to the
distribution of fish and wildlife under existing conditions. Common fish, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, and
shorebirds would continue to utilize the aquatic riverine, emergent wetland, and open water habitats.
Common birds and mammals would continue to utilize the terrestrial habitat.

If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season (February 15 through August

Special Status Species

Based on surveys, mussel beds and state-listed mussels are known to occur in the Trinity River, in the
Horseshoe Project area, and upstream of the Elm Fork. The City of Dallas would coordinate with the
TPWD and TCEQ to create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and Monitoring Plan or similar
method to minimize impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic resources (TPWD 2013).

17

Some species of Birds of Conservation Concern (BCC) birds listed in Section 3.5 are likely to occur in
the ROI. Impacts to special status species, including mussels and birds, during the construction and
operation of the Future Without-Project Condition would be minimized through the implementation of
BMPs and SCMs as determined applicable for each specific project.

The levee raise, AT&SF Railroad Bridge Modifications, and levee flattening would temporarily impact
habitat in the Mainstem (Dallas Floodway) and the Confluence (Elm and West Forks) groups but would
result in overall minimal changes in habitat acreage. Table 4.5-3 presents the approximate existing habitat
area, area of impacts, and change to each existing habitat type within the Mainstem and Confluence
Groups associated with the levee modifications. The levee raise would permanently impact a swath on
average 210 feet wide (excluding the 50-foot wide temporary construction buffer areas on each side) for
approximately 11,100 linear feet of the East Levee and 9,400 linear feet of the West Levee.

Temporary and permanent impacts to wetland, grasslands and aquatic riverine habitats would occur from
the implementation of the levee raise. The majority of the habitat temporarily impacted would be low
quality mowed grassland. The grassland habitat would return after the completion of the levee raise
modifications. Less than one acre of emergent wetlands would be eliminated and replaced with grassland.
BMPs and SCMs would be implemented to minimize impacts to wetlands to the greatest extent possible.
The material for the levee raise would come from two borrow pits located in the Mainstem (refer to
Figure 2-1). The borrow areas would also serve as the preliminary excavation associated with the West
Dallas Lake, and thus impacts specific to the borrow areas are not discussed here.
No change to grassland habitat values from the implementation of the FRM elements would occur. Low
quality mowed grasslands would be temporarily impacted during construction and the area would return
to low quality mowed grassland habitat after the improvements are finished. There would be a temporary
decrease to emergent wetland habitat values during construction but this impact would be offset by the
proposed Corinth Wetlands in the Mainstem Group.

Impacts to habitats during the operation of the FRM elements would be similar to current impacts. The
grasslands along the levees would still be mowed and maintained and access roads would be utilized for
maintenance.

Construction

6

19

During the construction of the levee raise, AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications, and levee flattening,
terrestrial wildlife would temporarily be affected in the Mainstem and Confluence groups. Minimal
impacts to the fragmented bottomland hardwood and low quality wetlands would occur with the
implementation of the FRM elements. Most of the species utilizing the mowed grasslands are common,
opportunistic species. Most, if not all species would recolonize the area after construction. Minimal
impacts to fish and other aquatic species are expected, as most FRM construction would avoid aquatic
habitats. Furthermore, identified BMPs and SCMs would minimize potential construction-related indirect
impacts to aquatic areas. Impacts to nesting bird species would be minimized to the greatest extent
possible. If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season (February 15 through
August 31), construction activities would comply with the MBTA to avoid impacts to nesting migratory
birds within the ROI. Specifically, a biologist would check the proposed construction sites, including
laydown areas, for nests (in trees, shrubs, and on the ground) before construction begins. If the biologist
finds an active nest, construction workers would not directly or indirectly disturb the nest or adjacent
areas until the biologist determines the nest is no longer active.

20

Operation

21

The impacts to fish and wildlife under Alternative 2 from continued mowing of low quality grasslands
would be similar to the impacts from the current mowing regime. Common birds, amphibians, reptiles,
and mammals adapted to human disturbance would continue to use the terrestrial habitat. The proposed
Corinth Wetlands would be used as a potential wetland mitigation site for wetland impacts, and
maintained as such.

occurs in the ROI. If these species occur in the area during construction, they could fly to other areas of
the Floodway or the Confluence. If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding
season (February 15 through August 31), construction activities would comply with the MBTA to avoid
affects to nesting migratory and/or special status birds within the ROI. Any impacts to special status
species during the construction and operation of the FRM elements would be minimized through the
implementation of SCMs.

Under Alternative 2, implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features in the
Mainstem Group would result in temporary negative impacts to biological resources during construction.
However, following construction, beneficial impacts to habitat are expected. Most sensitive aquatic
habitat types (aquatic riverine, bottomland hardwood, and open water) would increase in area and value
under the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features. For a specific description
of proposed BVP habitats and plant species, please refer to Appendix H, Planting Tables and Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department Aquatic Resource Relocation Plan Guidance. A Monitoring and Adaptive
Management Plan for the BVP Study Ecosystem features is included in Appendix H.

Construction

11

17

The BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would be implemented in the Mainstem Group
(Dallas Floodway) (refer to Figures 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). The habitat in the Mainstem Group has existed in its
current state for the last 50 years. Under Alternative 2, most of the habitat in the Mainstem Group would
be temporarily impacted during the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features.
However, small, low quality emergent wetlands within the project area are anticipated to be developed or
converted into other habitat types (open water, aquatic riverine, meadow) during the implementation of
BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features.

18

Operation

19

After an approximately 15-year construction period (2015-2030), most of the native habitat would be
restored to a higher habitat value than its current state. Table 4.5-4 presents the estimated habitat acreages
and habitat values from the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features in the
Mainstem Group over a 50-year period beginning with the completion of construction.

wetland, grassland, aquatic riverine, and open water habitat, refer to the 2014 PAR (USFWS 2014). With
the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, most of the habitat in the
Mainstem Group would be temporarily disturbed. Following the implementation of the BVP Study
Ecosystem and Recreation features (Years 0, 1, and 5), the bottomland hardwood, emergent wetland, and
urban forest HSIs would be low because the habitats would have just been created, and would take time to
become established.

Bottomland Hardwoods

2

7

Bottomland hardwoods would primarily be planted at the southeastern portion of the Mainstem Group.
The bottomland hardwood HSIs would be expected to increase over time as the trees mature, and the
emergent wetland HSIs would be expected to increase over time as wetland vegetation, habitat structure,
and food resources for wildlife become more established. In addition, over the 50-year period bottomland
hardwoods are expected to increase in acreage and value from the conversion of aquatic riverine to
bottomland hardwood because of climate change creating warmer, drier conditions (USFWS 2014).

8

Emergent Wetlands

9
11

Under the implementation of BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, emergent wetland acreages
would decrease but wetland quality would increase (refer to Table 4.5-4). The Corinth Wetlands would be
a mitigation site for other wetland impacts due to implementation of the Proposed Action.

12

Grasslands

13

The Mainstem Group grasslands would consist of native meadow, turf, and urban forest. The meadows
would be planted with a diverse range of native grasses and forbs, consistent with the numbers and
species found in the north Texas Blackland Prairie Ecoregion (refer to the species list in Appendix H).
Therefore, the resulting planted meadows would be a higher quality habitat than the existing non-native
grasslands and would be expected to increase in value over the 50-year period from increased native
species diversity. Meadows would be mowed annually in the late winter/early spring. This would allow
the meadows to grow and thrive, and prevent shrubs and woodland species from establishing in the
meadow areas (USACE 2013a, 2013b).

Public Draft EIS

April 2014

Urban forests are included under grasslands because they would have a habitat value closer to a grassland
than a native forest. The urban forest would be expected to take 10 to 25 years to mature; therefore, HSIs
would be expected to increase from years 5 to 25. Urban forest is considered a subset of grassland
because the majority of the proposed trees would be non-native ornamental trees and do not provide the
same habitat value as a native forest (USFWS 2014).

7

Grassland habitat would be expected to increase over the 50-year period from the conversion of emergent
wetlands to grasslands because of climate change creating warmer, drier conditions (USFWS 2014).

8

Aquatic Riverine

9

Aquatic riverine habitat would increase with the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features (refer to Table 4.5-4). The greatest increase to aquatic riverine under the
implementation of Alternative 2 would be due to the relocation of the Trinity River. The edge of the
relocated Trinity River would be terraced and planted to create riparian and wetland habitat. The
relocation of the Trinity River would result in adverse impacts on the aquatic riverine habitat during
construction; however, impacts would be beneficial once the new alignment is complete. The edge of the
aquatic riverine habitat would be expected to decrease over the 50-year period from the conversion of
aquatic riverine to bottomland hardwood because of climate change creating warmer, drier conditions
(USFWS 2014).

6

10

12

20

Aquatic riverine HSIs are not expected to increase much over time because they would contain water and
are expected to be functioning aquatic ecosystems once the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation
features are completed. At year 50, the aquatic riverine HSI would increase (USFWS 2014).

21

Open Water

22

29

With the creation of the lakes, the acreage of open water habitat would increase dramatically (refer to
Table 4.5-4). Open water habitat in the BVP lakes would have an HSI of zero at years 0 and 1 due to the
limited fish abundance and diversity. Open water would take approximately 5 years to establish fish
diversity and abundance. The fish diversity and abundance would be expected to increase in the lakes
after flood events result in the dispersal of fish into the new habitats. The open water HSI was determined
by referring to the 2010 fisheries sampling in Crow Lake, Bart Simpson Lake, and Cell D of the Dallas
Floodway Extension (City of Dallas 2010; USACE 2010; USFWS 2014). Overall, habitat values would
increase from the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features.

30

Urban Area

With the installation of roads, parking lots, and park facilities, urban areas would increase in acreage
(USFWS 2014).

The implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would temporarily affect fish

experience mortality during construction. Most mammals and birds would be displaced but would likely
colonize adjacent habitat.

TPWD and TCEQ to create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and Monitoring Plan or similar
method to minimize impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic resources (TPWD 2013).
Impacts to nesting bird species would be minimized to the greatest extent possible and would comply
with the MBTA. If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season (February 15
through August 31), a biologist would check the proposed construction sites, including laydown areas, for
active nests (in trees, shrubs, and on the ground) of MBTA-protected species before the construction
phase begins. If the biologist finds an active nest, the area surrounding the nest would be marked with
flagging and marked on maps; and construction workers would avoid that area until the biologist
determines the nest is no longer active.

10

Operation

11

Once the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features are established, the lakes (open water), aquatic
riverine, and emergent wetlands are expected to provide high quality habitat for fish, mussels,
amphibians, and other aquatic species, and foraging habitat for birds, reptiles, and mammals.

Special Status Species
14

Construction

15

If a federally listed bird species is observed in the Mainstem during the breeding season, the USFWS
would be notified to discuss alternative development plans or the need for consultation under Section 7 of
the ESA. If a state-listed species is encountered in the project area of project elements sponsored by the
City of Dallas, TPWD would be notified to discuss ways to minimize any potential impact. State-listed
mussel species such as the Texas pigtoe occur in the Horseshoe Project area and in the Elm Fork and are
likely to occur in other areas of the Biological Resources ROI. The City of Dallas would coordinate with
the TPWD and TCEQ to create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and Monitoring Plan or
similar method to minimize impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic resources (TPWD 2013).

Some of the BCC bird species listed in Section 3.5 are likely to occur in the ROI. The loggerhead shrike

to the greatest extent possible. If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season
(February 15 through August 31), construction activities would comply with the MBTA to avoid impacts
to nesting migratory birds within the Mainstem. Specifically, a biologist would check the proposed
construction sites, including laydown areas, for nests (in trees, shrubs, and on the ground) once before the
construction phase begins. If the biologist finds an active nest, construction workers would not directly or
indirectly disturb the nest or adjacent areas until the biologist determines the nest is no longer active.
Impacts to special status species, including mussels and birds, would be minimized through the
implementation of SCMs.

33

Operation

34

Increased habitat acreages and value in the Mainstem Group could provide habitat for special status
species. The ecosystem restoration features will be monitored after construction to ensure that they meet

owner should thoroughly clean, drain, and dry his boat after each and every put-in. Possession and
transport of zebra mussels—even if accidental—is a criminal offence punishable by fine and/or jail time
(TPWD 2013).
Non-native invasive plants pose a threat to native habitats. Monitoring for invasive species and the
application of appropriate control measures would minimize the risk from invasive species. Monitoring
and reporting guidelines are described in the SCMs. SCMs would be implemented to minimize the spread
of invasive species during construction and operation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation
features.

The majority of the bottomland hardwoods occur along the drainage channels. The quality (HSI) of the
bottomland hardwoods is expected to remain consistent over time. Bottomland hardwood areas within the
IDS are expected to decrease over time due to development. Bottomland hardwood habitats do not have
any special protection from development.
The emergent wetlands are part of the sump pump areas and would not be impacted. Little change to
emergent wetland quality (HSI) or acreage would occur over the 50-year period. The primary purpose of
the emergent wetland areas are flood control, not to provide habitat.
The majority of the grasslands occur along the drainage channels. The quality (HSI) of the grassland
habitat is expected to remain much the same over time due to edge effects and non-native species.
Grassland areas are expected to decrease over time because of development. Grassland habitats do not
have any special protection from development.
The IDS is smaller than the Trinity River, has less species diversity, and is not connected to the Trinity
River for species dispersal; therefore, the aquatic riverine HSI for the IDS Group would have a lower HSI
than the Trinity River. The HSI would remain at 0.70 from year 0 to 5 because of siltation, erosion, and
other temporary impacts from construction. At year 10, the HSI would return to 0.75 (pre-construction
conditions). By year 50, the HSI would increase to 0.80 (USFWS 2014).
Because the open water in the IDS Group is not connected to the Trinity River like the open water in the
Mainstem Group, the open water HSI in the IDS Group would be lower for the IDS Group than the
Mainstem Group. The water quality in the open water would not change in the next 50 years; therefore,
the HSI would remain the same for the next 50 years (USFWS 2014).
HUs for all habitats except aquatic riverine would decrease from the implementation of the IDP
improvements (Table 4.5-5).

Implementation of the IDP improvements would disturb or displace wildlife from the areas of

the smaller, less mobile and burrowing species, whereas mobile species would disperse to surrounding
areas. Individuals dispersing away from the activity would likely experience increased risks of predation,
reduced foraging or reproductive success, and energetic costs. The overall impact on wildlife populations
would be relatively small, proportional to the relatively small areas of habitat affected. In areas
temporarily impacted, wildlife species would recolonize available habitat area after construction. No

long-term impacts to wildlife populations are likely. Due to the low quality of the habitat surrounding the
majority of ROI and the small area of impact, the impacts to fish and wildlife, including migratory birds,
would be minor.

10

Impacts to nesting bird species would be minimized to the greatest extent possible. If proposed
construction activities occur during the avian breeding season (February 15 through August 31),
construction activities would comply with the MBTA to avoid impacts to nesting migratory birds within
the ROI. Specifically, a biologist would check the proposed construction sites, including laydown areas,
for nests (in trees, shrubs, and on the ground) once before the construction phase begins. If the biologist
finds an active nest, construction workers would not directly or indirectly disturb the nest or adjacent
areas until the biologist determines the nest is no longer active.

As presented in Table 4.5-7, overall HUs would increase under Alternative 2, resulting in beneficial
impacts to habitat value. The greatest increase would be to open water from the creation of the BVP
Study lakes, Urban, Natural, and West Dallas lakes. Bottomland hardwood habitat would also increase
with the highest quality habitat at the southeastern end of the Floodway. Aquatic Riverine habitat would
increase from relocating the river. The greatest decrease of acreage and HUs would be to grassland
habitat (USFWS 2014).

Under Alternative 2, impacts to biological resources would be minimized through the application of
SCMs and mitigation measures. However, given the magnitude of the proposed construction activities,
which would result in nearly complete disturbance of the Floodway, implementation of Alternative 2
would result in significant adverse impacts to biological resources within the ROI during construction;
however, post-construction, there would be an increase in key habitat acreage and value. No federally
listed species are known to reside or breed in the ROI; therefore, no impacts to federally listed species are
anticipated. If a federally listed bird species occurs in the ROI during the breeding season, the USFWS
would be notified to discuss additional minimization measures.
Impacts to state-listed species located within the Mainstem Group would be minimized through the
implementation of SCMs and mitigation measures. Identified SCMs would be applied to reduce the
potential for impacts to fish and wildlife, as well as reducing the risk for introducing invasive species in
the ROI.

Most, if not all species are expected to recolonize habitat after construction. For these reasons, there
would be beneficial long-term impacts to biological resources. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2
would result in significant adverse impacts to biological resources during construction, and beneficial
impacts to biological resources during operation. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of
minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

Temporary impacts to habitat from the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation
features are expected to be significant during construction. The majority of the Mainstem Group would be
temporarily impacted for up to approximately 15 years. Temporary impacts in the Mainstem Group from
the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects including the potential Trinity Parkway would be
primarily from road and bridge construction.
Permanent impacts to habitats would increase sensitive habitat (bottomland hardwood, emergent wetland,
and aquatic riverine) acreage and are expected to be beneficial. Bottomland hardwood acreage would
increase by 66 acres from the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features with hardwoods planted
along the Trinity River; the largest amount of hardwoods would be planted at the southeastern end of the
Floodway. Two acres of bottomland hardwood would be permanently impacted from the implementation
of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects; however, there would be a cumulative gain of 66
acres of bottomland hardwood.

Aquatic riverine acreage would increase from the relocation of the river under the BVP Study Ecosystem
and Recreation features. No impacts to aquatic riverine are anticipated from the implementation of the
Trinity Parkway. Open water habitat would increase from the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation
features creation of the Urban, Natural, and West Dallas lakes. No impacts to open water are expected to
occur from the implementation of the Trinity Parkway (refer to Table 4.5-8).
The greatest decrease of habitat would be to grassland habitat. While the overall acreage of habitat would
decrease from the implementation of Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects,
the amount of bottomland hardwood, open water, and aquatic riverine habitat would increase, resulting in a
long-term beneficial impact to habitat types. Emergent wetland and grassland would decrease in acreage.
Small, low quality emergent wetlands within the project area will be developed or converted into native
grassland (meadow) habitat during the implementation of Alternative 2. The remaining and created emergent
wetland habitat would have increased habitat value because of the wetland habitat improvements as part of
implementation of the Corinth Wetlands. In addition, as noted in Table 4.5-8 additional riparian and wetland
habitat would occur along the edges of the Trinity River. Grassland is a common habitat currently dominated
by non-native grasses.
As presented in Table 4.5-9, overall HUs would increase under Alternative 2 and all past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects, resulting in beneficial impacts to habitat value. The changes in HUs
result primarily from the implementation of Alternative 2, and secondarily from the implementation of the
potential Trinity Parkway project. The greatest increase would be to open water from the creation of the
BVP Study lakes. Bottomland hardwood habitat would also increase with the highest quality habitat at the
southeastern end of the Floodway. Aquatic riverine habitat would increase from the relocation of the
river. The greatest decrease of HUs would be to grassland habitat.

The ultimate distribution of fish and wildlife under Alternative 2 and the other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would be similar to the distribution of fish and wildlife under existing
conditions. Common fish, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, and shorebirds would continue to utilize the
aquatic riverine, emergent wetland, and open water habitats. Common birds and mammals would
continue to utilize the terrestrial habitat.
Under Alternative 2, impacts to fish and wildlife would be minimized through the application of SCMs
and mitigation measures (refer to Chapter 7). Impacts to nesting bird species would be minimized to the
greatest extent possible. If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season

(February 15 through August 31), construction activities would comply with the MBTA to avoid impacts
to nesting migratory birds. Specifically, a biologist would check the proposed construction sites,
including laydown areas, for nests (in trees, shrubs, and on the ground) once before the construction phase
has begun. If the biologist finds an active nest, construction workers would not directly or indirectly
disturb the nest or adjacent areas until the biologist determines the nest is no longer active.
However, given the magnitude of the proposed construction activities, which would result in nearly
complete disturbance of the Floodway, implementation of Alternative 3 would result in adverse impacts to
fish and wildlife during construction. Temporary impacts from the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects would be minimal compared to the Alternative 2, BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
temporary impacts.
Based on surveys, special aquatic resources including fishery habitat, mussel beds, and state-listed mussel
species are known to occur in the Trinity River. Mussels are specifically known to occur in the Horseshoe
Project area and in the Elm Fork. The City of Dallas would coordinate with the TPWD and TCEQ to
create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and Monitoring Plan or similar method to minimize
impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic resources (TPWD 2013).
Construction of the identified projects would result in adverse impacts on fish and wildlife during
construction activities. The past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects outside the Mainstem are
primarily surrounded by urban areas (refer to Figure 4.5-3). Ultimately, there would be an increase in
sensitive habitat acreage and value. Most, if not all species are expected to recolonize habitat after
construction. For these reasons, there would be beneficial long-term impacts to fish and wildlife.

The implementation of Alternative 2, the Horseshoe Project, the Trinity Parkway, and any other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects in the Trinity River, would likely adversely affect mussel
beds and state-listed mussel species. Based on surveys for the Horseshoe Project and surveys in the Elm
Fork, mussel beds and state-listed mussels occur in the Trinity River. The City of Dallas would
coordinate with the TPWD and TCEQ to create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and
Monitoring Plan or similar method to minimize impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic
resources (TPWD 2013).
No federally listed species are known to reside or breed in the ROI; therefore, no impacts to federally
listed species are anticipated. If a federally listed bird species were observed in the project areas during
the breeding season, the USFWS would be notified to discuss additional minimization measures. Some of
the BCC bird species listed in Section 3.5 is likely to occur in the ROI and be affected by Alternative 2
and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects.
Impacts to special status species, including mussels and birds, during the construction and operation of
Alternative 2 would be minimized through the implementation of BMPs and SCMs. The other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would adhere to laws and regulations to minimize impacts to
special status species. Therefore, impacts to special status species are expected to be less than significant.
Invasive Species

Invasive zebra mussels occur upstream of the ROI and are a major threat to native aquatic species. TPWD
recommends that users of Texas waters, especially boaters, adopt the “Clean, Drain, and Dry” protocol to
prevent zebra mussel larvae from spreading among Texas waters. Simply, this protocol is that a boat
owner should thoroughly clean, drain, and dry his boat after each and every put-in. Possession and

transport of zebra mussels—even if accidental—is a criminal offence punishable by fine and/or jail time
(TPWD 2013). Monitoring for invasive species and the application of appropriate control measures would
minimize the risk from invasive species. The USACE and City of Dallas would coordinate with the
USFWS, TPWD, and TCEQ to minimize the spread of invasive species. Monitoring and reporting
guidelines are described in the SCMs. SCMs would be implemented to minimize the spread of invasive
species during construction and operation of the Alternative 2.

Under the implementation of Alternative 2 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects,
impacts to biological resources would be minimized through the application of SCMs, mitigation
measures, and adherence to local, state, and federal laws and regulations to minimize impacts to
biological resources.
Given the magnitude of the proposed construction activities, which would result in nearly complete
disturbance of the Floodway, significant adverse impacts to biological resources would result. These
impacts would limited to during construction; post-construction, there would be an increase in key habitat
acreage and value. No federally listed species are known to reside or breed in the ROI; therefore, no
impacts to federally listed species are expected. Impacts to state-listed species located within the
Mainstem Group would be minimized through the implementation of SCMs, mitigation measures, and
coordination with the TPWD and TCEQ.

24

Identified SCMs for Alternative 2 would be applied to reduce the potential for impacts to fish and
wildlife, as well as reducing the risk for introducing invasive species to the Study Area. Most, if not all
species are expected to recolonize habitat after construction. For these reasons, there would be beneficial
long-term impacts to biological resources. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination
with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in significant adverse
impacts to biological resources during construction, and beneficial impacts to biological resources during
operation.

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to biological resources from implementation of the proposed
FRM elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there
would be no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections
4.5.3.1 and 4.5.3.3 for a discussion of impacts to biological resources associated with implementation of
the FRM elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.5.4.1 presents the
potential impacts to biological resources from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under
Alternative 2.

The BVP Study features would be implemented in the Mainstem Group (Dallas Floodway) (refer to
Figure 4.5-4). Under Alternative 3, most of the habitat in the Mainstem Group would be temporarily
impacted during the implementation of the BVP Study features. After the approximately 15-year
construction period (2015-2030), most of the habitat would be restored to a higher habitat value than its
current state. Three large lakes, re-alignment of the Trinity River, fringe riparian habitat, native grassland
meadows, additional bottomland hardwoods, and additional higher quality wetlands would be created
with the implementation of the BVP Study features (refer to Figure 4.5-4).
Table 4.5-10 presents the predicted acreages for the habitat types in the Mainstem Group over the 50-year
period following implementation of Alternative 3. The greatest decrease of habitat would be to grassland.
The greatest increase would be to open water from the creation of the BVP Study lakes. Bottomland
hardwood habitat would also increase with the highest quality habitat at the southeastern end of the
Floodway. Aquatic riverine habitat would increase from the relocation of the river.

As shown in Table 4.5-11, the increase in aquatic habitat (aquatic riverine, open water, and bottomland
hardwood) would be a beneficial impact from the implementation of Alternative 3. The grassland habitat
is primarily non-native and mowed; therefore, the loss of grassland habitat would not be an adverse
impact.

With the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, most of the habitat in the
Mainstem Group would be temporarily disturbed. As presented in Table 4.5-12, overall HUs would
increase in 50 years under Alternative 3. The greatest decrease of HUs would occur to grassland habitat.
The greatest increase would be to open water from the creation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features’ lakes. Bottomland hardwood habitat would also increase with the highest quality
habitat at the southeastern end of the ROI. Aquatic riverine habitat would increase from the relocation of
the river.

Alternative 3 assumes that the Trinity Parkway would not be constructed before the BVP Study features.
Accordingly, because partial excavation of lakes for the Trinity Parkway would not occur prior to the
BVP Study features, the excavation requirements of Alternative 3 would be substantially higher than

those associated with Alternative 2, resulting in greater construction-related impacts to biological
resources as compared to Alternative 2. These impacts would be limited to during construction; postconstruction, there would be an increase in key habitat acreage and value. No federally listed species are
known to reside or breed in the ROI; therefore, no impacts to federally listed species are anticipated. If a
federally listed bird species were observed in the project area during the breeding season, the USFWS
would be notified to discuss additional minimization measures.

14

Impacts to state-listed species located within the Mainstem Group would be minimized through the
implementation of SCMs and mitigation measures. Identified SCMs would be applied to reduce the
potential for impacts to fish and wildlife, as well as reducing the risk for introducing invasive species to
the Study Area. Most, if not all species are expected to recolonize habitat after construction. For these
reasons, there would be beneficial long-term impacts to biological resources. Therefore, implementation
of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse impacts to biological resources during construction,
and beneficial impacts to biological resources during operation. This conclusion assumes the
incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

This biological resources section analyzes the cumulative impacts from the implementation of Alternative

Temporary impacts to habitat from the implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation
features are expected to be significant during construction. The majority of the Mainstem Group habitat
would be temporarily impacted for up to approximately 15 years. Temporary impacts from the past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would be minimal compared to Alternative 3, BVP Study
Ecosystem and Recreation features temporary impacts.
Long-term permanent impacts to most sensitive habitats would increase in acreage and habitat value
(bottomland hardwood, open water, and aquatic riverine) would increase in acreage and habitat value and
are expected to be beneficial (Tables 4.5-13 and 4.5-14). Bottomland hardwood acreage would increase
from the BVP Study features with hardwoods planted along the Trinity River; the largest amount of
hardwoods would be planted at the southeastern end of the Floodway.
Aquatic riverine acreage and habitat value would increase from the relocation of the river under the BVP
Study features. No impacts to aquatic riverine are anticipated from the implementation of the past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. Open water habitat acreage and value would increase from
the BVP Study features creation of the Urban, Natural, and West Dallas lakes (Table 4.5-13). No impacts
to open water are expected to occur from the implementation of the past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects.
The greatest decrease of habitat would be to grassland habitat from the implementation of Alternative 3
and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. The acreages of bottomland hardwood, open
water, and aquatic riverine habitat would increase, resulting in a long-term beneficial impact to habitat
types and values. Grassland is a common habitat currently dominated by non-native grasses.

As presented in Table 4.5-14, overall HUs would increase under Alternative 3 and all past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects, resulting in beneficial impacts to habitat value. The changes in HUs
result primarily from the implementation of Alternative 3. The greatest increase would be to open water
from the creation of the BVP Study lakes. Bottomland hardwood habitat would also increase with the
highest quality habitat at the southeastern end of the Floodway. Aquatic riverine habitat would increase
from the relocation of the river. The greatest decrease of HUs would be to grassland habitat, primarily
resulting from the implementation of Alternative 3 (USFWS 2014).

The ultimate distribution of fish and wildlife under Alternative 3 and the other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would be similar to the distribution of fish and wildlife under existing
conditions. Common fish, amphibians, aquatic reptiles, and shorebirds would continue to utilize the open
water, aquatic riverine and emergent wetland habitat. Common birds and mammals would continue to
utilize the terrestrial habitat.
Under Alternative 3, impacts to fish and wildlife would be minimized through the application of SCMs
and mitigation measures. Impacts to nesting bird species would be minimized to the greatest extent
possible. If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season (February 15 through

August 31), construction activities would comply with the MBTA to avoid impacts to nesting migratory
birds. Specifically, a biologist would check the proposed construction sites, including laydown areas, for
nests (in trees, shrubs, and on the ground) once before the construction phase has begun. If the biologist
finds an active nest, construction workers would not directly or indirectly disturb the nest or adjacent
areas until the biologist determines the nest is no longer active. However, given the magnitude of the
proposed construction activities, which would result in nearly complete disturbance of the Floodway,
implementation of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse impacts to fish and wildlife during
construction.
Based on surveys, special aquatic resources including fishery habitat, mussel beds, and state-listed mussel
species are known to occur in the Trinity River. Mussels are specifically known to occur in the Horseshoe
Project area and in the Elm Fork. The City of Dallas would coordinate with the TPWD and TCEQ to
create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and Monitoring Plan or similar method to minimize
impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic resources (TPWD 2013).
The implementation of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in adverse
impacts on fish and wildlife. The past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects outside the Mainstem
Group are primarily surrounded by urban areas (refer to Figure 4.5-5). Ultimately, there would be an
increase in sensitive habitat acreage and value. Most, if not all species are expected to recolonize habitat
after construction. For these reasons, there would be beneficial long-term impacts to fish and wildlife.

The implementation of Alternative 3, the Horseshoe Project, and any other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects in the Trinity River, would likely adversely affect mussel beds and state-listed mussel
species. Based on surveys for the Horseshoe Project and surveys in the Elm Fork, mussel beds and statelisted mussels occur in the Trinity River. The City of Dallas would coordinate with the TPWD and TCEQ
to create an Aquatic Resource Recovery, Relocation, and Monitoring Plan or similar method to minimize
impacts to mussel beds and other sensitive aquatic resources (TPWD 2013).
No federally listed species are known to reside or breed in the ROI; therefore, no impacts to federally
listed species are anticipated. If a federally bird species is observed in the ROI during the breeding
season, the USFWS would be contacted to discuss additional minimization measures.
Some of the BCC bird species listed in Section 3.5 is likely to occur in the ROI and be impacted by
Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. Impacts to special status species,
including mussels and birds, during the construction and operation of Alternative 3 would be minimized
through the implementation of BMPs and SCMs. The past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
would adhere to laws and regulations to minimize impacts to special status species. Therefore, impacts to
special status species are expected to be less than significant.
Invasive Species

Invasive zebra mussels occur upstream of the ROI and are a major threat to native aquatic species. TPWD
recommends that users of Texas waters, especially boaters, adopt the “Clean, Drain, and Dry” protocol to
prevent zebra mussel larvae from spreading among Texas waters. Simply, this protocol is that a boat
owner should thoroughly clean, drain, and dry his boat after each and every put-in. Possession and
transport of zebra mussels—even if accidental—is a criminal offence punishable by fine and/or jail time
(TPWD 2013). Non-native invasive plants pose a threat to native habitats. Monitoring for invasive species
and the application of appropriate control measures would minimize the risk from invasive species. The
USACE and City of Dallas would coordinate with the USFWS, TPWD, and TCEQ to minimize the

spread of invasive species. Monitoring and reporting guidelines are described in the SCMs. SCMs would
be implemented to minimize the spread of invasive species during construction and operation of the
Alternative 3.

Under the implementation of Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects,
impacts to biological resources would be minimized through the application of SCMs, mitigation
measures, and adherence to local, state, and federal laws and regulations to minimize impacts to
biological resources.
Given the magnitude of the proposed construction activities, which would result in nearly complete
disturbance of the Floodway, significant adverse impacts to biological resources would result. These
impacts would limited to during construction; post-construction, there would be an increase in key habitat
acreage and value. No federally listed species are known to reside or breed in the ROI; therefore, no
impacts to federally listed species are expected. Impacts to state-listed species located within the
Mainstem Group would be minimized through the implementation of SCMs, mitigation measures, and
coordination with the TPWD and TCEQ.
Identified SCMs for Alternative 3 would be applied to reduce the potential for impacts to fish and
wildlife, as well as reducing the risk for introducing invasive species to the Study Area. Most, if not all
species are expected to recolonize habitat after construction. For these reasons, there would be beneficial
long-term impacts to biological resources. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 in combination
with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in significant adverse
impacts to biological resources during construction, and beneficial impacts to biological resources during
operation.

CULTURAL RESOURCES

22

4.6.1

23

The analysis of potential impacts to cultural resources considers both direct and indirect impacts. Direct
impacts include physically altering, damaging, or destroying all or part of a resource; altering
characteristics of the surrounding environment that contribute to the importance of the resource;
introducing visual or audible elements that are out of character for the period the resource represents
(thereby altering the setting); or neglecting the resource to the extent that it deteriorates or is destroyed.
Direct impacts can be assessed by identifying the type and location of a proposed action and by
determining the exact locations of cultural resources that could be affected. Indirect impacts are those that
may occur as a result of the completed project, such as increased vehicular or pedestrian traffic in the
vicinity of the resource. Direct and indirect impacts may be classified as adverse impacts or no adverse
impacts, as such often direct impacts and adverse impacts appear very similar in nature.

Approach to Analysis

A proposed action would result in significant adverse impacts to cultural resources if it would alter the
characteristics that make the resource significant. Significant adverse impacts are most often a result of
physical destruction, damage, or alteration of a resource; alteration of the character of the surrounding
environment that contributes to the resource’s integrity; introduction of visual, audible, or atmospheric
intrusions out of character with the resource or its setting; and neglect of the resource resulting in its
deterioration or destruction; or transfer, lease, or sale of the property. In addition, a proposed action or
alternative could affect Traditional Cultural Properites (TCPs) that are protected under a number of other

Chapter 4 Environmental Consequences, Cultural Resources

federal laws. The potential impacts to cultural resources have been evaluated consistent with NEPA
requirements and the Texas SHPO has been consulted throughout the course of the project concerning the
proposed actions and their impacts on cultural resources.

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, elements of the National Register significant Dallas
Floodway would continue to deteriorate from age, wear, and erosion. A major flood event could impact
the hydraulic physical features of the Dallas Floodway, which could affect the value of the essential
physical features of the Dallas Floodway. An SPF event could also result in damage to some or all of the
eight historic bridges that cross the Dallas Floodway. In addition, if the levees are breached during a
major flood event, floodwaters could inundate developed areas of the City of Dallas and impact numerous
historic buildings and historic districts within the Study Area. Historic buildings and structures that could
potentially sustain impacts include the contributing resources in the significant Dallas Floodway and the
National Register of Historic Places-eligible Oak Cliff Tenth Street Historic District. Floodwaters in these
areas could cause structural damage and material loss to these historic resources. No impacts to known
archaeological resources would occur under the Future Without-Project Condition.

The East and West Levees are essential physical features of the Dallas Floodway as a historic and cultural
resource. The modification of the levee height would affect the design and material integrity of this
resource. Although the height modification would impact the resource, the impact would not diminish the
ability of the levee to convey its significance and therefore not be a significant impact to cultural
resources.
Although the borrow pits would be located in the overbank portion of the Floodway, the impact to the
overbank would not be significant as the borrow pits would not detract from the resource’s continued use,
nor would it significantly alter the current landscape.
An archaeological site is located in the vicinity of the southeastern borrow pit and would not be directly
impacted. Although the potential for archaeological sites is low in the borrow pits, deeply buried deposits
may exist. Archaeological testing would be conducted prior to construction. Should significant sites be
discovered, mitigation would be required. Once completed, there would be no impact to historic
resources.

The AT&SF Railroad Bridge is a historic and cultural resource that has been found officially eligible for
nomination to the NRHP. The removal of large portions of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge would affect the
design, materials, and setting of the resource, diminishing its ability to convey its significance. These
modifications to the bridge would result in a significant impact to a historic property. Should the project
proceed, appropriate mitigation would be implemented. Appropriate mitigation will include high quality
photographic recordation of the resource and a written narrative of the resource to the level of
HABS/HAER Level II documentation. This documentation will be provided to local area libraries and the
Texas SHPO. Due to prior ground disturbance at this location by the original construction of the bridge,
the removal has no potential to impact archaeological historic properties. Once completed, there would be
no impact to historic resources.

The modification of the levee slopes would affect the design and material integrity of this resource.
Although the slope modification would impact the resource, the impact would not diminish the ability of
the levee to convey its significance and therefore not be a significant impact to cultural resources.
The fill for flattening would originate from borrow pits near the Westmoreland Bridge. Although the
borrow pits would be located in the overbank portion of the Floodway, the impact to the overbank would
not be significant as the borrow pits would not detract from the resource’s continued use, nor would it
significantly alter the current landscape.
An archaeological site is located in the vicinity of the southeastern borrow pit and would not be directly
impacted. Although the potential for archaeological sites is low in the borrow pits, deeply buried deposits
may exist. Archaeological testing would be conducted prior to construction. Should significant sites be
discovered, mitigation would be required. Once completed, there would be no impact to historic
resources.

Construction of the proposed BVP Study features, notably the proposed lakes and river relocation, has the
potential to impact archaeological sites within the Floodway. Although the potential for archaeological
sites is generally low in the proposed lake and river relocation areas, deeply buried deposits may exist.
Archaeological testing would be conducted prior to construction. Should significant sites be discovered,
mitigation would be required. Once constructed, the lakes would have no impact on cultural resources.
The operation of playing fields and additional facilities has the potential to have significant visual impacts
to historic resources within the Floodway. The proposed West Dallas Amphitheater, the Central Island
Amphitheater, the Lakes Isthmus gathering space, the Arrival Plaza, the Group Pavilion, and the Fountain
Plaza all serve as gathering areas for large groups of people. The construction of these facilities has the
potential to have significant visual impacts to historic resources within the Floodway. Mitigation of these
impacts will be the distribution of 250 hard-bound copies of a revised version of the 2010 Intensive
Engineering Inventory and Analysis of the Dallas Floodway, Dallas, Texas. The hard-bound copies of
this book will be distributed to all branches of the Dallas Public Library system.

Construction of public roads and parking has the potential to significantly impact historic resources
including buried archaeological deposits and architectural features such as historic bridges and pump
stations. Impacts to architectural features during construction would result in a visual impact to historic
properties until construction is completed.

Operation of these roads and parking areas would increase access to the area; however, there would be no
significant impact to historic properties. Impacts to architectural features would be visual in nature and
detract from the overall appearance of the Dallas Floodway, including the appearance of these
architectural features on the landscape as well as the overall appearance of the landscape as a whole.
Mitigation of these impacts will be the distribution of 250 hard-bound copies of a revised version of the

Alteration of the outfalls would result in a significant impact to historic properties determined
contributing to the Dallas Floodway Historic District. All of the outfalls planned for alteration are
associated with features of the Dallas Floodway, which were determined essential to the function of the
Floodway and supporting to the overall landscape of the Dallas Floodway. Once completed, the
alterations to the Interior Drainage Outfalls would constitute an alteration to the landscape of the Dallas
Floodway and be identified as a significant impact to the Floodway. Mitigation of these impacts will be
the distribution of 250 hard-bound copies of a revised version of the 2010 Intensive Engineering
Inventory and Analysis of the Dallas Floodway, Dallas, Texas. The hard-bound copies of this book will

Implementation of Alternative 2 would impact two historic properties within the Study Area: the Old and
New Hampton Pump Stations. Demolition of the Old Hampton Pump Station would result in an impact to
a historic property as the Old Hampton Pump Station was determined an essential, supporting feature of
the overall Dallas Floodway. The construction would create a new feature; however, the resulting pump
station would be visually consistent with the existing hydraulic features of the Dallas Floodway. The
sump improvements would have no impact to historic resources. Mitigation for the demolition of the Old
Hampton Pump Station will be the development of HABS/HAER Level II written documentation and
high quality digital photography of the resource.
Once completed the New Hampton Pump Station (Hampton 3 Pump Station) and the new 60-inch gated
culverts would have no impact on significant cultural resources.

Station was previously evaluated as supporting the Dallas Floodway. Demolition of the original Charlie
Pump Station would result in an impact to a historic structure as well as an impact to the overall integrity
of the Dallas Floodway. Once completed, the new Charlie Pump Station and associated features would
have no impact on historic properties. Mitigation for the demolition of the original Charlie Pump Station
will be the development of HABS/HAER Level II written documentation and high quality digital
photography of the resource.

visible, and therefore would not impact the structure’s ability to support the overall function and historic
integrity of the Dallas Floodway.
The construction of a new electrical building would constitute an impact to a historic resource, as it would
constitute an alteration of the original design. The new electrical building would result in a visual impact
to the overall landscape of the Floodway as well as to the Delta Pump Station itself, but would be
consistent with the hydraulic features of the Dallas Floodway.
Improvements to the Eagle Ford and Trinity-Portland Sumps would not impact a historic structure. The
operation of the Delta Pump Station, the electrical building, and the sump improvements would have no
impact to historic resources.
Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant and Sump Improvements

13

The construction of the new Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant would impact the integrity of the existing
Floodway. The construction would create a new feature within the Floodway; however, the resulting
pumping plant would be visually consistent with the existing hydraulic features of the Dallas Floodway.
Operation of the Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant would have no impact to historic resources.

Although the potential for archaeological sites is low in the Study Area, deeply buried deposits may exist.
Archaeological testing will be conducted prior to construction. The East and West Levees are essential
physical features of the Dallas Floodway as a historic and cultural resource. Although the height
modification would impact the resource, the impact would not alter the resource’s current significance nor
would it detract from its current and future purpose. The removal of large portions of the AT&SF
Railroad Bridge would affect the design, materials, and setting of the resource, diminishing its ability to
convey its significance and resulting in an impact to a historic property.

Summary

31

The demolition or alteration of contributing features to the Dallas Floodway Historic District would result
in impacts to a historic structure as well as an impact to the overall integrity of the Dallas Floodway. The
USACE will complete HABS/HAER Level II written documentation and high quality digital photography
of any resource adversely impacted. For resources impacted under the BVP, mitigation will consist of the
distribution of 250 hard-bound copies of a revised version of the 2010 Intensive Engineering Inventory
and Analysis of the Dallas Floodway, Dallas, Texas. The hard-bound copies of this book will be
distributed to all branches of the Dallas Public Library system. The City of Dallas would comply with all
relevant and applicable laws and regulations. Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in significant
adverse impacts to cultural resources. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization,
avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

4.6.3.5

33

The implementation of proposed improvements at the Able Pumping Plant include demolition of the
Small Able Pump Station. This demolition, combined with Alternative 2’s proposed demolition of the
Hampton and Charlie Pump Stations would result in significant adverse impacts to historic resources. In
addition, the removal of large portions of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge would also result in an impact to a
historic resource. The potential for impacts to archaeological sites exists; however, the probability of
finding any archaeological sites within the Floodway is low.

Parkway project would significantly alter the landscape of the Dallas Floodway. The completion of the
potential Trinity Parkway project would result in an impact to the NRHP-eligible Continental Avenue
Viaduct. Potential mitigation measures identified by the potential Trinity Parkway project to minimize the
impact to cultural resources include ensuring the replacement bridge section compliments the historic
bridge or providing an interpretive plaque discussing the historic viaduct. Additional potential mitigation
measures include the completion of Historic American Engineering Record documentation for the viaduct
(FHWA 2014). Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the identified past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in significant adverse impacts to cultural
resources.

Alternative 3 differs from Alternative 2 primarily in the number of bicycle and pedestrian paths, athletic
fields, and meadows, and the amount of landscaping. The change in BVP Study features from Alternative
2 to Alternative 3 would result in nearly identical impacts to cultural resources under Alternative 3 as
described for Alternative 2. Therefore, the cultural resources impact analysis presented in Section 4.6.3
for Alternative 2 is also valid for Alternative 3.

21

Under Alternative 3, impacts to cultural resources would be the same as described for Alternative 2.
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse impacts to cultural

measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

22

4.6.4.3

23

Under Alternative 3, impacts to cultural resources would be the same as described for Alternative 2
without the added impacts to the Continental Avenue Viaduct or visual impacts associated with the
Trinity Parkway project. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 in combination with the identified
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in significant adverse cumulative impacts
to cultural resources.

In order to provide an overall framework for evaluating recreational resources within the Study Area,
recreational opportunities were also identified within a 30-mile radius of the Study Area (including the
City of Dallas). The purpose for this approach was to assess the deficiencies and needs based on
demographics of all the communities within the Study Area. Table 4.7-1 identifies the type and number of
recreational amenities located within a 30-mile radius of the Study Area.

The Renaissance Plan evaluated existing service and equity levels to determine how well the City of
Dallas was meeting the needs of the populace from a demographic and geographic perspective (City of
Dallas 2002). An analysis of the demographic data profile of Dallas was conducted to give better insight
in meeting citizen needs for park facilities and programs. Based on recommended facilities per
population, The Renaissance Plan identified major gaps in public athletic facilities (e.g., soccer field,
volleyball courts, basketball courts), as well as recreational options such as trails, playgrounds, and
pavilions (Table 4.7-2).

The Renaissance Plan (City of Dallas 2002) assessed recreational amenities within the City and
determined then that parks in general were dated, contained older equipment and structures, and lacked
regular maintenance. Neighborhood parks were found to be overcrowded and necessitated reclassification
as community parks. The assessment also found that access to existing parks was limited, had poor
lighting, and overused sports fields with limited maintenance and upkeep. A survey by TPWD (2005)
determined that most people do not perceive the Dallas Floodway as desirable for active recreation,
festivities, or nature observation. The survey also determined that the City of Dallas has a below average
supply of almost 70% of the most commonly used facilities and resources. Thus, Alternative 1: Future
Without-Project Condition was evaluated based on the City of Dallas’s goal of 19.7 acres of parkland per
1,000 residents by year 2050.

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

The population of Texas is growing at twice the national rate, and the City of Dallas is one of the
country’s fastest growing cities (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). Under the Future Without-Project Condition,
approximately 5,890 additional acres of parks and recreation land would be developed within the City of
Dallas. In addition, there would be economic growth that would likely result in an increase in the quality
of life for people within the Study Area and region. With its current appeal of low cost of living, low tax
rates, attractive economic and cultural opportunities, Dallas would continue to attract new businesses,
residents, and visitors. By the year 2050, the population within the Study Area is expected to increase,
and the quality of living and household incomes are also expected to rise. Based on population growth
trends and accounting for those Future Without-Project Condition projects that would increase parkland
acreage, the total amount of parkland in 2050 would be approximately 28,890 acres for a proposed
population increase of approximately 1,722,902 (U.S. Census Bureau 2010).
As presented in Table 4.7-3, the Future Without-Project Condition would likely result in an increase in
recreation facilities, aquatic resources and access, trail networks, and recreation acreage. Some of these

increases have been quantified, reflecting at a minimum the known elements of the identified Future
Without-Project Condition projects. However, under the Future Without-Project Condition, the ratio of
parkland per 1,000 persons would be 16.76 in 2050, 12.6% lower than the current ratio (192) of parkland
per 1,000 persons and less than the City of Dallas’ goal of 19.7 acres of parkland per 1,000 persons.
Under the Future Without-Project Condition, the increased population and associated demand on all
recreational amenities would likely result in a greater recreation shortfall than currently exists.
Special events as described in Section 3.7.2.3 would continue to occur within the Floodway. Presumably
as the City of Dallas’ population continues to grow, event participants and the number of events would
also increase.

The proposed locations for levee modifications are not expected to directly impact recreational areas.
Two existing trails, Trinity and Crow Lake Park trail are within approximately 0.5 to 1 mile from levee
modification sites. However, access to these trails would not be affected. Temporary impacts from
construction would occur with the increased noise but would likely attenuate down to baseline levels
(refer to Section 4.15, Noise) before reaching recreational facilities. Following construction, long-term
beneficial impacts would result with improved FRM to upland recreational facilities and trails.

The AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications would have temporary impacts to adjacent trails, notably the
Santa Fe Trestle Trail during construction activity (i.e., noise, staging, increased workers and activity). In
addition, in-water access from recreational boating activity may be temporarily blocked/prohibited for
safety reasons during construction. However, these disruptions to recreation would be temporary
(approximately 6 months) and proper advanced notification of potential disruption to recreational areas
would be provided to the public.
Removal of the embankments would have only temporary construction impacts in terms of noise and
access to the trestle. The project would take approximately 6 months and be completed before summer
when more recreational use in the area occurs.
Levee Flattening: 4:1 Side Slopes

Construction activity would occur in stages and may cause noise disturbance as well as limit access to
nearby recreational areas. Impacts from construction activities would be temporary. Levee flattening
would enhance recreational amenities thereby resulting in a long-term beneficial impact to recreation.
Nonstructural Flood Control Improvements

25

As discussed in Section 2.2.2.5, physical impacts of implementing these nonstructural elements would be
negligible. Operational aspects that include improved mobilization rates, transportation network
improvements, emergency response improvements and implementing Emergency Action Plan procedures
as well as a flood warning system would ensure safety to residents enjoying nearby recreational resources
and amenities.

Construction associated with the proposed BVP Study features would result in temporary disruptions to
hiking, picnicking, equestrian areas, and special events within the Dallas Floodway. Disruption would
arise from closed public access points and staging areas. In addition, proximity to construction equipment
and activities would degrade recreation experiences on the river, as well as the trails. However, these
impacts would be temporary and only effect a small portion of existing recreation areas at a time as
construction would occur in stages throughout the Floodway. Proper advanced notification of potential
disruption to recreational areas would be provided to the public.

As presented in Table 4.7-4, implementation of proposed BVP Study features would result in substantial
increases in City of Dallas Parks and Recreation amenities to soccer fields, football fields, and trails.
Specifically, there would be an increase in the total city inventory of soccer fields by 17, or 12%,
reducing the shortfall by 7%. The addition of “flex spaces” to be groomed and maintained for a variety of
field sport usage would result in an increase of 11 football fields, or a 100% increase in inventory, and an
18% reduction in facility shortfall. The trail network proposed within the Floodway would increase trail
opportunities by 36%, and decrease the shortfall by 17%.

Implementation of the BVP Study features would also contribute to increasing the number of basketball
courts, playgrounds, and outdoor pavilions, albeit to a lesser degree. Outdoor basketball opportunities
would increase by 4%, reducing shortfall by 2%. The implementation of the BVP Study features would
increase playground inventory by 1%, reducing shortfall by 1%. Lastly, Alternative 2 would increase the
number of pavilions through the addition of plazas, council rings, and similar gathering spaces by 6%,
and therefore reduce the shortfall by 2%.
BVP Study features would serve as a community venue for special events. Tens of thousands of people
are expected to gather for celebrations in the Central Island, spilling across the river into the Oak Cliff
Parkland. The largest dedicated gathering venue would be the West Dallas Amphitheater. This venue
would be able to accommodate approximately 20,000 people for major outdoor concerts. Between 2,000
and 3,000 people would also gather in the more intimate Central Island Amphitheater near the Lakes
Isthmus. The Arrival Plaza at the foot of the Downtown Overlook would be another gathering venue, with
a capacity for another 2,000 or 3,000 people to come together. Smaller gathering venues include the
Group Pavilion on the north end of the Urban Lake and the Fountain Plaza across from the Arrival Plaza

on the Urban Lake as well. Well above the Floodway is the Continental Bridge, envisioned as a major
regional attraction for outdoor gathering. Given the increase in recreational gathering places with the
implementation of the BVP features, special event recreational opportunities (e.g., foot races, regattas,
concerts, etc.) for City of Dallas residents and visitors is expected to increase.
Both of the amphitheaters described above would be located near proposed recreational facilities,
including pedestrian paths and equestrian trails. Noise from concerts or other activities at the
amphitheaters could have an effect on the users of these facilities. However, as discussed in Section 4.15,
Noise, noise from concerts or events at the amphitheaters would be infrequent, and would not constitute a
permanent and continuous source of noise. In addition, trail users are expected to be mobile; if they did
not care for the amphitheater noise, they would be able to continue moving through the area, thus
minimizing their exposure to noise.

The addition of the off-channel lakes would create approximately 233 new acres of recreational
opportunities (Figures 4.7-1 through 4.7-3). The proposed 123-acre West Dallas Lake would include 7
acres of marshlands and feature floating wetlands that could be used as lane markers for rowing
competitions along the 1.5 mile long narrow body of water. Due to the proposed size of the West Dallas
Lake, it could support an array of national and international aquatic events. This would be the main lake
to provide recreational opportunities to nearby communities residing on the west side of the Dallas
Floodway.

Public Draft EIS

April 2014

The construction of Urban Lake (84 acres) and Natural Lake (49 acres) would result in an additional 133
acres of lake. Both lakes would be ringed with approximately 9 acres of wetlands and would include a
navigable channel connecting the two lakes via an isthmus that would provide easy boating access
between both lakes. In addition, these lakes would provide swimming areas as well as support small
boating activity such as canoeing and kayaking and within a convenient location for residential
communities along the east side of the Dallas Floodway. Urban Lake would also include a mile-long
promenade that would meander along the entire length of Urban Lake’s Downtown edge. The promenade
would provide a path for joggers, walkers, and cyclists as well as various relaxing and gathering spots. It
would also provide a scenic route for triathlons, 5K races, or other such events. The proposed Natural
Lake would allow boating for canoeists and kayakers, while boardwalks and soft surface trails would
provide visitors access to the water and wildlife viewing opportunities there.
Oxbow Lake is the smallest of the lakes proposed (3 acres) and would be located downstream just before
the Trinity River enters the Trinity Forest. This small lake would provide quiet backwater exploring
opportunities for recreational boaters as well as wildlife viewing opportunities. Table 4.7-5 presents the
projected recreational usage of the lakes and their connected amenities (City of Dallas 2009).

7

The proposed Trinity River relocation, riverbank treatments, and terracing would bring back the highvalued habitat and connection to adjacent ecosystem that was lost from previous Floodway construction.
Existing sparse vegetation, channel snags, clayey mud to fine sand, and channel bed shape irregularities
would be replaced with native channel bed plant species and substrate thereby creating shelter, feeding
zones, invertebrate colonization sites, and nursery pools. The resulting modification of the river would
provide scenic, picnicking, and wildlife viewing opportunities for residents, increasing recreational
opportunities along the river.
Wetlands

8
9
10
11
12
13

The proposed wetlands would be accented with boardwalks and soft surface trails for residents to use for
biking or walking. In addition, wetlands provide habitat for birds and other wildlife, thereby presenting
recreational bird or wildlife observation opportunities. The creation of wetlands and improvements to
existing wetlands (i.e., Corinth Wetlands) would reduce urban runoff from stormwater pollutants that
would, in turn, improve quality of wildlife habitat and provide wildlife observing opportunities for
residents along the Dallas Floodway.
Athletic Facilities

14

Flex Fields, Playgrounds, Venues

15

The proposed West Dallas Recreation Complex would result in approximately 90 additional acres of
playing fields (refer to Figure 4.7-2). The Complex would accommodate 17 regulation-sized soccer fields
and would be adaptable for other sports activities such as lacrosse, field hockey, rugby, cricket, and many
other sports uses. This would increase existing playing fields within the Study Area by approximately
30%. This complex would also provide two additional playgrounds, which would total 23 playgrounds or
structures available to children and their families within the Dallas Floodway. Furthermore, a skate park
would be another feature adjacent to Urban Lake that residents would experience (refer to Figure 4.7-3).

In addition to the West Dallas Recreation Complex, approximately 70 additional acres of flex fields
would be located south of Crow Lake, within the Oak Cliff Parkland and would provide multiple sport
uses. Combined, this increase in athletic facilities would provide a net increase in recreational
opportunities for residents. The Central Island Amphitheater would provide major outdoor concerts or

other large venues for approximately 2,500 people. The Amphitheater would also provide scenic views of
the proposed Urban Lake for viewing water events or photography opportunities.

6

Lastly, the downtown overlook at Reunion Plaza proposed on the north side of Urban Lake and
overlooking the lake would provide a place for gatherings, performances, concessions, and scenic views
(refer to Figure 4.7-3). The proposed net increase in flex fields, playgrounds, and venues would greatly
increase recreation opportunities within the Floodway.

7

River Access Points

8

The addition of three boat ramps and four new docks would increase launching and docking options along
the entire Dallas Floodway as compared to existing conditions where only the official portage is at the
Sylvan Avenue Boat Launch at Crow Lake Park. Although smaller boats currently are able to launch
upstream, the addition of the launches, located in the north and south end of the Floodway would provide
launching accesses to a greater variety of watercraft.

21

The addition of public roads (over 7 miles), 12 parking lots, and seven vehicular entry points would
provide overall improvements to existing access to recreation facilities and opportunities within the
Floodway. Previously inadequate access to the Dallas Floodway would be improved by an addition of 40
miles of trails, which would result in a net increase of approximately 40% from existing trails. These
trails would include biking, jogging, and equestrian trails.
The net increase in trails, public roads, and vehicular access would also result in achieving the regional
goal of linking public lands and open space within the Trinity Corridor and its tributaries and other
publicly owned areas (TPWD 2005). The addition of these general features in support of the proposed
venues and facilities would enhance access to recreational elements.
Interior Drainage Outfalls

22
23
24

While the proposed outfall changes would have no direct impact on recreation within the Floodway, the
water they supply to the Floodway wetlands and river amenities maintains these habitats and thus
supports the wildlife viewing and trail recreation opportunities at those sites.
Able Sump Improvements

30

These improvements to the Able Sump complex aim to provide access to the sumps as recreation
amenities that would provide interpretive trails and boardwalks, water features, gathering spaces, canoe
access, and trail linkage to the Levee Top and Santa Fe Trestle Trail. These improvements would provide
outdoor recreational opportunities in a previously inaccessible region, and would complement the land
use planning developments along Riverfront Boulevard that focus on the changing character of the river
front from industrial uses to mixed-use residential communities.

31

4.7.3.3

32

Some existing recreational facilities and amenities are located within the 100-year storm event and have
been vulnerable to flooding in the past. Notably are the greenbelts, some trails, Reverchon Park, the
Sammons Center for the Arts, and the West Dallas Community Center. Implementation of the proposed
IDP improvements would minimize the possibility of flooding these existing recreational facilities and the
proposed new recreational facilities and amenities.

Similar to improvements in the Hampton Drainage Basin, the proposed IDP improvements in the Delta
Drainage Basin would not overlap or restrict access to any existing recreational facility. However,
because a portion of the Trinity Trail passes adjacent to the Delta Pumping Station, trail users would be
exposed to construction noise. Also, portions of the North Hampton Park, located to the south and east of
the pumping plant, would be exposed to noise from construction activities. Construction noise would be
temporary and generally localized.
Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant and Sump Improvements

15

The proposed improvements in the Trinity-Portland Basin are not located within or near any existing
recreational facilities.

4.7.3.4

17

The proposed construction activities would result in temporary disruptions to recreation. However, these
impacts would be temporary and only effect a small portion of existing recreation areas at a time as
construction would occur in stages. Proper advanced notification of potential disruption to recreation
areas would be provided to the public.

Summary

Under Alternative 2, there would be a significant increase in the number and types of recreation
opportunities available to the people in the City of Dallas. The implementation of the BVP Study would
result in substantial increases in City of Dallas Parks and Recreation amenities in terms of soccer fields,
football fields, and trails, significantly reducing the recreation shortfall within the City. Notably, the new
lakes and associated amenities would provide new and enhanced recreation and interpretive opportunities
and provide scenic, picnicking, and wildlife viewing opportunities. New vehicular and pedestrian entry
points would provide overall improvements to existing access to recreation facilities and opportunities
within the Floodway. New boat launches and docks would increase the amount of Trinity River access to
a greater variety of watercraft. Furthermore, proposed IDP improvements would reduce the flood risk to
some existing and proposed recreation areas. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in
less than significant impacts to recreation during construction, and beneficial impacts to recreation during
operation. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation
measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

Construction activity proposed in Alternative 2 has the potential to overlap with reasonably foreseeable
future projects described in Section 2.9. More specifically, three recreational-based projects are currently
in the design phase and may be under construction simultaneously with elements of Alternative 2. These
reasonably foreseeable future projects include: Belleview Trail Connector, Bernal Trail, and Martin
Luther King Jr. Gateway Park and Cedar Crest Bridge Improvements. Impacts of the Proposed Action
potentially occurring simultaneously could limit access to existing recreational areas and venues or cause
residents or tourists to avoid certain parks or boating areas due to noise and construction occurring
adjacent to existing parks or recreational areas. The potential Trinity Parkway project could also
cumulatively impact existing parks by way of construction noise and access. Specifically, access to and
use of Trinity River Greenbelt Park could be restricted if an operating agreement with the City of Dallas
is implemented during Parkway construction. Furthermore, pedestrian bike paths proposed under
Alternative 2 may need modification to accommodate the potential Trinity Parkway project as proposed
under the current build alternatives.

Cumulative impacts to recreation would be beneficial when combined with other past and present
projects. More specifically, access to and tourist views of the recreational elements of the Proposed
Action would be significantly improved with implementation of the Trinity Parkway. The implementation
of the BVP Study would result in substantial increases in City of Dallas Parks and Recreation amenities in
terms of soccer fields, football fields, and trails, significantly reducing the recreation shortfall within the
city. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the identified past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would result in less than significant impacts to recreation during
construction, and beneficial impacts to recreation during operation.

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to recreational resources from implementation of the proposed
FRM elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there
would be no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections
4.7.3.1 and 4.7.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to recreational resources associated with implementation of
the FRM elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.7.4.1 presents the
potential impacts to recreational resources from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under
Alternative 2.

32

4.7.4.1

33

In general, construction impacts would not differ from those presented for Alternative 2. In addition to the
recreational impacts presented for the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation Features under Alternative
2, as presented in Table 4.7-6, under Alternative 3, there would be a net gain of 10.3 acres and 2.8 miles
for recreational facilities and pathways as compared to Alternative 2. Alternative 3 would involve one
additional amphitheater (i.e., the Natural Lake Amphitheater), which would be constructed along the
north side of the Natural Lake, to the east of the IH-35E bridge crossings of the Floodway. There would
also be additional space for a larger amphitheater and more room to add additional sports/flex spaces or
increase the size of proposed flex spaces. In addition, there would be an increase in park roads (2.1 miles),
parking (3 acres) and Floodway Access Gateways (4).

The summary provided for Alternative 2 is valid for Alternative 3; however, Alternative 3 would result in
a small net increase in recreation acreage as compared to Alternative 2. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 2 would result in less than significant impacts to recreation during construction, and beneficial
impacts to recreation during operation. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization,
avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

4.7.4.3

As described above, construction activity proposed has the potential to overlap with reasonably
foreseeable future projects presented in Section 2.9. Under Alternative 3, the Trinity Parkway would not
be built within the Floodway and thus more acreage would be available for parks, trails, etc.
Construction-related traffic from the reasonably foreseeable projects would present impacts to recreation
and recreation access. However, the additional acreage available for recreational areas would move the
City of Dallas closer to their goal of 19.7 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents than proposed under
Alternative 2, but only by 0.04%. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 in combination with the
identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in less than significant impacts
to recreation during construction, and beneficial impacts to recreation during operation.

The potential for a proposed action to alter the visual quality of a viewshed is considered when evaluating
impacts on visual resources. By identifying the existing visual conditions (character and quality) of the
viewshed potentially affected by a proposed action, an estimate of the visual impact can be assessed. The
following designations were used to describe the level of potential impacts to visual resources:

Approach to Analysis

Potentially significant impact (positive or negative): Any impact with the potential to
permanently lower or heighten the visual quality of a viewshed.
Less than significant impact: Any visible impact that would not potentially alter the visual quality
of a viewshed. Typically, this occurs when a project’s visual modifications can be seen but do not
dominate, contrast with, or strongly degrade a viewshed.
No impact: The project would not impact a viewshed. This occurs if a project’s visual
modifications do not happen or cannot be seen.

The identified Future Without-Project Condition projects would be typical of a major metropolitan area
and would be consistent with the overall existing visual environment of the Study Area. The identified
trails, parks, and recreation amenities, while subjective to individual viewer group perceptions, can

generally be described as consistent with the overall visual environment and would not result in a
dramatic change to the visual environment or change to visual sensitivity.
The identified Future Without-Project Condition bridges would alter the overall visual setting of the
Dallas Floodway. Depending on the viewer group, the signature bridges would be visually pleasing in a
man-made perspective, but could diminish the overall open space views of and from the Floodway for
some viewers. The overall visual quality of the Dallas Floodway would continue to be moderately high
(5), as vividness, intactness, and unity would likely remain moderately high (Table 4.8-1).

Construction activities for the proposed levee improvements would result in temporary impacts to the
visual environment of the Dallas Floodway. Generally, impacts from construction would include, but not
be limited to, the staging of construction equipment, stockpiles of excavated material, erosion control
materials, stored materials, exposed soil, dust and exhaust, increased vehicular traffic, nighttime
illumination, grading, and earth moving activities. Negative impacts to the visual environment from
construction would be temporary and depend on the viewer’s proximity and line-of-sight of the individual
projects. The construction within the Floodway would be localized as individual FRM elements are
implemented; not all elements would be constructed at the same time. Therefore, the location of the visual
impact would be highly variable throughout the construction period.

Following construction, impacts to the visual environment would be minimal as the levee height and
slope changes would be nearly imperceptible from existing conditions. Therefore, there would be no
noticeable change in the visual environment.

The 692 feet of existing steel truss (Photo 1) that crosses the Trinity River would be preserved. The
removal of the bridge features and the embankment would enlarge the viewshed within the South Trinity
River Greenbelt by eliminating visual barriers to the Great Trinity Forest. Viewer groups looking south
within the Floodway would observe more intactness and vividness as a result of these FRM elements.

Construction activities for the proposed BVP Study features would result in temporary impacts to the
visual environment of the Dallas Floodway over the course of approximately 15 years. There are
approximately 30 major features proposed as part of the BVP Study and impacts to the visual
environment would be different depending on the action. Generally, visual impacts from construction
would include, but not be limited to, the staging of construction equipment, stockpiles of excavated
material, scaffolding, erosion control materials, stored materials, exposed soil, dust and exhaust, increased
vehicular traffic, nighttime illumination, grading, and earth moving activities.
Construction in the Floodway would be extensive and vastly alter the visual environment for a period of
several years. The construction within the Floodway would be localized as individual features of the BVP
Study are implemented; not all elements would be constructed at the same time. Therefore, the location of
the visual impact would be highly variable throughout the construction period. Negative impacts to the
visual environment from construction would be temporary and depend on the viewer’s proximity and
line-of-sight of the individual projects.

The BVP Study proposes features within the Floodway that would considerably alter the existing visual
environment into an urban park setting (Photos 2 and 3). These proposed features would offer context
sensitive design that would reduce any aesthetic impacts. The sinuosity of the relocated river would
enhance the aquatic environment and provide the foundation for other environmental improvements,
thereby increasing the aesthetic characteristics of the Floodway. The proposed headwaters, lakes,
wetlands, and Trinity River would be maintained to limit aesthetic concerns including algal growth,
sedimentation, and floatable material. The BVP Study’s ultimate design goal is to pronounce the “quality,
use, and aesthetic character” of the Floodway. Viewers of the Floodway would primarily be in downtown
skyscrapers, levee-top trails, pedestrian overlooks, gateway parks, inside the Floodway, or traveling over
bridges and nearby roadways.

To preserve the nighttime views across the Floodway of downtown skyline, illuminated areas would be
selective and use cutoff optics to minimize light pollution and glare. Lighted features, including bridges
crossing the corridor, would provide visitors with an understanding of scale and place; meanwhile, areas
along the Promenade would be treated with smaller scaled illuminated amenities such as lighted benches
to create welcoming destinations. These methods would enhance the corridor and bring it “alive at
night”—with both people and light (City of Dallas 2009).

Furthermore, light fixtures would be strategically located to minimize their physical impact on vegetation
and wildlife. Light levels in these areas would strike a balance between a desired lighting aesthetic that
supports the nighttime activities of the Floodway for visitors and the need to provide an acceptable
environment for plants and wildlife. Lighting would respond dynamically to seasonal light levels (City of
Dallas 2009).

North Trinity River Greenbelt

Numerous actions under the BVP Study features would affect the viewshed of the North Trinity River
Greenbelt. The largest modification would be the construction of the 80-acre West Dallas Lake with its
additional 7 acres of wetland habitat (Photo 4 [existing] and Photo 5 [proposed]). The Trinity River
relocation, stormwater wetlands, recreational fields (Photo 6) trail connections, and boat launch would
also aesthetically affect the area. The relocation of the river along with increased wetland habitat would
provide the foundation for other environmental improvements, thereby increasing the aesthetic
characteristics of the Floodway. In contrast to the existing Floodway, Alternative 2 would provide a more
complex and hospitable mosaic of visually unique and interesting urban park settings. The vividness,
intactness, and unity would increase as a result of implementation of Alternative 2.

Proposed BVP Study features in the Central Trinity River Greenbelt include two terraced lakes. The
Urban Lake would be edged with a formal promenade along the downtown side (Photo 7 [existing] and
Photos 8 [proposed], 9 [existing], and 10 [proposed]). The opposite shore of the Urban Lake would be
more natural in character with a gently sloping berm, protecting it from the Trinity River. The berm
would be landscaped to provide wildlife habitat near the river and would include trails or pathways.

The Natural Lake would be located to the southeast of the Urban Lake and would provide a water
recreation experience of a more natural character. The lake would be approximately 75 acres in size, with
an additional 15 acres of wetlands around its shores. A water feature with three feet of drop would flow
towards the Urban Lake and would add enhanced aesthetics for the viewer. The lakeshore would be
composed of paths, picnic, and nature observation areas. Trees, grasses, and other vegetation would be
planted to create habitat for birds and wildlife. As the lake waters enter the Trinity River east of Cadiz
Street, the river would be divided into multiple braided river channels with low-lying wetlands and
protected islands for wildlife. The Central Trinity River Greenbelt would have the most visual exposure,
as this is envisioned to be the centerpiece of the BVP Study features. A Downtown Promenade and
Overlook would offer key observation points for views of the Central Trinity River Greenbelt and the
surrounding Dallas Floodway elements. Another viewing point includes the Oak Cliff Levee Top Road,
which would provide pedestrian entry into the park and on-street vehicle parking (Photo 11 [existing] and
Photo 12 [proposed]).
Illumination of the Trinity Lakes Area would provide a stimulating and legible nighttime landscape. With
the proper levels of brightness and contrast, lighting would contribute to the visitor’s sense of a safe and
welcoming nighttime environment. In support of these goals, the proposed lighting is divided into two
major categories: lighting for circulation and lighting for features. For circulation purposes, corridors of
light are proposed to mark the central portion of the Primary Trail and Urban Lake Promenade. For key
park features such as the Lakes Isthmus, Downtown Overlook, and Natural Lake Headwaters, pools of
light are proposed to emphasize their importance as park destinations. This strategy, both aesthetic and
user-friendly, would help orient visitors through rhythmic lines of light along paths and through lighted
features that can “punctuate” the nighttime environment. The dark sky preservation guidelines would be
incorporated where appropriate to minimize glare, light trespass, off-site lighting, and night sky pollution
(City of Dallas 2009).
Changes in the aesthetic environment of the Central Trinity River Greenbelt would be substantial and
would show only slight similarities with the existing conditions. However, these changes would likely
improve the visual character of the viewshed through greater vividness, intactness, and unity of an urban
park setting.

Proposed BVP Study features in this area are minimal when compared to the other Trinity Greenbelt
viewsheds. Actions include the construction of a boardwalk and wildlife observation areas (Photo 13
[existing] and Photo 14 [proposed]). The existing emergent wetlands at Corinth Street are of poor quality
and would be enhanced through grading and planting. Wildlife observation areas would be constructed to
provide visitors with viewing opportunities. The BVP Study features in this area would largely improve
the visual environment of the area by offering habitat enhancement and added observation points.

would consist of cast-in-place concrete and beams incorporated into the structure to accommodate the
installation of a bridge crane for maintenance. The pump station roof would have double tees, which
increases the stiffness of the structure and simplifies construction and maintenance. The New Charlie
Pump Station would not substantially alter or degrade the existing visual environment; resulting in no
change to the visual quality rating. Thus, overall impacts to visual resources from the construction of the

Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial, but less than significant, impacts to the visual
environment, mostly as a result of the aesthetic alterations from BVP Study features. When combined
with identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects, including trails, parks, signature
bridges, and recreation amenities, while subject to individual viewer group perceptions; these projects
would be consistent with the proposed overall visual environment of the BVP Study features, and other
associated elements and improvements. Such cumulative changes would occur in areas that are already
urbanized.

Cumulative Impacts

The Trinity Parkway would be a notable visual alteration within the ROI, particularly within the
Floodway. The potential Trinity Parkway would traverse along the eastern levee through the Southern and
Central Trinity River Greenbelts. As such, the potential Trinity Parkway would be visible to visitors
within the Floodway and those outside of the Floodway at elevation (e.g., Central Business District
buildings). The visual characteristics of the Dallas Floodway would be significantly changed with the
addition of the Trinity Parkway by altering the visual character and quality of the ROI, specifically
intactness and unity.

22

Therefore, when combined with the proposed revitalization of the Trinity River under Alternative 2, the
overall visual quality of the Dallas Floodway would be moderately high (5), as vividness would be high
and intactness and unity would be moderately high with the addition of the past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects. The estimated visual quality rating of moderately high (5) would be the same as the
existing Dallas Floodway. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the identified
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in less than significant impacts to the
visual environment.

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to visual resources from implementation of the proposed FRM
elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there would be
no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections 4.8.3.1
and 4.8.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to visual resources associated with implementation of the FRM
elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.8.4.1 presents the potential
impacts to visual resources from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under Alternative 2.

37

Visual impacts during construction would be the same as those described under Alternative 2. Impacts to
the North Trinity River Greenbelt visual resources would remain the same as those described under
Alternative 2 as no change to the BVP Study features would occur in this area. Implementation of
Alternative 3 would increase the visual unity, intactness, vividness, and quality of the Central and North
Trinity River Greenbelts because without the Trinity Parkway, there would be more areas for constructing
visually pleasing features within the eastern portion of the Floodway.

38

4.8.4.2

39

Under Alternative 3, there would be a slightly greater area of BVP Study features within the Study Area,
thus resulting in slightly more beneficial impacts as described under Alternative 2. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 3 would result in beneficial impacts to the visual environment. This

The cumulative impacts under Alternative 3 would be the same as described in for Alternative 2, except
the potential Trinity Parkway project would not be located within the Dallas Floodway. The Trinity
Parkway would not be located within the Floodway, increasing the overall visual quality of the Dallas
Floodway as compared to Alternative 2. Without the Trinity Parkway in the Floodway, there would be
more opportunity to build visually pleasing features, thereby improving visual unity and intactness.
Furthermore, the implementation of Alternative 3 and the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects that are similar in design and character (i.e., trails, parks, signature bridges, and recreation
amenities) would increase vividness, intactness, and unity within the ROI. The overall visual quality of
the Dallas Floodway would be high (6), as vividness, unity, and intactness would be high with the
addition of the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 3 in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would
result in beneficial cumulative impacts to the visual environment.

The analysis of impacts to socioeconomics under the Future Without-Project Condition is a qualitative
assessment of potential changes in socioeconomic factors that would likely occur if the Proposed Action
did not occur. The project action alternatives were analyzed in two phases, the construction phase and the
operations phase. The operations phase of the action alternatives were analyzed qualitatively using
information on historical economic growth patterns in the Dallas area and how those patterns might
interact with the Proposed Action. The construction phase of the project alternatives were analyzed
quantitatively using the Impact Analysis for Planning (IMPLAN) economic model (Minnesota IMPLAN
Group 2013) to generate estimates of economic impacts. Quantified economic impact results for the
construction phase are presented for Dallas County as a whole.

Result Variables and Key Concepts

3

Economic impact variables that are presented as results include: Jobs, Labor Income, and Economic
Output. Each of the result variables consists of a direct, an indirect, and an induced element as described
below.

4

Jobs

5
7

Jobs impacts represent the number of jobs that would be created or sustained within the ROI as a result of
construction activities. The IMPLAN model generates jobs numbers that include part-time jobs; therefore,
numbers calculated are for all jobs rather than full-time equivalent jobs.

8

Labor Income

9
10

Labor income impacts represent the income generated through the jobs that would be created or sustained
within the ROI as a result of construction activities.

11

Economic Output

12
13

Economic output impacts represent total production and sales volume that would be generated in the ROI
as a result of construction activities. Economic output is generated by increases in personal expenditures.

14

Direct Impacts

15

18

Direct impacts are associated with the construction projects themselves. Direct jobs include jobs building
and/or constructing the proposed projects. Direct labor income is the incomes earned by workers who are
building/construction the proposed projects. Direct economic output is associated with initial purchases of
local construction materials and supplies.

19

Indirect Impacts

20

25

Indirect impacts are the jobs, income, and economic output generated by the businesses that would supply
construction materials and supplies. Indirect jobs include jobs at companies that supply construction
materials/supplies or sell or rent construction equipment. Indirect jobs can extend to include jobs related
to the manufacture of products used for construction (if the manufacture is within the ROI). Indirect labor
income includes the income earned by people working indirect jobs. Indirect output includes the total
sales volume related to the supply of goods and services to construction contractors.

26

Induced Impacts

27

Induced impacts are the result of spending of the wages and salaries of the direct and indirect employees
on items such as food, housing, transportation, and medical services. This spending creates induced
employment in nearly all sectors of the economy, especially service sectors.

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, there would be an anticipated increase in both temporary
construction jobs, as well as permanent jobs, as multiple large-scale projects would occur within the ROI.
In addition, even without implementation of the identified future projects, increases in economic
development in the ROI are currently anticipated. The City of Dallas Office of Economic Development
has the primary goal to grow the economy of Dallas. To achieve this goal, prospects for future economic
growth, and the tasks needed to capitalize on those prospects were identified in a 2013 presentation (City
of Dallas 2013) as summarized below.

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

Leveraging public sector funding in key southern Dallas focus areas to stimulate private
investment;
Coordinating planning and development programs;
Building new and upgrading existing infrastructure;
Demolishing aging apartments to pave the way for mixed-use redevelopment;
Growing corporate interest in Downtown, Uptown and other key office markets;
Completing the Arts District vision with complementary private development;
Increasing focus on quality of life and sustainability - bike plan, complete streets and the Trinity
River Corridor;
Embracing the long-term changes in housing markets that favor urban multi-family options; and
Mirroring Texas growth projections that continue favorable economic/social trends.

Tasks to capitalize on these prospects include:



Build SourceLinkDallas program to provide enhanced coordination of small business services;
Secure financing from multiple sources for business and development projects;
Publicize and market Dallas’ advantages to investors, developers and businesses;
Facilitate business efforts to comply with regulatory and other city processes;
Maintain a competitive set of targeted business incentives to support job and tax base growth;
Provide rapid, thorough responses to requests from prospective businesses;
Provide individualized technical assistance through business assistance centers;
Explore potential efforts to increase small business recognition; and
Market downtown as a corporate headquarters, business services and entrepreneurial small
business destination.

Most economic growth in Dallas is expected to take place in the downtown area, in locations such as
currently undeveloped urban lots (i.e., greenfield sites) near the University of North Texas Dallas campus
and the inland port (City of Dallas 2010). Also, the NCTCOG developed Mobility 2035: The
Metropolitan Transportation Plan for North Central Texas (NCTCOG 2013), which identified potential
Transit Oriented Development. Transit oriented development/improvements in areas near to transit
stations resulting from additional demand for goods and services from commuters could also spur
economic growth in a future without the project.
Under the Future Without-Project Condition economic growth would likely result in an increase in the
quality of life for people within the ROI. With its current appeal for its low cost of living, low tax rates,
attractive economic and cultural opportunities, Dallas would continue to attract new businesses, residents,
and visitors.

Table 4.9-2 presents the anticipated changes to socioeconomic resources under the Future WithoutProject Condition. As with the predicted increase in economic prosperity and quality of living in the
future conditions, household income and high school graduation rates within the ROI are also expected to
increase. As expected, these predicted increases in population and income would likely put stresses on
housing supply, which may lead to higher rental prices and/or crowding of existing units. However, it is
likely that new housing units would be constructed to meet additional demand. Furthermore, many of the
identified Future Without-Project Condition projects would increase the amount of parks in the southern
portion of the ROI, resulting in a beneficial impact to minority populations and children.

By the year 2065, the overall City of Dallas and ROI populations are expected to increase, most notably
Hispanic/Latino, and the quality of living and household incomes is expected to rise. Under the Future
Without-Project Condition, the risk for river flooding would remain. If current trends continue, the SPF
would impact minority populations, and to a lesser extent low-income populations. Without future FRM
elements, these potential flood impacts would likely become worse because of estimated population
increases.
In the absence of comprehensive FRM actions, under the Future Without-Project Condition there would
be a potential for the SPF event to affect the ROI, and with it, impacts to socioeconomic resources from
flooding. More than $12.2 billion in floodplain investment could be affected. Potential secondary impacts
to socioeconomic resources would also occur (e.g., loss of jobs).

According to a study by the TPWD (TPWD 2005), the City of Dallas lacks sufficient recreational
opportunities for citizens and visitors. As recreational activities are generally considered valuable to a
community, improvements to recreational opportunities (and access to them) would directly benefit
residents of Dallas. In addition, the improvements would be expected to attract visitors to the area (for
sporting events, concerts etc.); visitors to the area would spend money in the local economy and support
tourism-related businesses, such as hotels and retail establishments. The additional money spent by
visitors would generate jobs and income for Dallas residents as well as tax revenues for local
governments and the State of Texas. Additional tax revenues may serve to improve the services that are
provided by these governments, such as police and fire protection services, and education.

Implementation of the IDP improvements would reduce the stormwater flood risk for structures located
within the interior areas. The IDP improvements would improve the capability of the Dallas Floodway to
reduce risk to the lives and property of Dallas residents from flood, which would provide beneficial
impacts to them in terms of health, safety, and personal finance.

Implementation of Alternative 2 would create 8,553 jobs (Table 4.9-12), and $662,634,032 in labor
income (Table 4.9-13), and increase economic output by $1,264,620,223 (Table 4.9-14). The increase in
recreational opportunities (and access to them) would directly benefit residents of Dallas. The anticipated
increase in visitors to the Study Area would result in more money spent in the local economy and support
tourism-related businesses such as hotels and retail establishments. The additional money spent by
visitors would generate jobs and income for Dallas residents as well as tax revenues for local
governments and the State of Texas. Furthermore, there would be a reduction in flood risk and associated
impacts within the Study Area. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial
impacts to socioeconomic resources. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization,
avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

When considered in conjunction with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects identified in
Section 2.9, Alternative 2 would have beneficial cumulative impacts to local and regional economic
conditions. The construction activity associated with implementation of Alternative 2 has the potential to
overlap with reasonably foreseeable future projects. The projects would generate economic impacts that
would be additive to the economic impacts summarized above. The projects would help fuel and sustain
the local and regional economy by creating jobs, business revenue, personal income, and fueling indirect
and induced effects in various industries. In terms of operations, reasonably foreseeable projects related to
Floodway improvements would marginally improve public safety infrastructure for Dallas residents.

Cumulative Impacts

In terms of social impacts, the Trinity Parkway project would have impacts on a number of existing
communities, which would potentially degrade community cohesion. These impacts include the
displacement and required relocation of residences, business, and/or community facilities. Other social
impacts associated with the Trinity Parkway project would include increased noise, visual intrusion,
and/or increased traffic on local streets (FHWA 2014). In terms of economic impacts, the Trinity Parkway
project would provide a much larger amount of economic impact than the combined effect of all elements
in Alternative 2. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the identified past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in beneficial cumulative impacts to
socioeconomic resources.

Alternative 3, as compared to Alternative 2, would create slightly more ecosystem and recreation features
(refer to Table 2-4). These additional improvements would be minor and impacts related to
socioeconomics would be very similar as described under Alternative 2 in Section 4.9.3. Under
Alternative 3, there would be slightly more construction activity than under Alternative 2. As such, there
would be slightly more construction-related economic activity. Any difference would be minimal and thus
the economic impact results presented under Alternative 2 in Section 4.9.3 is valid for Alternative 3 as
well. Under Alternative 3, there would be a slightly greater direct benefit to residents accrued through
additional recreational amenities. No difference in indirect effects generated through increased tourism
would be expected, as the additional amenities associated with Alternative 3 would not be likely to attract
additional visitors given that they are relatively minor as compared with Alternative 2.

31

4.9.4.2

32

Implementation of Alternative 3 would create approximately 8,553 jobs (refer to Table 4.9-12), and at
least $662,634,032 in labor income (refer to Table 4.9-13), and increase economic output approximately
$1,264,620,223 (refer to Table 4.9-14). The increase in recreational opportunities (and access to them)
would directly benefit residents of Dallas. The anticipated increase in visitors to the Study Area would
result in more money spent in the local economy and support tourism-related businesses such as hotels

and retail establishments. The additional money spent by visitors would generate jobs and income for
Dallas residents as well as tax revenues for local governments and the State of Texas. Furthermore, there
would be a reduction in flood risk and associated impacts within the Study Area. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 3 would result in beneficial impacts to socioeconomic resources.

The increase in likelihood of exposure to hazardous materials and wastes on the environment and/or
humans is considered when evaluating impacts from hazardous materials and wastes. Generally, through
mitigation, minimization, and avoidance, impacts can be avoided. The following designations were used

Approach to Analysis

Potentially significant impact: Any impact that could potentially increase the likelihood of
environmental and/or human exposure to hazardous materials and wastes.
Less than significant impact: Any impact that could potentially increase the likelihood of
exposure to hazardous materials and wastes; however, with identified mitigation, minimization,
and avoidance, the impacts would be considered less than significant.
No impact: The project would have no potential for an increase in exposure to hazardous
materials and wastes.

4.10.2

32

Several of the identified future projects in the Study Area have a project footprint that would present the
potential to come in contact or disturb existing hazardous sites. Through proper planning, investigation
and if necessary, action, some sites would likely be remediated while others would be avoided.
Specifically, as part of any necessary remediation plan, the action proponent (in coordination with
applicable regulatory agencies) would prepare a Corrective Measures Study, Implementation Work Plan,
and Report and Progress Reports. This series of documents would be open for public review and
comment and would detail the intended remediation approach (TCEQ 2009). Furthermore, the identified
future projects would adhere to applicable regulations regarding the use, storage, and transportation of
hazardous materials and disposal of hazardous wastes.

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, if contaminated soil is encountered during soil disturbing
activities within the Study Area, the activity proponents would be required to ensure that the
contaminated soil would be managed and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations. Within
the Study Area, hazardous materials and wastes would continue to be used, generated, and disposed of in
much the same manner as they are currently used, generated, and disposed.

workers would be required to adhere to the requirements outlined in the USACE Safety and Health
Requirements Manual EM 385-1-1 and AR 200-1: Environmental Protection and Enhancement to
minimize the potential for fuel, oil, and/or lubricant spills during construction activities.

During the Phase II Environmental Site Assessment, several soil borings located near the borrow pit
locations were found to contain heavy metals, PCE, and TCE at levels that exceeded the current TRRP
Tier 1 Residential PCLs (PCE and TCE) and Texas-Specific Soil Background Concentrations (heavy
metals) (USACE 2008). However, these exceedances are below TotSoilComb TRRP Tier 1 Residential
PCLs. The USACE has assessed the HTRW investigation to date, and no additional Phase II
investigations are warranted. Potentially contaminated areas or hazardous materials could be encountered
during demolition or constructed-related activities; however, a Soil Management Plan would contain a
contingency plan for encountering material during construction, and material would be handled as
appropriate. Any material that exceeds the TRRP Tier 1 Standard for TotSoilComb – PCL (combined) would
be considered hazardous and would be removed from the site and properly disposed of in accordance with
all relevant regulations.

Before initiating demolition activities, the construction contractor would inspect the bridge for the
presence of lead-based paint (LBP). If the inspection reveals the presence of LBP, the construction
contractor would be required to submit the necessary notifications and abate the hazards in accordance
with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. If contract workers discover any potentially
hazardous materials or generate any regulated wastes (e.g., LBP-containing demolition debris) during
construction activities, work would cease immediately pending further assessment by City of Dallas.
Oversight would be provided by the City of Dallas to ensure that the LBP and associated projectgenerated wastes would be handled and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations, including
but not limited to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (29 CFR § 1926.62) and
USEPA (40 CFR § 745 and 40 CFR § 261.4(b)(1)) regulations.

Based on information provided in the Environmental Data Resources (EDR) database search report, no
sites with known environmental conditions are located within 500 feet of the AT&SF Railroad Bridge
modifications. Phase II Environmental Site Assessment sampling conducted just upstream at the Corinth
Street Bridge identified several heavy metals at levels exceeding TCEQ Tier 1 PCLs (USACE 2008).
However, these exceedances are below TotSoilComb TRRP Tier 1 Residential PCLs. Any material that
exceeds the TRRP Tier 1 Standard for TotSoilComb – PCL (combined) would be considered hazardous and
would be removed from the site and properly disposed of in accordance with all relevant regulations.

Given the extent of proposed Floodway excavation, there could be a chance that contaminants of concern
could be encountered during demolition or constructed-related activities; however, a Soil Management
Plan would contain a contingency plan for encountering material during construction, and material would
be handled as appropriate. Any material that exceeds the TRRP Tier 1 Standard for TotSoilComb – PCL
(combined) would be considered hazardous and would be removed from the site and properly disposed of
in accordance with all relevant regulations. In the event that disposal would be required, a landfill or
treatment facility that meets the relevant state and federal regulatory standards for waste treatment and
disposal would be used.

Land use within the Dallas Floodway, in the future condition with the implementation of the BVP Study
features, would primarily consist of parks and recreation. For reuse purposes, the TCEQ requires soil
designated for use in parks and recreation land to meet the same standards as residential use (below all
Tier 1 Residential PCLs). However, consistent with prior USACE-TCEQ coordination for actions within
the Floodway, soils within the Dallas Floodway must meet TotSoilComb TRRP Tier 1 Residential PCLs for
reuse. The use of soils that meet the TotSoilComb TRRP Residential Tier 1 levels would limit the potential
for human exposure to potential hazardous or toxic materials associated with previously identified
contaminants within the BVP Study area during long-term operation.

30

The operation of the BVP Study features, once completed, would likely involve the routine use, transport,
and/or storage of hazardous materials. The long-term maintenance of parks, recreational facilities, trails,
and lakes, as well as the gateways, roads, and parking areas providing access to these new features, would
require the use of materials such as gasoline, oil, paint, pesticides, herbicides, and others. All hazardous
materials and wastes would be used and managed in accordance with federal, state, and local regulatory
requirements.

Station would expose workers, nearby residents, or the environment to hazardous materials/contaminants
or waste.
The Hampton Pumping Plant would continue to be a user or generator of small-quantities of hazardous

Before initiating demolition activities, the construction contractor would inspect the building for asbestos
containing materials (ACM) and LBP. If the inspection would reveal the presence of ACM and/or LBP,
the construction contractor would be required to submit the necessary notifications and abate the hazards
in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. If contract workers would discover any
potentially hazardous materials or generate any regulated wastes (e.g., ACM or LBP-containing
demolition debris) during construction activities, work would cease immediately pending further
assessment by City of Dallas. Any ACM would be handled and disposed of in accordance with OSHA
(29 CFR § 1910.1001) and USEPA (40 CFR § 61 Subpart M) regulations. Any LBP would be handled
and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to OSHA (29 CFR §
1926.62) and USEPA (40 CFR §745 and 40 CFR § 261.4(b)(1)) regulations.
The construction of the New Charlie Pump Station would be located on the West Levee, adjacent to the
existing Charlie Pump Station, between Houston and Jefferson Street. Although no known contaminated
sites are located within the area, as the proposed construction area is located close to the boundary of the
Murmur Corporation Site 3/RSR Corporation Superfund Site contamination plume. However, the
portions of the Murmur Corporation/RSR Corporation Superfund Site contamination plume closest the
New Charlie Pump Station have been remediated with no further Remedial Action necessary. Remaining
clean-up activities are approximately one mile (1.6 km) to the south (USEPA 2010).
The Charlie Pump Station would be a user or generator of small quantities of hazardous materials/wastes,
including oils, solvents, paints, etc. during routine operations and maintenance of the pumping systems
within the pumping station and other associated features. These materials would be managed in
accordance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

Alternative 2 would avoid directly disturbing any sites with known environmental conditions. The soil
proposed for use as borrow material and reuse in the Floodway would be acceptable for use under
TotSoilComb TRRP Tier 1 Residential standards. Any material that exceeds the TRRP Tier 1 Standard for
TotSoil
Comb – PCL (combined) would be considered hazardous and would be removed from the site and
properly disposed of in accordance with all relevant regulations. The USACE has assessed the HTRW
investigation to date, and no additional Phase II investigations in the Floodway are warranted. Potentially
contaminated areas or hazardous materials could be encountered during demolition or constructed-related
activities; however, a Soil Management Plan would contain a contingency plan for encountering material
during construction, and material would be handled as appropriate in accordance with all applicable
regulations.

Before demolition activities, structures would be surveyed for ACM and LBP. Any ACM would be
handled and disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to OSHA
(29 CFR § 1910.1001) and USEPA (40 CFR § 61 Subpart M) regulations. Any LBP would be handled
and disposed of in accordance with OSHA (29 CFR § 1926.62) and USEPA (40 CFR §745 and 40 CFR §
261.4(b)(1)) regulations. All hazardous materials and wastes would be used, stored, and disposed of in
accordance with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 2 would result in less than significant impacts to human health and the environment
associated with hazardous materials and wastes. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of
minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

4.10.3.5 Cumulative Impacts

24

The implementation of Alternative 2 would result in less than significant impacts to human health and the
environment in terms of potential exposure to hazardous materials and wastes. Agencies and contractors
implementing these identified projects would adhere to applicable regulations regarding the use, storage,
and transportation of hazardous materials and disposal of hazardous wastes, resulting in limited potential
for exposure and the limited possibility of hazardous material and waste releases into the environment.

Per FHWA policies, any sites with known environmental conditions within the right-of-way of the Trinity
Parkway would be acquired by the North Texas Transit Authority (NTTA) and secured in accordance
with applicable state and federal laws to minimize the risk of a contaminant release to the environment.
An increase in trucking of hazardous freight along the Floodway would occur with implementation of the
Trinity Parkway. The transportation of hazardous materials on the Trinity Parkway would be controlled
by ordinances adopted by the City of Dallas and TxDOT. Any accidental hazardous release would be
addressed in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations (FHWA 2014). Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects would result in less than significant cumulative impacts to human health and the environment
associated with hazardous materials and waste.

Impacts to human health and the environment associated with hazardous materials and wastes under

4.10.4.3 Cumulative Impacts

15

The cumulative impacts under Alternative 3 would be the same as those described under Alternative 2.
Without construction of the Trinity Parkway, any potential hazardous materials investigation and
remediation within the footprint of one of the identified projects and/or the Dallas Floodway Project,
would be the responsibility of others, whereas under Alternative 2 some hazardous material investigation
and potential remediation would occur as part of the Trinity Parkway project. Assuming project
proponents adhere to applicable regulations regarding the use, storage, transportation, and disposal of
hazardous materials and wastes, less than significant cumulative impacts to human health and the
environment associated with exposure to hazardous materials and wastes would occur with the
implementation of Alternative 3 and identified cumulative projects. Therefore, implementation of
Alternative 3 in combination with the cumulative projects would result in less than significant cumulative
impacts to human health and the environment associated with hazardous materials and wastes.

The CDC and the TREIS ROD both set specific parameters for the management of floodwaters within the
Floodway. These parameters are limited to flood control within the Floodway and do not extend to the
interior drainage area. For the purpose of this analysis, any activity with the potential to impact the flow
of flood waters within the Floodway is considered to be an impact, either adverse or beneficial, to public
safety. If that activity also exceeds the TREIS ROD criteria and/or the CDC review criteria, the impact is
considered to be both significant and adverse. For additional information about the TREIS ROD criteria

4.11.2.1 Interior Drainage System

The Future Without-Project Condition includes the completion of two substantial interior drainage
projects: the Baker Pumping Plant Improvements and the Able Pumping Plant improvements. Previously,
the Baker Pumping Plant drainage area included 104 structures subject to flooding during a 100-year
storm event; with the completion of the Baker Pumping Plant improvements (expected 2013), the number
of potentially affected structures would be reduced to 4. Similarly, the Able Pumping Plant drainage area
includes over 200 properties at flood risk. The Able Pumping Plant improvements are currently under
NEPA review and alternative analysis; the implementation of action alternatives improving the Able
drainage would substantially decrease the number of at-risk buildings in the vicinity.

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

20

Although improvements to the Baker and Able pumping plants would reduce the number of potentially
affected structures within the ROI, there would be a potential increase in the risk to persons and property
from stormwater flooding within the ROI under the Future Without-Project Condition. The reason for this
would be two-fold. First, the Future Without-Project Condition would not include improvements to other
components of the East West Levee Interior Drainage Systems (EWLIDS), and thus the conditions within
those drainage basins would continue to deteriorate. Second, the ROI includes 10,237 acres of
undeveloped lands. As that land is developed, the stormwater risk would increase with increased runoff
and with continued deterioration of stormwater management facilities. If infill development occurs within
the potentially affected flood zones over the next several decades, the risk for loss of life and damage
from an SPF event or 100-year flood event would increase.

21

4.11.2.2 Riverine Flood Risk

22

The population of Texas is growing at twice the national rate (U.S. Census Bureau 2010), and the City of
Dallas is one of the country’s fastest growing cities (U.S. Census Bureau 2008, 2010). Over the next 50
years, there is a chance of major flooding events occurring in Dallas. At the current levels of build out in
the City of Dallas, based on 2008 geographic information system data, nearly 15,000 properties would
potentially be affected by flooding associated with the current (2007) SPF event.

While the City of Dallas would continue to perform Operation and Maintenance (O&M) actions on the
Dallas Floodway Levee System, current O&M actions would be insufficient to keep up with changes in
watershed hydrology, floodplain encroachments, and land use, which would change the potential
magnitude of flood events in 2065. Thus, under the Future Without-Project Condition, the number of
structures potentially subject to river flooding from the SPF event would increase.
The BCRA concluded that an SPF (or greater) flood that would overtop the East Levee embankment,
West Levee embankment, and the floodwall on the East Levee would pose unacceptable risk using
Societal Tolerable Risk Guidelines for life safety from Environmental Regulations 1110-2-1156. Risks
for all other failure modes considered (i.e., failure related to levee instability or backward erosion) would
likely be tolerable. The BCRA notes that while models predict that risk from failure due to backward
erosion may be tolerable, that prediction may be modified as the erosion potential of levee soils is better
understood. The BCRA ranked different potential levee failures in terms of risk mode as shown in Figure
4.11-1 (USACE 2012).

The BCRA determined that the estimated probabilities of the levee failure scenarios are low. The levee
soils’ resistance to erosion and the unlikelihood of frequent or long-lasting flooding in the SPF
magnitude, lessens the likelihood of breach associated with overtopping; the long seepage path and lack
of continuous, large-grained sandy layers under the levees likely precludes failure associated with
backward erosion; and failure associated with levee instability requires the simultaneous occurrence of
multiple, unlikely levee stress and slide events (USACE 2012). As analyzed in the BCRA, the probability
of an event is only part of risk. The BCRA determined that life safety risks for overtopping under the
existing levee conditions of the East and West Levee systems exceed Tolerable Risk Guidelines (USACE
2012).

14

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, several planned or proposed projects would strengthen the
overall regional linkages within the Study Area by implementing designs to alleviate traffic congestion
and improve access and linkages across the ROI. Implementation of these transportation-centric future
projects would facilitate shorter response times by some emergency services providers to a major flood
event, thereby beneficially impacting this aspect of their ability to respond to the affected area(s).

15

4.11.2.3 Emergency Response

16

Emergency response would be challenged by a major flood event, even with the regular updates to
applicable emergency response plans and maintenance of existing communications protocols. Six of the
11 Dallas Fire-Rescue stations in the Study Area are located within the predicted extent of the current
(2007) SPF event, thus the ability of the City of Dallas to provide rescue services or respond to medical
emergencies would be reduced significantly. Similarly, the City of Dallas’ medical district is within the
predicted 2007 SPF inundation area, which could result in three of the four hospitals in the Study Area
being inaccessible by ground vehicles during such an event. Lastly, of the 63 police beats in the Study
Area, 39 would be directly impacted by an SPF event. This stress to all aspects of emergency response
indicates that the Future Without-Project Condition would result in an adverse impact on the public safety
of the City of Dallas. The City of Dallas would continue to implement the flood warning system
described in their Emergency Action Plan for the Trinity River Federal Levee System.

As discussed in Section 4.3, Hydrology and Hydraulics, the results of flood elevation and conveyance
modeling showed that the comprehensive plans for the BVP with the Trinity Parkway would not meet the
TREIS ROD criteria in terms of valley storage and water surface rise; however, the potential negative
impacts are considered to be insignificant. While additional design refinement efforts may be able to
reduce the valley storage losses noted and/or reduce the water surface rises for the flood event within the
Dallas Floodway on the main stem Trinity River, meeting the ROD criteria on every point would likely
not be achievable for such a large and complex combination of projects.

Alternative 2

For all BVP Study FRM elements, the primary safety concern during the construction phase of project
implementation would be related to the personnel and equipment working on construction projects within
the Floodway. Flash flooding occurs within the City of Dallas, and personnel within the Floodway would
be at risk of injury if flash flooding were to occur during construction. Similarly, the addition of large
equipment, and disruption of the current system could impact river flood flow during the construction
period. For example, during the AT&SF Railroad Bridge modification element, positioning additional
equipment and material adjacent to the wooden trestle could exacerbate the blocking of river water at
flood stage.
To minimize these potential construction safety risks, the construction contractor would closely monitor
weather reports not only at the construction site itself, but also throughout the Upper Trinity River
watershed. If significant rain events are predicted within the watershed, the contractor would be required
to remove all equipment from the Floodway to the developed side of the levee to the greatest extent
practicable. Construction would not occur during rain events, and construction personnel would be
required to maintain frequent communication with the City of Dallas Flood Control Division to assess the
safety of operating within the Floodway.
Operationally, implementation of Alternative 2 would improve the FRM elements within the Study Area,
thereby reducing the potential flood-related safety impacts to persons within the Study Area. The
following element-based discussion focuses on the operational impacts to public safety.
Levee Raise Modification and Flattening

28
29
30
31
32

The completion of the levee modifications would provide the developed sides of the levees with FRM for
a 277,000 cfs river flood event. In addition, the flattening of the levees would improve the ease of
maintenance; mowing and other maintenance equipment would be able to operate more safely on a
shallower levee slope. The shallower levee slope would also reduce stress on the river-side levee
integrity, and thus reduce the risks of levee slides and slumps.
AT&SF Railroad Bridge Modifications

33
34
35
36
37

40

The AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications would allow for river floodwaters to leave the Floodway
more rapidly than they leave now. This change would improve the discharge and thus flood management
capability of the Floodway overall. The ability of flood waters to leave the ROI more rapidly, however,
would not meet the requirements of the TREIS ROD criteria to maintain the pre-existing SPF flood
elevation within the Study Area, and may pose a risk to downstream areas of the Trinity River that are
unable to handle the increased rate of conveyance. When implemented in concert with the other parts of
the Proposed Action, however, the overall flood conveyance would be maintained as other project
elements and features act to slow flood water conveyance.

The AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications would also eliminate a major point of “capture” within the
Floodway that previously resulted in an accumulation of large debris being trapped by the wood trestle
and exacerbated the effect of constraining flood flow. Thus, removal of the wood trestle would not
improve flow based on the trestle constriction alone, but also on this potential accumulation impact of
Floodway debris. In addition, the removal of the embankments would enable flood waters to leave the
ROI with relatively unobstructed flow in this area.
Nonstructural Improvements

14

Nonstructural improvements would focus on improved prediction and communication with the public in
the event of a flood. Mobilization rate improvement measures would make the City of Dallas more
responsive to the needs of an at-risk population. With improved transportation networks, at-risk members
of the public would be able to evacuate a flood zone more efficiently, and the increased use of public
transportation would allow the improvements to reach a broader segment of the population. Those
without cars would be able to evacuate via the increased availability of public transportation options.
Expanding the network of shelters and identified safe zones would also improve public safety by
establishing a series of centralized areas for providing care and support to evacuated individuals.

15

4.11.3.2 BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation Features

16

For all BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, as with the BVP Study FRM elements, the
primary construction safety concern would be the personnel and equipment working within the Floodway.
To minimize these potential construction safety risks, the construction contractor would closely monitor
weather reports throughout the Upper Trinity River watershed. If significant rain events are predicted
within the watershed, the contractor(s) would be required remove all equipment from the Floodway to the
developed sides of the levees to the greatest extent practicable. Construction would not occur during rain
events, and construction personnel are expected to have frequent communication with the City of Dallas
Flood Control Division to assess the safety of operating within the Floodway.

The following feature-based discussion focuses on the operational impacts to public safety. Recreational
amenities would be closed when there is risk of flooding above bankfull level within the Floodway.
Under Alternative 2, a total of 13 motorized vehicle access points to the Floodway are planned; 10 of
these access points are planned as restricted for emergency access and use. These access points would
allow for rapid response to provide emergency services throughout the Floodway, and help to address
safety for all proposed features.
Lakes

The lakes created within the Floodway would constitute an attractive recreational feature likely to
increase use of the Floodway by area residents and tourists. As such, the need for emergency services
within the Floodway would also increase.
The lakes also represent an increase in valley storage within the Floodway, thus allowing larger floods to
be contained within the Floodway without overtopping. There is some concern as to how close the three
proposed lakes are to the levees. The USACE concluded in a risk assessment that placement of the
proposed lakes detailed in the BVP will not impact the levee system because the excavation will not
advance deep enough to penetrate the basal sand lenses that could cause seepage issues. The clay liner of
the lakes would also prevent lake water from permeating the sands that are the source of under-seepage
potential.

The proposed river modifications within the Floodway would constitute an attractive recreational feature
likely to increase use of the Floodway by area residents and tourists. As such, the need for emergency
services within the Floodway would also increase. The river modifications also represent an increase in
roughness of the river, that is, river bottom components that have the potential to slow or otherwise
interrupt water movement. The proposed meanders and riffle/pond flows would slow channel conveyance
through the Floodway.
The river modification would be designed to minimize the potential for levee underseepage. The existing
cutoff walls the city has constructed on the East Levee currently prevent underseepage through the East
Levee. These cutoff walls would be extended downstream to approximately Continental Avenue to
mitigate for the increase in risk due to the river modification.

The proposed wetlands and associated amenities within the Floodway would constitute an attractive
recreational feature likely to increase use of the Floodway by area residents and tourists. As such, the
need for emergency services within the Floodway would also increase.
The new wetlands would also represent an increase roughness of the river, as meanders and riffle/pond
flows would slow channel conveyance through the Floodway. At the same time, the proposed wetlands
may increase valley storage within the Floodway, thus allowing larger floods to be contained within the
Floodway without overtopping.
Increasing habitat within the Floodway may attract higher intensity usage by birds, and a corresponding
increase in bird/wildlife aircraft strike risk. While the wetlands within the Floodway may provide habitat
for increased usage by birds, the majority of the high quality habitat would be created at the eastern
(southern) end of the Study Area. This area is nearly 5 miles from Love Field, and thus the likelihood of
strike risk increasing from the habitat would be low. At this distance from the airfield, most planes are
flying at more than a 10,000-foot elevation, which is higher than the majority of wetland birds fly.
Athletic Facilities

The proposed athletic fields within the Floodway would constitute an attractive recreational feature likely
to increase use of the Floodway by area residents and tourists. As such, the need for emergency services
within the Floodway would also increase.

The general features of the BVP Study include substantial infrastructure devoted to the safety of amenity
users and deterrence of criminal activity. Alarm, video and lighting systems would all be incorporated in
park design. All parking areas would include video monitoring, lighting, and emergency call boxes. Video
cameras would also be located in other designated strategic areas. Emergency call boxes would be an
integral part of providing emergency assistance to park patrons and an overall sense of safety and
security. The call boxes would be installed in all access points, parking lots, and major park features. Call
boxes along the primary and secondary trails would be spaced to industry standards.
Signage would be an important component in security design. Effective signage supports surveillance,
detection, assessment and other security functions by creating a psychological deterrent and potentially
deterring casual wrongdoers. Security and informational signage would be installed at all access points,
parking lots and other strategic locations.

The Dallas Police Department would allocate a full-time security force, or a separate Trinity Lakes Area
security force could be established to patrol the park. Access by appropriately equipped emergency
vehicles, police, Emergency Medical Services, or fire, to service the park, would be facilitated by
removable bollards installed at all managed access points. This access management strategy would allow
emergency vehicles to access the park while denying access to private motorists. All levee access ramps
would be able to accommodate the size and weight of Emergency Medical Service vehicles and police
cars; fire trucks would use public motorized access points. Park roads and main paved trails would allow
for emergency vehicle access, circulation, and egress.
Interior Drainage Outfall Modifications

13

The maintenance of the interior drainage outfalls would continue to be vital to prevent accumulation of
debris, siltation, and/or erosion in and around outfalls. As discussed earlier, siltation can decrease the
ability of the Floodway to store floodwaters, while erosion threatens levee stability. The city would be
required to conduct ongoing operations and maintenance to prevent future debris accumulation, erosions,
and siltation.

14

4.11.3.3 IDP Improvements

15

Construction of IDP improvements would occur on the developed side of the levees. All IDP
improvements proposed for locations adjacent to existing pump stations would move forward without
interrupting the operation of the existing pump stations, and thus construction would not interfere with the
functioning of existing public safety elements. The primary safety risk associated with construction would
be general construction site safety of the workers, which would be required by contract agreements to be
managed in accordance with OSHA regulations and through implementation of industry standard best
practices, such as conduct of safety meetings and use of appropriate safety equipment on site.

During the project construction, the construction contractor would be responsible for the preparation and
submittal of a Flood Emergency Action Plan to the USACE and Trinity River Flood Control District for
their approval. The Flood Emergency Action Plan would be implemented in the event of imminent
flooding during construction and would address actions to be implemented during above normal river
stages for the duration of the construction activities.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would remedy any remaining deficiencies related to interior drainage
features identified in the 2007 USACE inspection report. Furthermore, proposed improvements would be
implemented in accordance with Technical Letter No. 1110-2-571 by increasing grass growth for erosion
control, removing any large trees that might become damaged by construction, and selecting species to
moderate the erosive potential of water.
Interior drainage improvements would substantially reduce the number of structures potentially affected
by a 100-year, 24 hour storm event. Table 4.11-1 compares the number of potentially affected and
potentially flooded structures under current conditions with those predicted under Alternative 2. As
shown in Table 4.11-1, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in a 45% reduction of potentially
affected structures in the WLIDS, and a 54% reduction in potentially flooded structures in the ELIDS. As
used in the table, “Drainage Area” refers to the area drained by each pumping plant. The Hampton
Drainage Area includes the Records Crossing and Nobles Branch sumps; the Eagle Ford Drainage Area
includes the Eagle Ford Sump; the Delta Drainage Area includes the Trinity Portland, WestmorelandHampton, and Frances Street sumps; and the Charlie Drainage Area includes the Charlie and Corinth
Street sumps. For more detail regarding pumping plant drainage, refer to Section 3.13, Utilities.

4.11.3.4 Risk Assessment

2

The 2012 BCRA was updated in the “Study of the Impact on Risk of the Proposed Balanced Vision Plan
and Trinity Parkway; Trinity River Corridor, Dallas Floodway” (see Appendix C of the USACE
Feasibility Report). This analysis considered the risk to life safety as it would exist with the BVP Study
features constructed. Although life safety and economic risks would be reduced with the BVP Study
features, residual risk would remain once construction is complete. In the unlikely event that the East and
West Levees were to overtop or experience a breach, the areas behind the levees would experience
significant economic damages to property and the potential for loss of life. Total risk is reduced with the
BVP features but not below the recommended tolerable risk guidelines.

4.11.3.5 Summary

20

Under Alternative 2, construction would not occur during rain events, and construction personnel would
be required to maintain frequent communication with the City of Dallas Flood Control Division to assess
the safety of operating within the Floodway. There would be a related increase in access points and
safety-related services under Alternative 2 within the Floodway. The proposed wetland areas would not
result in an increase in bird aircraft strike hazard potential to aircraft flying in and out of Love Field.
Operationally, implementation of Alternative 2 would improve FRM elements and IDP improvements
within the Study Area, thereby reducing the potential flood-related safety impacts to persons within the
Study Area. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial impacts to safety. This
conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed
in Chapter 7.

21

4.11.3.6 Cumulative Impacts

22

The Future Condition includes the completion of two substantial interior drainage projects: the Baker
Pumping Plant Improvements and the Able Pumping Plant improvements, which combined reduce
potentially flooded structures from 235 to 4. Combined with the interior drainage improvements proposed
under Alternative 2, the total potentially flooded structures in the EWLIDS would decrease by 78%.

Despite these improvements, the risk to persons and property from stormwater flooding within the ROI
would potential increase under Alternative 2 from the potential development of vacant lands noted in
Section 3.1.2.5. As infill development occurs within the potentially affected flood zones over the next
several decades, the risk for loss of life and damage from an SPF event or 100-year flood event would
increase; however, development restrictions would be employed to preclude construction in the potential
inundation area to minimize risk.
Emergency response would be challenged by a major flood event, even with the regular updates to
applicable emergency response plans, maintenance of existing communications protocols, and
implementation of Alternative 2. However, the conditions would be improved such that the challenges
would be less substantial than under existing conditions. The six Dallas Fire-Rescue stations in the ROI
located within the predicted extent of the 2007 SPF event would no longer be threatened by such a flood
and would be able to better assist in emergency response. Similarly, the City of Dallas’ medical district is
located within the predicted 2007 SPF inundation area, and would have reduced flood risk with the
implementation of Alternative 2. Lastly, as with Dallas Fire-Rescue stations, the 39 police beats within
the ROI that are located within the current predicted inundation area of an SPF event would have reduced
flood risk and remain accessible to participate in emergency response.
Several planned and proposed projects would strengthen the overall regional linkages within Study Area
by implementing designs to alleviate traffic congestion and improve access and linkages across the ROI.
Implementation of these transportation-centric future projects would facilitate quicker response times by
emergency services within and outside of the ROI to a major flood event, thereby increasing their ability
to respond to the affected area(s). The Trinity Parkway in particular would contribute to the overall
benefit to public safety in the ROI. The anticipated improvement results from reduction in peak, weekday,
weekend, and holiday local and non-local auto traffic on existing area roads, as well as facilitation of a
reduction in response time for police, fire protection, and medical services. NTTA policies permit the tollfree use of toll lanes by emergency vehicles in emergencies (FHWA 2014).

31

Implementation of Alternative 2 contributes to a beneficial impact to public safety that would be
supported by improvements to the EWLIDS and the transportation network proposed by other projects.
By decreasing the inundation risk from both the SPF and the 100-year, 24-hour storm event, while also
improving vehicular connectivity, the ROI would be significantly benefitted. Therefore, implementation
of Alternative 2 in combination with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in
beneficial cumulative impacts to safety.

Alternative 3 differs from Alternative 2 primarily in the alignment of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features. Alternative 3 would result in a difference in the number of bicycle and pedestrian
paths, athletic fields, and meadows, and the amount of landscaping, as compared to Alternative 2. The
change in BVP Study features from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3 would result in nearly identical impacts
to safety under Alternative 3 as described for Alternative 2. Therefore, the discussion of impacts
presented in Section 4.11.3 for Alternative 2 is also valid for Alternative 3.

40

4.11.4.2 Summary

41

Under Alternative 3, impacts to safety would be the same as described for Alternative 2. Therefore,

Proposed construction activities and land uses were evaluated to identify their traffic generation
characteristics (i.e., construction traffic, traffic resulting from the operation of the various project
components, or both);
The number and type of trips associated with each project element was estimated using published
traffic generation rates, or reasonably conservative estimates where published rates were not
available;
Construction and operation traffic was assigned to the projected future transportation network in
accordance with likely origins, destinations, and travel routes;
The effect of project traffic on Level of Service (LOS) on freeways and Trinity Parkway was
identified. For the purpose of this analysis, a substantial traffic effect would occur if traffic from
the Proposed Action would cause LOS ratings to decrease to D, E, or F;
Recommendations for managing weekend operation traffic on internal streets were identified; and
SCMs were identified to avoid, minimize or mitigate project traffic effects.

The following designations were used to describe the level of project impacts:

28

Approach to Analysis



33

Potentially significant impact: A potentially significant effect would occur if traffic from the
Proposed Action causes LOS rating to drop to D, E or F. For segments already characterized by
LOS F under baseline conditions, a significant effect would occur if the project increases traffic
by 2% or more, as compared to the baseline.
Less than significant impact: A less than significant effect would occur if the Proposed Action
appreciably increases traffic volumes, but does not cause a decline in LOS rating to D, E, or F.
Alternatively, for segments experiencing LOS F conditions, a less than significant impact would
occur if the Proposed Action increases traffic by less than 2%, as compared to the baseline.
No impact: When the Proposed Action does not add any recurring daily traffic to a given street or
freeway, no impact would occur.

Based on a review of data presented in Table 4.12-2, and considering the past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future projects described in Section 2.9, Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects,
all 11 bridges with low beam elevations below the current SPF elevation would continue to have their low
beam elevation below the SPF elevation. Public access to the Floodway would remain limited, while
maintenance crew access would remain the same. Table 4.12-2 summarizes the anticipated impacts to
transportation features under the Future Without-Project Condition.

As noted in Section 2.9, Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects, reasonably foreseeable
future improvement projects are proposed at the Baker Pumping Plant and Able Pumping Plant. These
improvements are expected to reduce the extent of the 100-year flood inundation area, and therefore the
number of roadways subject to flooding. However, for roadways that continue to be located within the

inundation area, the volume of traffic on these facilities would increase due to projected regional
population growth. Under existing conditions, over 1.13 million vehicle trips throughout the City of
Dallas would have been affected during a significant stormwater flood event. Population growth
projections for the City of Dallas Metropolitan Area by the NCTCOG indicate a population increase of
45% from 2010 to 2035 (NCTCOG 2013), and population growth is expected to increase demand on
freeways, surface streets, and transit facilities and services. Based on the freeway average daily traffic
(ADT) change from 2013 to 2035, it is estimated that an increase of 9% in ADT would be possible for
roads subject to flooding. This would increase the potential affected vehicle trips from a 100-year, 24hour stormwater flood event from 1.13 million to 1.24 million. As presented in Table 4.12-3, the majority
of roads currently subject to stormwater flooding would continue to be subject to stormwater flooding.

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, existing traffic volumes on major freeway facilities would
increase by the year 2035, and flood events would continue to have the potential to affect local and
regional transportation, resulting in short- to mid-term negative impacts to transportation. Public transit,
pedestrian and bicycle accessibility, and Floodway parking would improve under the Future WithoutProject Condition.

4.12.3.1 BVP Study FRM Elements

18

Under Alternative 2, the FRM elements are not expected to result in a substantial and recurring increase
in operational traffic. Although operation of the improvements would be expected to require ongoing
maintenance, such as vegetation removal, minor repairs, and related activities, such activities are not
expected to result in a regular, daily increase in traffic. Accordingly, the primary traffic impact associated
with the FRM would be from construction activities.

Construction of the FRM elements would involve the use of various types of heavy equipment and
machinery, including excavators, bulldozers, compactors, cranes, trucks, and backhoes. Accordingly,
delivery of heavy equipment and materials would not result in a regular daily traffic increase within the
ROI. However, construction activities would involve trips by dump trucks (to transport excess fill
material) and by construction workers (to operate earthmoving equipment). Because the borrow pits are
located within the Floodway, the majority of fill material haul trips to and from the levees are expected to

be confined to the Floodway, and would not traverse the street network. However, it may be necessary in
some instances to transport fill material via public streets.
The levee raise component of the FRM elements would involve the excavation of approximately 620,000
cubic yards of fill material during a single calendar year (i.e., 2015). Because of the number of trucks that
would be needed to transport excavated material within a single construction year, this phase of the FRM
elements would have the highest construction-related traffic generation. The number of front-end loaders,
and the number of dump trucks required to serve each loader, was estimated using a process developed by
faculty at the University of Maryland (2003). Inputs to the process include the loader quantity of
excavation, bucket capacity, dump truck capacity, and the haul time for trips between the construction site
and disposal areas. The number of trips per truck was estimated based on the following assumptions:





One one-way morning trip from the point of origin to the construction site in the Floodway;
Two round trips between the construction site and the fill material disposal area;
One one-way trip from the construction site to the fill material disposal area; and
One one-way afternoon trip from the fill material disposal area to the point of origin.

Based on the preceding discussion, each truck was assumed to make a total of seven trips per day. The
total number of employee and dump truck trips is presented in Table 4.12-4.

The construction-related traffic associated with the FRM elements would be temporary and localized. The
total volume presented in Table 4.12-4 is conservative, because it includes all dump truck trips, including
those that would operate exclusively within the Floodway. Even if all dump truck and employee trips
associated with the FRM elements were to use the roadway network, the construction traffic generation
would be lower than that of the Alternative 2 (refer to Table 4.12-5 in Section 4.12.3.2). With
implementation of SCMs (refer to Chapter 7), Alternative 2 would not result in any significant traffic
impact during construction. Because the FRM elements would involve a lower traffic generation and
would be subject to the same SCMs, this project element would likewise not result in any significant
traffic impact during construction.
Operation

The FRM elements would not result in a daily increase in traffic within the ROI. As discussed above in
the introductory paragraph of this section, operation traffic would be limited to routine and infrequent
maintenance activities, such as vegetation removal, minor repairs, and related activities, consistent with
ongoing maintenance activities. Therefore, no traffic-related impact would occur. Implementation of the
FRM elements would reduce SPF elevations at all active road and rail crossings of the Floodway, and

would therefore result in a beneficial impact with respect to local and regional access during major storm
events.

4.12.3.2 BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation Features

This portion of Alternative 2 would involve both construction and operation related traffic. Furthermore,
when compared to other elements of Alternative 2, the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
would have a substantially higher level of construction-related traffic generation.

The BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would involve the construction of numerous
improvements (i.e., lakes, wetlands, trails, parking lots, internal streets, athletic fields, and other
components) over the course of several years. The most intensive improvements, in terms of the number
of construction workers and the number of dump trucks, would be the lake construction, which would
occur over a 4-year period (i.e., 2022-2026), with the most intensive activity projected for the year 2022.
This portion of Alternative 2 would require extensive excavation and disposal of excess fill material,
resulting in a large number of dump truck trips and employee trips (i.e., to operate earth moving
equipment). However, as noted in Sections 2.2.1.1, Levee Height Modification, and 2.3, Anticipated
Project Implementation Timeline, the lakes4 would be partially excavated before this phase of project
implementation by the FRM elements and by the Trinity Parkway project.
Construction traffic for the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features was estimated using the
methods described in Section 4.12.3.1 (i.e., the number of front-end loaders and the number of dump
trucks per loader was estimated using procedures from the University of Maryland 2003). The key
difference between the FRM elements and the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features is the
estimate of the net excavation quantity. For the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, the net
excavation quantity accounted for the preceding excavation associated with the FRM elements and
Trinity Parkway, as borrow pit locations for both construction activities would overlap portions of the
proposed lakes5. The traffic generation associated with lake construction is presented in Table 4.12-5.

Baseline year 2022 conditions were estimated assuming a straight line of traffic growth for each freeway
segment between years 2013 and 2035. The distribution of dump truck traffic to the freeway network was
estimated based on likely travel routes from construction sites within the Proposed Action footprint to
landfills in the region. For the purpose of this analysis, it was assumed that the McComma’s Bluff,
Arlington Sanitary Landfill, Camelot Landfill, and other landfills in the surrounding area would be able to
accept excess fill material from the Proposed Action. Figure 4.12-1 presents daily traffic volumes for the
year 2022 baseline, project construction activities, and the year 2022 baseline with Alternative 2
condition. Table 4.12-6 presents the temporary impact of construction-related traffic on major freeways
and Trinity Parkway6 under year 2022 conditions. As shown in Table 4.12-6, implementation of
Alternative 2 would not result in any significant effects on key freeway and tollway facilities in the ROI.

6 This analysis scenario assumes that the potential Trinity Parkway would be open to traffic by the year 2022; however, in
accordance with Chapter 4 of the BVP Study (City of Dallas 2003), restrictions would be placed on trucks to discourage them
from using the potential Trinity Parkway within the Floodway (if constructed therein).

The BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would offer a broad range of both active and passive
recreational opportunities. Users of the recreational facilities and amenities would create a substantial and
recurring daily traffic increase on roadways approaching the Floodway, and on internal streets that
provide access to and from the facilities. The Proposed Action would provide 1,900 parking spaces within
the Floodway to accommodate these users, and various transit, pedestrian, and highway improvements
would be provided to facilitate access.
In order to estimate the operation traffic of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features, various
data sources were consulted, including the Programming and Capacities Study contained in the Trinity
River Corridor Design Guidelines (City of Dallas 2009), the 9th Edition of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (ITE 2012), and the Whittier Narrows Dam Basin Recreation
Area Environmental Impact Report (Watershed Conservation Authority 2010). Table 4.12-7 presents the
trip generation rates and traffic generation estimates of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation
features. As shown in this table, these features of Alternative 2 are expected to generate approximately
2,969 daily weekday trips and 7,477 daily weekend trips. This trip generation assumes typical usage of
the proposed amphitheaters. The traffic and parking implications of concerts or other special events at
these facilities, or elsewhere in the Floodway, are discussed below.
Weekday daily trips were assigned to freeway segments and portions of the potential Trinity Parkway in
accordance with likely travel routes from estimated trip origins to parking facilities provided within the
Floodway. The trip origins were identified based upon a review of U.S. Census Bureau Census County
Division data for the 2010 decennial Census and aerial photography of the ROI. Operations related traffic
from Alternative 2 was added to baseline year 2035 volumes in Table 4.12-1 to determine the total traffic
volumes of freeways and segments of the potential Trinity Parkway projected to occur under year 2035
baseline plus Proposed Action condition. Figure 4.12-2 depicts daily traffic volumes for the year 2035
baseline, project operation, and the year 2035 baseline with Alternative 2 condition.
The Proposed Action would accommodate existing special events that currently take place in the
Floodway, plus additional special events that would be scheduled to use the proposed amphitheaters and
other venues. Parking for large events at the West Dallas Amphitheater would be accommodated by a 42acre turf parking area, which has a capacity of 4,500 vehicles, and is located adjacent to the amphitheater.
Additional parking demand may be accommodated using parking facilities outside of the West Levee that
are currently used for existing special events, such as All Out Trinity. Also, 69,000 off-street parking
spaces are available on weekday evenings and weekends in downtown Dallas (Dallas Morning News
2013). Special event organizers would follow the existing City of Dallas Parks and Recreation
Department Special Event Permit Application process, including the inclusion of proposed road closures,
traffic control, and a parking plan. A traffic and parking management SCM is provided in Chapter 7 (see
SCM PD-27) to minimize the traffic effects when concerts or other major special events are scheduled
within the Floodway.

Table 4.12-8 presents the results of freeway and the potential Trinity Parkway segment analysis under
year 2035 conditions. As indicated in Table 4.12-8, the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
would not result in a significant impact on major freeways in the ROI or on the potential Trinity Parkway.

4.12.3.3 IDP Improvements

5

Construction

6

11

The IDP improvements would involve a temporary increase in traffic due to construction activities,
including the delivery of construction equipment and materials, and construction worker commuting.
Construction traffic impacts would be temporary and are expected to be localized. Also, constructionrelated traffic impacts may arise from temporary lane closures and possible traffic stoppages to
accommodate construction traffic movement. A Traffic Control Plan would be required to minimize the
effects of IDP improvement construction on traffic.

12

Operation

13

Operational traffic associated with Alternative 2 would involve infrequent routine maintenance activities
(e.g., electrical system repairs, heating, ventilation and air conditioning repairs, etc.). Although there may
be an incremental increase in maintenance required for newly-constructed or refurbished facilities, any
associated traffic increase would be relatively minor, and would not be expected to recur on a daily basis
during commuting periods.

Upon completion of the proposed IDP improvements, the expanded pumping plants would be better
equipped to manage stormwater in their respective basins. As a result, the roads identified as being
potentially subject to flooding would have a reduced risk of flooding-related closure.

4.12.3.4 Summary

2

14

Alternative 2 would potentially require extensive excavation and disposal of excess fill material, if the
excess cut material could not be used within the Floodway, resulting in a large number of dump truck
trips; however, these additional trips would not result in any substantial effects on key freeway and
tollway facilities in the ROI. Users of the recreational facilities and amenities would create a substantial
and recurring daily traffic increase on highways approaching the Floodway and on internal streets that
provide access to and from the facilities. With the implementation of SCMs, operational impacts would
be less than significant. Although operation of the IDP improvements would be expected to require
ongoing maintenance (such as vegetation removal, minor repairs, and related activities), such activities
are not expected to result in a regular, daily increase in traffic. Roads potentially subject to flooding
would have a reduced risk of flooding-related closure following implementation of the proposed FRM
elements and IDP improvements. Therefore, implementation Alternative 2 would result in less than
significant impacts to transportation during construction and operation. This conclusion assumes the
incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

15

4.12.3.5 Cumulative Impacts

16

The cumulative traffic implications of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects are
included in the year 2013 and year 2035 forecast traffic data developed by NCTCOG as part of Mobility
2035. This is because NCTCOG’s year 2035 travel demand forecast was developed based on long-range
population and employment projections in the North Central Texas region, and incorporates planned
transportation improvements. Cumulative traffic conditions are summarized in Table 4.12-9. As shown in
Table 4.12-9, traffic from cumulative growth, taken in combination with traffic associated with
implementation of Alternative 2, would result in significant adverse impacts to all freeway segments in
the ROI, except for IH-30, to the east of IH-35E.

Public Draft EIS

April 2014

The Trinity Parkway project is not expected to cause a substantial and recurring increase in traffic
generation during operations. Instead, the proposed tollway would accommodate existing and forecasted
future traffic that is already accounted for in existing traffic counts and future traffic growth projections.
Construction and operation of Trinity Parkway would result in the diversion of traffic from current routes
this potential new facility. As a result, traffic would increase on some arterials and freeways, and would
decrease at other locations (FHWA 2014). From a regional perspective, the potential Trinity Parkway
would increase transportation capacity, and the diversion of traffic would result in a net reduction in
traffic on other arterials and freeways within the ROI. As a result, Trinity Parkway’s cumulative traffic
impact would be less than significant.

10

4.12.4

11

17

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to transportation from implementation of the proposed FRM
elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there would be
no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections 4.12.3.1
and 4.12.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to transportation associated with implementation of the FRM
elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.12.4.1 presents the potential
impacts to transportation from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under Alternative 2.

18

4.12.4.1 BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation Features

19

Alternative 3 assumes that the potential Trinity Parkway would not be constructed within the Floodway.
Accordingly, because partial excavation of lakes for the potential Trinity Parkway would not occur prior
to the BVP, the excavation requirements of the proposed BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
under Alternative 3 would be substantially higher than those associated with Alternative 2, resulting in
more construction trips. While some of the excess cut material would be rough graded into the Floodway,
this analysis assumes a “worst case” scenario whereby all excess cut material would be transported out of
the Floodway to an appropriate landfill or disposal facility. Also under this alternative, there would be a
relatively minor reallocation of land uses within the Floodway, which would result in a negligible change
from Alternative 2 conditions.

The traffic generation implications of Alternative 3 are presented in Table 4.12-10. As shown Table 4.1210, the number of trucks potentially required to haul fill material would be more than twice the number
that would be required for Alternative 2.

Year 2022 baseline volumes were estimated using the process described above for Alternative 2.
However, because the potential Trinity Parkway would not be constructed within the Floodway under
Alternative 3, baseline volumes were adjusted to account for the assignment of traffic to other routes.
Refer to Figure 4.12-3 for ADT volumes for the year 2022 baseline, project construction-related traffic,
and the year 2022 baseline with Alternative 3 condition. Table 4.12-11 presents the findings of freeway
segment analysis under Alternative 3. As shown in Table 4.12-11, construction activities would result in
significant temporary impacts on one segment of IH-30. Although SCMs would minimize project
construction traffic impacts, it would not reduce the volume of project construction traffic on freeways.

Table 4.12-12 presents the weekday and weekend traffic generation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features under Alternative 3. Alternative 3 would result in a relatively minor increase in traffic
generation (i.e., 30 additional weekday trips, and 122 additional weekend trips), as compared to
Alternative 2. The Proposed Action’s traffic assignment was estimated using the same procedures
described above for BVP Study Alternative 2. Figure 4.12-4 shows ADT volumes for the year 2035

4.12.4.2 Summary

4

14

Under Alternative 3, the number of trucks required to haul fill material would potentially be more than
twice the number that would be required for Alternative 2. Although SCMs would minimize project
construction traffic impacts, it would not reduce the volume of project construction on freeways, resulting
in significant temporary impacts on one segment of IH-35E and one segment of IH-30. Alternative 3
would result in a relatively minor increase in traffic generation as compared to Alternative 2 under
operational conditions. Roads potentially subject to flooding would have a reduced risk of floodingrelated closure following implementation of proposed FRM elements and IDP improvements. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse impacts to transportation during
construction, and less than significant impacts to transportation during operation. This conclusion
assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter
7.

15

4.12.4.3 Cumulative Impacts

16

As shown in columns 6 and 7 of Table 4.12-14, Alternative 3 in combination with the past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would result in cumulative significant adverse impacts to all freeway
segments, except for IH-30, to the east of IH-35E.

Approach to Analysis



Potentially significant impact: Significant adverse impacts to utilities would occur if
implementation of any of the proposed projects would result in the use of a substantial proportion
of the remaining utility system capacity, reach or exceed the current capacity of the utility system,
or require development of facilities and utility sources beyond those existing or currently planned.



Less than significant impact: There would be no significant or unmitigable impacts on the utility
system from the implementation of a proposed project (e.g., relocation of utilities).



Beneficial impact: Beneficial impacts to utilities would occur if a proposed project results in
increases in utility capacity or a reduction in potential flood extent.



No impact: The project would have no impact to utilities.

12

4.13.2

13

Overall, utility demand would increase with the predicted increase in population in the Study Area. It can
be reasonably anticipated that area utility providers would plan and implement additional utility
upgrade/improvement projects to increase capacity to meet the anticipated increase in utility demands
associated with future population growth.

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

In addition, several Future Without-Project Condition projects would result in improvements to overall
utility service. The proposed Beckley Avenue Improvements project would include a major new drainage
system and upgrades to water and wastewater mains. The proposed EF2 Wastewater Interceptor Line

project would increase the capacity of wastewater conveyance throughout the Study Area. Moreover,
several identified Future Without-Project Condition projects would incorporate water conservation and
water reuse strategies, and would thus be consistent with water supply planning efforts initiated by DWU,
thereby resulting in a likely increased efficiency of water use and beneficial impacts to water supply.
Water planning strategies include water conservation, contract for return flows, and additional direct
reuse. The existing unacceptable encroachments to the Dallas Floodway Levee System would remain,
unless addressed as part of future projects.
The majority of the Future Without-Project Condition projects would likely result in the temporary or
permanent relocation of utilities. During construction, there would likely be short-term, pre-approved,
scheduled, and controlled utility service interruptions; however, upon completion of construction these
temporary service interruptions would cease.

15

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, the existing threat of stormwater flooding due to inadequate
interior drainage capacity would remain for those areas served by the Hampton, Charlie, Delta, and Eagle
Ford Drainage Basins. Stormwater flooding risks would remain, as the identified Future Without-Project
Condition projects would not alleviate all existing risk factors.

16

4.13.3

17

20

Prior to implementation of Alternative 2, construction managers would be required to ensure that
proposed construction activities would not physically impact existing infrastructure (e.g., buried pipes,
power lines) by contacting utilities providers to locate utilities infrastructure and by identifying utility
crossings.

Levee Raise and Flattening

30

Several underground utility lines exist in proximity to the proposed borrow pits. These include two fiber
optic cables, a water main, and a telecommunication line (Figure 4.13-1). Relocation and adjustment of
these utilities would be planned as part of the proposed BVP Study features and would be completed prior
to borrow activities. As the levee improvements would involve construction activities on the surface of
levees, no underground utilities are anticipated to be impacted. When proposed construction would occur
near overhead electrical transmission lines, low clearance and work platforms would be utilized to avoid
damage to electrical lines and maximize worker safety. Also, when the levee flattening and improvements
would occur near bridge crossing locations, utility location investigations would be undertaken as utilities
are often suspended underneath bridges.

31

Proposed levee improvements would not result in an increase in demand for utility services.

Multiple overhead electrical transmission lines cross the AT&SF Railroad Bridge on the northwestern
side of the Floodway (refer to Figure 3.13-14). Moreover, an overhead electrical line crosses directly over
the Santa Fe Trestle Trail embankment. Low-clearance equipment and/or lower work platforms would be
utilized as necessary to avoid low clearances from utility lines. The existing utility lines would remain.
No underground utilities are known to occur in the area; however, verification would be required prior to
construction.

Based on the findings of a Trinity River Utility Adjustment and Relocation study (City of Dallas 2008),
several utilities within the Floodway are proposed for adjustment or relocation due to the proposed
implementation of the BVP Study features. These include the relocation of four underground water mains,
13 underground and/or aerial franchise utilities and the removal of five miscellaneous pipelines (Table
4.13-1; Figures 4.13-2 and 4.13-3). The utility relocations would be designed and constructed in advance
of other project improvements by each respective franchise utility company to minimize the potential for
utility service interruptions. Table 4.13-1 lists currently known utilities that would need to be relocated as
part of the BVP Study features; as design progresses it is likely that additional utilities would need to be
relocated.

The implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would require the
rearrangement of multiple utilities and involve possible temporary service disruptions. Advanced notice
would be given to those users that would be affected by service disruptions. Of note, design specifications
would be developed and implemented to avoid and minimize any impact from construction or relocation
activities to the operation of the four underground water mains that cross the Trinity River. To minimize
service disruptions, the City of Dallas would require that shut-down for tie-ins to the existing water mains
would occur only during the coldest months (i.e., between October 1 and April 1).
Operation

13

The operation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would require utilities within the
Floodway to provide capacity to serve the proposed features and visitors. Anticipated utility requirements
include wastewater, potable water, and electricity for facilities such as restrooms, drinking fountains,
bridge and trail lighting, sound systems, etc. The intent as explained by the City of Dallas is to the have a
concessionaire provide amenities such as toilets and wash stations for your hands; this approach is
successfully used at other large events in and around the City, such as the Byron Nelson Championship.

14

Electricity

15

Electricity consumption associated with the operations of the BVP Study features would include lighting
for bridges, trails, amphitheaters, promenade, and recreational fields. To minimize the potential projectrelated increase in demand on the electricity grid, a goal of the design is to render the daily use of the
BVP Study features a carbon-neutral operation. Photovoltaic (PV) panels installed along the floodwall
and atop mobile restrooms would add to the overall use of renewable energy and reduce dependence on
the existing electric grid. PV is also proposed on the park’s shade structures, powering their nighttime
lighting. Solar-powered high-efficiency light-emitting diode trail lighting is under consideration as well
(City of Dallas 2009).

Furthermore, to avoid impacts to the electrical system from flooding, permanent facilities within the
Floodway would be designed to withstand inundation from floodwaters. Concessions would be trailer
based and moved seasonally or in advance of predicted floods. With the inclusion of these project design
guidelines, the total increase in consumption of electricity would be sufficiently low to support the
conclusion that the impacts on the service area would be less than significant.

Potable Water

7

14

An important component of the BVP Study is the responsible management of fresh water. Among the
ways the City of Dallas would conserve water is by using treated effluent - rather than fresh potable water
- in its design of the water features and amenities associated with the BVP Study. The design
specifications would include the re-use of treated wastewater in headwater wetlands, the lake system, and
recreational field irrigation, as well as other water-recycling practices. The only potable water that would
be consumed would be that used in restrooms and drinking water fountains. Although the BVP Study
features would require consumption of potable water, the sustainability practices initiated by the Study
would conserve water and not adversely impact the existing water supply.

15

Wastewater

16

Treated wastewater from the CWWTP would be pumped to the Natural Lake. On average, up to 60 MGD
of treated effluent would be supplied to the lake. Wastewater would be produced from new facilities
including restrooms and water fountains around the Floodway. There are 18 total proposed restroom
facilities throughout the BVP Study Area, which would be connected to the sewer system. Prior to
forecasted flood events, the restrooms would be disconnected to avoid structural loss and sewage spills.
Wastewater treatment capacity for the City of Dallas is 260 MGD and average daily city-wide usage is
approximately 144 MGD (City of Dallas 2013).

The additional wastewater from the proposed BVP Study facilities would be within the capacity of the
existing plants and would not require additional wastewater utility construction.

25

Stormwater

26

To accommodate the proposed relocation of the river, the existing stormwater outfalls would need to be
modified. The alterations of the outfalls would not affect stormwater conveyance efficiency or capacity,
but rather change the water discharge locations.

The BVP Study would improve habitat quality by both constructing new wetlands and enhancing existing
wetlands within the Dallas Floodway. The strategy for enhancement and construction includes raising the
wetlands slightly above the base of the Floodway and/or providing FRM from low level inundation,
debris and sediment via the use of berms. The stormwater wetlands would be designed to provide a high
flow channel for larger storm events that can be easily accessed for periodic maintenance. Benefits from
the additional wetlands would derive from the pollutant removal capabilities inherent in the existing sump
areas - screening of floatable material and settling of particulates. Some additional benefit would be
derived from uptake of nutrients and additional biofiltering in the wetlands during low flow (non-storm)
periods. This treatment would provide measurable benefits for the stormwater flows passing through these
sump areas.
Proposed enhancements to the Able Sumps would improve stormwater storage and flow efficiencies,
reducing stormwater flood risk in the area.

This section focuses on improvements to IDP stormwater conveyance. For a discussion of how these
improvements relate to property damage and public safety, refer to Section 4.11, Safety.

Construction

12

The location of the proposed New Hampton Pump Station is adjacent to an industrial park with power and
utility lines running just west of the proposed facility. The TXU overhead power lines would continue to
provide service to the Hampton Pumping Plant. Any existing utilities (fire hydrants, gas meters, etc.) that
would conflict with the design would be relocated (Figure 4.13-4). Water lines would be extended from
Security Drive and be provided by Dallas Water Utilities. Gas service to the site would not be needed.
However, there is a 24-inch diameter underground gas main located between the pump station and the
levee. This main may require relocation or lowering because of the 84-inch discharge pipes being placed
above it (URS 2009a).

13

Operation

14

Alternative 2 would increase the pump capacity of the Hampton Pumping Plant by 550,000 gpm. Also,
three, 60-inch culverts would be installed to facilitate stormwater flow between the Nobles Branch and
Record Crossing Sumps. With the implementation of the proposed improvements, the Hampton Pumping
Plant’s predicted 100-year, 24-hour storm event elevations would be the same as the design elevation
(405 feet), resulting in a substantial reduction in the potential flood extents. The increased pump capacity
and sump improvements would increase stormwater conveyance to the Floodway. Increased utility
demands generated by the New Hampton Pump Station would be met by area service providers.

Construction

22

The proposed New Charlie Pump Station would be built on undeveloped land, adjacent to the existing
Charlie Pump Station, between Houston and Jefferson Streets. Approximately 430 feet of new, 8-inch
diameter water line would be tied in to the existing 12-inch line and run along Brazos Street to provide
water service to the new pump station. A new 2-inch line would branch-off from the eight-inch supply
line to provide potable domestic water to the station. A fire hydrant would be installed on the eastern end
of the 8-inch line for protection of the station. Sewer service for the station would be provided by
installing a new section of gravity pipe that would connect the discharge from the pump station restroom
to this existing line. Demolition of the Old Charlie Pump Station would occur after the New Charlie
Pump Station has been activated.

The TXU overhead power lines that run along Levee Road would continue to provide service to the
Charlie Pumping Plant. Power would be supplied to the site from two independent sources, ensuring
continued operation during a power outage (URS 2009b). Any existing utilities (e.g., fire hydrants, gas
meters, etc.) that would be in conflict with the design plan would be relocated (Figure 4.13-5). Of note, an
existing 48-inch gravity sewer line runs at a depth of approximately 20 feet from the northwest to the
southeast side of the proposed pump station site. The line would be re-routed around the facility by
installing a new section of 54-inch reinforced concrete pipe and four structural manholes.

Construction

11

15

The proposed Delta Pump Station would be located on the West Levee adjacent to the existing Delta
Pump Station, along Canada Drive. An increase in electrical supply would be required because of the
increased size of the pump. The TXU overhead power lines that run along Levee Road would provide this
increase in service demand to the Delta Pumping Plant (Figure 4.13-6). Any existing utilities (fire
hydrants, gas meters, etc.) that would be in conflict with the design plan would be relocated.

30

As there is currently no pumping plant located in the Trinity-Portland Basin, the construction of the new
Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant would increase pumping capacity to 225,000 gpm. The increased pump
capacity and installation of the proposed gated conduit structure between Trinity-Portland and Eagle Ford
sumps would allow for selective exchange of flow between these two sumps and would increase
stormwater conveyance to the Floodway. A standby generator would be used in case of emergency.
Increased utility demands generated by the Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant would be met by area service
providers.

With the implementation of Alternative 2, the Trinity-Portland Pumping Plant’s predicted 100-year, 24hour storm event water levels would be the same as the design elevation (411.5 feet), resulting in a
substantial reduction in the potential flood extents.

4

4.13.3.4 Summary

5

14

Prior to implementation of Alternative 2, construction managers would be required to ensure that
proposed construction activities would not physically impact existing infrastructure (e.g., buried pipes,
power lines) by contacting utility providers to locate utilities infrastructure and identifying utility
crossings. Any impacts to utility services during construction would be temporary and communicated to
customers ahead of the temporary outage. The proposed operations under Alternative 2 associated with
the BVP Study features would result in an increase in utility demand; however, this increase is anticipated
to be met by local and regional utility providers and BVP Study features (e.g., PV panels). The proposed
IDP improvements would substantially increase the level of stormwater conveyance. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial impacts to utilities. This conclusion assumes
the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

15

4.13.3.5 Cumulative Impacts

16

Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in beneficial impacts to utilities by improving stormwater
conveyance. Several past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would also result in improvements
to overall utility service. The proposed Beckley Avenue Improvements project would include a major
new drainage system and upgrades to water and wastewater mains. The proposed EF2 Wastewater
Interceptor Line project would increase the capacity of wastewater conveyance throughout the Study
Area. Also, the Able and Baker Pumping Plant Improvements are anticipated to reduce the stormwater
flood risk in the Able and the Oak Lawn Basin, respectively. All past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects would be implemented following coordination with regional utility providers to minimize the
potential for impacts to utilities.

The various build alternatives of the potential Trinity Parkway project would impact electrical,
communications, water, sanitary sewer, natural gas, and storm drainage utilities. Specifically,
construction of the potential Trinity Parkway within the Floodway would relocate at least two potable
water lines, two natural gas lines, and five overhead electrical transmission lines. These relocations may
result in temporary, localized utility disturbance; the NTTA is currently coordinating with the Public
Utilities Commission to maximize efficiencies and minimize service interruptions (FHWA 2014).
Relocations would be required to comply with FHWA regulations 23 CFR Part 645. Operations of the
potential Trinity Parkway would require electricity for lighting and toll collection activities.
Potential temporary, localized interruptions in utility service may result from implementation of
Alternative 2 and from several other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects. These
interruptions are not anticipated to be long lasting, to impact large sections of the Study Area, or to
repeatedly impact smaller sections of the Study Area. Implementation of Alternative 2 would require
coordination with the Public Utilities Commission and other activities in the region to minimize impacts
to individuals from service interruptions. Because of the localized, temporary nature of the potential
service interruptions, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would result in less than significant cumulative impacts to water, sewer,
electrical, gas, and communications utilities.
Operationally, because the proponents for Alternative 2 and all identified past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects requiring utility connection and/or relocation coordination with the Public Utilities

Commission, the power requirements of Alternative 2 cumulatively with other projects are not anticipated
to significantly impact the regional power supply or other utility services. The future needs are anticipated
to be within existing and future service distribution/collection capacities and capabilities (U.S. Energy
Information Administration 2013).

11

In conjunction with Alternative 2, past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects would further reduce
the extent of flooding in the communities alongside the levees from a 100-year, 24-hour storm event.
Alternative 2 contributes significantly to this reduction as well, and thus there would be a significant,
beneficial impact to stormwater conveyance. As the cumulative benefits to stormwater conveyance are
significant and long term, they are expected to outweigh the inconvenience of temporary, localized
interruptions in service. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in beneficial cumulative impacts to utilities.

12

4.13.4

13

19

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to utilities from implementation of the proposed FRM elements
and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there would be no change
in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections 4.13.3.1 and
4.13.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to utilities associated with implementation of the FRM elements and
IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.13.4.1 presents the potential impacts to
utilities from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features associated with
Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under Alternative 2.

20

4.13.4.1 BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation Features

21

28

The construction of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features under Alternative 3 would involve
the same utility relocations that are described under Alternative 2 in Section 4.13.3.3; however, because
the potential Trinity Parkway is assumed to be constructed outside of the Floodway, all utility relocations
would be the responsibility of the BVP Study project proponent, whereas under Alternative 2 some
relocations would occur during construction of the potential Trinity Parkway and would be the
responsibility of the FHWA. As under Alternative 2, advanced notice would be given to those customers
that would be affected by service disruptions. Operational impacts under Alternative 3 would be the same
as those described under Alternative 2.

29

4.13.4.2 Summary

30

35

Impacts to utilities under Alternative 3 would be slightly greater, but not substantially different, during
the construction phase as compared to Alternative 2 because more utilities would be temporarily affected
to create the proposed BVP Study lakes. There would be no change in operational conditions between
Alternatives 2 and 3. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 would result in beneficial impacts to
utilities. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation
measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

36

4.13.4.3 Cumulative Impacts

37

The cumulative impacts of Alternative 3 would be the same as those described in 4.13.2.1; however,
under Alternative 3, the project proponents do not anticipate the potential Trinity Parkway being
constructed within the Floodway. Potential Trinity Parkway alignments outside the Floodway that are
being considered would require substantially more utility relocations (potentially at least 8 potable water
lines, between 1 and 3 sewer lines, 1 natural gas line, 6 electrical transmission lines, and an electrical
substation) and associated temporary, localized interruptions (FHWA 2014). Electricity consumption

would be comparable to Alternative 2. All other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable project
contributions would be as discussed in 4.13.2.1. As the cumulative benefits to stormwater conveyance are
significant and long term, they are expected to outweigh the inconvenience of temporary, localized
interruptions in service. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 in combination with the past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in beneficial cumulative impacts to utilities.

4.14 AIR QUALITY
6

4.14.1

7

Emissions projected to occur as a result of implementing the Proposed Action were evaluated to
determine potential impacts to regional air quality. Potential air quality impacts would include: (1)
increasing ambient air pollution concentrations above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS), (2) contributing to an existing violation of the NAAQS, (3) interfering with, or delaying
timely attainment of the NAAQS, (4) impairing visibility within federally-mandated Prevention of
Significant Deterioration (PSD) Class I areas, or (5) resulting in the potential for any new stationary
source to be considered a major source of emissions.

Approach to Analysis

The closest PSD Class I area to Dallas, Texas is the Wichita Mountains Wilderness Area in Oklahoma, a
distance of approximately 175 miles. Therefore, there are no PSD Class I areas within regulatory
proximity of the Study Area and this impact threshold was not carried forward in the analysis.

On March 24, 2010, the USEPA revised the General Conformity regulations. These rules implement
Clean Air Act (CAA) provisions prohibiting federal agencies from taking actions that may cause or
contribute to violations of the NAAQS. A formal conformity determination is required for federal actions
occurring in nonattainment or maintenance areas when the total direct and indirect stationary and mobile
source emissions of nonattainment pollutants or their precursors exceed de minimis thresholds. As
discussed in Section 3.14.3.1, the applicable criteria pollutant de minimis levels are 50 tons/year for
VOCs and NOx; VOCs and NOx are precursors to the formation of ozone (O3). The Study Area is in
attainment of the NAAQS for all other criteria pollutants (de minimis thresholds are only applicable for
nonattainment pollutants).

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, many large-scale transportation, planning, and recreation
enhancement projects would likely occur within the Study Area between existing conditions and the year
2065, resulting in impacts to regional air quality. Many of the identified future projects would require the
use of heavy construction equipment and vehicles, which would result in a temporary increase in mobile
source emissions (most notably VOCs and NOx, PM2.5, and PM10) to the region. The proposed future
construction projects would likely require a conformity applicability analysis and demonstration of
compliance with the Texas State Implementation Plan (SIP), where applicable.

Alternative 1: Future Without-Project Condition

Following construction, an overall reduction in mobile source emissions would be expected to occur as
the majority of the Future Without-Project Condition projects are designed to improve traffic and
circulation, promote pedestrian and bicycle use, and enhance recreational opportunities, all of which
could result in a reduction in vehicle trips and lengths and beneficial impacts to air quality. None of the
identified future projects would result in significant new sources of stationary emissions. Thus, under the
Future Without-Project Condition there would likely be a reduction in mobile emissions and beneficial
impacts to air quality within the Air Quality Control Region (AQCR).

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, the TCEQ would continue to implement the strategies
outlined in the December 2011 Dallas-Fort Worth SIP revision for demonstrating attainment of the
federal O3 standard (TCEQ 2011). With implementation of TCEQ’s SIP strategies, technologically driven
reductions in vehicle and equipment emissions, a promotion of mass transit, and implementation of the
reasonably foreseeable projects that enhance recreational opportunities and improve traffic and
circulation, air quality within the AQCR over the next several decades would likely improve. Specifically,
the overall trend of a reduction in NOx emissions as captured in Table 4.14-1 would likely continue. VOC
emissions would likely stabilize if not decrease.

This air quality analysis considers the environmental consequences resulting from implementation of the
elements as summarized in Table 2-1. Alternative 2 consists of implementing the proposed BVP Study
FRM elements and Ecosystem and Recreation features, and IDP improvements within the Trinity River
Corridor in Dallas, Texas.

Assessing potential impacts requires an evaluation of the emissions generated as a result of implementing
Alternative 2, and assessing if these emissions would either increase ambient air pollution concentrations
above the NAAQS, contribute to an existing violation of the NAAQS, interfere or delay attainment of the
NAAQS, or result in the construction of a new major stationary source. To assess if emissions could
contribute to an existing violation or other way interfere with attainment of the NAAQS for O3, NOx and
VOC emissions were estimated using industry standards, and then compared to the General Conformity
Rule (GCR) de minimis thresholds. The applicable GCR de minimis levels are 50 tons/year for VOCs and
NOx; VOCs and NOx are precursors to the formation of O3.
Because Alternative 2 would primarily generate air emissions as a result of construction activities, the air
quality analysis has been quantitatively evaluated. Detailed estimated emissions calculations resulting
from all project activities, and construction scenarios and schedule assumptions are presented in
Appendix N. These assumptions take into account the anticipated project implementation timeline
discussed in Section 2.3. It was assumed that construction planning and design would commence in
March 2015, and all construction activities would be completed in September 2029. It was also assumed
that larger elements in the FRM and IDP would be constructed first, before implementing many of the
“surface” BVP Study features.
For the purpose of analyzing air quality impacts, emissions are presented per year of construction
implementation and many of the FRM elements, BVP Study features, and IDP improvements were
assumed to overlap within a given implementation year. Table 4.14-2 presents the estimated VOC and
NOx emissions, by year, that were estimated to occur from construction activities associated with
Alternative 2. The emissions were then compared to the GCR thresholds to assess conformity
applicability. For the remaining pollutants, the annual emissions were compared to the latest published

Estimated emissions from implementation of Alternative 2 would exceed de minimis thresholds for NOx
(50 tons per year) for the 2017 through 2027 construction years. Based on the preliminary project
assumptions, NOx emission estimates for the proposed project elements under Alternative 2 would require
a determination of conformity. This may be achieved by:

Public Draft EIS

Documenting that the emissions from the action are identified and accounted for in the SIP;
Obtaining a statement from the TCEQ that the emissions from the action along with all other
emissions in the area do not exceed the budget for those emissions in the SIP;
Having the Dallas – Fort Worth Metropolitan Planning Organization provide a statement that the
emissions are included in transportation plan modeling;
Having the state agree to include the emissions in the SIP; or
Mitigating or offsetting the increase in emissions.

Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in temporary increases in criteria pollutant emissions
associated with construction activities. A comparison of the annual emissions to the 2008 Dallas County
emission inventory demonstrates that in the year when the greatest quantity of emissions would be
generated (2020), the emissions would represent less than one-third of 1% of the county emissions in
2008 for PM2.5 and less than that for the remaining pollutants. Vehicle emissions generated by proposed
construction activities would be temporary; no long-term increases in mobile or stationary source
emissions would occur in the region.

24

Fugitive dust (i.e., PM10 and PM2.5) would increase as a result of surface disturbances associated with
construction activities and would temporarily impact local air quality. However, fugitive dust generated
by proposed construction activities would be temporary; no long-term increases in fugitive dust would
occur following the completion of construction activities. In addition, increases in PM10 and PM2.5 would
be moderated through implementation of the SCMs identified in Chapter 7, thereby limiting the total
quantity of fugitive dust emitted during project implementation.

With implementation of the BVP Study features, additional people would be expected to visit and recreate
in the area compared with baseline conditions. Operational emissions associated with the influx of visitors
would primarily consist of mobile emissions from vehicle use. However, it is reasonably assumed that the
majority of mobile source emissions currently occur within the region, and no substantial increases in
operational emissions would occur within the Metropolitan Dallas-Fort Worth AQCR. As the
attractiveness of the BVP increases through feature completion, there would be a potential for a slight
increase in out of region visitors, resulting in a negligible increase in regional mobile emissions. Ongoing
maintenance activities would occur, particularly with respect to maintaining the Natural and Urban Lakes;
however, emissions associated with these activities would not be considered substantial.

4.14.3.5 Summary

11

22

Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in temporary increases in criteria pollutant emissions
associated with construction activities. Estimated NOx emissions generated by construction activities
would exceed GCR de minimis thresholds for NOx, triggering a need to prepare a conformity
determination. Construction contractors may choose to apply to the TCEQ for a construction waiver to
allow for a temporary exceedance of NOx emissions tied to construction activity; however, a conformity
determination would still be required. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 would result in
significant adverse impacts to air quality. However, no substantial long-term increase in mobile or
stationary source emissions in the ROI would occur. The significant adverse impacts to air quality would
be addressed and moderated to the extent possible. Implementation of Alternative 2 would result in
significant adverse impacts to air quality during construction and less than significant impacts to air
quality during operation. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or
mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

23

4.14.3.6 Cumulative Impacts

25

The ROI considered in this air quality cumulative analysis includes areas adjacent to the Study Area and
potentially the entire Metropolitan Dallas-Fort Worth AQCR. Cumulative impacts resulting from
Alternative 2, in conjunction with impacts from other projects discussed in Section 2.9, would potentially
occur during proposed construction activities.

As discussed above, proposed construction activities under Alternative 2 would produce emissions that
would exceed applicable GCR significance thresholds for NOx during multiple years of project
implementation. Any concurrent emissions-generating action that occurs in the region would potentially
further contribute to ambient air quality impacts.
As a result of the significant air quality impacts identified, a conformity determination would be prepared
prior to project implementation to demonstrate that the net increase in NOx would conform to the SIP. An
impact analysis would determine whether or not emissions from Alternative 2 and combined projects
implemented during the same construction period would adversely impact the regions requirements to
attain compliance with the O3 standard or increase ambient air pollution concentrations above the
NAAQS for any of the other criteria pollutants. The combination of proposed and future project emissions
of O3 would be minimized through the USEPA and TCEQ enforcement of federal and state regulations,
which would insure that despite the increase in O3 emissions, compliance with the O3 standard and SIP is
not prevented and the maintenance of air quality standards for all other criteria pollutants is not
jeopardized.

The combination of proposed and future project emissions of CO, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 would be unlikely
to contribute to an exceedance of an ambient air quality standard based on air quality levels that are
measured today, as none of these pollutants are currently trending towards nonattainment. In addition,
projected impacts associated with the Trinity Parkway project, which is considered a substantial regional
reasonably foreseeable project, determined that concentrations of criteria pollutants are not expected to
exceed ambient air quality standards at any time.

Operational emissions associated with Alternative 2 are not expected to increase substantially and would
be similar to baseline conditions. There are no identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects (refer to Section 2.9, Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects) that suggest that
operational impacts would result in significant air quality impacts. The combination of proposed
operations and future project operational emissions would not be expected to significantly increase.

23

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to air quality from implementation of the proposed FRM
elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there would be
no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections 4.14.3.1
and 4.14.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to air quality associated with implementation of the FRM
elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.14.4.1 presents the potential
impacts to air quality from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features
associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under Alternative 2.

24

4.14.4.1 BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation

25

Alternative 3 assumes that the Trinity Parkway would not be constructed before the BVP. Accordingly,
because partial excavation of lakes for the Trinity Parkway would not occur prior to the BVP, the
excavation requirements of Alternative 3 would be substantially higher than those associated with
Alternative 2. As described in Section 4.1.2.4, this analysis assumes a worst case scenario whereby all
excess cut material would be transported out of the Floodway.

Because Alternative 3 would primarily generate air emissions as a result of construction activities, the air
quality analysis has been quantitatively evaluated. The anticipated project implementation timeline would
be the same as for Alternative 2 and construction assumptions and impacts would be similar to those
described under Alternative 2. Detailed estimated emissions calculations resulting from all project
activities, and construction scenario and schedule assumptions are presented in Appendix N. Additional
excavation equipment and haul truck trips would be required under this alternative because all excavation
needed for construction of the lakes would be completed under the BVP. In addition, all vehicular access
points would be completed under the BVP as part of Alternative 3. As shown in Table 4.14-4, estimated
emissions would therefore be slightly higher during the 2017, 2022, and 2023 construction years than
those identified under Alternative 2.

Similar to Alternative 2, implementation of Alternative 3 would exceed de minimis thresholds for NOx
(50 tons per year) during the same construction implementation years described for Alternative 2.
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 would trigger a formal conformity determination under
Section 176(c) of the CAA.
Operation

Under Alternative 3, operational impacts would be similar to those described for Alternative 2.

4.14.4.2 Summary
Implementation of Alternative 3 would result in temporary increases in criteria pollutant emissions
associated with construction activities. Estimated NOx and VOC emissions generated by construction
activities would exceed de minimis thresholds for NOx, triggering a need to prepare a conformity
determination. Construction contractors may choose to apply to the TCEQ for a construction waiver to
allow for a temporary exceedance of NOx emissions tied to construction activity; however, a conformity
determination would still be required. Estimated construction emissions under Alternative 3 would be
only slightly greater during the peak construction years (2017, 2022, and 2023) than those estimated
under Alternative 2. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse
impacts to air quality. However, no substantial long-term increase in mobile or stationary source
emissions in the ROI would occur. The significant adverse impacts to air quality would be addressed and
moderated to the extent possible. Implementation of Alternative 3 would result in significant adverse
impacts to air quality during construction and less than significant impacts to air quality during operation.
This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as
detailed in Chapter 7.

21

4.14.4.3 Cumulative Impacts

22

Implementation of Alternative 3 would result in similar cumulative impacts as described under
Alternative 2, with the exception that cumulative impacts to air quality would be greater than those under
Alternative 2. The proposed construction activities under Alternative 2 would produce emissions that
would exceed applicable GCR significance thresholds for NOx during multiple years of project
implementation. Any concurrent emissions-generating action that occurs in the region would potentially
further contribute to ambient air quality impacts.
As a result of the significant air quality impacts identified, a conformity determination would be prepared
prior to project implementation to demonstrate that the net increase in NOx and VOCs would conform to
the SIP. An impact analysis would determine whether or not emissions from Alternative 3 and combined
projects implemented during the same construction period would adversely impact the region requirements
to attain compliance with the O3 standard or increase ambient air pollution concentrations above the
NAAQS for any of the other criteria pollutants. The combination of proposed and future project emissions
of O3 would be minimized through the USEPA and TCEQ enforcement of federal and state regulations,
which would insure that despite the increase in O3 emissions, compliance with the O3 standard and SIP is
not prevented and the maintenance of air quality standards for all other criteria pollutants would not be
jeopardized.
The combination of proposed and future project emissions of CO, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 under Alterative 3
would be unlikely to contribute to an exceedance of an ambient air quality standard based on air quality
levels that are measured today, as none of these pollutants are currently trending towards nonattainment.
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 in combination with the identified past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable projects would result in significant adverse impacts to air quality during
construction and less than significant impacts to air quality during operation.

The following impact designations have been used to characterize the level of project impacts relative to
noise:

Approach to Analysis



Significant impact: For construction, a temporary significant noise impact would occur if
construction activities were to take place during nights, early mornings, and Sundays. For
operations, a significant effect would occur if the Proposed Action were to cause a permanent and
continuous increase of 10 A-weighted decibels (dBA)7 or more above the existing worst-hour
ambient noise level.
Less than significant impact: For construction, a less than significant temporary impact would
occur if construction activities were to avoid nights, early mornings, and Sundays. For operations,
a less than significant impact would occur if a proposed action were to cause a relatively minor
permanent and continuous increase in ambient noise levels at sensitive noise receptors in the
project vicinity, defined as an increase of less than 10 dBA above the existing worst-hour noise
level.
No impact: No discernible change in ambient noise levels at sensitive noise receptors in the
project vicinity.

Under the Future Without-Project Condition, several past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
would involve roadway flattening and other improvements that could shift vehicular traffic closer to
sensitive noise receptors. Examples include the Beckley Avenue improvements, various bridge projects
(such as the Hampton Road Bridge, the Sylvan Avenue Bridge, and the Loop 12 Bridge), the Horseshoe
Project, and Riverfront Boulevard. Also, other present and reasonably foreseeable projects may result in
temporary and localized noise impacts due to construction activities, including construction worker traffic
and the operation of construction equipment. Operations- and construction-related noise impacts from
these projects would be minimized through compliance with applicable regulations, including Section
4(b) of the Noise Control Act (NCA) of 1972 and Dallas City Code: Volume II, Chapter 30.

Specifically, increased traffic volumes generally result in increased traffic noise. However, to the extent that increased congestion
reduces vehicle speed, traffic noise would also be reduced (TxDOT 2011).

The AT&SF Railroad Bridge modifications are located primarily within the Floodway are therefore not
near any sensitive noise receptors. Most of the components situated near or beyond the levees do not have
a line of sight to nearby sensitive noise receptors. Similarly, the borrow pits would be located within the
Floodway, and would be shielded from sensitive noise receptors by the levees. Accordingly, the analysis
of the noise impacts of the FRM elements focuses on the levee raise and levee flattening improvements.

Construction of the FRM elements would require the use of various types of construction equipment and
machinery (e.g., excavators, bulldozers, compactors, cranes, trucks, etc.) over a period of several years.
As discussed above, much of the construction work would take place in areas that are relatively far away,
or shielded, from sensitive noise receptors. However, when construction takes place on top of or on the
developed side of the levees, surrounding land uses would be exposed to temporary noise impacts. This is

particularly true for the proposed FRM activities on the West Levee, which would be close to multiple
sensitive noise receptors along Canada Drive and Mexicana Road.
FHWA (2006) has developed a model that estimates construction related noise that uses a database
consisting of a wide range of construction equipment and vehicles and their associated noise levels. In
order to estimate construction noise levels, a hypothetical construction scenario consisting of the
following equipment was input into the FHWA model. The list below presents the equipment used for the
model, as well as their respective noise levels as reported by FHWA.


Backhoe (maximum noise level: 80.0 dBA9)
Compactor (maximum noise level: 80.0 dBA)
Dozer (maximum noise level: 85.0 dBA)
Dump truck (maximum noise level: 84.0 dBA)
Excavator (maximum noise level: 85.0 dBA)
Front end loader (maximum noise level: 80.0 dBA)
Tractor (maximum noise level: 84.0 dBA)

Based on the above list, the model estimates that the combined construction noise level would to be 85.5
dBA10 at 50 feet from the noise source. Ambient noise at Sample Sites adjacent to sensitive receptors
located near the FRM elements on the West Levee ranges from 58 dBA (Sample Site 3) to 83.1 dBA
(Sample Site 5b). Sensitive receptors having a direct line of sight to construction activities on the crest of
the West Levee may experience a temporary noise increase of 10 dBA or more during construction. The
extent of this noise effect varies based on ambient noise levels. For receptors near Sample Site 3,
construction noise would be 10 dBA higher than ambient noise 400 feet away from the construction site.
Construction noise would have no effect at receptors near Sample Site 5b, since construction noise is not
substantially louder than ambient noise. (It should be noted that this discussion is concerned with outside
noise levels only, and does not consider the additional attenuation offered within the structure when the
windows are closed.) Chapter 7 contains measures to reduce the noise effects of the FRM elements. These
measures include compliance with Section 4(b) of the NCA of 1972 and the City of Dallas noise
ordinance (i.e., Dallas City Code: Volume II, Chapter 30). Compliance with the City of Dallas noise
ordinance would require construction activities to take place between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.
on weekdays and between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Saturdays and legal holidays11. Accordingly,
although the FRM elements would result in temporary and localized noise increases during construction,
these increases would not occur during early mornings, nights, or on Sundays. Therefore, construction
impacts would be less than significant.
Operation

The FRM elements would not introduce any substantial recurring, or permanent sources of operational
noise. While routine maintenance activities would involve occasional use of maintenance equipment and

Construction activities associated with the proposed BVP Study features would include, but would not be
limited to, delivery of construction equipment and materials; operation of heavy construction equipment
for various construction activities (including excavation, earth moving, and grading); import and export of
soil; and construction worker trips to and from the various construction sites. Construction of the projects
that comprise the BVP Study features are expected to take place over a period of years, resulting in
temporary and localized construction noise at various locations as construction progresses. Construction
would occur within the Floodway and on top of, and adjacent to, the levees. Sensitive noise receptors
(mostly residential land uses, others could include churches, hotels, parks and schools) are located
proximate to the proposed BVP Study features, primarily along the western and southern sides of the
Floodway.
Construction activities are expected to result in a noise level of 85.5 dBA at 50 feet from the noise source.
One residence located at the intersection of Mexicana Road and Canada Drive is situated within 50 feet of
the proposed trail connection near the West Dallas Lake. At this distance, construction noise would be
more than 10 dBA higher than the ambient noise of 67 dBA, and would be temporary. However, as
discussed in Chapter 7, SCMs have been identified to reduce project noise effects. As would be the case
for the FRM elements, these measures would reduce noise levels to below the significance threshold.

Alternative 2 would construct a number of recreational enhancements within, and adjacent to, the
Floodway, resulting in an overall increase in ambient noise levels within the Floodway. For the most part,
the various recreational enhancements would encourage outdoor activities (e.g., walking, picnicking, bird
observation, etc.) that would not in themselves constitute substantial new sources of noise. The BVP
Study features include new roadways to provide vehicular access to the recreational facilities. Traffic on
these roadways would introduce a new source of noise to the ROI. The majority of new access roads
would be located within the Floodway; noise from traffic within the Floodway would be attenuated by the
levees, which would act as a noise barrier between the roads and residential areas to the south and west of
the Floodway. However, these residences would be directly exposed to traffic noise as vehicles approach
and pass over the levees en route to the Floodway. The volume of traffic accessing the recreational areas
would be distributed to various roads approaching the vehicular access points, and would be concentrated
during weekends, when demand for recreational facilities is highest (ITE 2012). During weekends, travel
demand on freeways and regional arterials associated with work commuting trips would be substantially
lower than on weekdays (Transportation Research Board 2010). Accordingly, ambient noise levels
associated with traffic would be lower on weekends than on weekdays.
Alternative 2 would also involve the construction of two amphitheaters within the Floodway. The West
Dallas Amphitheater would be located along the north side of the West Dallas Lake, to the west of the
Westmoreland Road bridge across the Floodway. The stage would face to the north and west, and the
venue would have a maximum capacity of 25,000 people. A concert in the amphitheater could generate
noise levels as high as 110 dBA (Caltrans 2012). Ambient noise at the nearest noise measurement (i.e.,
Sample Site 13) is 80 dBA. The nearest sensitive receptor (a church) is located approximately 3,500 feet
to the north and west of the West Dallas Amphitheater stage. Assuming that the 110 dBA noise level is

measured roughly 50 feet from the stage, and a noise attenuation of 6 dBA per doubling of distance,
concert noise would approach ambient levels at a distance of 1,600 feet12. Given that the sensitive
receptor is more than twice that distance from the West Dallas Amphitheater, no significant noise impact
would occur, given the significance criteria described in Section 4.15.1. For this reason, and because the
West Dallas Amphitheater would not be a permanent and continuous source of noise, the impact would be
less than significant.
The Central Island Amphitheater would be located along the western bank of the Urban Lake, to the south
of the IH-30 bridge across the Floodway. The Central Island Amphitheater would accommodate up to 100
people on a typical weekend and could accommodate up to 2,500 people under peak conditions. The stage
would be located on a small island within the Urban Lake, and seating areas would be provided within a
sloped area extending inland from the Urban Lake’s western bank (City of Dallas 2009b). Although
nearby uses are generally commercial and industrial, some residential land uses, including mid-rise
developments, are situated opposite the Central Island Amphitheater stage, beyond the levee. The nearest
residential uses, located along Greenbriar Lane, are approximately 1,500 feet from the Central Island
Amphitheater stage. Based on the assumptions described above, unobstructed noise levels at the
residences would be approximately 80 dBA, or 15 dBA higher than the nearest existing noise
measurement (i.e., Sample Site 8). However, noise is further attenuated by shielding, such as vegetation,
buildings and noise walls. Although the levees were not specifically built for noise abatement, they would
provide some measure of shielding between activities within the Floodway and nearby sensitive noise
receptors. Assuming that the levee would offer noise level reduction of 6 dBA or more, then the noise
level increase associated with concerts would be below the significance threshold of 10 dBA above
ambient conditions. Therefore, the noise impact of the Central Island Amphitheater would be less than
significant.

30

In addition to existing residences, new receptors would be introduced by the BVP Study features.
Specifically, new pedestrian and equestrian trails would be constructed near the amphitheaters, and within
the levees. Therefore, users of these facilities would not be shielded from noise emanating from the
amphitheaters by the levees. However, as discussed above, noise from concerts or events at the
amphitheaters would be infrequent, and would not constitute a permanent and continuous source of noise.
In addition, trail users are expected to be mobile; if they did not care for the amphitheater noise, they
would continue moving through the area, thus minimizing their exposure to noise.

31

4.15.3.3 IDP Improvements

32

The IDP improvements would necessitate the delivery of equipment and materials for the construction or
demolition; construction activities including excavation, earth moving, grading and the removal of
resulting debris; and trips to and from the various sites by contracted workers. The effects would be
localized to the various sites, within and adjacent to the Floodway and levees. Sensitive noise receptors
(mostly residential land uses; also including parks, schools, hotels and churches) are located on all sides
of the IDP Study Area, but those closest to the proposed improvements lie along the southwestern border
of the Floodway.

As would be the case for the FRM elements and BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features,
construction noise associated with the IDP improvements are expected to result in a noise level of 85.5
dBA at 50 feet from the noise source, and would be temporary in nature. However, as discussed in
Chapter 7, measures have been identified to reduce the Proposed Action’s noise impact to below the
significance threshold.
Operation

8

After construction, operational noise at most locations would be consistent with existing noise levels.
Noise generating activities are assumed to include occasional service to the pump stations and supply
delivery. Routine maintenance of the proposed improvements would not increase noise levels.

15

Additional noise may result from the operation of trash screens at new or improved pump stations. Trash
screen operation at the new Trinity-Portland Pumping Station would create a new source of noise. As
noted in Section 3.15, Noise (Chapter 3, Affected Environment), attenuation of this noise level would
occur at a rate of 6 dBA per doubling of distance. As noted above, the nearest sensitive noise receptor is
400 feet from the pump station. Given this relationship, the noise level at the nearest sensitive receptor
would be 62.0 dBA, or 4 dBA higher than the ambient level. This noise level would be less than 10 dBA
higher than ambient noise, and would not be considered significant.

4.15.3.4 Summary

17

29

Under Alternative 2, construction would include the use of various types of construction equipment and
machinery (e.g., excavators, bulldozers, compactors, cranes, trucks, etc.) over a period of several years.
The majority of proposed construction activities would occur in areas that are relatively far away or
shielded from identified sensitive noise receptors. Construction noise would be temporary, localized, and
subject to the City of Dallas noise ordinance. Impacts would be less than significant. Alternative 2 would
construct a number of recreational enhancements within and adjacent to the Floodway, resulting in an
overall increase in ambient noise levels within the Floodway. However, as discussed in Section 4.15.3.2,
noise increases from the operation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features would be less
than significant. Operational noise associated with FRM and IDP activities would be relatively minor,
temporary, and consistent with existing noise levels associated with on-going operations. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 2 would result in less than significant impacts to the noise environment.
This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as
detailed in Chapter 7.

4.15.3.5 Cumulative Impacts

31

As discussed in Section 2.9, Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Projects, there are multiple past,
present and reasonably foreseeable future projects within the overall Study Area. As indicated in Table
3.15-3, these projects are expected to result in increased ambient noise levels at 10 of the 20 noise
recording Sample Sites. Among the reasonably foreseeable future projects, the potential Trinity Parkway
would be a notable source of new traffic noise in the ROI, particularly within the Floodway.

construction-related cumulative noise impacts would be less than significant, provided that all projects
comply with applicable regulations (specifically, Section 4(b) of the NCA of 1972 and Dallas City Code:
Volume II, Chapter 30). As described above, Alternative 2’s operational impacts due to traffic and
amphitheater noise would be less than significant at existing sensitive noise receptors located primarily

along the south side of the West Levee, and at new sensitive noise receptors created within the Floodway
by the BVP Study features. A cumulative noise increase near sensitive receptors would occur at Sample
Site 6. This increase is due to the widening of the Hampton Road Bridge, which shifted traffic closer to
sensitive receptors. The BVP Study would provide public vehicular access to the Floodway at this
location (refer to Section 2.2.2.5, General Features). While Alternative 2 would contribute to an
incremental increase in noise due to traffic, the cumulative impact would be less than significant for the
following reasons:
1. Assuming that the Hampton Road Bridge project shifted traffic 20 feet closer to the nearest
sensitive receptor (located 180 feet to the west), the bridge project would result in a net noise
increase of less than 1 dBA13.
2. Traffic from Alternative 2 would access the Floodway from a total of 7 alternative access
“gateways.” Weekday daily traffic coming into the Floodway would be 2,969 ADT. The existing
ADT on Canada Drive to the west of Hampton Road is 3,300 ADT (refer to Table 3.12-5). A
doubling of ADT would increase noise by 3 dBA (TxDOT 2011). If 100% of all project traffic
were to use the Hampton Road access point (and 0% were to use the remaining 6 access points),
then project traffic would increase traffic noise by less than 3 dBA. This increase, taken together
with the increase described above, would be less than the significance threshold of 10 dBA.
Accordingly, no significant cumulative impact would occur.
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 in combination with the past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects would result in less than significant impacts to the noise environment.

27

Traffic noise from the Trinity Parkway project would increase noise levels at some locations within the
Dallas Floodway. As compared to existing conditions, noise levels would increase by between 1 dBA and
9 dBA, depending on the location. No net increase in noise is projected near the Hampton Road Bridge
project described above (FHWA 2014). Because traffic noise from the Trinity Parkway project, when
taken in combination with noise from Alternative 2 and other past, present, and reasonably-foreseeable
future projects, would not increase noise levels by more than 10 dBA above ambient levels, the potential

Under Alternative 3, the potential impacts to the noise environment from implementation of the proposed
FRM elements and IDP improvements would be the same as presented under Alternative 2, as there
would be no change in these components from Alternative 2 to Alternative 3. Therefore, refer to Sections
4.15.3.1 and 4.15.3.2 for a discussion of impacts to the noise environment associated with implementation
of the FRM elements and IDP improvements, respectively, under Alternative 3. Section 4.15.4.1 presents
the potential impacts to the noise environment from implementation of the BVP Study Ecosystem and
Recreation features associated with Alternative 3, which are slightly different from those presented under
Alternative 2.

Under Alternative 3, the proposed lakes would not be partially excavated by the Trinity Parkway project.
As a result, the number of dump trucks required to transport excess fill material would increase relative to
Alternative 2 (refer to Section 4.12, Transportation), resulting in an incremental increase in construction

noise from truck traffic. Under Alternative 3, there would be a relatively minor reallocation of land uses
within the Floodway, the majority of which would not introduce noise sources different from those
analyzed under Alternative 2. However, under Alternative 3, a third amphitheater (i.e., the Natural Lake
Amphitheater) would be constructed along the north side of the Natural Lake, to the east of the IH-35E
bridge crossings of the Floodway. This amphitheater would be substantially smaller than both the West
Dallas Amphitheater and the Central Island Amphitheater. The Natural Lake Amphitheater’s stage would
face to the north, and seating areas would be provided within a sloped area extending inland from the
Natural Lake. Ambient noise at the nearest noise measurement (i.e., Sample Site 10) is 75.4 dBA. Based
on the significance criteria described above, a significant impact could occur if a sensitive receptor were
to experience a noise level of 85.4 dBA or more. Based on the concert noise level and propagation
assumptions described above, and discounting the noise attenuation provided by the East Levee, a
sensitive receptor within 3,200 feet of the stage could experience a significant noise impact. However,
land uses located to the north of the Natural Lake Amphitheater are predominantly industrial and
commercial, and no sensitive receptors are located within 3,200 feet of the stage. Therefore, operational
impacts under Alternative 3 would be less than significant.

4.15.4.2 Summary

17

22

Impacts to the noise environment under Alternative 3 would be slightly higher, but not substantially
different, during the construction phase as compared to Alternative 2. Although Alternative 3 would
introduce one additional noise source (i.e., the Natural Lake Amphitheater), it would not result in a
significant noise impact. Therefore, implementation of Alternative 3 would result in less than significant
impacts to the noise environment. This conclusion assumes the incorporation of minimization, avoidance,
and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

23

4.15.4.3 Cumulative Impacts

24

The cumulative impacts of Alternative 3 would be the same as those described for Alternative 2, except
the additive noise impacts from the potential Trinity Parkway project within the Floodway would not
occur. These potentially significant noise impacts would not affect the noise environment within the
majority of the Floodway, depending on the ultimate location of the Trinity Parkway. Therefore,
implementation of Alternative 3 in combination with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
projects would result in less than significant impacts to the noise environment.

This chapter of the Dallas Floodway Project Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) presents a summary
and comparison of the potential impacts to environmental resources from implementation of the action
alternatives (Alternatives 2 and 3), as compared to the Future Without-Project Condition (Alternative 1).
Chapter 3 of this EIS provided a baseline for impact analysis by presenting an overview of the existing
conditions for each resource area. Chapter 4 discussed the impacts of both action alternatives, as well as
probable future conditions under each alternative (including taking no action as presented under
Alternative 1, Future Without-Project Conditions) in light of the other projects planned in and around the
Study Area. The preceding discussion of impacts included several categories where the impacts were
similar for the two action alternatives. In these cases, Alternative 3 deferred to Alternative 2 analysis. If
the action alternatives would have distinct impacts, then those differences have been clearly identified.

SUMMARY OF IMPACTS

Table 5-1 presents a summary of the anticipated impacts to each resource area from implementation of
Alternatives 2 or 3. Impacts are summarized for the action alternatives by themselves (“discrete”) as well
as in combination with the identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects (“cumulative”). As
shown in Table 5-1 and as noted in the resource-specific impact analysis, some resource areas have
different construction and operational impacts, whereas other resource areas have one impact period
presented (i.e., construction and operation as indicated by “both”). Impact summaries assumes the
incorporation of minimization, avoidance, and/or mitigation measures as detailed in Chapter 7.

COMPARISON OF ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Table 5-2 presents a summary of the features, construction period, and area of disturbance associated with
the action alternatives. Alternative 2 and 3 do differ in the features to be implemented, as Alternative 3
includes more trails and other features as compared to Alternative 2. Overall, Alternative 2 and
Alternative 3 would have similar construction schedules. Alternative 2 and 3 would disturb the same
amount of land, as both alternatives assume impacts to the entirety of the Floodway.

Elements

Alternative 2
Improved FRM.
Extensive ecosystem and recreational
improvements within the Floodway,
including 2 amphitheaters, 38 miles of
trails, 20 miles of roads (partially
restricted), and 78 acres of “flexible”
field space.
 Improvements to interior drainage.
 Construction planned 2015-2030.
 Construction schedule coordinated with

Construction planned 2015-2030.

2,413 acres

As shown in Table 5-2, the elements between Alternative 2 and Alternative 3 are very similar, and thus so
are the environmental impacts of the action alternatives.
Table 5-3 summarizes the key impacts to each resource area from implementation of each action
alternative and highlights the differences in impacts between the two action alternatives. In addition, the
anticipated Future Without-Project Condition (Alternative 1) for each resource area is summarized. For an
analysis of impacts associated with environmental justice, climate change, and floodplain management,
refer to Chapter 7.
Overall, impacts from the implementation of Alternative 2 as compared to Alternative 3 are largely
similar. In fact, land use, hazardous materials and wastes, cultural resources, and safety impacts would be
the same under both alternatives. Several resources would have slightly greater beneficial impacts under
Alternative 3, as Alternative 3 would not take advantage of construction efficiencies afforded by the
implementation of the potential Trinity Parkway project. Without the excavation of the lakes from the
construction of the potential Trinity Parkway project, greater impacts would occur due to increased
traffic, emissions, and hauling of materials. Thus, Alternative 3 would result in greater impacts to geology
and soils, transportation, air quality, and noise compared to Alternative 2. At the same time, under
Alternative 3, the Trinity Parkway would be built outside of the Floodway, allowing for slightly more
space for BVP Study features. This would result in slightly more recreational facilities and wetlands,
increasing the beneficial impacts to water quality, biological resources, recreational resources, and visual
resources under Alternative 3.

This chapter of the Dallas Floodway Project Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) presents a discussion
of other considerations required by NEPA. This EIS has been prepared in compliance with and in regard
to the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, Executive Orders (EOs), and Memoranda of
Agreement (MOA) pertaining to federal water resource projects. Table 6-1 and the following text provide
information regarding the current compliance status of the Proposed Action with the applicable
environmental laws, regulations, EOs, and MOA.
Before initiating construction, the project proponent would be required to ensure that project complies
with the applicable environmental laws, orders, and agreements. Discussion to support the required
compliance review is incorporated within the main body of this EIS and supporting appendices (specific
references are provided in Table 6-1). Additional summary discussions to address climate change and
environmental justice are included in Sections 6.6 and 6.7, respectively.

Proposed Action

Distinction between Federal Project and Non-Federal Project Element Compliance
Requirements

Project elements proposed as part of the Federally Recommended Plan have different compliance
requirements than do project elements that would be completed without federal sponsorship (i.e.,
elements implemented by the City of Dallas). For example, elements of the Proposed Action that would
be undertaken by the City of Dallas and that are not part of the Federally Recommended Plan would fall
under the jurisdiction of state agencies. The nonfederal project elements would be required to comply
with state and local regulations and requirements (as well as some federal requirements), and the project
proponent could be penalized for failure to comply. Elements of the Proposed Action undertaken by the
USACE would be required to comply with federal laws and regulations.
Because project elements that are not part of the Federally Recommended Plan would still be within a
USACE managed system, the project proponent would be required to satisfy the Clean Water Act (CWA)
Section 408 permitting process. Part of that process includes NEPA documentation and public comment;
this EIS satisfies Section 408 NEPA requirements. Before issuing a construction authorization, the
USACE would evaluate the project proponents’ construction proposal to ensure that all aspects would be
consistent with the project as described and analyzed in this EIS. If the construction proposal substantially
differs, then the project proponent would be required to prepare a supplemental NEPA and Section 408
analysis, or revise the construction proposal.

Chapter 6 Other Considerations Required by NEPA

This EIS has been prepared in accordance with NEPA, CEQ regulations
implementing NEPA, and USACE NEPA procedures. Public participation and review
are being conducted in compliance with NEPA.
The air quality analysis in this EIS concluded that proposed emissions under
Alternatives 2 and 3 would temporarily exceed the de minimis threshold for NOx.
Project implementation would require additional coordination with the TCEQ for
temporary exceedance authorization in order to comply with the CAA. Coordination
is ongoing; the TCEQ is currently revising the State Implementation Plan under the
CAA, and compliance with an approved SIP at the time of implementation is a
requirement of this EIS.
Permits under CWA Sections 401 and 404 would be required under Alternatives 2
and 3.
 A Draft Section 404(b)(1) Analysis of the Proposed Action has been included in
the EIS (refer to Appendix L). The TCEQ would review the EIS preferred
alternative in total for the purpose of issuing a State Water Quality Certificate
prior to the action proponent initiating construction of features involving
discharges into waters of the U.S. Appropriate environmental mitigation for
unavoidable impacts to water resources is currently being determined in
coordination with resource agencies.
 Before construction, a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) would be
developed and a Notice of Intent would be submitted to TCEQ, followed by
submittal of a Notice of Termination once the construction site has reached final
stabilization.
 Stormwater runoff during construction of infrastructure improvement aspects of
the Proposed Action and ongoing operational activities would be performed in
compliance with the Texas Construction General Permit. The proposed
demolition and construction activities would require preparation of a SWPPP and
use of Best Management Practices to limit potential erosion and runoff.
 Refer to 6.1.2.2 for a discussion of CWA permitting for federal and non-federal
project elements.

Contaminated soil or groundwater could be encountered during demolition or
constructed-related activities under Alternatives 2 and 3; however, as required by
CERCLA, a Health and Safety Plan and Soil Management Plan would be
implemented.
As stated in the Coordination Act Report (CAR), “due to the lack of suitable habitat
and the urbanized character of the project area, it is unlikely that any federally listed
threatened or endangered species would become established in any of the study area.
… [A]dverse effects to federally listed species are not anticipated with
implementation of any of the proposed alternatives.” (USFWS 2014). Prior to
construction, a review would be conducted to determine if additional new species or
impact information is available which warrants further consideration.
This EIS satisfies the requirements of EO 11988. An eight-step analysis as required
under USACE implementing guidelines regarding EO 11988 is found in Section 6.5.
As shown in that analysis, the Proposed Action would occur in the Floodway, there
are no practicable alternatives that are outside of the Floodway, the Proposed Action
would not increase flood risk or harm public safety, and the Proposed Action would
not trigger additional development within the floodplain. This EIS presents an
analysis of the foreseeable impacts associated with the Proposed Action, and not
additional alternatives have been developed in the course of analysis. No substantial
change to flood elevation is predicted under either action alternative.
The public notice requirements of this EO are satisfied in the course of the public
notice and outreach completed prior to and during the release and review period of
the Draft EIS.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would initially impact lower quality wetlands, but ultimately
either alternative would increase the functional quality of wetlands within the Study
Area.
This EIS considers disproportionate high and adverse effects on minority, lowincome, and child populations. The majority of the residential population within the
Study Area is more than 50% minority; substantial sections of the Study Area have
populations of more than 50% that live in poverty. The residential population was
active in the development of the Proposed Action, and the USACE and City of Dallas
have proactively continued to engage and educate members of the public regarding

the Proposed Action and its impacts.
This EIS considers disproportionate high and adverse effects on minority, lowincome, and child populations. Children make up nearly 25% of the Study Area
population. The Proposed Action is not expected to disproportionately adversely
impact children during construction or operation.
The TPWD control measures relating to invasive species are incorporated into
Alternatives 2 and 3. Neither alternative is likely to cause or promote the introduction
or spread of invasive species in the U.S. or elsewhere.
No tribal interest associated with the Proposed Action has been identified to date. The
Caddo Tribe has been included in all governmental notifications. As of the
publication of the Public Draft EIS, no response or comment from the Caddo Tribe
has been received.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would beneficially impact migratory birds by creating new and
better wetland and aquatic habitats for stopover and foraging.
The USFWS has prepared a Draft Fish and Wildlife CAR (refer to Appendix M). The
findings of the CAR conclude, “Both Alternatives 2 and 3 would result gains to fish
and wildlife resources and both would support the Dallas Floodway Project
objectives of flood protection, habitat creation/restoration, and public recreation. …
In summary, we believe the implementation of these recommended measures would
serve to minimize the adverse impacts associated with the proposed project.”
Alternatives 2 and 3 would beneficially impact migratory birds by creating new and
better wetland and aquatic habitats for stopover and foraging.
Coordination is ongoing among the THC, USACE, and City of Dallas to determine
mitigation needed for significant adverse impacts to the Dallas Floodway Historic
District.
This EIS considers noise impacts consistently with these statutes. Noise impacts
would occur during the construction of the Proposed Action. The special conservation
measures identified in Section 7.2 would minimize the adverse impacts of noise,
consistent with the requirements of these statutes.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would not result in significant hazardous materials related

Section 10 compliance with the Rivers and Harbors Act is completed jointly with the
CWA Section 404 permitting process as part of the Regional General Permit-12.
Alternatives 2 and 3 do not satisfy ROD or CDC criteria for the 100-year flood event.
The USACE and City of Dallas are in the process of determining if the Dallas
Floodway Project could qualify for a variance from the requirements without
sacrificing public safety. A variance would be required for either of the action
alternatives to be implemented. The USACE and City of Dallas would request a
variance from the TREIS ROD/CDC requirements, with the demonstration of there
being no impact to public safety.

The screening and selection process used in the development of this EIS has identified the least
environmentally damaging practicable alternative (LEDPA) consistent with the Section 404(b)(1)
guidelines; Alternative 2 is the LEDPA. The Proposed Action has been reviewed by the USACE (Fort
Worth District Regulatory Branch) and the LEDPA has been identified as consistent with CWA Section
404(b)(1) (refer to Section 7.1). A Draft Section 404(b)(1) Analysis has been prepared for the Proposed
Action (refer to Appendix L).
As part of the Section 404 and Section 408 review, the non-federal elements of the Proposed Action may
be authorized by the Regional General Permit 12 (RGP-12). Use of RGP-12 requires clearly identifying
waters of the U.S., impacts to waters of the U.S., and proposing mitigation for impacts to waters of the
U.S. Mitigation may be completed “in place” (e.g., as through development of the Corinth Wetlands), or
through the purchase of mitigation bank credits. If RGP-12 conditions are satisfied, then the CWA
Section 404 and Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10 process is complete as part of the completion of the
Section 408 process. A Section 404/Section 10 permit decision cannot be made until the Section 408
review process is completed. If the requirements of RGP-12 are not met, then an individual permit
authorization may be needed.

36

UNAVOIDABLE ADVERSE IMPACTS AND CONSIDERATIONS
THAT OFFSET THESE IMPACTS

Avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts to natural, cultural, and other environmental resources
were integrated into the action alternatives to the greatest extent possible and practicable. However,
adverse impacts may not always be completely avoided and/or minimized. Preliminary special
conservation measures and mitigation measures have been developed over the course of impact analysis.
These preliminary measures are identified within the impact analysis for each resource, and in Chapter 7,
Recommended Plan and Resource Impact Minimization Actions. As the NEPA process progresses,
additional mitigation measures may emerge and management actions may be altered based on
consultation with federal and state regulatory agencies and comments received from the public. The Final
EIS will be updated to reflect any changes; if additional mitigation measures are identified for the selected
alternative, then the EIS would be updated to include them. The ROD would also note any and all
mitigation requirements. These mitigation measures would be funded, and efforts to ensure their
successful completion or implementation are to be treated as compliance requirements.

6.3

April 2014

Similarly, non-federal projects involving discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters of the U.S.
require CWA Section 404 approval by the USACE. Specifically, Section 404(b)(1) of the CWA stipulates
that no discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., which include wetlands, shall be
permitted if there is a practicable alternative which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic
ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other significant environmental consequences.
Furthermore, an alternative is considered practicable if it is available and capable of being done after
taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes.

term beneficial uses of the environment. As discussed in Chapter 4, the action alternatives would result in
both short- and long-term environmental impacts.
Short-term uses of the environment associated with the Proposed Action would include construction
throughout the Floodway. Short-term effects from construction would include localized disruptions and
higher noise levels in some areas. The Trinity River channel water quality would likely be substantially
degraded during the construction period. Project-related construction activities would temporarily
increase air pollution emissions and noise in the immediate vicinity of the affected area(s). Depending
upon their location, humans and animals could experience increased levels of noise from construction. As
described in Section 4.15, noise levels could be as loud as 65.5 dBA. Noise from construction activities
would be short-term and would not be expected to result in permanent damage or long-term changes in
human experience, wildlife productivity, or habitat use.
Upon completion of construction, the productivity and use of the Floodway would improve. The
Proposed Action aims to improve ecosystem health and diversity within the Floodway. Thus, it is
anticipated that after the short-term adverse effects to the Floodway, the long-term productivity would be
substantially enhanced.

6.4
16

Public Draft EIS

IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENTS OF
RESOURCES

NEPA requires that environmental analysis include identification of “…any irreversible or irretrievable
commitments of resources that would be involved if the Proposed Action is implemented.” The term
“resources” (both renewable and nonrenewable) means the natural and cultural resources committed to, or
lost by, the action, as well as labor, funds, and materials committed to the action.
The permanent use and subsequent loss of non-renewable resources, such as oil, natural gas, and iron ore,
are considered irreversible because non-renewable resources cannot be replenished by natural means. An
action that causes a loss in the value of an affected resource, which cannot be restored (e.g., disturbance
of a cultural site), is considered an irretrievable commitment of resources. Similarly, the consumption of a
renewable resource that would be lost for a period of time is also considered an irretrievable commitment
of resources. Renewable natural resources include water, lumber, and soil, all of which can be replenished
by natural means within a reasonable timeframe.
Both action alternatives would involve irretrievable commitments of both non-renewable and renewable
resources. Demolition, construction, and renovation activities would expend fuel, construction materials,
and labor. The operation and maintenance of new and existing facilities required to implement the Dallas
Proposed Action would require energy to light the amenities and fuel to operate landscaping and
maintenance equipment.
Implementation of Alternative 2 or 3 would have an irreversible impact to grassland quality and/or
quantity. These grasslands consist primarily of nonnative Bermuda grasses, which are mown and
maintained within an urban environment. The value of these grasslands is not considered to be high due to
their low value as wildlife habitat, and therefore impacts to this resource would not be mitigated. In
addition, the Proposed Action would result in development of grasslands for the creation of higher quality
habitat with the Floodway.

FLOODPLAIN ACTIVITIES

EO 11988 requires federal agencies to avoid “to the extent possible, the long and short-term adverse
impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid direct and indirect
support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative.” EO 11988 states that to
accomplish this objective, “each agency shall provide leadership and shall take action to reduce the risk of
flood loss, to minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health, and welfare, and to restore and
preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains in carrying out its responsibilities” for:

Activities and development within the Floodway falls under multiple plans, policies, and requirements.
As discussed in Section 1.6, the City of Dallas participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, is
subject to consideration under the 1988 Upper Trinity River EIS Record of Decision (ROD) criteria, has
adopted the Trinity River Corridor Development Certificate (CDC) process, and enforces zoning
regulations for development in the floodplain.

Regional Development

The TREIS ROD H&H criteria were originally developed for the purpose of limiting potential increases
in flood risk in the Trinity River Corridor due to floodplain developments and has been applied to the
USACE Section 404 regulatory process. The criteria identified in the TREIS ROD are described and
analyzed for the Proposed Action in Sections 3.3 and 4.3. For project features that would be implemented
entirely by the City of Dallas, the CDC process applies. CDC criteria are nearly identical to the H&H
criteria established in the TREIS ROD with the only difference being that the CDC include the project
criterion “no increase in the 100-year flood water surface elevation and no significant increase in the
Standard Project Flood water surface elevation.”
The City of Dallas’ Balanced Vision Plan (BVP) Study and the Trinity River Corridor Comprehensive
Land Use Plan (TRCCLUP) jointly create a land use development regime that aims to revitalize the
Floodway and surrounding developed regions. Implementation of these plans, currently in progress,
involves maintaining most of the residential area while phasing out industrial use along the riverfront and
replacing it with neighborhood-scale commercial and residential development. The City of Dallas zoning
code has requirements for all construction and land use activities within the city limits, and is helping
bring new development in line with the goals of the TRCCLUP. Current zoning within the Floodway is
agricultural or public use.
As described in Section 1.6, the USACE evaluated the Dallas Floodway levee and Interior Drainage
Systems (IDS) in the Periodic Inspection No. 9, and the system as a whole was given an “unacceptable”
rating. Based the review, the USACE withdrew its letter of support for certification provided to FEMA. In
response, the City of Dallas prepared a Maintenance and Deficiency Correction Period (MDCP) plan that
identified 198 items. The City of Dallas has addressed all MDCP items and expects to have the levee
system repaired and certified prior to FEMA completing the revised maps. If FEMA accepts the City’s
certification package, FEMA could accredit the Dallas Floodway Levee System and its Flood Insurance
Rate Maps would again show the levees provide “protection” from the 1% Annual Exceedance
Probability (AEP), or 100-year event. FEMA is also remapping the floodplain on the interior side of the

Dallas expects to have the IDS improved to 100-year levels prior to the remapping.

To assist in complying with EO 11988, the USACE has issued guidance (USACE ER 1165-2-26), as it
pertains to planning, design, and construction of USACE projects. The Water Resources Council
Floodplain Management Guidelines for implementation of EO 11988, as referenced in USACE ER 11652-26, requires an eight-step process that agencies should carry out as part of their decision-making on
projects that have potential impacts to, or are sited within, the floodplain. The eight steps reflect the
decision-making process required in Section 2(a) of EO 11988. In order to demonstrate the Proposed
Action complies with EO 11988 and to address related public safety concerns, the following
documentation is provided. The existing floodplain management activities, including National Flood
Insurance Program related actions and requirements are described. This is followed by a response to the
eight-step process.

EO 11988 Eight Step Analysis

1. Determine if the proposed action is in the base floodplain.
Yes, the Proposed Action lies within the base floodplain.
The 1% AEP riverine floodplain in the project area is contained within the larger Dallas Floodway Levee
System. The 1% AEP interior drainage floodplain is located on the developed of the levee system. The
proposed flood risk management elements would be improvements to the existing Dallas Floodway
Project and IDS. The intended effects of the proposed flood risk management elements are to reduce both
economic damages and life safety risk associated with riverine flooding. The intended effects of the
proposed IDP improvements is to reduce flooding within the 1% ACE floodplain on the developed side of
the levee to reduce both economic damages and life safety risk associated with interior flooding. The
BVP Study ecosystem restoration and recreation enhancements are located within the Floodway. The
BVP Study ecosystem restoration activities are within the base floodplain and include features that would
improve the existing condition of the Trinity River riverine ecosystem and associated wetlands in the
Floodway. The BVP Study recreation enhancements would create a desirable destination for active
recreation, festivities, or nature observation in the Floodway.
2. If the action is in the base floodplain, identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to the action
or to location of the action in base floodplain.
Alternatives have been evaluated and not carried forward as they were either not
practicable or did not meet the goals of the Proposed Action.
The Proposed Action has multiple components including flood risk management, ecosystem restoration
and recreation enhancements. Practicable alternatives for FRM elements actions are described first,
followed by ecosystem restoration and recreation enhancements, respectively, and lastly, IDP
improvements.

Riverine and interior drainage flood risks are addressed by the Proposed Action. The proposed riverine
flood risk management plan is located within the base floodplain and includes modifications to existing
features of the Dallas Floodway Project. A flood risk analysis (as described in the USACE Feasibility
Report [USACE 2014]) concluded the existing levee system could overtop during a flooding event,
overtop and breach, or breach prior to overtopping due to seepage through the foundation of the levee
system. The levee system evaluation followed the “Principals and Guidelines for Water and Related Land

Resources,” dated March 1983, including evaluation of contributions to NED and reducing potential lifesafety risk. The NED analysis was only performed on the measures that address riverine flood risk. Plan
formulation and screening of plans described in the USACE’s Feasibility Report, Chapter 3, Sections 3.1
through 3.4 (USACE 2014) is the basis for concluding there are no practicable alternatives to locating the
proposed flood risk management plan in the base floodplain. The main Federal objective of reducing
flood risk cannot be achieved by alternatives outside the floodplain. All structural alternatives considered
were located in the base floodplain.
Practicable nonstructural alternatives like flood proofing, structure relocation, permanent evacuation, and
instrumentation were considered. Flood proofing, structure relocation and permanent evacuation were
removed from consideration to because they were not viable for broad application across the Study Area,
or were not economically viable. Other nonstructural measures including instrumentation and EAP
improvements are part of the Proposed Action.

As developed in the BVP Study, the City of Dallas aims to revitalize the Trinity River as a great natural
resource in order to create a unique public domain and achieve a model of environmental stewardship.
The BVP Study ecosystem and recreation features are located in the Dallas Floodway and are part of the
City’s overall vision for the Trinity River Corridor. Environmental restoration of the Trinity River is site
specific and requires actions in the floodplain. The actions are intended to be beneficial to the ecosystem
in nature.
The City of Dallas proposes land- and water-based recreation to be intertwined with the flood risk
management and ecosystem features. The City of Dallas’ recreation need is broader than being targeted in
the Dallas Floodway and land and water-based recreation can be accommodated at other locations (refer
to Section 3.7 for a discussion of recreation need). Even with the recreation component of the Proposed
Action being located elsewhere, the desire to locate recreational facilities in the Dallas Floodway would
continue to exist.

A number of alternatives were evaluated to determine the recommended improvements to the City’s IDS.
The alternatives are described in the City’s reports Interior Levee Drainage Study – East Levee Phase I
Report, Dallas, Texas; and West Levee Phase II Report (City of Dallas 2006 and 2009). The goal of the
alternatives are to reduce computed peak sump elevations for the 100-year, 24-hour event. Recent local
severe rainfall events resulting in widespread stormwater flooding and property damage have
demonstrated that improvements are needed to the IDS to reduce the risk of interior flooding.
The City’s IDP studies (City of Dallas 2006, 2009) considered decreasing the magnitude or altering the
timing of the inflow to the sump, increasing the discharge from the sump, or increasing the storage
capacity of the sump at each of the major pumping plants (including pump stations and associated
sumps). A large amount of detention would be required to decrease the magnitude or alter timing of
inflow and not considered feasible, as the region is highly developed. Increasing storage capacity had its
limitations due to high property values in the surrounding area to the sumps. Areas that were identified as
feasible for expansion ultimately would have little effect on storage capacity.
None of the alternatives considered eliminated the need for additional pump stations. The screening of
alternatives described in the City’s IDP reports is the basis for concluding there are no practicable
alternatives to locating the proposed interior drainage improvements in the base floodplain. The IDS
improvements did not require evaluation in accordance with the “Principals and Guidelines for Water and

The Proposed Action would occur in a highly urbanized area near downtown Dallas, Texas. Urban
development would remain on the protected side of the Dallas Floodway Levee System as it exists today
and would not enter the base floodplain because of the Proposed Action. The City of Dallas has
developed land use plans that aim to revitalize the Trinity River Corridor and riverfront regions; however,
any additional development within the Floodway would be counter to the long range TRCCLUP. The
changes to the existing urban development would remain on the protected side of the Dallas Floodway
Levee System as it exists today, and revitalization of these areas could happen with or without the
Proposed Action. Interior drainage system components are considered public utilities under the City of
Dallas zoning code. The proposed IDP projects would not change this land use designation and would not
induce development in the base floodplain. Some undeveloped areas outside of the Floodway are
expected to become developed over time; however, such development is being observed currently, and
could continue with or without the Proposed Action.
4. Identify the impacts in the base floodplain of the proposed action and any induced development.
Impacts within the base floodplain are presented in Chapter 4 of this EIS.
Impacts to the base floodplain are described for the Proposed Action. Impacts are described in terms of
the 1988 TREIS ROD criteria and the Trinity River CDC process. The alternatives were evaluated
whether they meet the ROD criteria in terms of valley storage and water surface rise. The alternatives did
not meet the ROD criteria; however, the potential negative impacts are insignificant and a variance to the
ROD is recommended.
Criteria for the CDC, a local requirement, are nearly identical to the H&H criteria established in the 1988
TREIS ROD. The City of Dallas would conduct the necessary CDC permit actions. As project designs
move toward a higher level of detail in the final design stages, continual H&H analysis will be performed
to ensure the highest reasonable level of compliance with the 1988 ROD criteria, and CDC criteria as
appropriate.
Impacts to fish and wildlife, cultural resources, recreation, and other floodplain resources are considered
in this EIS. Avoidance and minimization to existing floodplain resources has been considered in the
development of the Proposed Action. Most of the expected losses or impacts to existing floodplain
resources are expected to be compensated by the benefits provided by the Proposed Action. Mitigation
requirements for the Proposed Action are described in Section 7.2 of this EIS.
5. Describe measures available to minimize adverse impacts on the natural and beneficial
floodplain values.
Avoidance and minimization efforts for all resources are described in Section 7.2 of this
EIS.
Implementation of the Proposed Action would incorporate special conservation measures (SCMs)
designed to prevent, avoid, and/or minimize adverse impacts to resources. Mitigation measures are
proposed in some cases to counter impact that cannot be sufficiently avoided or minimized by an SCM.
Mitigation requirements are described in Section 7.2 of this EIS.

There are no remaining unmitigated adverse effects on natural and beneficial floodplain due to
implementation of the Proposed Action.
7. Finding and Explanation
EO 11988 requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, the long- and short-term adverse
impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of flood plains and to avoid direct and indirect
support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative. The Proposed Action does
not support direct or indirect floodplain development within the base floodplain. The City of Dallas and
USACE have lead public outreach efforts to local communities starting with the NEPA scoping meeting
and throughout the study process. To date, there is no known public opposition to the Proposed Action. A
public review of the draft Feasibility Report and EIS will be conducted and relevant public and agency
comments will be considered.
8. Critical Actions

24

The same results of the base floodplain apply considering the topics listed above to the 0.2% AEP (500year event). This flood event, like the base floodplain, remains contained in the Floodway, and would not
overtop the existing or proposed levee system improvements. A breach could occur prior to overtopping
due to seepage through the foundation of the levee system. Chapter 2 of the feasibility report discusses
annualized failure probabilities of failure modes for the levee system. A breach due to internal erosion
through the foundation of the levee system (PFM #7) has an estimate annualized probability of failure of
5.19E-06. This probability is estimated at a top of levee height, and the 500-year is approximately 4-5 feet
below the top of levee (USACE 2014).

25

6.5.3

26

Life safety and economic risks are reduced with the application of flood risk management and IDP
components of the Proposed Action; however, residual risk remains once construction is complete. In the
highly unlikely event that the East and West Levees were to overtop and experience a breach, the areas
behind the levees would experience significant economic damages to property and the potential for loss of
life. In the Feasibility Report, alternatives were evaluated based on their ability to contribute to economic
development and reduce life safety risk. The residual risk is determined to be tolerable because there was
no practicable way to reduce risk further.

Additional Public Safety Considerations

Because the area is urbanized, consequences of a highly unlikely levee failure would remain high. Flood
warning issuances vary among levee failure modes. For example, failure due to internal erosion of the
foundation would have less time than the warning time for overtopping with a subsequent breach.
Overtopping and subsequent breach has an estimated warning time of approximately 8 hours. The city has
an existing in-depth EAP that identifies elderly populations over 65, special needs households, and other
structures that should to be targeted for evacuation during flood events (refer to Sections 3.11 and 4.11 of
this EIS for the description of the EAP).
In the highly unlikely event of levee failure, the City of Dallas can anticipate to experience substantial
loss of life and economic harm. Economic risk and risk of loss of life are quantitatively estimated in the
BCRA.

CLIMATE CHANGE

The Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of the Effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas
Emissions issued by the CEQ on February 18, 2010 recommends incorporating impacts associated with
climate change as part of the standard cumulative impact analysis of all NEPA documents. The draft
guidance encourages agencies to determine which climate change impacts warrant consideration in their
analyses based on both the Proposed Action’s potential impact to climate changes and the potential
impact a changing climate may have on implementation of the Proposed Action.
The USEPA developed a “State of Knowledge” website subsequent to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change report. The USEPA affirms that while the contribution is uncertain, human activities
are substantially increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which, in turn, are contributing to a global
warming trend (USEPA 2013). The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established
by President George H. Bush in 1989, and later mandated by congress as part of the Global Change
Research Act of 1990. The USGCRP is a working group coordinating the efforts of 13 different federal
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Department of
Defense, and the Department of Energy. The USGCRP releases regular reports presenting the most
current scientific consensus of predicted changes associated with global climate change; the 2009 report is
the most recent complete report. In 2013, the USGCRP issued a draft update of the 2009 report, Global
Climate Change Impacts in the US. These reports summarize the science of climate change and the
impacts of climate change on the U.S., now and in the future, and are recommended by the CEQ 2010
draft guidance as the primary sources for framing climate change discussions.

30

While the 2009 and 2013 USGCRP reports acknowledge difficulty in specifying climate change impacts,
there are several resource areas identified as being altered by climate change and human impacts. The
report identifies fresh water in the U.S. as being stressed, and that climate change exacerbates that stress.
Predictably, with increased pressure on water sources, the report predicts challenges to agriculture in the
U.S., as water stress, weather extremes, pests and disease impede agricultural production. Extreme
weather patterns have been linked to climate change, and the report predicts correlated increased risk to
human health via heat and cold stress, as well as increase exposure risk to disease vectors (USGCRP
2013).

Regional Predictions

Existing Conditions

The USGCRP looks at potential impacts of climate change globally, nationally, regionally, and by
resource (e.g., water resources, ecosystems, human health). The City of Dallas is within the Great Plains
region of analysis. The Great Plains region has already seen evidence of climate change in the form of
rising temperatures that are leading to increased demand for water and energy and impacts on agricultural
practices. Over the last few decades, the Great Plains have seen fewer cold days and more hot days, as
well as an overall increase in total precipitation. The decrease in the cold days has resulted in an overall
shortening of the frost-free season by one to two weeks. Within this region, there was an increase in
average temperatures 1.5°F from a 1960-1970 baseline to the year 2000 (USGCRP 2013).

Since 1991, the amount of rain falling in very heavy precipitation events in the Great Plains has increased
by 21% from 1901-1960 (USGCRP 2013). From 1971-2011, the City of Dallas received an average of
34.9 inches of rainfall annually, an 8.4% increase over the annual rainfall average of the 40 previous years
(1930-1970) (National Weather Service 2012).

11

In addition to more extreme rainfall, extreme heat events have also been increasing. Most of the increases
of heat wave severity in the U.S. are likely due to human activity, with a detectable human influence in
recent heat waves in the southern Great Plains (USGCRP 2013). In particular, in 2011, the State of Texas
experienced a heat wave and drought. The growing season and summer were both the hottest and driest
on record. Extreme heat events in Texas have also been occurring substantially more frequently. Using
historical data, an extreme heat event that was predicted to have a 100-year recurrence (i.e., a 1% AEP) in
1964 would have only 5- to 6- year recurrence (i.e., a 20% to 17% AEP) in 2008 (Rupp et al. 2011).

The USGCRP looks to two potential future conditions as part of its predictive modeling process. Under
conditions of lower greenhouse gas emissions, the average temperature in the Great Plains region may
increase as much as 4°F by 2020, 6°F by 2050, and 8°F by 2090 from averages observed in 2000. Under
conditions of higher continuous greenhouse gas emissions, the potential increase is greater in the longterm, and may be as much as 13.5°F by 2090. Projected changes in long-term climate predict more
frequent extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy rainfall (USGCRP 2013). These varying
conditions shape the resource-level discussion presented here.

Despite the documented increase in precipitation since 1991, current simulations predict decreasing
rainfall for the region into the future. As climate change continues to influence weather patterns, current
modeling predicts that the average spring rainfall in the Dallas area may decrease between 5% (low
emissions scenario) and 15% (high emissions scenario) by 2070-2090. At the same time, the precipitation
that does fall is predicted to occur in more frequent heavy rainfall events, and thus the intensity of
flooding is projected to increase. The increase in frequency of extreme heat events is also likely to
continue; the temperatures observed during extreme events are projected to increase by 4°F to 15°F,
depending on the emissions scenario used for predictive modeling (USGCRP 2013). This change in
precipitation and heat would likely alter agricultural and ecosystem conditions.
The combined increased risk of drought and flooding may indicate a decrease in overall water quality for
the Trinity River. Increased frequency and duration of droughts, and associated low water levels, increase
nutrient concentrations and residence times in streams, have the potential to increase the likelihood of
harmful algal blooms and low oxygen conditions.

As climate change is seen in increased temperatures and drier conditions in the Dallas area, aquatic, open
water, and emergent wetland habitats are expected to convert to drier habitats, such as bottomland
hardwoods and grasslands (USFWS 2014). By the year 2060, 1% of the emergent wetlands are expected
to convert to grassland due to siltation and drier conditions from climate change; 5% of the aquatic
riverine habitat is expected to be converted to bottomland hardwoods, primarily due to warmer and drier
conditions from climate change; and 8% of open water is expected to convert to bottomland hardwoods
(USFWS 2014). Meanwhile, grassland and plains birds could experience significant shifts and reductions
in their ranges (USGCRP 2013).

As temperatures increase in the current century, optimal zones for growing crops will shift. Pests that
were historically unable to survive in cooler areas may spread northward. Milder winters and earlier
springs also may encourage greater numbers of pest species. Rising carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere may increase growth of both crop and weeds species. In some areas, water scarcity may
reduce or even eliminate certain types of agricultural production. Similarly, changes in temperature and
precipitation affect the composition and diversity of native animals and plants through altering their
breeding patterns, water and food supply, and habitat availability. In a changing climate, populations of
some pests such as red fire ants and rodents, better adapted to a warmer climate, are projected to increase
(USGCRP 2013).

Changes in temperature are also correlated with changes in energy demands. Energy demands for the City
of Dallas associated with heating needs are expected to decrease by between 27% (low emissions
scenario) and 40% (high emissions scenario) by 2080-2099. However, the predicted temperature change
anticipates more warm days, and therefore increased cooling demands. In Dallas, energy demands
associated with cooling needs are expected to increase by between 28% (low emissions scenario), and
73% (high emissions scenario) by 2080-2099. At the same time, power sources may become less
dependable. The portion of U.S. electric grid disturbances caused by weather-related phenomena has
more than tripled from about 20% in the early 1990s to about 65% in recent years. The frequency of
disturbance caused by extreme weather has increased tenfold since 1992 (USGCRP 2013).
The potential for increased risk of power loss, combined with increased temperatures has the potential to
have substantial impacts on public health. Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S.
More than 3,400 deaths between 1999 and 2003 were reported as resulting from exposure to excessive
heat. Analyses suggest that currently rare extreme heat waves will become much more common in the
future. At the same time, the U.S. population is aging, and older people are more vulnerable to hot
weather and heat waves. Diabetics are also at greater risk of heat-related death, and the prevalence of
obesity and diabetes is increasing (USGCRP 2013).
In an effort to help minimize potential adverse impacts from climate change, the City of Dallas has a
series of programs designed to minimize GHGs and favor more sustainable lifestyle choices. In 2006, the
Mayor of Dallas signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Change Agreement, which is a commitment by the
mayors around the country to reduce GHG emissions in their own cities and communities to 7% below
1990 levels by the year 2012 through improved efficiency in government fleets, improved transit systems,
and other emissions reduction measures (Green Dallas 2008).

37

In 2010, the estimated GHG emissions from the City of Dallas operations were 402,560 metric tons
(Green Dallas 2012). This amount is approximately 33% less than 1990 GHG emissions (Green Dallas
2012). The City of Dallas has already attained the 7% GHG emissions reduction for the period between
1990 and 2012. The main factors that may have helped Dallas obtain this goal are (1) the purchase of
renewable energy sources (at 40%) for the City’s electricity consumption, and (2) the energy efficiency
improvements in the power generation sector (Green Dallas 2012).

The potential effects of proposed GHG emissions are by nature global and cumulative impacts, as
individual sources of GHG emissions are not large enough to have an appreciable effect on climate
change. Therefore, an appreciable impact on global climate change would only occur when proposed
GHG emissions combine with GHG emissions from other man-made activities on a global scale.
Currently, there are no formally adopted or published NEPA thresholds of significance for GHG
emissions stemming from proposed actions. Formulating such thresholds is problematic, as it is difficult
to determine what level of proposed emissions would substantially contribute to global climate change.
Nonetheless, the project emissions of the GHG compounds: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
nitrous oxide (N2O) have been quantified to the extent feasible in Appendix N. GHG emissions are
quantified in terms of “CO2 equivalence” (CO2e), that is the degree to which a compound may function as
a GHG as compared to CO2. The emissions from the year of greatest anticipated construction activity,
2020, have been compared to the 2012 U.S. GHG Emission Inventory (USEPA 2014). The estimated
GHG emissions from the 2020 construction activities associated with Alternative 2 represent less than one
thousandth of 1% of the GHG emissions generated by the U.S. in 2012 (Table 6-2). GHG emissions for
other construction years during the period of implementation of Alternative 2 would be lower than for the
year 2020.

Federal agencies are addressing and will continue to address emissions of GHGs on a national scale by
reductions mandated in federal laws and EOs. As previously mentioned, the City of Dallas has already
attained the federally mandated 7% GHG emissions reduction for the period between 1990 and 2012, and
is proactively addressing GHG emissions within the region.

The primary drivers of the Dallas Floodway Project are to increase FRM, enhance the ecosystem, and
improve recreational amenities available in the City of Dallas. The improvements to the levee system are
designed to contain the future predicted Standard Project Flood (SPF) of 277,000 cubic feet per second.
Current predictions anticipate that the frequency and intensity of flooding in the southern Great Plains
region, including Dallas, are expected to increase. If these projections are validated as more data come
available, it is possible that the SPF elevations may be higher than currently anticipated, and additional
FRM may be required. In addition, more frequent and intense flooding below the SPF may also
substantially increase the operations and management cost to maintain the Floodway and amenities
between flood events. Climate change predictions do not currently provide sufficient granularity to design
the FRM elements to completely address any increase in risk. Instead, the USACE and City of Dallas
would monitor climate change predictions and adaptively manage FRM within the risk area as new data
become available.

Climate change is also expected to increase drought frequency and severity in the southern Great Plains.
As many of the ecosystem and recreation features proposed are aquatic in nature (e.g., the proposed lakes
and extensive wetland construction), water scarcity may degrade the values of these amenities. The Urban
and Natural Lakes complex is proposed to be supplied with wastewater from the Central Wastewater
Treatment Plant, which treats wastewater from the City of Dallas. No major reduction programs in water
usage have been proposed for the City of Dallas, and the population is expected to increase in the coming
decades (refer to Section 3.9 of this EIS). Therefore, it is likely that this water supply would continue to
be available. At the same time, those features that would be supported via groundwater, river flow, or
precipitation may be harder to maintain.
The 2014 Planning Aid Report (USFWS 2014) considered climate change in estimating habitat changes
into the future. As summarized in Sections 3.5 and 4.5 of this EIS, the predicted decrease in precipitation
may result in a loss of emergent wetlands. Wetlands designated as mitigation wetlands may require
additional maintenance and monitoring to continue to function as required. Other emergent wetlands in
the Study Area may contract over time due to lack of water.
An additional effect of creating more aquatic habitat within the Study Area is the potential for increased
pest and disease-vector habitat. The increased amount of habitat could exacerbate the predicted increased
public health risk from vector-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus and various tick-born conditions
that already frequent Texas. In addition, emergent diseases such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever may also
pose a health risk compounded by increased habitat. Thus far, lifestyles (notably well-sealed buildings
with air filtration systems) in Texas mitigate exposure to vector born disease (Reiter et al. 2003). The City
of Dallas mosquito control program also functions to keep disease vector populations low. However, an
anticipated result of the Proposed Action is to significantly increase the number of people participating in
outdoor recreation, adjacent to newly constructed high quality habitat. Thus, it is possible that climate
change will contribute to a public health risk facilitated by the Proposed Action.

The following impact analysis for environmental justice is based on the combination of impact analyses
from other resource areas covered in this EIS. Resource areas that were determined to potentially impact
populations and/or communities include Recreational Resources, Visual Resources, Socioeconomics,
Safety, Transportation, Utilities, Air Quality, and Noise. For a detailed discussion of the overall impacts
to each resource area, refer to Chapter 4 of this EIS.

The resource impacts to environmental justice (i.e., impacts potentially felt disproportionately by lowincome, minority, and/or child populations) from implementation of the Proposed Action are summarized
in Table 6-4. The environmental justice impacts of Alternative 2 and Alternative 3 are virtually identical,
and thus, Table 6-4 presents potential impacts from the Proposed Action implemented under either action
alternative. Alternative 3, as compared to Alternative 2, would create slightly more recreation features
(refer to Table 2-3). These additional improvements would be minor and impacts related to environmental
justice would be similar to those described for Alternative 2. Additionally, under Alternative 3, there
would be slightly more construction activity than under Alternative 2. As such, there would be a slightly
higher level of construction-related impacts to environmental justice. Any differences would be minimal
and thus the results presented under Alternative 2 are valid for Alternative 3 as well. SCMs, as identified
in Chapter 7, would be implemented.

Large construction projects have been occurring within the ROI the past several years (refer to Section
2.9.2.1), with each of these projects having localized impacts on residents. From a cumulative
perspective, impacts of construction activity in the ROI are not temporary; these impacts have been a
constant condition. Impacts of construction on communities in the ROI are disproportionate in a
cumulative context; no other area of Dallas has endured the impacts of multiple construction projects over
recent years. In addition, the large infrastructure projects that have been constructed within the ROI
(particularly the Hampton Bridge and the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge) do not specifically benefit residents
of the ROI; the benefits of these projects are enjoyed by all Dallas residents and visitors to Dallas.
Alternative 2 reinforces the trend that residents of the ROI must disproportionately endure the impacts of
construction of projects that would not specifically benefit them.

Future projects in the ROI (refer to Section 2.9.2.2) would generate additional cumulative impacts, in
terms of length of time and magnitude of impacts, that would be additive to the impacts associated with
Alternative 2. In particular, the Trinity Parkway EIS identifies adverse impacts to environmental justice.
Adverse impacts to environmental justice identified in the Trinity Parkway EIS include disproportionate
effects on low-income and minority populations such as relocations and displacements, noise impacts,
visual impacts, and transportation impacts. Displacements would be due to acquisition of property,
increased traffic would be due to new access roads located in residential areas, with noise and visual
impacts stemming from construction activities (FHWA 2014).

Public Draft EIS

April 2014

Impacts to environmental justice populations related to recreation, visual resources, utilities, air quality,
and noise would be adverse during construction, in the near-term, but have either no adverse impact or a
beneficial impact during operation and in the longer term. The “near-term” however is a fairly extensive
period of time – at least 10 years – and adverse impacts over this period would not seem temporary to
affected populations, especially to children who would be dealing with stresses (and other potential health
issues associated with the project) for the bulk of their childhood.

15

From a cumulative perspective, there would be potential for a continuation of gentrification in
environmental justice population areas given. The potential exists for amenities to improve through
construction, and when construction is finished, for the ROI to become higher-income and less-minority
via processes that are out of the control of current low-income and minority residents of the ROI. Noting
this potential, the BVP incorporates 20 years of coordination with the public – with special attention paid
to the low income and minority neighborhoods. Based on the extensive communication with the affected
residential communities, the recreational amenities proposed directly reflect the requests of the
communities. The USACE has similarly lead public outreach efforts to target these residential
communities, and continues to receive public feedback.

The BVP Study is the result of more than two decades of outreach and collaboration by the City of Dallas
with the residential population of the Study Area, which is more than 50% minority for the majority of the
Study Area. More recently, the USACE has taken part in an extensive campaign to engage and educate
residents of the Study Area regarding on-going and proposed Floodway projects. Table 6-5 summarizes
notable public outreach efforts conducted by the USACE in 2013.

PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE AND THE LEAST
ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING PRACTICABLE
ALTERNATIVE

As discussed in Chapter 1, Section 5141 of the Water Resource Development Act (WRDA) of 2007
directs the USACE to review the City of Dallas Balanced Vision Plan (BVP) Study, as prepared and
amended in 2004, to determine if the project is “technically sound” and “environmentally acceptable.”
This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), paired with the Feasibility Report prepared by the USACE
(USACE 2014), evaluates the environmental acceptability of the BVP Study and its associated features.
The USACE has not developed alternatives to the 2004 BVP Study, as doing so would be outside of the
scope of the 2007 WRDA authorization. At the same time, the Trinity Parkway, an element proposed
separately from, but incorporated in the BVP Study, is being developed and refined. The City of Dallas,
recognizing that various alternatives for the Parkway are in development, has created alternative
alignments of the BVP Study features, and those alternatives are captured by Alternative 2 and 3 in this
EIS. The BVP Study and Internal Drainage Plan (IDP) improvements were determined to have the
potential to be technically sound following proper design and construction (USACE 2014).
In identifying a preferred alternative, the USACE reviewed trends in project planning and development in
the City of Dallas. Specifically, at the time of this writing (April 2014), the ongoing environmental review
of the potential Trinity Parkway project does not conclusively suggest that this facility would not be
constructed in the Dallas Floodway as proposed. As this EIS has determined the Proposed Action would
be environmentally acceptable, the USACE must review the action alternatives to determine which is the
least environmentally damaging practicable alternative (LEDPA).
The identification of an environmentally preferable alternative is required under the Council on
Environmental Quality regulation 40 CFR 1505.2. Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), activities
requiring a CWA Section 404 permit must select the LEDPA (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR]
230.10(a)). Thus, for actions authorized under the CWA permitting procedures, the LEDPA,
environmentally preferable alternative, and the preferred alternative are the same.
Implementation of the action alternatives would result in the same impacts for the flood risk management
(FRM) elements and IDP improvements. The difference between the two action alternatives is due to
variation in the BVP Study features under each alternative. This difference is driven by whether or not a
reasonably foreseeable project (i.e., the potential Trinity Parkway project) would be located within the
Floodway; the ultimate alignment of the potential Trinity Parkway project would be determined by a
separate agency (i.e., Texas Department of Transportation [TxDOT]). Both action alternatives would
result in direct impacts (excavation and fill) to wetlands and other waters of the U.S. but would result in
an overall increase in the acreage and functionality of wetlands and other waters of the U.S. within the
Floodway. Impacts to the aquatic ecosystem and water quality would be avoided and minimized to the
greatest extent possible through implementation of special conservation measures (refer to Section 7.2).
As discussed in Section 4.3, the project has been designed so that impacts to the hydrology and hydraulics
of the Trinity River would be less than significant. However, as summarized in Chapter 5, impacts to

certain resource areas under Alternative 3 would be greater than would occur under Alternative 2.
Therefore, implementation of Alternative 2 represents the LEDPA for the Proposed Action.
The USACE and the City of Dallas have tentatively identified Alternative 2 as the Preferred Alternative.
The Preferred Alternative may be further developed and refined as the result of public and agency input
obtained through the ongoing public involvement process described in Section 1.7.2, Public Involvement.

7.2

Public Draft EIS

SPECIAL CONSERVATION AND MITIGATION MEASURES

Implementation of the Preferred Alternative would incorporate special conservation measures (SCMs)
designed to prevent and/or minimize adverse impacts to resources. SCMs may be resource specific, or
may be procedural and apply to several different resources. In addition, mitigation measures may also be
applied to counter impact that cannot be sufficiently avoided or minimized by an SCM.
Planning efforts for USACE projects ensure that project-related adverse environmental impacts (i.e.,
impacts on fish and wildlife resources) have been avoided or minimized to the extent practicable, and that
remaining unavoidable significant adverse impacts are compensated to the extent justified. As part of
project development, implementation of either Alternative 2 or 3 would include development of a
mitigation plan, as required under Engineering Regulation 1105-2-100 (the USACE Planning Guidance
Notebook) and Section 2036(a) of WRDA 2007. The mitigation plan would comply with the mitigation
standards and policies of the regulatory programs administered by the USACE and would require the
following specific mitigation plan components:

monitoring until successful;
criteria for determining ecological success;
a description of available lands for mitigation and the basis for the determination of availability;
the development of contingency plans (i.e., adaptive management);
identification of the entity responsible for monitoring; and
establishment of a consultation process with appropriate federal and state agencies in determining
the success of mitigation.

29

Section 7.2.1 presents a description of each recommended SCMs that would be incorporated with
implementation of the Preferred Alternative; Section 7.2.2 presents proposed mitigation and monitoring
measures (MM). Subsequent resources will refer back to the measure by code if it applies as well. Section
7.2.3 presents a table (Table 7-1) summarizing which resource area impacts are being avoided,
minimized, or mitigated by each of the presented measures.

SCMs are organized according to the stage of the project in which they would be implemented: planning

to which it applies.

As project elements are designed and submitted for construction, the project sponsor shall
ensure that the proposed project feature would be a single and complete project that is
within the impacts discussed within this EIS (e.g., impacts to valley storage are no greater
than those discussed in Section 4.3) and incorporates any ecosystem enhancement
requirements incurred. For example, the project sponsor may not propose to begin
construction on a project feature that would impact wetlands without also including equal
or greater wetland restoration/enhancement as part of the same proposal. A project
sponsor may not defer restoration that may balance impacts to a later project element.

Before construction of any action within the Floodway, the proponent shall submit design
plans to the USACE and the City of Dallas Planning Department for review, consistent
with the currently applicable Dallas Development Guide (City of Dallas 2006). At the

within a designated Floodway. These may include, but are not limited to, requirements of
the USACE, the City of Dallas, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
(TCEQ), and the TxDOT. Final river terrace designs would be evaluated for stability and
sustainability using geotechnical, hydraulic, and sediment transport analyses. Terrace
vegetation would be established in a manner that does not compromise terrace function or
stability.

PD-10

Any refinements to existing designs would maintain the geomorphic terrace elevations
designed in relation to water surface elevations at effective flow frequencies, with stable
slopes given local hydraulic, geotechnical, and vegetation conditions, and would provide
adequate terrace drainage.

PD-11

Bank treatments shall be designed based on local hydraulic conditions, maximum shear
stresses during high flows, local geotechnical conditions, proximity to other park
features, and existing or proposed vegetation. Typical treatments shall be designed for
river reaches with similar conditions and would extend the length of a given reach.
Transitions between different bank treatments shall be designed to withstand hydraulic
discontinuities and changes in shear stress. All bank treatments would be appropriately
“keyed in” at the channel invert elevation and the top of bank elevation to prevent
unraveling of the treatment. Materials and construction methods for all bank treatments
shall be specified to ensure sustainability over the necessary design life for each
treatment. Only native North Texas riparian species would be planted in riparian areas.

a. Hydrology: The wetland would be designed to achieve the minimum requirement to meet
the hydrology criteria as defined in the 1987 Wetland Delineation Manual and the Great
Plains Regional Supplement (USACE 2010b). This would be achieved through either (1)
locating the wetland at an elevation where it would receive sufficient
inundation/saturation from the Trinity River or (2) designing the wetland as a
depressional basin that would receive stormwater runoff from surrounding areas,
overbank flows from the Trinity River and drainage sumps, or water from other artificial
sources (e.g., pumped from the created lakes or Trinity River).

The final design of Floodway features would conform to all USACE regulations and
guidelines for construction in the Floodway.

PD-14

The river channel relocation design shall have a geomorphically stable channel pattern
and geometry that avoids encroaching within 200 feet of the toe of the levee. The channel
pattern shall be offset from all sensitive floodplain park features by a distance sufficient
to allow channel adjustments to occur without impacting park features over the life of the
project. Where offset from park features is not possible, channel geometry shall be
strengthened, using bioengineering approaches that incorporate native vegetation and
other natural materials.

PD-15

Components of the Preferred Alternative shall be designed such that foundations and
structural supports provide for adequate anchoring of design components during flood
events.

PD-16

Trail and road bridges within the Floodway shall be designed so that they present as thin
and unobtrusive profile as possible to minimize potential flood impacts.

PD-17

Shade structures and the Group Pavilion shall be designed so that no portion of the
canopy structure would be below the 100-year flood extent.

PD-18

The project sponsor shall initiate consultation with the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (TPWD) early in the design process to discuss potential impacts to aquatic
resources and specifically to state-listed mussels. If appropriate, the project sponsor
would prepare a recovery plan for any impact to state-listed species anticipated by a
project feature.

PD-19

The final project design shall consider that periodic flooding of the entire Floodway can
last for days or weeks at a time. Thus, Preferred Alternative features shall be designed to
be able to sustain the force of powerful floodwaters, while also requiring minimum
maintenance and cleanup after floodwaters recede. Design may incorporate the use of
features that may be removed when a flood is anticipated, such as floating barges or
trailer structures that could be removed within an 8-hour period. Site features such as
benches, trash cans, and light poles shall be anchored in place and designed to withstand
floodwaters. The final project design shall seek to create a landscape that minimizes
flood-related maintenance and repair.

PD-20

Buoy and lane marking structures, such as floating wetlands in the lakes shall be
designed to incorporate measures to hold the plant communities together during flood
events. The anchorage cables shall have sufficient slack to allow the floating features to

b. Vegetation: The design would utilize a mixture of agency recommended native plants, as
well as other native plants that are more common early successional species and easy to
establish vegetative cover, to help ensure plant survival.
c. Soils: The project design would include identification of soils that would be collected
from wetland impact locations and then spread on the enhanced/restored areas. By using
soils from the impact sites, there would be the added benefit of an incredible seed source
as well as organic material. The soils to be used for enhancement/restoration would be
tested for nutrient, organics, and percolation and if they do not meet the minimum
standards, additional organics/soil amendments/ripping would be added/completed until
the standard is met.

PRE-1

In defining the construction extents for each element, the construction contractor would
minimize the amount of disturbed ground area at any given time, and minimize ground
disturbing activities in proximity to residential areas and waters of the U.S.

PRE-2

The perimeter of all areas to be disturbed during construction activities shall be clearly
demarcated using flagging or temporary construction fencing, and no disturbance outside
the demarcated perimeter would be authorized. All access routes into and out of the
proposed disturbance area shall be flagged, and no construction travel outside those
boundaries shall be authorized. When available, areas already disturbed by past activities
or those that would be used later in the construction period would be used for staging,
parking, and equipment storage.

PRE-3

Erosion control measures and appropriate best management practices (BMPs), as
required and developed through the SWPPP and engineering designs and erosion control
plan (refer to PD-7), would be implemented before, during, and after construction
activities in accordance with the Texas Construction General Permit TXR150000.

PRE-4

Staging areas shall be established for the storage of equipment and materials.
Construction equipment shall be stored within a staging area at the end of each working
day to minimize trip generation to and from the site. The removal of any trees or potential
ground nesting areas shall comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). BMPs
shall also be implemented to prevent soil erosion at the staging areas.

PRE-5

For each distinct project element, a Field Contact Representative shall be present during
the beginning of the construction period to provide all construction personnel with an
environmental education briefing that would include, but not be limited to, the following:
 information regarding sensitive species and habitats with the potential to occur in the
area,
 impacts that may occur,
 conservation measures being implemented,
 construction worker responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act, and
 avoidance and reporting procedures.

PRE-6

If proposed construction activities occur during the avian breeding season (February 15
through August 31), construction activities shall comply with the MBTA to avoid
impacts to nesting migratory birds within the region of influence. Specifically, a biologist
shall check the proposed construction sites, including laydown areas, for nests (in trees,
shrubs, and on the ground) before the construction phase has begun. If the biologist finds
an active nest, construction workers would not directly or indirectly disturb the nest or
adjacent areas until the biologist determines the nest is no longer active.

PRE-7

Archaeological testing shall be conducted prior to construction. Although the potential
for archaeological sites is generally low in the proposed borrow bit and construction
areas, deeply buried deposits may exist. Should significant sites be discovered, mitigation
would be required.

proposed construction activities, work would immediately stop, and the City of Dallas
would immediately notify the USACE and Texas Historical Commission, and consult
with appropriate federally recognized Tribe(s) to determine appropriate treatment
measures in agreement with 36 CFR Part 800.13. If then determined necessary, a cultural
resources monitor would be present during additional construction in the discovery area.

C-11

In the event that excavated material contains hazardous substances, a landfill or treatment
facility that meets the relevant state and federal regulatory standards for waste treatment
and disposal would be used.

C-12

The construction contractor shall closely monitor weather reports throughout the Upper
Trinity River watershed. If significant rain events are predicted within the watershed, the
contractor would remove all equipment from the Floodway to the developed sides of the
levees to the greatest extent practicable. Construction shall not occur during rain events,
and construction personnel shall have frequent communication with the City of Dallas
Flood Control Division to assess the safety of operating within the Floodway.

C-13

As determined in the Traffic Control Plan prepared per SCM PD-31, contractors shall be
responsible for providing and maintaining all barricades, warning signs, flashing lights
and traffic control devices in conformance with Part VI of the Texas Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (TxDOT 2012). Closure of traffic lanes and sidewalks along any
public roadway shall be restricted to the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. workdays to
minimize the impact on traffic flows, unless otherwise approved by the City of Dallas.

C-14

Construction shall comply with Section 4(b) of the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 USC
Sections 4901-4918), which directs federal agencies to comply with applicable federal,
state, and local noise requirements with respect to the control and abatement of
environmental noise. Construction shall also comply with the City of Dallas noise
ordinance (i.e., Dallas City Code: Volume II, Chapter 30) Section 30-2, item (8), limiting
construction/demolition activities to between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.,

equipment) shall be readily available for use and during transport in the event of an
unplanned release.

POST-3

The City of Dallas shall make efforts to eradicate Johnson grass. The presence of these
grasses impedes the ability of managers to inspect levee condition during high flow
events and thus precludes accurate prediction of cracks, slumps, or slides on the levees.

POST-4

A traffic wayfinding system, consisting of street and freeway signage, shall be
implemented to guide users of the BVP Study Ecosystem and Recreation features from
freeways to internal streets within the Floodway. To the extent feasible, the wayfinding
system shall route traffic away from residential streets and congested highways, and shall
encourage transit, pedestrian, and bicycle access to the Floodway instead of passenger
cars.

completed as project elements move forward with Section 408 review. Mussel planning
cannot be completed at this time, as there is insufficient information of the life history
and habitat requirements of these state-listed species.

M-5

A biological analysis would be conducted every 3 years using the same habitat evaluation
technique to monitor and quantify habitat impacts resulting from future flood control or

for future habitat restoration planning projects (USFWS 2014).

M-6

As new/enhanced aquatic and wetland habitats are developed under the project design,
wetland and stream assessment reach (WAAs and SARs, respectively) shall be
established and evaluated using TXRAM methods (USACE 2010a) to provide objective
metrics on whether the project is meeting the over-arching goal of adequately
compensating for its impacts with net gains in aquatic resource acreage and/or functions.
Individual WAAs and SARs shall be established during the first year following
construction, and shall be reevaluated every two years subsequently, until the score is
within two points of the previous evaluation and the site appears to be on a stable
trajectory. Each WAA and SAR would be evaluated in this manner for a minimum of five
years (first year plus two subsequent evaluations). The data shall be used in conjunction
with the Annual Monitoring Report (see SCM M-3) to identify which metrics indicate
functional deficiencies, and how they can be improved. Such an analysis would provide

degraded safety conditions that occur in the dark (e.g., personal injury and fire).
Advanced notice of known utility shut-downs shall be given to those users who would be
affected by unavoidable service disruptions.

M-11

The City of Dallas shall develop and implement a Traffic Monitoring Plan to assess the
adequacy of internal streets within the Floodway to efficiently accommodate weekend
traffic demand. Traffic data collection and traffic operations observations shall be
conducted at vehicular access points and key locations within the Floodway (i.e., internal
street intersections and approaches to parking facilities). Recommendations to facilitate
traffic flow (e.g., installation of permanent or temporary traffic control, channelization,
pavement markings, etc.) shall be implemented to reduce traffic congestion and queuing.

M-12

Potable water shut-down for tie-ins to the existing water mains would only occur between
October 1 and April 1.

M-13

The constructor contractor would seek authorization from the City of Dallas and TCEQ
to implement “flex hours,” as appropriate, for construction activities during peak
commuting hours in the summer months to minimize ozone-forming emissions. This may
require a variance of the noise ordinance (refer to SCM C-13).

M-14

Routine inspections of the berms separating lakes and the Trinity River, pump stations,
bridges, and the earthen berm for the Trinity Parkway would be periodically inspected for
erosion or other flaws. These critical elements need to be fixed immediately as they
directly impact the functionality of the Dallas Floodway Levee System.

out recommendations for maintenance schedules. The project proponent would not be
permitted to use non-native plant species, even if they are currently part of the BVP
Study planting palette. Non-native species shall not be included in the implemented
planting palettes of aquatic, wetland, and riverbank and terrace habitats.

The incorporation of SCMs and mitigation and monitoring into the Preferred Alternatives would
minimize adverse impacts to environmental resources. Table 7-1 identifies the resource areas to which
each measure would apply. As depicted, several measures would apply to multiple resource areas.

100-year storm event: the amount of rainfall within 24 hours that has a 1% annual exceedance
probability within a specific area.
100-year floodplain: the area adjoining a river, stream, or other watercourse that would be covered by
water as a result of a 100-year storm event.
Alluvium: loose, unconsolidated soil or sediment, which has deposited by flowing water, as in a riverbed,
floodplain, or delta.
Ambient Air Quality: air concentrations of specific pollutants (termed “criteria” pollutants) determined
by the USEPA to be of concern to the health and welfare of the public.

11

Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): the probability of a flood event occurring in any year. The
probability is expressed as a percentage. For example, a flood which may be calculated to have a 1%
chance to occur in any one year, is described as the 1% AEP.

12

Aquifers: an underground body of rock that contains groundwater.

13

Archaeological resources: locations where human activity measurably altered the earth or left deposits
of physical remains (e.g., stone flakes, arrowheads, or bottles). Archaeological resources are either sites or
isolates, and may be either prehistoric or historic in age. Isolates often contain only one or two artifacts,
while sites are usually larger and contain more artifacts. These resources can include campsites, roads,
trails, dumps, battlegrounds, mines, and other features.

Architectural resources: standing buildings, dams, canals, bridges, and other structures of historic or
architectural significance.
Attainment, Nonattainment, and Maintenance Areas: if the air quality in a geographic area meets or
does better than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), it is called an attainment area;
areas that don't meet the national standard are called nonattainment areas. Once a nonattainment area
meets the standards and additional redesignation requirements, the USEPA will designate the area as a
maintenance area.

26

Average Daily Traffic (ADT) volume: the number of vehicles crossing a given point on a roadway in
both directions during a 24-hour period.

27

Bedrock: subterranean solid rock that lies beneath loose material (such as soil, sand, clay, or gravel).

28

Biofiltration: a pollution control technique that uses living material to capture and degrade pollutants.

29

Bioretention: the process in which contaminants and sedimentation are removed from stormwater runoff
by plants and microbes.

25

30
31
32

Borrow area (or borrow pit): a surface area where material (usually soil, gravel or sand) excavated for
use at another location.

34

Brownfield: an abandoned or underused industrial or commercial facility available for re-use, however
such redevelopment may be complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

35

Channelization: manmade measures intended to alter the course, characteristics and/or flow of a river.

pumped dry to create a dry work environment below the waterline.
Comprehensive analysis: a complete and multi-disciplinary
assessment of existing conditions, direct and indirect environmental
consequences, and project alternatives.

Channel bank armoring

Conformity Determination: a Conformity Determination is the formal
process and documentation required when the proposed emissions from a federal action in a
nonattainment or maintenance area exceed de minimis thresholds and are not otherwise exempt from the
General Conformity Rule requirements.
Cooperating Agency: an agency, other than the Lead Agency, that participates in the NEPA process for a
proposed action because of jurisdiction by law or special expertise.
Criteria Pollutants: commonly found air pollutants Ozone (O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen
Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Oxides (SOx), Particulate Matter (PM10, PM2.5) and Lead (Pb) that can harm your
health, the environment, and cause property damage. USEPA calls these pollutants "criteria" air pollutants
because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria for
setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another
set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards.

22

Cubic feet per second: a unit expressing the rate of discharge (or flow rate) of water. One cubic foot per
second is equal to the discharge of water flowing at a velocity of one foot per second, through a
rectangular opening that is one foot wide and one foot high.

23

Culvert: a tunnel accommodating the flow of water under a road or railroad.

24

Cumulative project: any past, present, or future project that could contribute
toward cumulative effects on environmental resources, when taken in
combination with a proposed action and other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable projects.

Dallas Floodway (or “the Floodway”): a floodway that crosses the western and central portions of the
City of Dallas, adjacent to the Trinity River and the West and Elm Forks of the Trinity River.
de minimis Threshold: the General Conformity Rule establishes maximum emission levels in tons per
year allowed based on the severity of an area’s air quality problem. The exceedance of a de minimis
threshold requires a Conformity Determination. 40 CFR 93 Section 153 lists these maximum de minimis
thresholds.
Direct Impacts (Socioeconomics): impacts associated with the construction projects themselves. Direct
jobs include jobs building and/or constructing the proposed projects. Direct labor income is the incomes
earned by workers who are building/construction the proposed projects. Direct economic output is
associated with initial purchases of local construction materials and supplies.

to be acceptable through the application of the NEPA process and is documented in the Record of
Decision.
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS): a document that is required under the NEPA for any major
federal action, and/or when the environmental consequences of a proposed action may be significant. An
EIS discloses both the positive and negative effects of a proposed action.
Environmental Justice Low-income Population Area: a census block group where 20% or more of the
residents have incomes below the poverty line. For purposes of analysis, the populations of these areas are
considered special status populations.
Environmental Justice Minority Population Area: a census block group where 50% or more of the
residents have minority status. For purposes of analysis, the populations of these areas are considered
special status populations.

25

Feasibility Study: a detailed investigation of engineering feasibility, cost effectiveness, and
environmental consequences of alternative solutions to a water resources challenge.

26

Flex field: an open area or field that can be used for a variety of activities and sports.

27

Floodway: a channel of a river or other watercourse and adjacent land areas reserved in order to

bridges, above-ground utilities, buildings, or other structures.
Flood Risk Management (FRM): the USACE’s program to minimize flood risk through the appropriate
use and resiliency of structures such as levees and floodwalls. FRM also promotes alternatives when other
approaches (e.g., land acquisition, flood proofing, etc.) reduce flood-related risks.
Flood Warning System: a system to advise residents of flooding to facilitate preparedness and
evacuation.
Fluvial Geomorphology: the study of river forms and the processes that shape them. Fluvial
geomorphology considers the geological setting, channel morphology, hydrology, hydraulics, sediment
transport, and riparian and floodplain vegetation.

Fugitive Dust: particulate matter that becomes airborne and has the potential to adversely affect human
health or the environment. The most common forms of particulate matter are known as PM10 (particulate
matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less) and PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns
or less).
Future Without-Project Condition: this future condition describes environmental conditions in a given
area assuming that a proposed action is not implemented. The Future Without-Project Condition is the
baseline for measuring a proposed action’s environmental effects.
General Conformity Rule: ensures that Federal actions comply with the NAAQS. In order to meet Clean
Air Act requirement, a federal agency must demonstrate that every action that it undertakes, approves,
permits or supports will conform to the appropriate state implementation plan. A federal action can be
shown to “conform” by demonstrating there will be no increase in emission in the nonattainment or
maintenance area from the federal action that could cause new violations of the standards and/or no
increase in the frequency or severity of previous violations.
Geotextile: permeable fabric which, when used in association with soil, have the ability to separate, filter,
reinforce, protect, or drain the soil.
Greenbelt: land use designation used in land use planning to retain areas of largely undeveloped, wild, or
agricultural land surrounding or neighboring urban areas.

21

Greenhouse Gas (GHG): gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global climate change
(also known as the greenhouse effect) by absorbing infrared radiation. Many GHGs occur naturally in the
atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), water vapor, and nitrous oxide (N2O), while
others are synthetic.

22

Hydraulics: the science that deals with the conveyance of liquids through pipes and channels.

23

Hydraulic Neutrality: A term often used to characterize “technical soundness” as it relates to the
hydraulic performance of the Dallas Floodway. In this context, hydraulic neutrality indicates that the
floodway’s ability to convey the SPF and 100-year flood event would be minimally altered.

Hydrology: the science that deals with the properties, circulation and distribution of water on and under
the surface of the earth. Hydrology is also concerned with water in the atmosphere, from the moment of
precipitation until it returns to the atmosphere, or is discharged into the ocean.
Indirect Impacts (Socioeconomics): jobs, income, and economic output generated by the businesses that
would supply construction materials and supplies. Indirect jobs include jobs at companies that supply
construction materials/supplies or sell or rent construction equipment. Indirect jobs can extend to include
jobs related to the manufacture of products used for construction (if the manufacture is within the region
of influence [ROI]). Indirect labor income includes the income earned by people working indirect jobs.
Indirect output includes the total sales volume related to the supply of goods and services to construction
contractors.
Induced Impacts: impacts that result from the spending of wages and salaries of the direct and indirect
employees on items such as food, housing, transportation, and medical services. This spending creates
induced employment in nearly all sectors of the economy, especially service sectors.
Invasive species: introduced species that adversely affects the habitats and bioregions that they invade
economically, environmentally and/or ecologically.

Inverse square law: an equation that describes how noise dissipates over a given distance from the noise
source.
Jobs Impact: the number of jobs that would be created or sustained within the ROI as a result of
construction activities.
Labor Income Impact: the income generated through the jobs that would be created or sustained within
the ROI as a result of construction activities.
Lead Agency: a federal agency designated to supervise the preparation of the National Environmental
Policy Act environmental analysis.
Levee: an elongated naturally occurring ridge, or artificially constructed fill or wall, which regulates
water levels. It is usually earthen and often located parallel to, and both sides of the course of a river.
Areas located outside of the levees are referred to as developed areas.

Public Draft EIS

April 2014

Passenger Car Equivalent Vehicles: a traffic volume that includes a factor that is applied to trucks to
better represent their disproportionate effect on highway capacity.
Plasticity: A geologic process where a material undergoes a change under extremely high pressure and/or
temperature. High plasticity soils (soils most similar to high quality pottery clay) turn into sticky mud
when mixed with water. Soils with a high plasticity tend to be clay, those with a lower placidity tend to be
silt, and those with a plasticity of 0 (non-plastic) tend to have little or no silt or clay.
Potentially affected structure: a structure that is wholly or partially within the extent of a specified
storm event.
Potentially flooded structure: a potentially affected whose estimated finished floor elevation is below
the predicted storm event water level.

13

Pressure sewer: means of collecting wastewater from multiple sources and delivering the wastewater to
an existing collection sewer, and/or to a local or regional treatment facility. Pressure sewers are not
dependent on gravity to move wastewater.

14

Promenade: a paved public walkway, typically along a waterfront area.

15

Public Involvement: a systematic interdisciplinary approach to solicit
input from the public on a proposed action, including public hearings and
reasonable notices to the public.

Pump station: facilities including pumps and equipment for moving fluids
from one place to another. In the Dallas Floodway, pump stations are used
to convey water from sumps on the developed side of the levees into the
Floodway.

Promenade

Reasonably foreseeable: actions or impacts that are considered likely to
occur based upon an assessment of data and trends.
Record of Decision (ROD): a written public record identifying and
explaining the reasoning for the Lead Agency’s decision on the Proposed
Action.
Recurrence Interval/Return Period: the probability that a given event
(e.g., 100-year flood) will be equaled or exceeded in any given year.

Pump Station

Region of Influence (ROI): the geographic extent that is being evaluated for a particular environmental
resource.

33

Regionally Significant Arterial (RSA): major surface streets (i.e., not freeways). RSAs identified by the
North Central Texas Council of Governments are projected to accommodate approximately 20% of all
vehicular traffic in the North Central Texas region by the year 2035.

34

Retaining wall: above-ground structures designed to prevent soil erosion.

35

Scoping Meeting: a public meeting where a Lead Agency (and other agencies as appropriate) describes a
proposed action and solicits input from the public.

31
32

36

38

Section 408 Project: any project that modifies a federal levee system, above and beyond ordinary
operations and maintenance that requires USACE approval under 33 United States Code Section 408.

39

Seepage: the slow escape of a liquid or gas through porous material or small holes.

Sensitive Noise Receptors: buildings or parks where quiet forms a basic element of their purpose;
residences and buildings where people normally sleep (e.g., homes, hotels, hospitals), where nighttime
noise is most annoying; and institutional land uses (e.g., schools, libraries, parks, churches) with primarily
daytime and evening use.

5

Sluice: an artificial passage for water to flow through with a gate for controlling the flow.

6

Standard Project Flood (SPF): the volume of stream flow expected to result from the most severe
combination of meteorological and hydrologic conditions that are reasonably characteristic of the
geographic region involved, excluding extremely rare combinations.

State Implementation Plan (SIP): developed in order to improve air quality in designated nonattainment
and maintenance areas. Through this plan, States propose their strategy for reducing criteria air pollutant
emissions. Plans often incorporate different strategies, such as the use of a permit system to ensure that
power plants, factories and other pollution sources meet State clean-up goals.
Sump: a low-lying basin that receives surface water runoff. Sumps are used in the Dallas Floodway
EWLIDS to store stormwater on the developed side of the levees before it is pumped into the Dallas
Floodway.
Superfund: common name for the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, a United States federal
law designed to clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances.
Technically sound: this means that, at a minimum, a proposed action has
been designed and implemented in accordance with USACE standards.
Traditional Cultural Properties (TCP): resources associated with the
Sump
cultural practices and beliefs of a living community that link that
community to its past and help maintain its cultural identity. These resources can encompass a variety of
subjects including archaeological resources and architectural resources, as well as sacred areas or objects,
sources of raw materials, and traditional hunting and gathering areas. TCPs are generally associated with
Native American groups and are evaluated for National Register of Historic Places eligibility.
Trestle: a framework consisting of beams used to support a flat surface,
such as a roadway or railroad.
Tributary/Fork: a stream or river that flows into a mainstem (or parent)
river or a lake.
Trip generation: an estimate of the number of new trips that would be
added to the transportation network as the result of a proposed action.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE): a U.S. federal agency under
Trestle
the Department of Defense and a major Army command with
approximately 37,000 military and civilian personnel. The USACE is involved with numerous civil works
projects, and is especially associated with dams, canals, and flood risk management.
Urbanization: the physical transformation of rural and undeveloped areas to provide permanent
structures and infrastructure to accommodate an influx of population.
Valley Storage: the water volume that occupies a floodplain following a flood event. Valley storage is a
measure of floodplain volume capacity.
