EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA SHALLOW FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT
Responsible Agency: The lead agency is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District.
Cooperating Agencies include the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
Abstract: The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) proposes to construct and
operate a Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB) in Palm Beach County, Florida. The Shallow
FEB is an above-ground 60,000 acre-foot impoundment with a maximum operating depth of 4
feet. The Shallow FEB would be constructed on 16,517.9 acres of land situated north of
Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) 3/4 and between the Miami and North New River Canals in
the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). As proposed, construction of the Shallow FEB would
place fill within 280.1 acres of freshwater marsh wetlands to construct levees, place fill within
112.8 acres of canals to create appropriate wetland elevations, and excavate 43.0 acres of
freshwater marsh wetlands to create canals and ditches. Operation of the Shallow FEB would
inundate 10,820.3 acres of jurisdictional wetlands and 1,214.7 acres of uplands to create an
emergent marsh habitat. The SFWMD is required to obtain a Department of the Army permit
pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. This Final Environmental Impact Statement
evaluates the environmental effects of four (4) alternatives: the No Action Alternative, the
SFWMD’s Preferred Alternative (the Shallow FEB), a deep FEB Alternative, and a Stormwater
Treatment Area Alternative. The overall project purpose, as defined by the USACE, is to achieve
the Water Quality Based Effluent Limit at the STA 2 and STA 3/4 discharge points in the Central
Flowpath of the Everglades Protection Area. To achieve this, the Shallow FEB project would
retain and deliver water at improved timing to the STAs so that the STAs perform at a more
optimized efficiency.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT
EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA A-1 SHALLOW FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
IN PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA
A.

BACKGROUND

The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) is requesting regulatory authorization
from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in the form of a Department of the
Army (DA) permit pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, to construct a Shallow Flow
Equalization Basin (FEB) on the A-1 project site in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). The A1 project site is approximately 16,517.9 acres and bordered to the east by US Highway 27, to
the south by Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) 3/4, to the west by an area known as the Holey
Land Wildlife Management Area (Holey Land) and to the north by agricultural lands.
The Shallow FEB is designed to improve the phosphorus treatment performance in STAs 2 and
3/4 by retaining and then delivering water to the STAs with improved flow and timing, which is
expected to increase the effectiveness of phosphorus treatment in the STAs prior to discharge
in the Everglades Protection Area (EPA). Since the A-1 Site was purchased with Farm Bill Funds,
the SFWMD will request approval for a land use change from the United States Department of
the Interior (DOI)/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).

B.

NEED FOR PROPOSED ACTION

The SFWMD is required to meet a numeric discharge limit, referred to as the Water Quality
Based Effluent Limit (WQBEL) that is contained in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit for discharges from the STAs into the EPA. The WQBEL was developed
to assure that such discharges do not cause or contribute to exceedances of the 10 parts per
billion (ppb) total phosphorus (TP) criterion (expressed as a long-term geometric mean [LTGM])
established under 62-302.540, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) (SFWMD – Final Technical
Support Document for the WQBEL 2012). The TP criterion is measured at a network of stations
across the EPA marsh and is intended to prevent imbalances of aquatic flora and fauna. The
WQBEL is measured at the discharge points from each STA and requires that the total
phosphorus concentration in STA discharges shall not exceed: 1) 13 ppb as an annual flowweighted mean in more than three out of five water years on a rolling basis; and 2) 19 ppb as
an annual flow-weighted mean in any water year. Excess phosphorus discharged into the EPA
has caused ecological impacts within the Everglades.

Although phosphorus levels in the discharges from STA 2 and STA 3/4 have been reduced
during the years that these STAs have been operating, STA discharges have not consistently
achieved the phosphorus concentrations described in the WQBEL that was established in 2012.
As a result of technical discussions in early 2010, the SFWMD, Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
developed a plan to ensure that discharges into the EPA do not cause or contribute to
exceedances of the State of Florida’s 10 ppb TP numeric phosphorus criterion entering into the
EPA. The above agencies identified a suite of water quality projects that would work in
conjunction with the existing Everglades STAs to meet the WQBEL at the discharge points from
the STAs. As a result of these technical discussions, on September 10, 2012, FDEP issued NPDES
and Everglades Forever Act (EFA) permits for the existing Everglades STAs and consent orders
establishing the WQBEL and the suite of water quality improvement projects to be constructed.
The Shallow FEB at the A-1 project site is the project proposed by the SFWMD to achieve the
WQBEL within the Central Flowpath of the EPA.
The SFWMD is proposing to meet the WQBEL in flows from STA 2 and STA 3/4 by using a
shallow FEB at the A-1 project site to temporarily store excess water from within the central
EAA, collected by the North New River and Miami Canals. This water is then delivered from the
Shallow FEB to STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4 at an improved rate. By managing
basin runoff in the Central Flowpath in a more advantageous manner, the impacts of storm
driven events would be reduced for STA 2 and STA 3/4. The proposed projects will also
improve operations of the STAs in the dry season by providing water during the periods of
drought and low water conditions. Attenuating and managing excess water flows in the Central
Flowpath is intended to enhance operations and improve phosphorus treatment performance
in STA 2 and STA 3/4 so that these STA discharges meet the WQBEL.
The goals and objectives are to assist STA 2 and 3/4 in achieving the WQBEL at the STA
discharge points in three ways:
1. Attenuate peak water flows and temporarily store runoff from the central EAA,
thereby minimizing the discharge of untreated water into the EPA,
2. Improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4, thereby providing enhanced
operation and phosphorus treatment performance, and
3. Assist in maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout
conditions within STA 2 and STA 3/4, which will sustain phosphorus treatment
performance.

The overall project purpose, as defined by the USACE, is to achieve the WQBEL at the STA 2 and
STA 3/4 discharge points into the Central Flowpath of the EPA. The project construction
completion milestone is July 2016 as established in the Consent Order (OGC #12-1148).

C.

SCOPE OF ANALYSIS

The USACE determined that the scope of this Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
includes the A-1 project site, the STAs that the proposed project would assist (STAs 2 and 3/4),
the Everglades Water Conservation Areas that receive the STAs discharges (WCA 2A and 3A),
and the Holey Land. The A-1 project site was originally purchased using Department of the
Interior’s (DOI) Farm Bill funds for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan EAA A-1
Storage Reservoir project and is subject to land use restrictions; therefore, the land use of the
site is a major component of the scope of analysis. The EAA was historically Everglades
wetlands, which has now been ditched and drained. Much of the EAA canal system, including
the extensive network of ditches and canals along the perimeter of the site, is considered to be
“navigable waters of the United States” under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section
10 of the Rivers and Harbor Act. The lands within the A-1 project site have been previously
farmed. However, the lands were taken out of agricultural use and the wetland hydrology,
hydric plants, and hydric soils have returned. Therefore, the USACE’s regulatory jurisdiction
under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act includes the project site as well as wetlands and
aquatic resources that will be affected as a result of the project. A number of federally listed
species utilize the project site as well as other natural areas that will be affected by the project.
Taking these factors into consideration, the proposed project is subject to substantial federal
control and responsibility and the scope of analysis is extended over the entire site.

D.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

This Final EIS evaluates construction of the applicant’s (SFWMD) preferred alternative, which is
a Shallow FEB on the A-1 project site. The USACE will analyze a range of alternatives to
determine if the applicant’s preferred alternative is the least environmentally damaging
practicable alternative, and if the applicant’s preferred alternative is not contrary to the public’s
interest. The range of alternatives considered in this EIS include the No Action Alternative, the
Applicant’s Preferred Alternative (Shallow FEB), a Deep FEB, and an STA. The potential effects
of the Alternatives would largely be a function of the manner in, and degree to which, the
Alternative features are used in the context of other regional water management infrastructure
and system operations made possible by the presence of the enhanced water management
options and phosphorus treatment performance. The No Action Alternative and Alternatives 2
(Shallow FEB), 3 (Deep FEB), and 4 (STA) are presented to compare the differences in regional
water management infrastructure to effectively meet the project purpose.

DESCRIPTION OF ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Alternative 2 is a 15,000-acre Shallow FEB, with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4
feet, and is SFWMD’s Preferred Alternative to be evaluated in this EIS. The Shallow FEB was
assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:









Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee heights for 4 feet
maximum operating depth)
Interior levees to convey inflows to the north end of the FEB (8.7+/- miles)
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA-3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

The majority of the Shallow FEB outflows (approximately 80%) will be directed to STA 3/4 for
treatment while the remaining flows (approximately 20%) will be conveyed to STA 2 (including
Compartment B) via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Alternative 3 is a 15,000-acre Deep FEB, with a maximum operating depth of approximately
12.5 feet. Alternative 3 was assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:










Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 20-30 feet levee heights for a maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet)
Inflow Pump Station to direct North New River Canal flows into the FEB to the maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
A cutoff wall to minimize or eliminate seepage impacts to adjacent areas
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA 3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

The majority of the Deep FEB outflows (approximately 60%) will be will be directed to STA 3/4
for treatment while the remaining flows (approximately 40%) will be conveyed to STA 2
(including Compartment B) via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Alternative 4 is a 15,000-acre STA, with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4 feet.
The proposed STA would have a normal operating depth of approximately 1.25 – 1.5 feet and a
maximum operating depth of approximately 4 feet. Alternative 4 would operate in parallel with
STA 2 and STA 3/4. Alternative 4 was assumed to include the following components, at a
minimum:









Perimeter Levees around the STA (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee height for 4 feet maximum
operating depth)
Interior levees dividing the STA into cells
Inflow canals to direct inflows from the North New River and Miami Canals to the STA
Discharge canal to direct outflows from the STA to the L-5 Canal
Internal distribution canals to facilitate sheetflow through the cells
Internal collection canals to assist in conveying water out of the cells
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect STA seepage and return to STA
Operable water control structures to control water levels and flows into and out of all
STA cells

In order to operate the new STA, construction of conveyance features in addition to
construction of the STA itself will be required. Specifically, a discharge canal would need to be
constructed within the Holey Land to connect the STA discharge canal to the L-5 Canal. This
would enable the delivery of discharges with low phosphorus from the proposed STA to WCA
2A and/or WCA 3A via existing infrastructure, without interfering with the existing operations
of STA 2, STA 3/4 and the North New River and Miami Canals.

F.

SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

The effects of the alternatives on the environment were evaluated. Many of the environmental
effects were similar between Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. However, changes to the affected
environment are seen in land use, soils/total phosphorus removal, surface water, water quality,
and wetland impacts as a result of the Alternatives and discussed further in Section 4.22. For
Table 4-16 below, a “+” is a positive effect, a “0” is a neutral effect, while a “-“ is a negative
effect.

The evaluation of environmental impacts indicates that among the alternatives that are
projected to meet the WQBEL at both STAs, the SFWMD’s Preferred Alternative (the shallow
FEB) is the least expensive and also has the lowest wetland impact. The changes in hydroperiod
in the downstream Everglades (WCA 2A and WCA 3A) in each of the Action Alternatives is
negligible.
G.

AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONTROVERSY

This project is being developed with input and consensus from federal and state agencies, local
agencies and the public. There is currently ongoing coordination with the Seminole Tribe of
Florida, Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, USFWS, DOI, USEPA, Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FFWCC), and Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) to address concerns regarding impacts such as wetlands, water quality, flood protection,
wildlife and habitat, and threatened and endangered species. Numerous meetings have
occurred with the various agencies and the public in the context of identifying areas of
potential controversy and resolving or mitigating for those concerns. Through the coordination
process and meetings with the agencies, all areas of potential controversy, in particular the
compensatory mitigation, have been resolved.
H.

LIST OF OTHER GOVERNMENT ACTIONS REQUIRED

The SFWMD shall be responsible for obtaining federal, state and local permits, licenses and
meet other consultation requirements for the proposed project, as described in this section and
Chapter 8 of the main report.
The USACE’s permitting decision is required to comply with many federal requirements
including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Water Act (CWA), Endangered
Species Act (ESA), Rivers and Harbors Act, Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), Fish and
Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, and the National Historic Preservation Act. The USACE will
consider other relevant environmental laws as well as protection of wetlands, floodplain
management, environmental justice, and invasive/exotic species.

State requirements that will need to be satisfied for this project include an Everglades Forever
Act (EFA) permit for construction and operation of the FEB. A consumptive use/water use
permit will also need to be obtained for any construction dewatering prior to dewatering
activities. In addition, a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits
(Notice of Intent to use Generic Permit for stormwater discharges from large and small
construction activities) would also need to be obtained prior to start of construction. The
Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) is currently processing a permit
application from the SFWMD for the Shallow FEB under file number 0313994-001.
Local permitting authority for the proposed EAA A-1 Shallow FEB project resides with several
county Departments and Divisions. Primary coordination of local permit review will be
administered by Palm Beach County’s Planning, Zoning and Building (PZB) Division.
The SFWMD will be required to obtain approval from the USFWS/DOI for a land use change on
the A-1 project site.
The USACE made a determination that the SFWMD’s proposed Shallow FEB project may affect,
but is not likely to adversely affect the Audubon’s crested caracara, the Florida panther, the
Everglade snail kite, and the wood stork; and may adversely affect the eastern indigo snake.
The USACE is currently in formal consultation with the USFWS.

I.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES

The SFWMD proposes to obtain ecological lift within the boundary of either the Deep FEB or
STA for hydrologic and vegetation benefits expected from the additional retained water. The
USACE determined that the compensatory mitigation plan of utilizing on-site ecological lift
within the Deep FEB or STA alternatives was not possible at this time. The Deep FEB would not
be expected to support adequate wetland vegetation due to periods of flooding greater than 4feet following by periods of drawdown. Based on USEPA’s Guiding Principles for Constructed
Treatment Wetlands, the STA Alternative would provide compensatory mitigation within a
treatment area that the USACE has only utilized past treatment wetlands to offset impacts to
agricultural wetlands.. If the Deep FEB or the STA alternative were selected, further discussions
would need to occur to develop an appropriate mitigation plan. The USACE does not have any
concerns with the mitigation plan for the Shallow FEB. The USACE agrees that the Shallow FEB
would provide wetland benefits and the loss of wetland function and value is offset.
The Shallow FEB Alternative would provide significantly more mitigation credit than is needed
to offset the impacts from construction. The USACE is evaluating whether it is appropriate to
utilize the excess functional capacity units from the Shallow FEB Alternative as compensatory
mitigation to offset wetland impacts for future projects. The Shallow FEB will be operated as a

water storage site to enhance the operation of the STAs. The Shallow FEB will accept water
during storm events, and supply water to the STA during the dry season. The USACE recognizes
that the Shallow FEB would be susceptible to more drastic changes in water elevations and will
sacrificially experience dry-out conditions in favor STA 2 and STA 3/4. These changes in
hydrology will cause the wetland community to change between marsh wetlands and wet
prairie wetlands, with dryer dry periods. The USACE recognizes that this is a great benefit for
water quality purposes within the EPA and an improvement to the current site conditions on
the project site. However, the effects from changes in hydrology on the wetlands at the project
site may not make appropriate mitigation to offset future impacts for other projects, especially
if there is dissimilar vegetation or hydroperiod as this would be out of kind. This option would
be evaluated on a case by case basis for each future project.

J.
COMPENSATORY MITIGATION TO OFFSET THE LOSS OF WETLAND
FUNCTION AND VALUE
The compensatory wetland mitigation plan for Alternatives 2 includes hydrologic and
vegetation benefits within the footprint of the project. By retaining additional water on the
site, it is anticipated that the hydrology and the vegetation community within the footprint of
the project would improve from the current condition. In assessing the pre- and post-project
conditions of the wetlands with UMAM, the project results in an environmental benefit (or
excess credits). The FDEP, the USFWS and the USEPA have agreed upon and finalized the
Uniform Mitigation Assessment Method (UMAM) scores, incorporating an appropriate UMAM
scores, time lag and risk associated with the Compensatory Mitigation Plan as described in
Chapter 5. Therefore, all concerns with the UMAM analysis have been resolved. The SFWMD’s
Preferred Alternative (Alternative 2) results in a surplus of 1,510.5 credits.

K.

COORDINATION

Throughout the evolution of project design alternates, federal and state agencies, county
officials, and the public have been kept informed through a scoping meeting, social media,
news release, and public notices designed to inform, gather input, and respond to questions
regarding the proposed project. The public, government agencies, federally-recognized Native
American Tribes, and interested parties are afforded the opportunity to provide input regarding
this project by reviewing and commenting on the draft and final EIS. Project information,
schedules, documents, and presentations to the public are also kept updated and available on
the USACE website: http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/ItemsofInterest.aspx.

1.1

INTRODUCTION

The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) has submitted an application to the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, Regulatory Division (USACE) for a
Department of the Army (DA) permit authorizing the discharge of dredge or fill material into
waters of the United States (US), including wetlands under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
(CWA) for construction of a shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB). The FEB is proposed in
western Palm Beach County, Florida, on land designated as Compartment A-1 (A-1 project site)
within the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) (Figure 1-1). The A-1 project site is approximately
16,000 acres and bordered to the east by US Highway 27, to the south by Stormwater
Treatment Area (STA) 3/4, to the west by an area known as the Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area (Holey Land) and to the north by agricultural lands.
Water flowing south from Lake Okeechobee can be separated into three flowpaths: the
Western flowpath that extends beyond the EAA to the west, the Central flowpath, which is the
bulk of the EAA, and the Eastern flowpath (Figure 1-2). These flowpaths are delineated by the
source basins that route flows into the existing Everglades STAs. The project site is in the
southern portion of the Central EAA flowpath. The Central EAA is mainly comprised of the S-2,
S-3, S-6, S-7, and S-8 drainage basins and also includes the following independent water
management or drainage districts established by Chapter 298 Florida Statutes (commonly
referred to as 298 Districts): South Florida Conservancy District, South Shore Drainage District,
East Shore Water Control District (ESWCD), and 715 Farms (Figure 1-3). Currently, the North
New River and Miami Canals route flows from these basins and 298 Districts into STA 2,
Compartment B, and STA 3/4 for phosphorus treatment prior to discharging into Water
Conservation Area (WCA) 2A and WCA 3A. Water can be diverted around the STAs and
discharged directly into the WCAs, referred to as “diversions”. For example, during extreme
storm events, diversions could occur as water is sent directly from the canals into the WCAs
without entering into the STAs if the water volumes in the canals exceed the capacity of the
STAs. Alternately, when dry conditions in the Lower East Coast may lead to salt water intrusion,
water is delivered directly from the canals into the WCAs to help maintain the freshwater
gradient in the coastal wells. Water diversions in the dry season are referred to as urban water
supplies.

Purpose and Need

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT REQUIREMENTS

The USACE anticipates a decision on the proposed activities which would constitute a Major
Federal Action in accordance with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 1501.8 and is
preparing documentation to comply with requirements of the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 United States Code (USC) §§ 4321 et seq.]. NEPA is the “basic national
charter for protection of the environment” [40 CFR §1500.1(a)] and requires federal agencies to
be fully informed about the environmental consequences of their decision to provide financial
assistance, exercise permit or regulatory authority, or to conduct an action that may
significantly affect the environment. In addition, NEPA mandates that the public be informed of
the proposed actions, the consequences of the actions, and the ultimate agency decision.
Based on the size of the project area, the current purpose for the site, and the potential
positive and negative environmental effects, both individually and cumulatively, of the
anticipated action (the proposed A-1 Shallow FEB), the USACE has determined that the project
would “significantly” affect the human environment. Therefore, an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) is necessary to inform any final decision on the permit application. The
USACE’s decision will be to either issue, issue with modifications to the applicant’s proposal, or
deny a DA permit for the proposed action.
This document, the Everglades Agricultural Area A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin EIS (A-1
FEB EIS), is an EIS that provides a comprehensive environmental analysis to aid in the decision
making process for the DA permit application for the proposed Shallow FEB. The USACE has
prepared this EIS in accordance with the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations
(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B “National Environmental Policy Act
Implementation Procedures for the Regulatory Program”, and 40 CFR §230.10(a), which
implement the procedural provisions of the NEPA (42 USC §§4321 et seq.) for the USACE.
The CEQ regulations implementing the NEPA mandate that Federal agencies responsible for
preparing NEPA analyses and documentation do so “in cooperation” with other agencies with
jurisdiction by law or special expertise (40 CFR §§ 1501.6 & 1508.5). The proposed project
would require authorization from the USACE under Section 404 of the CWA and would be
subject to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)/U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) approval for
a land use change for construction of a Shallow FEB on the A-1 Project Site. Therefore, the
USACE requested that the DOI be a cooperating agency on this EIS, and the DOI agreed on
October 30, 2012. Since the USFWS and the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
have expertise in threatened or endangered species and water quality, respectively, the USACE
has also invited the USFWS and USEPA to be cooperating agencies on this EIS. The USEPA
agreed to be a cooperating agency on this EIS on October 16, 2012. The USFWS has assisted

Purpose and Need

the USACE to develop this EIS. Because the authorization from the USACE is the major federal
action, the USACE is the lead federal agency for this NEPA process and is responsible for
preparation of the EIS.
This particular chapter of the EIS will cover the project background and purpose, and a
description of the project as proposed by the SFWMD. This chapter is designed to provide a
concise description to the public and to decision makers about what the essential needs and
goals are for the project. The project’s purpose and need is presented in Section 1.5. Section
1.6 describes the permit decision to be made while Section 1.7 discusses issues raised by the
public. Finally, Section 1.8 discusses the environmental documents related to the proposed
permit action.

1.3

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Section 1.3.1 provides background information to describe the history of actions that have
focused on managing phosphorus levels in the Everglades Protection Area (EPA) as defined in
the 1994 Everglades Forever Act (EFA), including the adoption of the phosphorus Water Quality
Based Effluent Limits (WQBEL) for the STAs, and the development of Regional Water Quality
Plan. The EPA includes WCA 1, otherwise known as Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National
Wildlife Refuge (the Refuge), WCA 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and the Everglades National Park. Section
1.3.2 describes the prior permitting history associated with the previously permitted A-1
Reservoir project. Finally, Section 1.3.3 describes the history and need to obtain approval for a
land use change on the A-1 project site.

1.3.1 HISTORY OF PHOSPHORUS MANAGEMENT IN THE EVERGLADES
In 1988, the federal government filed a complaint in federal court against the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and SFWMD for alleged violations of state
water quality (U.S. v. FDER and SFWMD, Case No. 88-1886-CIV-MORENO). The lawsuit was
settled in 1991. In 1992, a Consent Decree was entered embodying the terms of the 1991
settlement agreement. The 1992 Consent Decree identified a number of specific actions the
State needed to undertake to address excess phosphorus in discharges from the EAA into the
Everglades. These include the development of a regulatory program for implementation of
performance-based best management practices (BMPs) to reduce phosphorus in outflows from
EAA farms, and creation of the initial 32,600 acres of STAs with 34,700 total acres to be
purchased. STAs are shallow marshes constructed and operated to reduce phosphorus levels in
surface water entering the EPA. The Consent Decree also included interim and long-term
phosphorus concentration limits for inflows to the Everglades National Park (ENP), and ambient
phosphorus levels for the Refuge marsh.

Purpose and Need

In 1994, expanding upon the 1992 Consent Decree, the Florida Legislature enacted the
Everglades Forever Act (EFA), which, following the approach identified in the 1992 Consent
Decree and the 1994 Everglades Protection Project Conceptual Plan, envisioned a two pronged
approach to achieving water quality standards in the EPA. First, the EFA directed the SFWMD to
implement a regulatory source control program requiring landowners in the EAA and adjacent
C-139 Basin to reduce phosphorus in their runoff prior to discharge. Second, the EFA required
the SFWMD to acquire land, then design, permit, and construct an expanded series of STAs to
further reduce phosphorus levels in stormwater runoff and other sources before it enters the
EPA. In 1995, the settling parties (United States of America, FDEP, and SFWMD) jointly moved
to modify the Consent Decree, including the size of and the deadline for completion of STAs, to
reflect changed circumstances and the enactment of the EFA by the Florida legislature in 1994.
Under the proposed modification, the USACE would have been responsible for construction of
STA-1 East which would discharge into the Refuge. The motion to approve those modifications
was granted in 2001. In the 1994 EFA, the STAs, also known as the Everglades Construction
Project (ECP), originally consisted of six large constructed wetlands totaling about 40,000 acres.
The STAs were expanded by approximately 5,000 acres in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 while in FY2012,
completion of construction of Compartments B and C resulted in an additional 12,000 acres of
treatment area, for a total of 57,000 acres of effective treatment area. As discussed below, the
latest proposed expansion embodied in the 2012 NPDES permit for the STAs will bring the STAs
to a total of approximately 63,000 acres and will provide an additional 110,000 acre-feet of
additional water storage (SFWMD 2013).
The EFA also required the development of a numeric total phosphorus water quality standard
for the EPA by December 31, 2003, or a default standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb) would
take effect. Although the default criterion did become effective, it was replaced with the
current 10 ppb criterion which includes a four part methodology to measure achievement of
the criterion (Rule 62-302.540 F.A.C.). If the STAs and source controls contemplated by the EFA
would not achieve water quality standards including the applicable numeric criterion for total
phosphorus in the EPA by December 31, 2006, the EFA required the SFWMD to submit a new
proposal to the FDEP by December 31, 2003, that would achieve compliance by 2006. In March
2003, the SFWMD developed and submitted the Long-Term Plan for Achieving Water Quality
Goals in Everglades Protection Area Tributary Basins (Long-Term Plan) to FDEP, which was
incorporated into the EFA by reference (Burns & McDonnell 2003). The Long Term Plan was
revised in October 2003. Also in 2003, the Florida legislature amended the EFA requiring the
SFWMD to implement the Long-Term Plan in two phases. The initial phase included physical
and vegetative enhancements to existing STAs, expanded source control programs in non-ECP
basins, and integration with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) projects.

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

The second phase was to be developed if the elements of the initial phase were unsuccessful in
achieving water quality standards in the EPA by 2016.
The STA expansions and enhancements described in the initial phase of the Long-Term Plan
have been completed and reductions in phosphorus concentrations have been achieved, but on
occasion, concentrations in the Refuge have exceeded levels proscribed in the Consent Decree.
Despite the success of these measures state and federal agencies recognize the need to further
improve the quality of water entering the Everglades in order to achieve the standards.
In 2004, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida (Miccosukee Tribe) and the Friends of the
Everglades (FOE) brought suit against the USEPA alleging that the 2003 EFA amendments were
new or revised state water quality standards that USEPA should have reviewed and
disapproved. The complaint also alleged that USEPA should have reviewed and disapproved
parts of the State’s phosphorus rule. USEPA already reviewed and approved the numeric
criterion and implementing methodology for total phosphorus. After several remands and
actions, in July 2008, Judge Alan Gold agreed with the Miccosukee Tribe and FOE and issued an
order enjoining FDEP from issuing new NPDES permits for the STAs that authorize discharges
above the 10 ppb phosphorus standard. The Judge also ordered USEPA to review and
disapprove the amendments to the EFA and to review the remainder of the State’s phosphorus
rule to determine if it is in compliance with CWA. In December 2009 USEPA issued a new
determination disapproving the EFA Amendments as new or revised water quality standards as
well as disapproving portions of the phosphorus rule. In response to motions filed by the
Miccosukee Tribe and FOE, on April 14, 2010, Judge Gold further ordered USEPA to issue an
Amended Determination identifying the remedies and strategies that the SFWMD would need
to implement to achieve the 10 ppb phosphorus standard in the EPA. The Court also ordered
the State to submit NPDES permits within 60 days of the Amended Determination that
conformed to the Court’s orders, and the Amended Determination.

1.3.1.1

Restoration Strategy

In response to Judge Gold’s April 14, 2010, order, the USEPA began a technical review of the
current phosphorus control technologies in order to develop a suite of remedies and strategies
to achieve water quality standards in the EPA. USEPA consulted with the SFWMD, FDEP, and
others during the development of these remedies and strategies. USEPA first identified a
WQBEL for discharges into the EPA that USEPA determined would achieve compliance with the
State of Florida’s numeric phosphorus criterion in the EPA. USEPA, after months of modeling of
various options and discussion, subsequently identified a suite of additional water quality
projects based on the modeling that would work in conjunction with the existing Everglades
STAs to meet the WQBEL for discharges from those STAs. USEPA’s Evaluation of Alternatives to

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

Achieve Phosphorus WQBELs in Discharges to the Everglades Area dated September 2, 2012, is
included in Appendix G.
On September 3, 2010, USEPA issued an Amended Determination (2010 AD) identifying a
recommended WQBEL, and a suite of remedies and strategies designed to achieve the WQBEL.
The 2010 AD is included in Appendix G.
In particular, the 2010 AD proposed that the A-1 site would be designated as an STA to
maximize phosphorus uptake. The size of the STA that the USEPA predicted would be needed to
meet the WQBEL was based on many factors and assumptions including the volume of flow to
be treated and the concentration of TP in these flows. Based on these assumptions, the
modeling predicted a 15,600 acre STA would be needed in the Central Flowpath to meet the
WQBEL at the discharge points of STA 2 and STA 3/4. The USEPA noted in the 2010 AD that
there may be other project designs that could meet the WQBEL and invited the SFWMD to
submit an alternative plan. Since the USEPA issued the 2010 AD, additional permitting
developments occurred.
On November 2, 2010, consistent with the Court’s April 14, 2010 Order, FDEP submitted
example NPDES permits to the Court and indicated that FDEP lacked State law authority to
conform to the 2010 AD without compliance schedules. After hearings, the Court issued a
subsequent order that deemed these permits as submitted to USEPA as draft permits for
review under the CWA. USEPA objected to these permits finding certain provisions, including
the use of the compliance schedules, inconsistent with the requirements of the CWA.
In addressing USEPA’s objections, the SFWMD began a new analysis of potential remedies,
starting with the work done for the Amended Determination. The SFWMD updated and
revised some of the flow data and hydrologic modeling upon which the USEPA had relied in
developing the projects for the 2010 AD. For example, the SFWMD plan assumed a slightly
lower volume of water to be treated, and relied upon different assumptions regarding TP
concentrations in the water to be treated. Both the 2010 AD and the SFWMD plan relied on the
use of the 15,000 acre A-1 site to store or treat water. However, the revised SFWMD plan
would utilize the A-1 site as a 54,000 acre-foot FEB to manage and meter water flow and
phosphorus load discharged into STA 2 and STA 3/4. Even though the FEB was not designed to
treat phosphorus, water depth in the Shallow FEB is projected by the State to support
vegetation that is likely to aid in the removal of additional phosphorus.
The new modeling relied data and information and options different than those relied upon by
the USEPA at the time of the 2010 AD. After extensive technical discussions with the SFWMD
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

1-9

July 2013

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

and the FDEP and thorough evaluation, the USEPA concluded that the State plan is based on an
appropriate set of assumptions given the information available at the time the plan was
developed. The USEPA determined that the State plan can reasonably be expected to achieve
the WQBEL.
The USEPA worked closely with other federal agencies, the SFWMD, and the FDEP to identify a
modified suite of remedies that was based on many months of additional modeling by the
SFWMD, ENP and the Refuge. Ultimately, these new remedies were incorporated into a draft
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and consent order, along with
an EFA permit and consent order, issued by FDEP on June 6, 2012. Historically, each STA had an
individual permit. It was decided to issue one watershed NPDES permit for all the STAs. The
2012 revised NPDES watershed permit, associate documents and draft enforcement consent
order between the FDEP and the SFWMD include corrective actions and deadlines to achieve
the WQBEL. These documents are in Appendix G and can be found online at the website:
http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wqssp/everglades/ecp-sta.htm.
USEPA found the permit addressed its objections, which led to final NPDES permit being issued
on September 10, 2012. The permit established a WQBEL and identified a suite of additional
water quality improvement projects developed by the State (in lieu of those in the Amended
Determination), identified as the Regional Water Quality Plan (RWQP).
This EIS, although independent from the evaluation performed by the USEPA in the Amended
Determination and subsequent evaluation associated with the 2012 NPDES permit recognizes
the prior discussions between the USEPA, SFWMD and FDEP. This is also reflected in USEPA’s
memorandum reviewing the State’s proposal, entitled, “Assessment of the State of Florida’s
Everglades Water Quality Plan,” dated June 13, 2012.

1.3.1.2

Water Quality Based Effluent Limit

The WQBEL is a numeric discharge limit that will be applied to all NPDES permitted discharges
from Everglades STAs to the EPA to assure that such discharges do not cause or contribute to
exceedances of the 10 ppb total phosphorus (TP) criterion [expressed as a long-term geometric
mean (LTGM)] established under 62-302.540, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.) (SFWMD –
Final Technical Support Document for the WQBEL 2012). TP is measured at a network of
stations across the EPA marsh and prevents imbalances of aquatic flora and fauna. The WQBEL
is measured at the discharge points from each STA and requires that total phosphorus
concentration in STA discharges shall not exceed: 1) 13 ppb as an annual flow-weighted mean
in more than three out of five water years on a rolling basis; and 2) 19 ppb as an annual flowweighted mean in any water year.

Purpose and Need

Regional Water Quality Plan

The RWQP was the result of many months of discussions and modeling by both the State of
Florida and ENP and the Refuge, and is composed of projects divided into the three EAA flow
paths (Eastern, Central and Western) (Figure 1-2). Under the RWQP, the proposed Shallow FEB
project, a component of the Central Flowpath, is an incremental step towards achieving the
overall goal of meeting water quality standards in the EPA. The Shallow FEB is the subject of this
EIS. Other projects identified in the RWQP will be evaluated as appropriate for those projects
requiring DA authorization under the CWA.

1.3.2 PRIOR DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY PERMITS
On October 14, 2004, (after passage of the EFA and before Judge Gold’s decision) a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) regarding acceleration of several CERP and other water
quality improvement projects was signed by the Governor’s Executive Office and the SFWMD.
Collectively the group of projects was named Acceler8. Acceler8, consisting of eight projects
with multiple components (Figure 1-4), was designed to expedite attainment of water quality,
quantity, timing and delivery goals of Everglades restoration efforts ahead of the federal
implementation schedule for CERP. The eight Acceler8 projects include:
• C-44 (St. Lucie Canal) Reservoir / Stormwater Treatment Area
• C-43 (Caloosahatchee River) West Reservoir
• Everglades Agricultural Area STA Expansion
• Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoir- Phase 1 (later phase to include Bolles and
Cross Canals Improvements)
• Water Preserve Areas Includes Site 1, C-9, C-11, Acme Basin B, Water Conservation Area3A/3B Seepage Management Area
• Picayune Strand (Southern Golden Gate Estates) Restoration
• Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands - Phase 1
• C-111 Spreader Canal
As part of the Acceler8 program, the SFWMD pursued construction of a 12.5-foot deep
reservoir on the A-1 project site for water storage ahead of the federal schedule for
implementation of a CERP reservoir project at that site. The 12.5-foot deep reservoir was to be
the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir – Phase 1 (fourth bullet above) project, also referred
to as the A-1 Reservoir. As described in the 2006 Final EIS for the EAA A-1 Reservoir, the overall
project purpose of the reservoir was to provide water storage in order to improve timing of
water deliveries from the EAA to the WCAs, reduce Lake Okeechobee regulatory releases to the
estuaries (i.e. route additional water from the lake south thereby reducing discharges to the

Purpose and Need

estuaries), meet supplemental agricultural irrigation demands, and increase flood protection
within the EAA. The purpose of the A-1 Reservoir and the current project differ (e.g. the current project
does not propose to route additional water from the lake south that would otherwise go to tide or to
meet supplemental agricultural demands). Additional information on the current proposal’s purpose
and need is provided in Section 1.5. A DA permit was issued to the SFWMD associated with the

construction of the 190,000 acre-foot A-1 Reservoir in July 2006. The SFWMD began
construction on the EAA A-1 Reservoir in 2006, but terminated the construction contract in late
2008. Subsequently, in 2008 the State of Florida announced the River of Grass proposal to
purchase additional lands in the EAA and C-139 Annex from the U.S. Sugar Corporation. The
SFWMD recognized that the acquisition of additional lands could lead to modifications of the
plan for the A-1 Reservoir beyond what was contemplated by the expedited project. The DA
permit for the A-1 Reservoir has since expired.
The SFWMD having terminated the plans for the reservoir, is now proposing to construct a
Shallow FEB (up to 4 feet of surface water) on the A-1 project site (Figure 1-5). The purpose of
this project is not to be confused with purpose of the A-1 Reservoir as the project purposes are
quite different. The main difference is that the A-1 Reservoir project purpose was to reduce
Lake Okeechobee regulatory releases to the estuaries (i.e. to route additional water from the
lake south thereby reducing discharges to the estuaries) and provide water storage for other
uses, while this project would only attenuate the flow of existing water into the STAs to
maximize water quality treatment for existing water, that is water currently sent south from
Lake Okeechobee (does not accept water releases that would have otherwise been sent to the
estuaries). To construct the Shallow FEB, a new DA permit will be required to fill waters of the
US, including wetlands.

Purpose and Need

1.3.3 TALISMAN LAND ACQUISITION
The need to obtain an interim land use change approval from the USFWS/DOI for construction
of the Shallow FEB on the A-1 project site is a requirement of the funding agreement entitled
Cooperative Agreement Among the United States Department of the Interior and the Nature
Conservancy and the South Florida Water Management District (Cooperative Agreement).
Congress enacted the 1996 Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (Farm Bill) and
provided funds on April 4, 1996 (Public Law 104-127, 110 Statute 1022). Under Section 390 of
the Farm Bill, the Secretary of Interior was authorized to use funds made available to conduct
restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem in South Florida, including, but not limited to
the acquisition of real property and interests in real property located within the Everglades
ecosystem. The Farm Bill provided that the Secretary of the Interior could transfer funds to the
USACE, the State of Florida, or the SFWMD to conduct the aforementioned restoration
activities.
A Framework Agreement was entered between the DOI, the Department of the Army, the State
of Florida, FDEP and the SFWMD, on October 3, 1996, which provides a framework for the
Secretary of Interior to provide funds under Section 390 to the other parties for Everglades
ecosystem restoration. The parties agreed to use Section 390 funds, in part, to acquire real
property for conservation purposes and to construct features that are intended to become part
of existing or future USACE projects authorized by Congress. The parties agreed, consistent with
the Farm Bill, to use Section 390 funds, in part, to acquire real property for conservation
purposes and to construct features that are intended to become part of existing or future
USACE projects authorized by Congress. The parties agreed, consistent with the Farm Bill, that
any real property acquired or features constructed with these funds will be used to conduct
restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem. The Framework Agreement also provides
that funding agreements between DOI, FDEP, and the SFWMD generally will use the standard
forms and follow the standard procedures of the USFWS pertaining to the provision of funds
including grants or cooperative agreements, whichever the case may be.
The Framework Agreement specifically provides that real property acquired may be managed
for purposes that are not inconsistent with the purpose of restoring the Everglades ecosystem
until the land is intended to be incorporated into a DA project. In addition, the Framework
Agreement provides a dispute resolution mechanism.
In 1999, the Nature Conservancy under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement closed on the
acquisition of approximately 50,000 acres of land located within the southern portion of the

A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

1-14

July 2013

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

EAA in Palm Beach and Hendry Counties. This acquisition, which included the Compartment A-1
lands, was the culmination of many years of negotiations.
The DOI transferred funds to the Nature Conservancy pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement,
and the SFWMD received the title to the properties acquired. The Cooperative Agreement
states that lands acquired for public ownership under this Agreement will be used and
managed for purposes of Everglades ecosystem restoration and will be subject to the provisions
of the Framework Agreement, including but not limited to, those provisions applicable to uses
of property prior to the commencement of the USACE project. Any proposed change in land use
of Compartment A-1 may not be implemented until the USFWS/DOI: 1) reviews the proposal; 2)
determines that it meets the requirements of the NEPA, Section 7 of the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and any other applicable
statutes; and 3) approves the proposal. The Cooperative Agreement also includes a procedure
for dispute resolution.
It is essential to Everglades restoration that water entering the WCAs achieves the WQBEL and
flows entering ENP meet the limits set in the phosphorus rule which are also the limits
identified in the 1992 Consent Decree, Appendix A for ENP. During the evaluation and
optimization for the A-1 project site the SFWMD determined a Shallow FEB would optimize the
treatment performance of the existing STA’s and be more cost effective than a deep FEB, or
reservoir.

1.4

DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTION

The proposed Shallow FEB is a shallow above-ground impoundment for the temporary storage
of stormwater runoff, with a capacity of approximately 60,000 acre-feet at an approximate
maximum operating depth of 4 feet (Figure 1-5). As a result of the project, approximately 435.9
acres of waters of the US, including wetlands, would be impacted as a result of placement of fill
and approximately 10,500 acres of waters of the US would be inundated (up to four feet of
water depth).
The key features of the Shallow FEB project include the following:

Purpose and Need

The proposed Shallow FEB is intended to attenuate peak water flows and temporarily store
excess water from within the central EAA, collected by the North New River and Miami Canals
and to subsequently improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA
3/4. By managing basin runoff in the Central Flowpath in a more advantageous manner, the
impacts of storm driven events would be reduced for STA 2 and STA 3/4. The proposed Shallow
FEB will also improve operations of the STAs in the dry season by providing water during the
periods of drought and low water conditions. Attenuating and managing excess water flows in
the Central Flowpath will enhance operations and improve phosphorus treatment performance
in STA 2 and STA 3/4 so that these STA discharges meet the WQBEL. Discharges from these
STAs flow into WCA 2A and WCA 3A, part of the EPA marsh where the 10 ppb phosphorus
criterion is applied.
The goals and objectives for the Shallow FEB are to assist STA 2 and 3/4 in achieving the WQBEL
at the STA discharge. The FEB will facilitate this in concert with the STAs in three ways:
1. Attenuate peak water flows and temporarily store runoff from the central EAA,
thereby minimizing the discharge of untreated water into the EPA
2. Improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4, thereby providing enhanced
operation and phosphorus treatment performance
3. Assist in maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout
conditions within STA 2 and STA 3/4, which will sustain phosphorus treatment
performance
Although the 2012 Consent Order requires that construction commence by June 2014 and be
completed by July 2016, the SFWMD is proposing to move forward on an accelerated basis.
The SFWMD anticipates that construction would begin in October 2013 and be completed by
March 2015. The Consent Order requires that 54,000 acre-feet of storage capacity be
constructed. Since the A-1 project site could support 60,000 acre-feet of storage, the SFWMD
has chosen to utilize the maximum storage on the site.

Purpose and Need

PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED

In accordance with the NEPA, an EIS “shall briefly specify the underlying purpose and need to
which the agency is responding” (40 CFR §1502.13). When considered together, the “purpose”
and the “need” for the project establish the basic parameters for identifying the range of
alternatives to be considered in an EIS. Under NEPA (33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B) and under
Section 404 of the CWA pursuant to the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230), there
are three ways that the USACE is to examine the underlying goals, or purpose, of a project: 1)
the Applicant’s stated purpose and need (i.e. SFWMD’s stated purpose and need), 2) a “basic”
project purpose defined by the USACE specifically for addressing a project’s water dependency,
and 3) an “overall” project purpose, which is defined by the USACE and is used for the
alternatives analysis. Pursuant to 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B, when defining the purpose and
need for a project, “while generally focusing on the applicant's statement, the USACE will in all
cases, exercise independent judgment in defining the purpose and need for the project from
both from the applicant’s and the public’s perspective.”
Interpreting the Applicant’s Stated Purpose and Need. The Applicant’s stated purpose and
need is an expression, typically in the Applicant’s own words, of the underlying goals for a
proposed project. The USACE takes an applicant’s purpose and need into account when
determining the overall purpose and the project purpose and need. The Applicant’s purpose
and need is described in Section 1.5.1 below.
Defining the USACE’s Basic Project Purpose. The USACE uses the basic project purpose to
determine water dependency [40 CFR §230.10(a)(3)]. If a project is not water dependent, other
alternatives that would not result in impacts to special aquatic sites are presumed to be
available. The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines state that practicable alternatives to nonwaterdependent activities are presumed to be available and to result in less environmental loss
unless clearly demonstrated otherwise by the applicant [40 CFR §230.10 (a)(3)]. Section 1.5.2.1
below defines the USACE’s basic project purpose as applied to the Applicant’s proposed project.
The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines are one of the substantive criteria that the USACE uses to
evaluate a permit. The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines establish two rebuttable presumptions:
first, for a non-water-dependant project, the Guidelines presume that practicable alternatives
are available that do not involve the discharge of dredged or fill material into a special aquatic
site, such as wetlands. Second, the Guidelines presume that such alternatives result in less
adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem than wetland alternatives. These presumptions apply
unless the applicant clearly demonstrates otherwise. Application of these rebuttable

A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

1-18

July 2013

Chapter 1

Purpose and Need

presumptions results in the identification of the least environmentally damaging practicable
alternative (LEDPA).
Defining the USACE’s Overall Project Purpose. The USACE will use the overall project purpose
to identify alternatives for evaluation in this EIS and to determine if the Applicant’s proposed
project is the LEDPA under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. According to USACE guidance in its
2009 Standard Operating Procedures, “The overall project purpose should be specific enough to
define the applicant’s needs, but not so restrictive as to constrain the range of alternatives that
must be considered under the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Defining the overall project
purpose is the USACE’s responsibility. However, the applicant’s needs and the type of project
being proposed should be considered.” The USACE’s overall project purpose more specifically
addresses the Applicant’s purpose and need than does the USACE basic project purpose. The
USACE’s overall project purpose, as applied to the Applicant’s proposed project, is defined in
Section 1.5.2.2 below.
Defining the USFWS/DOI’s Project Purpose and Need. The project purpose as defined by
USFWS/DOI is to conduct restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem. Because the
Compartment A lands were acquired for public ownership under the Cooperative Agreement
and are intended to be used and managed for purposes of Everglades Ecosystem Restoration
subject to the provisions of the Cooperative Agreement, any proposed change in land use of
Compartment A-1 may not be implemented until the USFWS/DOI approves the proposal.
Therefore, for purposes of this EIS, the USFWS/DOI must determine that the Proposed Action
constitutes conducting restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem in order to approve
the interim land use change for construction of the Shallow FEB.

1.5.1 THE APPLICANT’S PURPOSE AND NEED STATEMENT
The Applicant’s stated purpose and need is a statement that defines the intent and underlying
goals for a proposed project. The Applicant’s stated purpose and need are as follows:
The SFWMD’s purpose of the project is to improve inflow delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4 by
attenuating peak water flows and temporarily storing water runoff primarily from the central
EAA, and to assist in maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout
conditions within STA 2 and STA 3/4, which would increase the phosphorus treatment
performance of these STAs in order to achieve the WQBEL.
The RWQP identified that an FEB was needed to improve management of flows in the Central
Flow Path. The Central Flow Path is primarily comprised of flows from the S-2/S-6/S-7 and S3/S-8 drainage basins, South Florida Conservancy District, and South Shore Drainage District

with a small amount of water coming from the C-139 Basin and Lake Okeechobee regulatory
releases under limited conditions. An FEB in this location within the EAA can manage basin
runoff in the Central Flowpath in a more advantageous manner than the no action alternative,
thereby reducing the impacts of storm driven events and dry-outs on STA 2 and STA 3/4
phosphorus reduction performance in order to assist these STAs in meeting the WQBEL.

1.5.2 USACE PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED STATEMENT
As stated above, the USACE defines the basic project purpose to determine water dependency
while the overall project purpose is used to identify and evaluate alternatives, including the
LEDPA.

1.5.2.1

USACE Basic Project Purpose and Water Dependency

The basic project purpose is to improve water quality of flows from the STAs 2 and 3/4. In
general, improvement of water quality or water treatment does not require access or proximity
to a special aquatic site. Therefore, the USACE finds that the basic project purpose is not water
dependent.
The A-1 project site is located in an area which consists of agricultural areas as well as wetlands
and ditches (or other Waters of the US). The need to attenuate water and then deliver it to the
STAs located at the south of the central flow path will ultimately limit the location of any
alternative sites of comparable size that could be utilized to satisfy the project purpose.
Additionally, other project sites within the Central Flowpath would have similar site
characteristics as the entire EAA has similar characteristics. Therefore, limited practicable
alternatives exist that would not have a similar impact on special aquatic sites and none of
these would be able to deliver water to the STA 3/4 and STA 2 as needed to improve
performance. The USACE may authorize the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of
the US for a proposed project that is not water dependent if the USACE determines that the
proposed project: (1) is the LEDPA and complies with other Section 404(b)(1) Guideline
requirements, (2) is not contrary to the public interest, and (3) complies with all other
applicable regulatory requirements.
The USACE determined that the DA permit application for the proposed Shallow FEB is a single
and complete project as defined in 33 CFR §330.2(i). While the Regional Water Quality Plan
envisions multiple projects in three separate flow paths from the EAA into the Everglades, the
A-1 FEB project is the component of the Central Flowpath and has independent utility.

Purpose and Need

USACE Overall Project Purpose

The overall project purpose, as defined by the USACE, is to achieve the WQBEL at the STA 2 and
STA 3/4 discharge points in the Central Flowpath of the Everglades Protection Area.

1.5.3 DOI PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED STATEMENT
The purpose and need statement for the required USFWS/DOI interim land use change is to
conduct restoration activities within the Everglades ecosystem. Concurrent with the analysis
conducted by the USACE in this EIS, in order for approval of the interim land use change for
construction of the Shallow FEB, USFWS/DOI also must determine that the proposed action
constitutes restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem.

1.6

DECISIONS TO BE MADE

The Proposed Action would result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the
US, including wetlands, through filling, excavation, land clearing, and other activities. Under
Section 404 of the CWA (33 USC §1344), the USACE is responsible for regulating the placement
of fill and discharge of dredged material into the waters of the US, including wetlands.
Therefore, because the SFWMD is seeking approval of a permit from the USACE, a federal
agency, the project involves a federal action. Because any environmental consequences of
SFWMD’s proposed project are essentially products of the USACE permit action, the scope of
the federal permitting action includes all of construction activities associated with this action on
the project site. Based on review of this EIS, the USACE will make a decision to either issue,
issue with conditions, or deny a permit for the Proposed Action.
The Proposed Action, through the USACE permit review requires consultation under Section 7
of the ESA and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, the Proposed
Action would involve evaluation for compliance with the Section 404 (b)(1) Guidelines of the
CWA; Section 401 of the CWA, the Clean Air Act, and federal requirements under the 1996
Farm Bill Act. A draft of the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines evaluation is included in Appendix A,
the final evaluation will be provided in a Record of Decision that documents the DA permit
decision after completion of the Final EIS. Other authorizations required may include: a Water
Quality Certification issued pursuant to Section 401 of the CWA through the FDEP; a Coastal
Zone Management Act consistency determination under Section 307 issued by FDEP; an EFA
permit from FDEP; a Conceptual Reclamation Plan issued by the FDEP; and a Zoning and Land
Use Permit issued by the appropriate county. If the STA is selected as the preferred alternative,
a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit for construction and operation of an
STA may also be required. Consultation and coordination, including public involvement, are

included in Chapter 7 of this EIS while a description of the required permits, licenses and
environmental laws are described in Chapter 8.

1.7

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

One of the basic tenets of NEPA is that comprehensive information is made available to the
public and agency officials before decisions are made and before actions are taken. In addition,
NEPA gives all persons, organizations, and government agencies the right to comment on
proposed federal actions that are evaluated by an EIS. To provide the public with the
comprehensive information they need to comment, the early identification of issues and
potential impacts is critical to efficient, effective EIS preparation. To obtain public input for this
Final EIS and to ensure that the information provided in the Final EIS was comprehensive, the
USACE sought input both early in the process, as required by NEPA, and throughout the
development of this document. The opportunities for public input available during the EIS
development are summarized in the following paragraphs.

1.7.1 SCOPING SUMMARY
The scoping process helps to establish the framework for the environmental study and
facilitates the development of the reasonable range of feasible alternatives to be evaluated in
the EIS. The goal of scoping is to provide opportunities for the public and agencies to provide
input on the proposed project. The lead federal agency uses scoping comments to identify the
nature and extent of potential issues and impacts.
To solicit public comments and develop a range of alternatives, the USACE held a public scoping
meeting, published the intent to complete an EIS in the Federal Register, distributed a public
notice, conducted a press release to media outlets, and consulted with agencies and federally
recognized Native American Tribes letters by mail. The USACE generated a mailing list of
interested parties which includes parties that had previously been involved with the A-1
Reservoir mailing list, a list of parties generated by the FDEP for the watershed NPDES permit
for the STAs parties on the distribution list for the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP)
and the River of Grass project, and parties interested in the EAA, as well as adjacent
landowners, State, Federal, and local governments. Approximately eighteen (18) people
attended the Scoping meeting which was held on September 6, 2012, at the SFWMD
Auditorium, 3300 Gun Club Road, West Palm Beach, Florida.
During the formal scoping period from August 28, 2012, to September 27, 2012, fourteen (14)
issue-specific comments were identified in the communication received from the public and
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Purpose and Need

agencies. In general, comments received were related to one or more of the following nine (9)
major categories:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

general support for the project,
potential for improved habitat,
water quality,
fish and wildlife resources,
the interrelationship with the federal Central Everglades project,
wetland mitigation and a contingency plan,
effects of operation,
alternative analysis, and
downstream water quantity.

Scoping comments were used in conjunction with the USACE defined overall project purpose to
develop the full range of alternatives presented in Chapter 2. Specific public and agency input
received during scoping was used to inform the scope and range of issues addressed. This input
included:
•
•

geographic extent of the affected environment,
evaluation of the deep FEB, or reservoir, as an alternative.

1.7.2 ISSUES ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED ANALYSIS
The following issues were eliminated from detailed analysis based on public and internal
scoping:
•

•

Essential Fish Habitat – Since the proposed project would not change the amount of
freshwater that currently is released from Lake Okeechobee to tide, the project would
not affect essential fish habitat in the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries.
Air Quality – Although a new pump station would be required for the deep FEB and the
STA alternatives, no measurable changes in air quality are expected to occur as a result
of any of the alternatives. There may be a negligible impact on carbon monoxide
emissions within the project area as the pumps are expected to be standard flood
control diesel pump stations similar to those at G-370 and G-372. Short term increases
would be associated with earth-moving equipment and activities required to accomplish
the proposed construction activities, but those short-term impacts will be intermittent
in nature and likely offset by the cessation in use of agricultural equipment. Alternatives
2, 3, and 4 require exotic plant removal, which is anticipated to occur by burning. The

Purpose and Need

increase in air quality pollution associated with the vegetation burning is short term.
Long-term effects are associated with the operation of the existing pumps. However, it
is anticipated that there would be slight long-term improvements in air quality due to
the changes in land use from agricultural to uses such as water storage and native
wetland habitats.
Noise Pollution - No measurable changes in noise are expected to occur as a result of
any of the alternatives. Noise impacts are expected during construction activities;
however, this would be temporary in nature and limited to the immediate area of
construction. The long-term noise impacts are associated with the operation of the
existing pumps, which is not expected to cause concerns for humans or fish and wildlife
species.
Transportation – Any effect on highways from construction traffic would be short term
and would not cause extended delays on adjacent highways. These impacts could be
considered negligible considering the scope of construction work. Railways that exist in
the EAA to transport sugar cane and the mainline railroad, South Central Florida
Express, are not anticipated to be affected by Action Alternatives based on their
distance from project site.
Water Supply and Drinking Water - The project purpose does not involve increasing or
decreasing system performance for water supply or drinking water.

1.7.3 PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT EIS
Once the Draft A-1 Shallow FEB EIS was completed, regulations required that it be issued
publicly to obtain the comments of (1) any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is authorized to develop
and enforce environmental standards; (2) appropriate State and local agencies; (3) American
Indian Tribal Governments, when the effects may be on a reservation; and (4) the public, which
consists of those persons or organizations who may be interested or affected (40 CFR 1503.1).
This section summarizes the public comment period process relating to the release of the Draft
A-1 Shallow FEB EIS and the major comments raised by the public.
A Notice of Availability for the Draft A-1 Shallow FEB EIS was issued on February 22, 2013 (ERFRL-9007-8; see Appendix D). The formal public comment period began on February 22, 2013,
and ended April 8, 2013. In addition, Federal agencies, State and local governmental entities,
American Indian Tribal Governments, and the general public were encouraged to submit
comments via U.S. mail, e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter.
Eleven (11) comment letters were received on the Draft A-1 Shallow FEB EIS. Comments were
received from (1) Federal agencies, including USEPA and the U.S. Department of the Interior; (2)

evaluating the accuracy and adequacy of the draft EIS to determine whether its text needed to
be corrected, clarified, or otherwise revised. The content of all comments was examined and
summarized into major comment categories, and responses were developed for each of these
categories, as appropriate. This summary is provided as Appendix F of this Final EIS along with
copies of the comments received. Several topics raised by public comments on the Draft A-1
Shallow FEB EIS are of broad interest or concern. These issues are addressed throughout the
Final EIS and are more fully responded to in the “Comment/Response Document,” Appendix F.

Purpose and Need

RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS

A number of previously published environmental documents contain information relevant to
this EIS. Brief summaries of some of the most relevant environmental documents are provided
in the following paragraphs. The reports and documents listed below were utilized to varying
degrees as sources of information to evaluate the proposed project and have helped to inform
the USACE as it developed this EIS on construction and operation of the Shallow FEB.

1.8.1 FINAL EIS – EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA RESERVOIR A-1
This EIS, which was completed in 2006, is the USACE’s NEPA document for the decision to
construct a reservoir on the project site. Even though the purpose of the previously permitted
reservoir is different from the purpose of the proposed Shallow FEB, much of the information
to develop the alternative to construct a Deep FEB, or reservoir on the project site was based
on the 2006 EIS. In addition, background information and descriptions of the affected
environment were derived from the 2006 EIS.

1.8.2 FINAL EIS TO CONSTRUCT STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS ON
COMPARTMENT B AND C OF THE EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA,
FLORIDA
The USACE completed an EIS in January 2009 for the construction of three additional STAs in
the EAA. Two of the three additional STAs include the Compartment B North Build-out and
Compartment B South Build-out, which expanded STA 2. The third additional STA is
Compartment C, which is located west of the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area in Hendry
County and is part of the STA 5/6 complex. Because the proposed Shallow FEB is intended to
assist STA 2, the Compartment B and C EIS was used as a source of reference material since
Compartment B expanded the treatment capacity of STA 2. Information in the Compartment B
and C EIS was used to help develop background information, to update information needed to
describe the affected environment, and to support the technical information used to evaluate
the environmental effects.

1.8.3 SOUTH FLORIDA ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT
The South Florida Environmental Report (SFER) is an annual document that consolidates the
scientific and engineering efforts made by various agencies throughout south Florida related to
Everglades Restoration. As a requirement of the 1994 EFA, the SFWMD, in cooperation with
the FDEP, compiles various agencies’ reports into a single document to summarize and update
the accomplishments on South Florida’s environmental restoration and other key activities.

Purpose and Need

The final SFER of 2012 and draft report of 2013 were used to provide information in the EIS on
the existing STAs and water quality data.

1.8.4 FINAL SUPPLEMENTAL EIS FOR THE LAKE OKEECHOBEE REGULATION
SCHEDULE 2008
The Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule (LORS) 2008 is included in the modeling
assumptions for the proposed project. LORS 2008 is an operating schedule for Lake
Okeechobee that balances competing water use objectives including flood control, water
supply, navigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife resources. LORS lessened some of the
impacts to the environment from the previous regulation schedule (referred to as Water Supply
and Environment) by operating the lake at a lower level, and accommodated for the Herbert
Hoover Dike structural limitations. A final Supplemental EIS was completed in November 2007
and a ROD was signed in April 2008.

1.8.5 EVERGLADES RESTORATION TRANSITION PLAN
The Everglades Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP) is the water management operating criteria
for Central and Southern Florida Project features and the constructed features of the Modified
Water Deliveries and Canal-111, which was recently adopted. The ERTP is a modification of the
Interim Operational Plan to incorporate operational flexibilities designed to improve
hydrological conditions in WCA 3A for the endangered Everglade snail kite, endangered wood
stork, and wading bird species while maintaining protection for the endangered Cape Sable
seaside sparrow. An EIS was completed for the project, and the Record of Decision was signed
on October 19, 2012.

1.8.6 WATER CONSERVATION AREA 3 DECOMPARTMENTALIZATION & SHEET
FLOW ENHANCEMENT
Water Conservation Area 3 Decompartmentalization and Sheet Flow Enhancement report,
which was completed in May 2007, documents the historical, hydrologic, meteorological and
water quality data for WCA 3A and the surrounding area. The document was used to compile
existing or baseline conditions of WCA 3A and existing water flows from WCA 3A and 3B.

ecosystem in WCA 3A and 3B, which supported the existing site conditions for fish and wildlife
habitats, wildlife usage, water flows, water quality, water management, and hydrology.

1.8.8 USEPA AMENDED DETERMINATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE OF
FLORIDA'S EVERGLADES WATER QUALITY PLAN
On September 3, 2010, the USEPA issued its Amended Determination in order to ensure that
the water entering the EPA from the EAA and C-139 Basin meets the pertinent water quality
standards in the shortest time possible. On June 13, 2012 USEPA issued a memorandum
entitled, “Assessment of the State of Florida’s Everglades Water Quality Plan.” This
memorandum documents the history and evolution of the efforts by USEPA, FDEP, and SFWMD
since the issuance of the Amended Determination to define the pertinent water quality
standards and the means for achieving them. These documents are discussed in further detail
in section 1.3.1.1.

1.8.9 NPDES AND EFA PERMITS
On June 13, 2012, FDEP received notification from the USEPA that the permit and associated
projects the FDEP submitted on June 6, 2012, addressed USEPA’s objections and were sufficient
to achieve the phosphorous standard for the EPA. On June 20, 2012, FDEP issued a Notice of
Draft Permit for both the Everglades Forever Act watershed permit and proposed consent order
and the NPDES watershed permit and proposed consent order for the operation and
maintenance of the ECP STAs. The FDEP issued signed permits on September 10, 2012. These
permits address all of the STAs, including 2 and 3/4. The NPDES permit number for the STAs is
FL0778451 while the EFA permit number is 0311207.

2.0 ALTERNATIVES
This chapter outlines the process used to determine the range of reasonable alternatives to the
proposed action and presents each alternative to be considered. Several alternatives to the
Applicant’s proposal were evaluated for their ability to meet the overall project purpose as
presented in Chapter 1, including the feasibility, timeliness, and responsiveness to the issues
and concerns identified during public scoping. This evaluation process concluded with a range
of reasonable project alternatives, including:
• Alternative 1: No Action
• Alternative 2: Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (Applicant’s Proposed Action)
• Alternative 3: Deep Flow Equalization Basin
• Alternative 4: Stormwater Treatment Area

2.1

REGULATORY SETTING FOR ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS

Both the Council of Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
Implementation Procedures [40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §1502.14] and the United
States Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) NEPA Implementation Procedures (33 CFR Part 325,
Appendix B) require consideration of a range of reasonable alternatives for a proposed action.
Defining a range of reasonable alternatives is a key element for subsequent analyses in an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The CEQ (1981) describes the alternatives as being the
“heart of the environmental impact statement,” and alternatives that are considered
reasonable under NEPA include those alternatives “that are practical or feasible from a
technical and economic standpoint and using common sense.” The USACE’s NEPA
Implementation Procedures define reasonable alternatives as “those that are feasible, and such
feasibility must focus on the accomplishment of the underlying purpose and need (of the
applicant or the public) that would be satisfied by the proposed Federal action (permit
issuance).” The USACE‘s regulations further provide that only reasonable alternatives need to
be considered in detail and that the reason for eliminating alternatives from detailed study
should briefly be discussed in the EIS [33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B, sec. 9.a. (5) (a)]. NEPA
regulations require that agencies consider a range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed
action, including consideration of a “No Action” alternative; the regulations do not, however,
require consideration of every conceivable variation of an alternative (40 CFR §1502.14). In
addition, these regulations provide that, while the USACE shall not prepare a cost benefit
analysis of the alternatives, the EIS should indicate any cost considerations that are likely to be
relevant to a decision [33 CFR Part 325, Appendix B, sec. 9.a.(5)(d)].

Chapter 2

Alternatives

The substantive criteria used by the USACE to evaluate a permit are the Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230) promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA). The guidelines require the evaluation of “practicable alternatives,” and are
used to identify the Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) to ensure
that “no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable
alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic
ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental
consequences.” The guidelines define an alternative as practicable “if it is available and
capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in
light of overall project purposes” (40 CFR §230.10 [a][2]). The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines
indicate that the analysis of alternatives for NEPA environmental documents will in most cases
provide the information required to evaluate the alternatives under the guidelines (40 CFR
§230.10 [a][4]).
The USACE and cooperating agencies evaluated and screened the alternatives mindful of both
the NEPA requirements and the 404(b)(1) Guideline requirements. As a result, the alternatives
analysis in this EIS also satisfies the requirement under both NEPA and the Section 404(b)(1)
Guidelines. Additional analysis required to comply with the Guidelines is included in Appendix
A. As described below, the USACE and cooperating agencies examined the full scope of
possible alternatives and components and systematically arrived at the range of reasonable and
practicable alternatives. Through this process, the USACE believes that it has captured all of the
alternatives and components necessary to determine whether the Applicant’s proposed project
is the LEDPA.

2.2

PRELIMINARY SCREENING OF ALTERNATIVES

The USACE implemented a structured process to develop and screen alternatives for the A-1
Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB) project, with a goal to consider the broadest range of
possible alternatives and identify the range of reasonable and practicable alternatives that
would advance for comparative analysis. The intent of an iterative process is to eliminate
impracticable and unreasonable alternatives as early in the process as practical to allow the
USACE and the cooperating agencies to focus detailed evaluation on practicable and reasonable
alternatives. For some proposals there may exist a very large or even an infinite number of
reasonable alternatives if the proposed alternatives could vary from one another due to an
infinite number of incremental changes (e.g., various water depths). Nevertheless, only a range
of reasonable and practicable alternatives need be considered. The USACE and cooperating
agencies worked together to consider the development and screening process. Although the
USACE sought the consensus of the cooperating agencies in determining reasonable and
practicable alternatives that would meet the water quality goals of the project, the USACE’s
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

2-2

July 2013

Chapter 2

Alternatives

analysis, which is reflected in a chronological order below, is independent of USEPA’s prior
analysis in the 2010 Amended Determination (AD), and therefore, a Stormwater Treatment
Area (STA) alternative was not identified as an alternative in the USACE’s analysis until later in
the process.
The initial step in the process was identification of possible alternative concepts for achieving
the purpose and need of the project (see Chapter 1). Two alternatives that are always
examined in an EIS are the No Action Alternative and the Applicant’s Preferred Alternative.
Because the USACE had originally evaluated a range of alternatives and issued a permit for the
A-1 Reservoir on the project site, the USACE determined that the A-1 Reservoir was an
alternative to the proposed project. The A-1 Reservoir was included in the Notice of Intent to
draft an EIS published in the Federal Register prior to the Scoping meeting.
Alternative 1: No Action. As required by the CEQ, the EIS must consider as an
alternative the possibility of not permitting the project. For this alternative, the activities
that are considered would only be those that would not require a Department of the
Army (DA) permit to discharge fill into waters of the United States (US) [33 CFR Part
325, Appendix B, Paragraph 9.b.5(b)].
Alternative 2: Shallow FEB (Applicant’s Proposed Action). The Applicant is proposing to
construct a shallow (approximate depth of four feet) FEB on the A-1 Project Site. The
Shallow FEB is proposed to improve delivery rates to STA 2 and STA 3/4 by attenuating
and temporarily storing peak stormwater flows to assist in maintaining optimal water
levels and minimizing the frequency of dryouts within STA 2 and STA 3/4. This
alternative is described in greater detail in Section 2.4.2 below.
Alternative 3: Deep FEB. A deep reservoir, known as the A-1 Reservoir, was previously
the subject of NEPA and Section 404 permit review for this site; therefore, the USACE
determined that the construction of a deep FEB similar to the previously authorized A-1
Reservoir is a reasonable alternative to the construction of a shallow FEB for
consideration. A deep reservoir was also was the subject of a detailed review by the
USEPA as referenced in USEPA’s 2010 AD. The construction of the deep reservoir, or
deep FEB, may also provide for flow attenuation, and the flow attenuation could provide
water quality benefits to the STAs. Therefore, a Reservoir was considered as a
reasonable alternative to the applicant’s proposed project. This alternative is described
in greater detail in Section 2.4.3 below.
During public scoping meeting, it was suggested that a deep Reservoir and the restoration of a
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

2-3

Chapter 2

Alternatives

pond apple slough south of Lake Okeechobee (offsite of the A-1 project site) should be
considered as alternatives. During the public scoping comment period, the USEPA commented
that an STA alternative was also included in the 2010 AD and should be incorporated into the
USACE’s alternatives analysis. The scoping comments are documented in Chapter 7. At the
conclusion of the scoping period, the USACE and the cooperating agencies considered the goals
of the project to generate other potential project alternatives that were not previously
considered to be evaluated along with the alternatives listed above. Additional alternatives
evaluated at this point included:
•

A Deep Reservoir - This alternative had already been identified and carried
forward as Alternative 3, which was initially identified as the A-1 Reservoir. A
reservoir has similar characteristics of a Deep FEB. However, as previously
described, the previously permitted A-1 Reservoir has a different project
purpose than would be served by the proposed project. To avoid confusion with
the name and purpose of the previous A-1 Reservoir project, this alternative,
which will be carried forward for further evaluation, has been renamed as a
Deep FEB (approximate depth of 12.5 feet).

•

Utilizing other treatment technologies to treat and remove phosphorus from the
Central Flowpath

•

Utilizing other lands not currently owned by the Applicant as possible off-site
Alternatives

•

The restoration of a pond apple slough south of Lake Okeechobee

•

Construction of a Stormwater Treatment Area on the Project Site. The
construction of a STA also was the subject of a detailed review by the USEPA in
the 2010 AD.

These four additional alternatives were then assessed based on their practicability, which is
determined based on their ability to meet the USACE overall project purpose. The USACE
coordinated with the cooperating agencies and the applicant to obtain additional details about
the Applicant’s proposed project as well as the other alternatives. Based on the review, the
following alternatives were not considered practicable alternatives and were, therefore,
eliminated from further analysis:
•

Utilizing other treatment technologies to treat and remove phosphorus from the
Central Flowpath. Various alternative treatment technologies, such as the
Hybrid Wetland Treatment Technology pilot project and the Northern Everglades
Chemical Treatment pilot project, are currently being conducted in the Northern
Everglades watershed. The pilot projects are in various stages of testing.
Similarly, other treatment technologies are unavailable to practicably meet the

overall project purpose.
•

Utilizing other lands not currently owned by the Applicant as possible offsite
Alternatives. The USACE evaluated the practicability of utilizing properties not
currently owned by the Applicant for offsite alternatives to be carried forward
for further analysis. Given the project purpose, an alternative project site would
need to work in association with and be in close proximity to STA 2 and 3/4 to
meet the WQBEL at the STA discharge points. The A-1 project site is ideally
located adjacent to both STA 3/4 and STA 2, allowing it to provide benefits to
both STAs. Noting that the A-1 project site was contiguous to STA 2 and STA 3/4,
USEPA stated in the 2010 AD that the A-1 site was “strategically located for an
expansion of the current STAs” and did not provide the SFWMD any scheduled
time to aquire additional lands within the Central Flowpath.
Any project developed on another site must be acquired by the State, which
requires time for land acquisition. In USEPA’s 2010 AD, USEPA found acquisition
times “were highly variable and has ranged from two to eight years.” The USACE
conducted a survey of eleven of the Applicant’s restoration land acquisition
experiences spanning between 1991 to 2009 and found that land acquisition has
taken as little as three years and as long as 17 years to complete, with an
average of 6-7 years. Acquisition time depends upon the number of willing
sellers and increases due to the number of involved landowners. Other lands
adjacent to STA 2 and STA 3/4 not owned by the Applicant are agricultural lands
located north of STA 2, which are privately owned and utilized by three entities:
Okeelanta Corporation, New Hope Sugar, and King Realty Company. None of
these companies are known willing sellers. Due to the land acquisition time
frames (up to 17 years) and the subsequent time for site development and
construction, the USACE determined that utilizing lands not currently owned by
the applicant would be an alternative that is not available to the applicant and is
impracticable.

•

The restoration of a pond apple slough south of Lake Okeechobee (offsite
alternative). Although a pond apple slough restoration project could provide
environmental benefits, there is no evidence that it would ensure achievement
of the Water Quality Based Effluent Limits (WQBEL) at the STA discharge points.
Therefore, this alternative does not satisfy the project purpose. Additionally,
this alternative would be contingent upon the purchase of land currently
unavailable to the applicant, which the USACE has determined is impracticable.

Alternatives

The alternative that was not eliminated during the practicability analysis (the construction of an
STA on the project site) was advanced to the next step of the alternatives development process.
The USACE’s independent alternatives development and USEPA’s alternatives analysis results in
the same suite of alternatives: a Shallow FEB, a Deep FEB, and an STA.
Alternative 4: A Stormwater Treatment Area. The construction of an STA may also
ensure that the WQBEL is met at the discharge points of STA 2 and STA 3/4, and
therefore an STA on the A-1 project site is considered a practicable alternative to the
applicant’s proposed project. The USEPA had fully evaluated the STA alternative, found
that it would attain the WQBEL at the discharge points for STA 2 and STA 3/4, and
recommended this option during the development of the 2010 AD.

2.3

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA AND A FLOW
EQUALIZATION BASIN

2.3.1 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA
STAs are large-scale freshwater wetlands constructed to remove phosphorus from urban and
agricultural runoff prior to discharge to the Everglades. Phosphorus is removed from the water
column through physical, chemical, and biological processes such as sedimentation,
precipitation, plant growth, microbial activity and the accumulation of dead plant material that
is converted to a layer of soil. A typical STA has multiple cells that are divided into several
parallel treatment paths or flow ways. Water flows through these systems via water control
structures, such as pump stations, gates, or culverts. The plant communities in STAs are broadly
classified as emergent aquatic vegetation (EAV) or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV).
Interspersed among this vegetation, where conditions are favorable, are floating aquatic
vegetation and periphyton communities. In contrast to conventional chemical treatment
technologies which are designed to allow real time active control of treatment processes to
provide technically reliable performance, STAs are, biological systems which are more complex
and reliant on multiple factors that are less controllable and subject to natural perturbations.
STAs are highly managed and maintained wetlands and typically require intensive monitoring
networks to enable continuous evaluation of vegetation conditions and treatment
performance. Proactive management of both desirable and undesirable vegetation within STAs
is critical to achieving and sustaining treatment performance. In addition, STA dryout is a major
concern due to potential spikes in phosphorus concentrations that can occur upon rehydration.
Therefore, strategies to manage STAs during dry conditions include proactive measures to
maintain minimum water levels in an effort to reduce vegetation stress and maintain treatment

Alternatives

performance. Additional STA acreage increases the risk of STA dryout (and potential
performance reduction) and requires additional water to maintain minimum STA water levels,
often at times when regional water supplies are limited and demands are high.

2.3.2 FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
FEBs are impoundments constructed to temporarily detain excess surface water flows prior to
release into STAs. The FEBs are not intended to treat the water, but to store it during high
water events until the optimal time when STA needs additional water. The FEBs would then
pump water into the STAs at an ideal rate once the peak runoff flows have subsided in the
canals. The FEB would achieve normal full stage level only during peak runoff conditions and is
not intended to store water for any extended length of time after pumping operations cease.
However, during the rainy season and extreme wet years, the FEB site could experience staged
water levels for significant durations. The vegetation within the FEB is expected to be
herbaceous wetland plants that are likely to aid in the removal of additional phosphorus.

2.4

DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVES

As well as providing the full range of reasonable alternatives for NEPA, the four alternatives also
establish the range of practicable alternatives that will be evaluated to determine the LEDPA
per USACE guidance related to Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act (40 CFR Part 230). The
following sections provide detailed information on the four reasonable alternatives.

2.4.1 ALTERNATIVE 1: NO ACTION
NEPA regulations require consideration of the No Action Alternative, which can be used as a
benchmark for comparison of the environmental effects of the various alternatives. The No
Action Alternative would result from the USACE not issuing a DA permit for fill in waters of the
US regulated by the USACE under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Without a DA permit, no
additional fill could be discharged into waters of the US.

2.4.2 ALTERNATIVE 2: SHALLOW FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN (SOUTH FLORIDA
WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT’S PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE)
Alternative 2 is a 15,000-acre shallow FEB with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4
feet, and is South Florida Water Management District’s (SFWMD) Preferred Alternative. In the
2010 AD, the USEPA proposed that the A-1 project site be utilized as an STA to maximize
phosphorus uptake. After issuance of the 2010 AD, the SFWMD updated and revised some of
the hydrologic modeling upon which the USEPA had relied in developing the projects for the
2010 AD utilizing new data, information, and options that were unavailable at the time of the
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Alternatives

2010 AD. In 2012, the SFWMD proposed that a Shallow FEB in place of the STA design would
better manage and meter water flow and phosphorus load discharged into STA 2 and STA 3/4.
After extensive technical discussions with the SFWMD and FDEP and thorough evaluation, the
USEPA concluded that the modified plan was based on an appropriate set of assumptions and
could reasonably be expected to achieve the WQBEL (USEPA 2012). Both alternatives (a Shallow
FEB and an STA) are being evaluated for this EIS. Construction of the Shallow FEB would result
in impacts to 435.9 acres of waters of the US to include 280.1 acres of fill to construct the levee
and 112.8 acres of fill to raise the elevation of canals and ditches, as well as the discharge of fill
material associated with excavation of 43.0 acres of waters of the US. Operation of the
shallow FEB would inundate 10,820.3 acres of jurisdictional wetlands and 1,214.7 acres of
uplands to create an emergent marsh habitat.
Alternative 2 would include the following components:









Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee heights for 4 feet
maximum operating depth)
Interior levees to convey inflows to the north end of the FEB (6.5+/- miles)
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA 3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

The site contains 1,200 foot wide areas that have been scraped down to the cap rock along the
perimeter of the site that would be incorporated as a flow path into the interior footprint of the
Shallow FEB. By utilizing the available scraped down area as a flow path, it has been
determined by the SFWMD, based on preliminary hydraulic analyses, that the existing pump
stations G-370 and G-372 currently have the capability to deliver flows to the north end of the
FEB.
Inflows will be conveyed to the Shallow FEB via two proposed operable water control structures
by the existing STA 3/4 inflow pump stations G-370 and G-372. The Shallow FEB will receive
runoff from the Miami Canal via existing pump station G-372, and from the North New River
Canal via existing pump station G-370. After inflows are conveyed to the north end of the
Shallow FEB, the water will be spread utilizing the northern scraped area to enable sheet flow
from north to south. An internal collection canal will be constructed to assist in conveying
water out of the Shallow FEB. Outflows will be conveyed by operable water control structures
to the North New River Canal. Operable water control structures may also be constructed to

allow discharges to be conveyed via gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. The perimeter
seepage canals constructed during the EAA A-1 Reservoir project have been evaluated by the
SFWMD and determined to be adequate to protect adjacent properties, including US Highway
27. The majority of the Shallow FEB outflows (approximately 80%) will be directed to STA 3/4
for treatment while the remaining flows (approximately 20%) will be conveyed to STA 2
(including Compartment B) via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations.

2.4.3 ALTERNATIVE 3: DEEP FLOW EQUALIZATION BASIN
Alternative 3 is a 15,000-acre deep Flow Equalization Basin, with a maximum operating depth
of approximately 12.5 feet. A deep FEB can attenuate flows to the STAs to improve STA
performance. This differs from typical storage reservoirs, including the earlier design that was
the subject of the 2006 EIS that often have multiple objectives such as water supply for the
environment, urban, or agricultural uses. Similar to the Shallow FEB, construction of the Deep
FEB would result in impacts to 576.6 acres of waters of the US to include 533.6 acres of fill to
construct the levee and the discharge of fill material associated with excavation of 43.0 acres of
waters of the US. Operation of the deep FEB would inundate 10,820.3 acres of jurisdictional
wetlands. As the inundation would be greater than four feet during parts of the year, emergent
marsh habitat at the site would have a less optimal hydrology during those times when the
water levels are greater than four feet. The remainder of time when water levels are below
four feet, it is anticipated that either submerged aquatic or emergent marsh vegetation would
be present.
Alternative 3 was assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:










Perimeter Levees around the FEB (> 20 miles; 20-30 feet levee heights for a maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet)
Inflow Pump Station to direct North New River Canal flows into the FEB to the maximum
operating depth of 12.5 feet
Internal collection canal to assist in conveying water out of the FEB
Operable water control structures to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of
the FEB
A cutoff wall to minimize or eliminate seepage impacts to adjacent areas
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect FEB seepage and return to FEB/STA 3/4
Degradation of portions of major agriculture roads
Demolition of the existing test cells
Demolition of the existing Talisman and Cabassa pump stations

Based on hydraulic analyses, the existing pump stations G-370 and G-372 currently do not have
the capability to deliver flows to the Deep FEB up to the maximum operating depth of 12.5 feet.
Therefore, a new inflow pump station located at the northeast corner of the Deep FEB would

be required to deliver flows to the Deep FEB up to the maximum operating depth of 12.5 feet.
Inflows will be conveyed to the Deep FEB via two proposed operable water control structures
by the existing STA 3/4 inflow pump stations G-370 and G-372 and a new inflow pump station.
The Deep FEB will receive stormwater runoff from the Miami Canal via existing pump station G372, and from the North New River Canal via existing pump station G-370 and the new inflow
pump station.
An internal collection canal may be constructed to assist in conveying water out of the Deep
FEB. Outflows will be conveyed by operable water control structures to the North New River
Canal. Operable water control structures may also be constructed to allow FEB discharges to be
conveyed via gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. A new cutoff wall and the perimeter
seepage canals constructed during the EAA A-1 Reservoir project will likely be improved to
protect adjacent properties, including US Highway 27. The majority of the Deep FEB outflows
(approximately 60%) will be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining flows
(approximately 40%) will be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B) via the G-434 and G435 pump stations.

2.4.4 ALTERNATIVE 4: STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA
Alternative 4 is a 15,000-acre STA, with a maximum operating depth of approximately 4 feet. As
previously mentioned, the USEPA’s AD proposed that a the A1 Site be utilized as an STA to
maximize phosphorus uptake in association with STA 2 and STA3/4. After issuance of the 2010
AD, the SFWMD updated and revised some of the hydrologic modeling and proposed the
Shallow FEB in place of the STA design. After extensive technical discussions with the SFWMD
and FDEP and thorough evaluation, the USEPA concluded that the plan was based on an
appropriate set of assumptions and could reasonably be expected to achieve the WQBEL. Both
alternatives are being evaluated for this EIS. The proposed STA would have a normal operating
depth of approximately 1.25 – 1.5 feet and a maximum operating depth of approximately 4
feet. The proposed A-1 STA would operate in parallel with STA 2 and STA 3/4. Construction of
the A-1 STA would result in impacts to 986.4 acres of waters of the US to include 353.6 acres of
fill to construct the levee, 112.8 acres of fill to raise the elevation of canals and ditches, 270
acres of canal excavation, and 250 acres of excavation and fill within Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area (Holey Land). Wetland impacts within the Holey Land are required to
construct a new discharge canal to allow treated discharges from the A-1 STA to be conveyed to
the L-5 Canal. The new discharge canal would be proposed west of STA 3/4 Cells 3A and 3B
while the existing STA 3/4 discharge canal south of STA 3/4 Cell 3B would be expanded. Within
the proposed A-1 STA, over 10,500 acres of waters of the US would be inundated to create an
emergent marsh habitat similar to other STAs.

Alternative 4 was assumed to include the following components, at a minimum:

Perimeter Levees around the STA (> 20 miles; 8-10 feet levee height for 4 feet maximum

Interior levees dividing the STA into cells

Internal distribution canals to facilitate sheetflow through the cells
Internal collection canals to assist in conveying water out of the cells
Seepage canal and pump station(s) to collect STA seepage and return to STA
Operable water control structures to control water levels and flows into and out of all
STA cells

For this EIS, the A-1 STA represented in Alternative 4 was assumed to utilize the existing STA
3/4 inflow pump stations (G-370 and G-372) to convey stormwater runoff to the proposed A-1
STA. Inflows are then assumed to be conveyed via inflow canals to the north end of the project
site. Flows would then be distributed to the A-1 STA cells via water control structures and
conveyed north-to-south and collected in internal collection canals. In order to operate the A-1
STA, construction of conveyance features in addition to construction of the A-1 STA itself will be
required. Specifically, a discharge canal would need to be constructed within the Holey Land to
connect the A-1 STA discharge canal to the L-5 Canal. This would enable the delivery of
discharges from the proposed A-1 STA to Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A and/or WCA 3A
via existing infrastructure, without interfering with the existing operations of STA 2, STA 3/4
and the North New River and Miami Canals.

2.5

COMPONENTS COMMON TO ALL ACTION ALTERNATIVES

The following components of the Central Flowpath, including STA 2 (including Compartment B)
and STA 3/4, WCA 2A and WCA 3A are common to all of the alternatives although the timing
and volumes of inflow and outflow to the components would vary by alternative.

2.5.1 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA 2
STA 2 is a 16,000-acre constructed wetland marsh system which was designed to reduce
phosphorus concentrations in surface water. The facility is located within southern Palm Beach
County and is immediately adjacent to the western boundary of WCA 2A. STA 2 consists of
Flow-way 1 (Cell 1), Flow-way 2 (Cell 2), Flow-way 3 (Cell 3), Flow-way 4 (Cells 4, 5 and 6), and
Flow-way 5 (Cells 7 and 8) (Figure 2-1). STA 2 currently receives runoff from the S-2, S-5A, S-6
and S-7 Basins, East Shore Water Control District and 715 Farms (also known as Closter Farms).
Runoff collected by the North New River Canal is pumped into STA 2 via the G-434 and G-435
pump stations. Runoff collected via the Hillsboro Canal is pumped into STA 2 via the S-6 pump

station. In addition, stormwater runoff from agricultural lands adjacent to STA 2 is pumped into
STA 2 via the G-328 pump station. Treated discharges from STA 2 are pumped into the L-6
Canal, and then conveyed to either northern WCA 2A through a set of box culverts or to
western WCA 2A through a section of degraded L-6 Canal levee.

2.5.2 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREA 3/4
STA 3/4 is a 16,000-acre constructed wetland marsh system which was designed to reduce
phosphorus concentrations in surface water. The facility is located in southern Palm Beach
County between STA 2 and the Holey Land. STA 3/4 consists of the Eastern Flow-way (Cells 1A
and 1B), the Central Flow-way (Cells 2A and 2B), the Western Flow-way (Cells 3A and 3B), and
the Periphyton-based STA Implementation Project. STA 3/4 currently receives agricultural
and/or urban runoff from the S-2, S-3, S-7, S-8, and C-139 Basins, the South Shore Drainage
District and the South Florida Conservancy District. Runoff collected by the North New River
Canal is pumped into STA 3/4 via the G-370 pump station. Water collected via the Miami Canal
is pumped into STA 3/4 via the G-372 pump station. Treated discharges from STA 3/4 are

2.5.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS 2A AND 3A
WCA 2A operates under the current Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project regulation
schedule. Operations of WCA 2A also include regulatory releases to the Atlantic Ocean through
the Lower East Coast canals, as documented in the C&SF Project Water Control Plan for Lake
Okeechobee and Everglades Agricultural Area (Water Control Plan), (USACE, June 2008). In
addition, no net outflows from WCA 2A to maintain minimum stages in the Lower East Coast
Service Area canals (salinity control) are assumed, if water levels in WCA 2A are less than the
minimum operating criteria of 10.5 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29).
Any water supply releases below the minimum operating criteria are matched by an equivalent
volume of inflow, typically from Lake Okeechobee.

WCA 3A operates under the current Everglades Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP) regulation
schedule. As discussed in Chapter 1, ERTP is the water management operating criteria for
Central and Southern Florida Project features and the constructed features of the Modified
Water Deliveries and Canal-111, which were recently adopted. Since this new operating regime
went into effect in October 2012, the ERTP regulation schedule for WCA 3A, as per South
Florida Water Management Model alternative 9E1, was assumed for this EIS. Operations of
WCA 3A also include regulatory releases to the Atlantic Ocean through the Lower East Coast
Canals, as documented in the Water Control Plan (USACE, June 2008). In addition, no net
outflows from WCA 3A to maintain minimum stages in the Lower East Coast Service Area canals
(salinity control) are assumed, if water levels in WCA 3A are less than the minimum operating
criteria of 7.5 feet NGVD29. Any water supply releases below the minimum operating criteria
are matched by an equivalent volume of inflow, typically from Lake Okeechobee.

Affected Environment

3.0 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
This chapter provides a description of the physical, biological, chemical, and human
environments that could be affected by alternatives evaluated. The existing conditions are
presented in either a regional- or area-specific context depending on the nature of the resource
or the anticipated effect to that resource.

3.1

GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Lake Okeechobee, located north of the project area, is an approximately 730-square-mile
freshwater lake located north of the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) with an average depth
of roughly 9 feet (USACE 2007a). The depressional area, now occupied by Lake Okeechobee,
was formed approximately 6,000 years ago when the Okeechobean Sea receded (Lodge 2004).
The depressional area then filled with water during the following period of wetter conditions.
Historically, water flowed south from the lake to the Everglades through a series of small
tributaries at the southern portion of the lake. Once the headwaters of the Everglades, the
waters are now contained by the Herbert Hoover Dike and by an earthen levee around the
southern perimeter of the lake. Discharges, water levels, and flows are highly managed through
a series of water control structures and canals including the structures that discharge water to
the EAA.
The EAA is located south of Lake Okeechobee primarily in western Palm Beach County (Figure
3-1), extending south to Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3A. It is bounded on the east by the
Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, which is WCA-1 (herein referred to as
the Refuge), WCA 2A, the Western C-51 Basin, the L-8 Basin, and on the west by the C-139
Basin. Historically, the EAA was pond apple swamp forest on the southern shore of Lake
Okeechobee and an extensive sawgrass wetland, which have been drained and put into
agriculture production. The former wetlands produced the rich organic peat and muck soils that
today make it a highly productive agricultural area. As of September 30, 2011, there were
474,622 acres of land under active agricultural production in thirty-two (32) South Florida
Water Management District (SFWMD) permits in the EAA (Office of Agricultural Water Policy
2011). The agricultural area designation was formally established in the 1950s and associated
water management infrastructure was substantially completed in 1962 (USACE and SFWMD
2004). As of 2004, sugar cane was reported to be the area’s dominant crop with approximately
898 square miles (575,000 acres) of active sugar cane fields; this harvest provides 50 percent of
the sugar produced nationally (USACE and SFWMD 2004).

Affected Environment

Runoff from the EAA, which contains relatively high levels of nutrients (mainly phosphorus and
nitrogen from particulate matter and fertilizers), drains from the agricultural canals to the
secondary canals, then into the six main primary canals, and are eventually discharged into the
Everglades Protection Area (EPA) or to tide. In addition to flood protection, the canals and
water control structures convey regulatory and/or water supply releases from Lake
Okeechobee to the EAA, the WCAs, and the Everglades National Park (ENP). The canals also
provide for municipal water supply to eastern Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties
(Cooper 1989).

As described in Chapter 1, the Central Flow Path consists of the bulk of the EAA. In relation to
the above described features, Compartment A-1 (A-1 project site) is at the south central portion
of the Central Flowpath and immediately north of Stormwater Treatment Area (STA) 3/4

The physical, biological, chemical, and human environments of those areas that may be
affected include land use; geology, topography, and soils; hydrology to include surface water
and ground water hydrology; water quality; climate; vegetation and cover types; threatened
and endangered species; fish and wildlife species; aesthetics; cultural, historic and
archaeological resources; socioeconomics; environmental justice; recreation; hazardous and
toxic wastes; and flood protection. The spatial extent of the effect for each components
described in this chapter varies based on the geographic extent of effects on the environment
being described and will be addressed by topic.
Areas not considered as part of the affected environment include Lake Okeechobee, C-139
Basin, and the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area since the No Action Alternatives and the
Action Alternatives would have no effect on these areas.

3.3

LAND USE

The general pattern of land use within the region of South Florida consists of an expanding zone
of urban development within the coastal strip adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean; a large area
dominated by intensive agricultural use east, south, and west of Lake Okeechobee; and a band
of largely undeveloped land within the EPA. The following discussion addresses existing land
use patterns within the project site, the STAs and other areas including the WCAs and the Holey
Land.

3.3.1 PROJECT SITE
On March 26, 1999, the Nature Conservancy (TNC) closed on the acquisition of approximately
50,000 acres of land located within the southern portion of the EAA in Palm Beach and Hendry
Counties. This acquisition was the culmination of many years of negotiations. The complex
transaction was structured in two phases involving agreements between Talisman Sugar
Company and other sugar companies, the Departmetn of the Interior (DOI), TNC, and the
SFWMD. The DOI provided $99,434,312 in federal Farm Bill funds for the acquisition of these
lands and the SFWMD provided $12,939,906. Compartments A, B, and C lands were purchased
in part with this acquisition as described in the Framework Agreement
The land acquisition included the 16,000-acre A-1 project site. The SFWMD has managed the A1 property under agricultural leases prior to the land being utilized for a restoration project. A
project to construct a reservoir on the A-1 project site was included in the Comprehensive
Environmental Restoration Plan (CERP) as it was designed to improve the quantity, quality,
timing and delivery of water in the Everglades. The reservoir would have provided water

storage in order to improve timing of water deliveries from the EAA to the WCAs, reduce Lake
Okeechobee regulatory releases to the estuaries, meet supplemental agricultural irrigation
demands, and increase flood protection within the EAA. In 2006, SFWMD was given
Department of the Army (DA) authorization to construct the reservoir on the A-1 project site.
USFWS/DOI provided approval for the interim land use change for construction of the reservoir.

3.3.2 STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS
STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4 were constructed and are being operated to
provide water quality improvement in discharges to the EPA. Physical features within the
existing STAs include the constructed wetlands and the associated water management
infrastructure (such as levees, canals, and water control structures). Land cover within the STAs
is primarily a mixture of open water, emergent, and submergent marshes. Land use for these
areas can be classified as public/institutional or conservation. To varying degrees, the STAs also
support ancillary recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing.

MANAGEMENT AREA
WCAs 2 and 3 abut the southern boundaries of the EAA (Figure 3-1). WCAs 2A and 3A were
designated primarily to receive flood waters from adjacent areas and store the waters for
beneficial municipal, urban, and agricultural uses; however, they are currently managed for
multiple uses including flood protection, water supply storage, and environmental resource
protection. The Holey Land is managed for environmental resource protection. The Florida
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWCC) currently manages the fish and wildlife
resources in the WCAs and the Holey Land.

GEOLOGY, TOPOGRAPHY, AND SOILS

3.4.1 GEOLOGY
At the project site, the upper carbonate sand and limestone constitutes the Fort Thompson
Formation. Below this, shelly sand and sparse limestone constitutes the Caloosahatchee
Formation and possibly part of the Tamiami Formation. The top of the Fort Thompson
Formation consists of a hard limestone layer about four and a half to five feet thick, which is
locally called caprock. The caprock is generally white, light gray, tan or yellowish brown. The
caprock is underlain by silty carbonate sand extending to about 23.5 to 24.5 feet deep, where
another hard limestone layer one and a half feet to three feet thick is encountered. A thinner,
hard limestone layer about one half foot to one foot thick is often encountered at around 16 to

17 feet deep. The sand and lower limestone layers are generally white to very pale brown.
Laboratory testing of the sand sampled in the borings averaged 84.2 percent calcium carbonate
content with an average of 22 percent passing the #200 sieve in gradation tests. Visual
inspection of the sand samples from the borings revealed that they include shell fragments, and
tend to be angular and platy (USACE 2006).
All the Fort Thompson Formation limestone layers exposed in core or in excavations at the
project site are very fossiliferous. The sand exposed in the seepage collection canals and
dewatering sumps was abundantly fossiliferous with gastropods, pelecypods, corals, and
echinoderms.
Portions of the project site and surrounding areas also contain the Caloosahatchee Formation.
The top of the Caloosahatchee Formation is composed of fine grained, subrounded, shelly
quartz sand that is mixed with shelly carbonate sand similar to that in the Fort Thompson
Formation. The Caloosahatchee Formation at the site is 30 to 60 feet thick; however, the
interface between this formation and the underlying Tamiami Formation is difficult to define.
The proportions of carbonate to quartz sand vary. Laboratory testing on the sampled sand
indicated an average calcium carbonate content of 40.1 percent and an average of 12.1 percent
of material passing through the #200 sieve. The primary color of the geologic material in the
Caloosahatchee Formation is light greenish gray (USACE 2006).
Other geologic information may indicate that the Caloosahatchee Formation is not present at
the project site. For instance, geological work (Reese and Cunningham, 2000) has redefined the
stratigraphy of the area. Presently, the Tamiami Formation has several recognized named and
unnamed geologic members including the Ochopee Limestone Member and the Pinecrest Sand
Member. Both Tamiami Formation members contain sandy strata, but the Pinecrest Sand
Member is principally shelly, fine grained, quartz sand. Therefore, interpretation of the contact
between the Caloosahatchee Formation and Tamiami Formation at the project site is not
possible (USACE 2006).

3.4.2 TOPOGRAPHY
The Central Flowpath consists of agricultural lands in the EAA, the project site, STAs 2 and 3/4,
and the Holey Land, while WCA 2A and WCA 3A are located south of the Central Flowpath. The
topography within the Central Flowpath and the WCAs 2A and 3A is relatively flat. The EAA
contains elevations generally less than 18.6 feet North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988,
and the ground surface generally slopes from north to south with an average gradient of 0.15
foot per mile.

With the exception of work performed at the site under the permit for the previous A-1
Reservoir Project, the majority of elevations of the unfilled and unexcavated areas at the site
range from 7 to 9 feet NAVD 1988 (SFWMD recordings, 2012). A seepage canal was constructed
just within the east, west, and north property borders of the project site, with elevated areas
inside the canal where the associated fill was placed. In addition, a remnant mining area in the
northeast portion of the project site has elevations less than 5 feet NAVD 1988, and an adjacent
stockpile area with elevations up to 15 feet NAVD 1988. The elevations of areas surrounding
the project site generally range from 6 to 11 feet NAVD 1988 (SFWMD recordings, 2012). See

3.4.3 SOILS
According to the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Survey of 1988, 96 percent of the
EAA is composed of the following series of soils: Torry muck (7%), Terra Ceia muck (9%),
Pahokee muck (27%), Lauderhill muck (40%), Dania muck (10%), and Okeechobee muck (3%).
The remaining 4 percent of the EAA is composed of sands (Okeelanta muck) (Bottcher and
Izuno 1994). Historically, the EAA was part of the largest region of organic soils, commonly 14
feet thick or more. Through the years of draining and agricultural production, these soils have
been significantly reduced or in some areas even lost completely (Lodge 2004). Recent studies
have been conducted on the subsidence of soils in the EAA, and it is projected that by 2050
nearly half of the EAA will have less than 8 inches of soil, which means the soil elevation on
average is decreasing 0.6 inches a year (Snyder 2004).
The A-1 project site contains Pahokee muck (primarily in the southern portion of the site) and
Lauderhill muck (primarily in the northern portion of the site). Numerous soil borings, taken
from 50 to 100 feet below ground surface, were completed within the project site in December
2004 and January 2005. The borings generally penetrated through approximately one half to
two feet of surficial peat/muck and marl, then through 22 to 26 feet of primarily carbonate
sand and limestone, and then into primarily shelly quartz sand with sparse limestone to their
completed depths. The marl beneath the peat and muck is known by some authors as the Lake
Flirt Marl (Reese and Cunningham, 2000; Harvey et. al., 2002), but is undifferentiated from the
peat and muck layer for this EIS.
South of the EAA, the WCAs and Holey Land primarily consists of muck and peat type soils, with
the underlying substrate classified as marl and/or limestone. Other soils in these areas that
have poor natural drainage (predominantly alfisols and entisols with histosols) include fine sand
and loamy material.

HYDROLOGY

Water in the EAA is managed to provide flood protection, irrigation, and fresh water for the
EAA and surrounding environmentally sensitive areas through a series of canals, levees,
culverts, gates, and pumps (USACE and SFWMD 2004). Within the Central Flowpath, three
major canals pass through the EAA and receive flows from Lake Okeechobee and runoff from
the EAA: Hillsboro Canal, North New River Canal, and Miami Canal. Discharge from Lake
Okeechobee and runoff from the EAA, which contain relatively high levels of nutrients (mainly
phosphorus and nitrogen from particulate matter and fertilizers), drain from the agricultural
canals, to the secondary canals, into the primary canals. These three canals discharge to the
STAs through pump structures as detailed below.
STAs outflow into WCAs, which serve as surface water impoundments developed to provide
water supply, water storage, flood control, and wildlife conservation (SFWMD 2007) and are
subjects of Everglades restoration activities. At times, when conditions do not allow for the
STAs to treat all runoff water prior to discharge, diversion to the WCAs may occur without
treatment. WCAs are Everglades wetlands surrounded by levees and typically include a rim
canal located on the inside of the levees next to the largely undisturbed peat soils and wetland
plant communities. The marsh vegetation, along with the east coast protection levee, prevents
floodwaters that historically flowed eastward from the Everglades from flowing into the
developed areas along the southeast coast of Florida (USACE 2011).

3.5.1 OVERALL WATER MANAGEMENT
Currently, water levels in Lake Okeechobee are managed by a regulation schedule by
transferring water through a complex system of pumps and locks. The Lake Okeechobee
regulation schedule attempts to achieve the multiple-use purposes as well as provide seasonal
lake level fluctuations. Flood control improvements around Lake Okeechobee consist of a
system of approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of encircling levees, designed to withstand a
severe combination of flood stage and hurricane occurrence.
The management of water from Lake Okeechobee to the EPA is through the network of canals
constructed as a result of the Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) Project. The C&SF Project’s
intention was to provide water storage in the WCAs and to better control water levels in the
Everglades for multiple purposes. The construction of canals, levees, and roads has eliminated
the historical freshwater sheet flow and resulted in changes in the timing and quantity of flow
within the system that have influenced water quality conditions and impacted the downstream
EPA. On average, about 900,000 ac-ft of water is discharged from and through the EAA to the
south and southeast, historically mostly discharging into the EPA (Abtew and Khanal, 1994;
Abtew and Obeysekera, 1996). Four primary canals (Hillsboro Canal, North New River Canal,
Miami Canal, and West Palm Beach Canal) and three connecting canals (Bolles Canal, Cross
Canal, and Ocean Canal) facilitate runoff removal and irrigation water supply. Currently
runoff/drainage from the EAA is discharged to the STAs for treatment and released to the
WCAs.
The WCAs are regulated for the Congressionally-authorized C&SF project purposes to provide
flood control; water supply for agricultural irrigation, municipalities and industry, and ENP;
regional groundwater control and prevention of saltwater intrusion; enhancement of fish and
wildlife; and recreation (USACE 2011). The current operating regime for WCA 3A is Everglades
Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP). ERTP superseded the 2006 Interim Operational Plan (IOP)
because the IOP was no longer a viable option for water management within WCA 3A based on
the status of endangered species within WCA 3A. The ERTP maximizes operational flexibilities
to provide further hydrological improvements consistent with protection of multiple listed
animal species, including the Everglades snail kite, wood stork and other wading birds and their
habitats in south Florida, while maintaining nesting season requirements for the Cape Sable
Seaside Sparrow, along with C&SF Project purposes. Water management operating criteria
outlined within ERTP is to be superseded once the features of the Modified Water Deliveries
(MWD) to the Everglades National Park project and the C-111 Project are available for water
management operations. Therefore, the ERTP serves as a transition plan between the previous
2006 IOP for Protection of the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow and a future operational plan.

3.5.2 SURFACE WATER
3.5.2.1

Project Site

The surface water hydrology at the A-1 project site is currently rainfall driven. The site was
previously farmed as agricultural lands, but the agricultural activities have ceased. As a result
of the prior construction activities for the A-1 Reservoir, a seepage canal was constructed
within the north, east and west border of the project site. The canal was not completed. To
maintain flow, the levee at the south end of the A-1 project site was degraded to allow surface
runoff to enter the STA 3/4 seepage canal. Therefore, the surface waters currently flow from
the existing agricultural ditches to the STA 3/4 seepage canal.

3.5.2.2

Stormwater Treatment Area 2

The general management goal for STAs is to maintain shallow inundation in emergent aquatic
vegetation cells (EAV) for most of the year and to maintain shallow inundation of submerged
aquatic vegetation (SAV) cells throughout the year. Dry out and desiccation of submerged
aquatic vegetation and associated periphyton communities causes mortality and a significant
reduction in phosphorus removal performance.
Inflows. STA 2 currently receives water from the North New River Canal, which is pumped into
the STA via the G-434 and G-435 pump stations. Runoff collected via the Hillsboro Canal is
pumped into STA 2 via the S-6 pump station. In addition, runoff from agricultural lands adjacent
to STA 2 is pumped into STA 2 via the G-328 pump station.
Outflows. Treated discharges from STA 2 are pumped into the L-6 Canal via the G-335 and G436 pump stations, and then conveyed to either northern WCA 2A through a set of box culverts
or to western WCA 2A through a section of degraded L-6 Canal levee. See Figure 3-6 for a

Runoff collected by the North New River Canal is pumped into STA 3/4 via the G-370 pump
station. Runoff collected via the Miami Canal is pumped into STA 3/4 via the G-372 pump
station.
Outflows. Treated discharges from STA 3/4 are conveyed to the STA 3/4 Discharge Canal and L5 Canal, and then conveyed to either western WCA 2A via the S-7 pump station, to eastern
WCA 3A via S-150, or western WCA 3A via the S-8 pump station. Pump station G-404 can also
be operated to convey treated STA 3/4 discharges to the northwest corner of WCA 3A and to
provide supplemental irrigation water supply to the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation (in
conjunction with pump station G-409). See Figure 3-7 for a simple schematic of STA 3/4.

Water Conservation Area 2A

Water within either the Hillsboro Canal or the North New River Canal enters into WCA 2A from
STA 2 and STA 3/4 primarily through pump stations S-7 (STA 3/4), G-335 (STA 2), and G-436
(STA 2). Pump stations deliver water from the canals to the WCAs. The S-7 pump station has an
adjacent gated spillway that can be opened to allow water supply deliveries from WCA 2A to
the EAA. Surface water inflows to WCA 2A also enter from the Refuge through the S-10A, S-10C,
and S-10D spillways located along the L-39 Levee. An interior levee (L-35B) across the southern
portion of WCA 2 subdivides WCA 2A from WCA 2B. The majority of the surface water flows
from WCA 2A into WCA 3A primarily through the S-11 spillways; however, a portion is released
via the S-144, S-145 and S-146 structures to WCA-2B. When pool elevations in WCA 2B exceeds
11.0 feet NGVD, water is discharged from WCA 2B to the North New River Canal via spillway
structure S-141.

Water Conservation Area 3A

WCA 3A receives water from Lake Okeechobee, WCA 2 and the EAA via the North New River
and Miami Canals with the majority of the inflows delivered from WCA 2A through the S-11
spillways. Another large source of water entering into WCA 3A is from STA 3/4 and STA 5, which
enter through the S-8 and G-404 pump stations, and the S-150 and G-357 culverts, all of which
are located at the northern boundary of WCA 3A. Under high water conditions, water flows
across the open portion of the western boundary of WCA 3A and into Big Cypress National
Preserve. However, surface outflows are primarily made to the ENP through the S-12 spillways
and the S-333 structure.
The S-140 pump station discharges runoff from the C-139 Annex, as well as the Seminole Tribe
of Florida Big Cypress Reservation and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida Reservation
located along the northwestern boundary of WCA 3A. Water supply deliveries to the Seminole
Tribe of Florida Big Cypress Reservation are made via the G-409 pump station located just west
of the northwest corner of WCA 3A. Sources of water for this pump station include Lake
Okeechobee (delivered via the G-404 pump station), STA 3/4, STA 5, STA 6, Rotenberger and
Holey Land WMAs, EAA runoff, and WCA 3A.
Interior levees (L-67AC) across the southeast portion of WCA 3 subdivide WCA 3A from WCA
3B. WCA 3B receives most of its water from rainfall, but occasionally receives water supply
releases from WCA 3A via the Miami and L-67 Canals (through S-151). Water is discharged from
WCA 3B to the adjacent basins through the S-31 and S-337 structures via the Miami Canal,
although plans are underway to enable discharges to the Northeast Shark River Slough along
the northeast boundary of ENP from WCA 3B via the S-355 structures (Cooper, 1991; Grein et
al., 2003; Hwa, 2003; SFWMD, 2000; SFWMD Operations, 2003; Smelt, 2003; STRIVE, 1999; and
USACOE, 1999).

3.5.2.6

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Historically, inflows to Holey Land occurred via inflow pump station G-200A. The source of
inflows was the portion of the Miami Canal (L-23, L-24 and L-25) south of STA 3/4 diversion
structure G-373, which typically contains stormwater runoff that has been treated by either STA
3/4 or STA 5/6. However, in October 2005, Hurricane Wilma severely damaged G-200A,
rendering it inoperable. To date, this pump station has not been replaced. As a result, limited
surface water inflow capacity exists through the G-372HL box culvert located near STA 3/4
inflow pump station G-372. Outflows from Holey Land to the L-5 Canal could occur via culverts
with flashboard risers (G-204, G205 and G-206) (SFWMD, 2013). However, since April 2008,

Affected Environment

there has been no surface water inflow to the Holey Land, and no outflows have occurred since
January 2006. Essentially, Holey Land has become a rainfall-driven system and no longer
functions as a flow-through system (Figure 3-8). The area dries out routinely, and re-wets
depending on rainfall amounts (SFWMD, 2013).
Figure 3-8 Location of Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

3.5.3 GROUNDWATER
The Lake Okeechobee area contains a surficial aquifer system consisting of all the rocks and
sediments from land surface to the top of the limestone. In the Central Flow Path, the high
organic content of the soil makes the surficial groundwater generally undesirable for domestic
use except close to Lake Okeechobee. This aquifer is recharged directly by two sources: Lake
Okeechobee and rainfall. Lake Okeechobee provides water for a variety of consumptive
demands, including urban drinking water, irrigation for agricultural lands, and recharge for
wellfields.
Beneath the surficial aquifer is the Floridan aquifer system. It is the largest aquifer in Florida
and the most productive in the world. This system underlies an area of approximately 100,000
square miles (258,999 km2) in Florida, southeastern Alabama, southern Georgia, and southern
South Carolina. This aquifer is composed of a thick sequence of limestone layers and is divided
into Upper Floridan and Lower Floridan, by a less permeable middle confining unit of

carbonates. In the EAA, the water of the Floridan aquifer is rather salty, particularly in the
Lower Floridan (Sprinkle, 1989).
The intermediate confining unit is located approximately 200 to 250 feet below ground surface
(bgs) and will restrict any seepage from the project site that might reach this depth. There is a
high degree of communication between groundwater and surface water in the area, the
groundwater gradient in the surficial aquifer system is controlled, to a large extent, by the
operation of the hundreds of canals throughout the region. Therefore, even though the
general regional gradient in the surficial aquifer system is believed to be southward, localized
gradients may actually be in other directions in portions of the area surrounding the project site
due to the operation of canals and wells in the region.

3.5.4 STA PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL
Native soils within STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4 are primarily organic muck. As
dead emergent plant material is accumulated in the EAV cells, the material slowly is converted
to a layer of peat soil. In submerged aquatic vegetation cells, the decomposing plant matrerials
form mostly mineral soils. The accretion of new soil primarily from vegetation and detritus
material in the STA occurs at a rate of approximately 1.2 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.8 cm/yr, respectively
(Bhomia, Rupesh 2012).
STAs remove phosphorus from water by channeling the water through shallow marshes with
either emergent wetland vegetation or submerged wetland vegetation, both of which remove
phosphorus in different ways (Figure 3-9). For SAV-based treatment, the dominant phosphorus
removal pathway binds inorganic phosphorus with soil calcium while EAV treatment enhances
phosphorus storage by plant uptake and peat burial (Bhomia and Reddy 2012). Water
containing inorganic phosphorus enters the wetland system. In the EAV treatment system, the
wetland plants take up or absorb phosphorus from the water. As the plant material
decomposes, the detritus material containing the phosphorus become sediments and provides
substrata for microbial growth where phosphorus is converted to a bioavailable form. In the
SAV treatment system, the limestone layer beneath the sediment absorbs or co-precipitates
the phosphorus and makes it unavailable. As a whole system, phosphorus reduction in the STAs
is carried out by the various physical, chemical, and biological processes, but it primarily takes
place at the soil-water-plant roots interface, assisted by microbes in the water column and
within the soil layer. Ultimately, the removal of phosphorus occurs as it is sequestered in the
accreted soils.

Affected Environment

STAs periodically experience dryout events as a result of drought conditions or management
related activities (Figure 3-10). Upon re-flooding, phosphorus stored in the soils can be remobilized into the water column and released into downstream canals and/or wetlands (Figure
3-11). Several factors can potentially affect phosphorus release from STA soils. These include,
but are not limited to, the degree of prior sediment enrichment, hydrologic pattern (i.e.
continuously flooded versus periodic dryout), forms and concentrations of phosphorus in soil,
minerals, inflow water chemistry, oxidation-reduction potential, vegetation conditions, and
management activities (DeBusk and Kharbanda 2013).
Between Water Years 2002 and 2012, STA 2 experienced dryout conditions in at least five (5)
water years, with approximate durations ranging from 1 to 5 months. STA 3/4 experienced
dryout conditions one time since Water Year 2005, with a duration of less than one month.
Below are detailed descriptions of dryout conditions for STA 2 and STA 3/4.

conditions for approximately 1 month during Water Year 2011. Cell 4 experienced dryout
conditions for several months in Water Year 2011, but this was related mainly to Compartment
B construction activities. Cell 1 experienced dryout conditions for a brief period in June 2011.
Cell 4 experienced dryout conditions for several months in Water Year 2012 related mainly to
Compartment B construction activities.
STA 3/4
The Water Year 2011 dry season resulted in dryout conditions in all cells of STA 3/4 for
approximately 1 month (June 2011). The dryout of SAV resulted in the near total loss of live
vegetation.

WATER QUALITY

Historically, the Everglades was an oligotrophic (or low nutrient) system. Therefore, the
increased levels of nutrients present in portions of the system today have resulted in an
imbalance in the native flora and fauna, for example, cattails and other invasive species
displacing native sawgrass. Currently, nutrient inputs into the Everglades come primarily from
agricultural fertilizers and decomposition of the peat soils, which is accelerated by continued
agricultural use. While the increased concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other
nutrients are a concern in the EPA, historically vegetation growth in the Everglades was limited
by the comparative lack of bioavailable phosphorus. Thus, phosphorus is a parameter of
particular concern in the water of Lake Okeechobee, the EAA, and the EPA.
Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) were implemented in the EAA in the 1990s,
with the result of improving water quality. However, this area remains a primary source of
pollutants for the WCAs. The WCAs form the remnant wetland communities for the northern
section of the Everglades system. Water moving south from Lake Okeechobee and EAA is
pumped through the STAs into WCAs, which are isolated by a series of levees and pump
stations. Construction of STAs upstream of the WCAs serves to improve water quality
conditions through time.

Affected Environment

The focus of the water quality improvements in the Everglades is to reduce the total
phosphorus concentrations in the water entering into the EPA marsh. Water quality standards
are established to protect the designated use of a waterbody. The EPA waters have been
designated as Class III which has the designated use of “recreation, propagation, and
maintenance of healthy, well-balanced population of fish and wildlife” (62.302.540 FAC). The
numeric total phosphorus criterion for Class III waters in the EPA as established in 62- 302.540
FAC is 10 parts per billion (ppb) measured as a long-term geometric mean. Achievement of the
10 ppb criterion in the Refuge and WCAs 2 and 3 is dependent on the total phosphorus (TP)
concentrations in the water leaving the EAA. The 10 ppb criterion is applied using an
achievement methodology that takes into account spatial and temporal variability, which is
described below.
Achievement of the criterion in impacted and unimpacted areas of the Refuge, WCA 2 and WCA
3 is determined based upon data from stations that are evenly distributed and located in
freshwater open water sloughs similar to the areas from which data were obtained to derive
the phosphorus criterion. Determining achievement of the criterion is based on data collected
monthly from the network of monitoring stations in both the impacted and unimpacted areas.
The waterbody is assessed for attainment of the criterion as determined by a four-part test. In
order to provide protection against imbalances of aquatic flora or fauna, the following
provisions must all be met:
a. The 5-year geometric mean averaged across all stations is less than or equal to 10 ppb;
b. The annual geometric mean averaged across all stations is less than or equal to 10 ppb
for 3 of 5 years;
c. The annual geometric mean averaged across all stations is less than or equal to 11 ppb;
and
d. The annual geometric mean at all individual stations is less than or equal to 15 ppb.
Assessment of the phosphorus criterion within the Everglades indicates that the 4-part test is
typically met in the unimpacted portions of each WCA, while the impacted portions of each
WCA fail one or more parts of the test and therefore exceed the criterion. (SFWMD 2012).

3.6.1 PROJECT SITE
Water quality data at the project site are not available, but is anticipated to be similar to that of
other fallow cropland in the EAA. It is reasonable to assume that phosphorus levels in the soil
and in runoff would be lower than active agricultural activities, but higher than sites not
previously farmed.

approximately 1,900 acres with the construction of Cell 4, which was flow capable by December
2006. However, this cell went off-line in Water Year (WY) 2010 (water budget standard
duration measured between May 1, 2009 and April 30, 2010) for Compartment B construction.
Compartment B construction was completed in December 2011 and was permitted to operate
in September 2012, adding approximately 7,000 acres of treatment area. The STA
2/Compartment B complex has a total of eight treatment cells, five flow-ways, and a total
effective treatment area of approximately 15,000 acres. (Figure 3-6).
STA 3/4 consists of six treatment cells (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B) and the Periphyton-based STA
(PSTA) Implementation Project cells (Upper SAV, Lower SAV and PSTA). STA 3/4 has 16,300
acres of effective treatment area and began operation in 2003 (Figure 3-7).
Average annual TP concentrations of inflows to and outflows from STA 3/4 and STA 2 are shown
in Table 3-1. Since STA 3/4 began operation in October 2003, it has treated approximately 3.7
million acre-feet (ac-ft) of runoff, retaining 440 metric tons (mt) of TP, and reducing TP
concentration from 114 parts per billion (ppb) to 18 ppb. Since STA 2 began operation in
October 2003, it has treated approximately 2.7 million acre-feet of runoff, retaining over 269
metric tons of TP, and reducing TP concentration from 103 ppb to 22 ppb flow weighted mean
concentration (FWMC). While improvements have been observed, these STA outflow
concentrations still exceed the WQBEL criterion of 13 ppb, which is the concentration required
at the STA discharge in order to prevent further phosphorus enrichment in the EPA.

to conduct scientific investigations and research with the goals of enhancing knowledge of the
complex treatment systems, the factors affecting performance, and the various TP removal
mechanisms in the STAs. The research projects and results are presented annually in the South
Florida Environmental Reports (SFERs) (available at www.sfwmd.gov/sfer). It is evident,
however, that maintaining minimum stages to keep the STAs hydrated and to ensure the
viability of EAV and SAV, and regulating inflows to minimize high hydraulic loading rates
improves their performance.

3.6.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS
The geometric mean of measured TP concentrations (in ppb) in the WCAs over the 2005 to
2011 period of record is summarized in Table 3-2. The inflow and outflow concentrations are
based on total inflows and total outflows to the WCA. As the outflow from the STA is discharged
in the canal, the treated water mixes with the untreated water in the canal, and can enter into
the WCA. As not all of the canal water is treated by the STA and not all of the treated water
enters the WCAs, the TP concentrations in the outflow from the STA are different from the
concentrations in the inflow in the WCAs. Figure 3-12 and Figure 3-13 show the location of the
water quality monitoring stations in WCA 2A and WCA 3A, respectively.

Decreases in interior marsh TP concentrations in recent years have been observed for WCA 2A
and WCA 3A (Table 3-3). The continued decreases in TP concentration observed in WCA 2 and
WCA 3 likely reflect recovery from the recent climatic extremes, improved treatment of the
inflows to these areas (which is supported by similar decreases in inflow concentrations), and
improved conditions in the impacted portions of the marsh (SFWMD 2012). This includes the
area downstream of the S-10 structures located along the L-39 levee between WCA 2A and
WCA 1, which is one of the area’s most highly impacted by historical phosphorus enrichment
(Figure 3-14). This area is also where the quantity of discharge has been significantly reduced
and the quality of the discharge has improved since STA 2 began operation.

3.6.4 HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA
Since 2008, there have been no surface water inflows to or outflows from Holey Land. Due to
the lack of surface water flows, SFWMD has collected limited water quality samples from
ponded water at the G-204, G-205, and G-206 (Figure 3-15). The results (October 1, 2010 to
September 30, 2011) show total phosphorus concentrations ranging from 20 ppb to 32 ppb,
with an average concentration of 25 ppb at G-200, 48 ppb to 206 ppb, with an average
concentration of 117 ppb at G-204, 30 ppb to 72 ppb, with an average concentration of 48 ppb
at G-205, and 12 ppb to 31 ppb, with an average concentration of 24 ppb at G-206- (SFER 2013).
Higher nutrient levels were observed at G204, which dries out more frequently than G205 and
G206, due to the higher topography of the location.These values are indicative of water column
concentrations within these pools and may not be representative of the marsh water quality.

VEGETATION

3.7.1 PROJECT SITE
The project site contains 16,517.9 acres of land, of which 14,656.9 acres are waters of the US
and 1,861 acres are uplands. The waters of the US consists of 9,950.4 acres of mixed scrub
shrub wetlands (exotic regraded wetlands), 203.2 acres of exotic scrub shrub wetlands (exotic
dominated wetlands), 3,908.5 acres of herbaceous freshwater marsh wetlands (scraped area
wetlands), 97.6 acres of borrow areas, and 498.1 acres of channelized waterway (other surface
waters).
The uplands consist of existing levees and areas that have been previously filled to store rock
material and muck soils. The exotic degraded wetlands (9,950.4 acres) are areas that previously
contained sugar cane vegetation. Since active sugarcane cultivation has ceased in 2009, these
wetland areas have gone fallow. Sugar cane vegetation is no longer present and wetland
vegetation has recruited back into the area. These areas, which are in an altered condition,
contain plant species such as Carolina willow or often just referred to as willow (Salix
caroliniana), wand goldenrod (Solidago stricta), bushy broomsedge (Andropogon glomeratus),
salt bush (Baccharis glomerulifolia), elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum), primrose willow

(Ludwigia peruviana) and cattail (Typha spp.). Standing water was not observed in these areas
during a site visit in October 2012.
The 203.2 acres of wetland that were high quality depressional wetlands in 2005 are now in a
highly degraded condition with 90% nuisance and exotic species such as Elephant grass and
castor bean (Ricinus communis). These areas did not contain standing water during a site visit in
October 2012. [See Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) field trip report in
Appendix C for details.] The 3,908.5 acres of freshwater marsh wetlands were previously
scraped down during construction activities for the A-1 Reservoir. These areas are considered
higher quality wetlands as compared to the exotic dominated wetland areas and exotic
degraded wetlands because they contain a dominance of native plant species including waterprimrose (Ludwigia peruviana), bushy aster (Aster dumosus), marsh fleabane (Pluchea rosea),
flat-sedge (Cyperus spp.), jointed spikerush (Eleocharis interstincta), and water-hyssops (Bacopa
caroliniana). Also these areas contained standing water during the site visit in October 2012.
The waters of the US include 96.7 acres of borrow areas and 498.1 acres of channelized
waterway. Spatter-dock (Nuphar spp.) and water lettuce (Pistia Stratiotes) were found floating
on the surface of the canals and ditches. Refer to Chapter 5 to review the SFWMD’s Uniform
Mitigation Assessment Methodology (UMAM) wetland function and value scores for existing
site conditions.

3.7.2 STA 2 AND STA 3/4
Cells within the STA's are designed for either EAV or SAV and open water areas. The dominant
submerged aquatic vegetation species include Najas sp. (water-nymph) and Chara (muskgrass),
a gray-green branched multicellular algae, while the dominant emergent aquatic vegetation is
cattail (Typha domingensis).
Maintaining water depths at levels optimal to cattail growth and survival is an important
management strategy in the STAs. Changes in hydrologic regimes in a marsh can have subtle to
drastic effects on cattail (Chen et al., 2010). Cattail species can be eliminated under extended
periods of deeper water level conditions (Appelbaum, 1985 as cited in Chen 2013; Sojda and
Solberg, 1993 as cited in Chen 2013). Extended deepwater conditions can cause the formation
of cattail floating mats in the STAs (Chen et al., 2010). Heavy hydraulic loading, particularly
during storm events, has impacted cattail coverage and density in EAV cells.
Dry-outs have less effect on cattails than SAV as cattails can survive short periods of dry-out.
Lowering water levels to near ground level for a moderate time improves cattail recruitment
and establishment (Chen 2013); however long periods of complete dry-out can also result in

cattail mortality. In SAV cells, dryout events typically have adverse effects on the vegetation
and potentially alter the community characteristics following rehydration. Dry-out of SAV cells
leads to die off of the SAV and the associated periphyton communities essential to phosphorus
sequestration. For example, an STA 3/4 central flow-way dryout/re-flood event in 2011 resulted
in a dramatic change in the SAV community from a water-nymph and muskgrass co-dominated
to a muskgrass dominated system. (DeBusk and Kharbanda 2013)

3.7.3 WATER CONSERVATION AREAS 2A AND 3A
Almost all of the WCAs are grass-dominated wetlands interspersed with tree islands
(hammocks) and Carolina willow strands. Tree islands are a unique feature of the Everglades
ecosystem. In general, there are two recognizable types of basin wetland communities present
in the WCAs:
1. Sawgrass ridge composed of primarily of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) with cattail
(Typha spp.), maidencane (Panicum hemitomon), arrowhead (Sagittaria sp.),
pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), Carolina willow, buttonbush (Cephalanthus
occidentalis), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and saltbush.
2. Slough communities, composed of spikerush (Eleocharis spp.), white water lily
(Nymphaea odorata), SAV and periphyton.
There are also forested wetlands within the WCAs, which include tree islands. The composition
of tree island plant communities vary from island to island but a relatively small number of
plant communities are widely distributed across the landscape of the central Everglades.
Despite some north–south landscape stratification in tree islands, at least six identified canopy
communities are present in all tree island that were surveyed, which is an indication that the
forest canopy of elevated tree islands is relatively similar throughout the central Everglades.
The six canopy communities are:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)

Fig Canopy
Diverse Forest
Pond Apple Canopy
Willow Mix
Willow Canopy
Coco plum Canopy

The dominant canopy species identified fall into two broad categories: very flood intolerant
species and species that tolerate a wide hydrologic range. The dominant species of the Fig and
Diverse Forest communities, Ficus aurea, Schinus terebinthifolius, Cocoloba diversiflora,
Bursera simaruba, and Celtis laevigata, were found in all island groups and in 29% of the plots

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

surveyed. Most of the dominant species of these two canopy communities are species known
to be flood intolerant with optimum annual hydroperiods of less than 60 days (Sah 2004).
Species with broad hydrologic tolerances (200 to 310 days; Sah 2004) include Annona glabra,
Salix caroliniana, and Chrysobalanus icaco, which were dominant in the Pond Apple, Willow
Canopy, and Coco Plum plant communities and recorded in 77% of the plots. Chrysobalanus
icaco has a hydrologic tolerance of 50–240 days per year, one of the longest hydroperiod
ranges of the common tree island species (Sah 2004).
In general, woody species with wide hydroperiod tolerances were more common than were
species requiring shorter hydroperiods. Because of the highly altered hydrology caused by
water management in the current Everglades, it is not clear whether this finding reflects a
natural pattern of wetland forests or is the result of human-caused hydroperiod increases in
the last several decades. The canopy communities of the tree island heads of the studies tree
islands were qualitatively described in the 1970s and early 1980s and provide a partial idea of
how the vegetation canopy communities have changed during the past 25 to 30 years
(McPherson 1973; Alexander and Crook 1975; Zaffke 1981; Wetzel 2002a).
Although the vegetation descriptions are limited, the canopy communities located on islands in
the middle of WCA 3A or 3B appear to have changed little in 25 years (Alexander and Crook
1975; Wetzel 2002a). Species richness was similar and the same species were present at both
time periods. However, for two islands in southern WCA 3A the tree island canopy communities
appear to have shifted toward a greater dominance of species with broad water tolerances.
Comparison of the data from this study and descriptions from Alexander and Crook (1975) and
McPherson (1973) suggest that canopy species such as A. glabra and S. caroliniana increased
and other water intolerant species, such as Ficus aurea, Myrsine guianensis, and Persea
borbonia became less common on these two islands. If such a shift in canopy species has
occurred on these two islands it may be the result of increased water levels caused by the
levees that have impounded water in southern WCA 3A since the 1960s. Extreme hydrologic
patterns, a history of human camps, and severe fires are important environmental drivers for
tree island head forest composition, but there are other possible factors not measured that
could influence forest composition, including competitive exclusion from non–native species,
patterns of seed dispersal (Gawlik and Rocque 1998), and interspecific competition. In addition,
the data cannot reflect the loss of plant species (or community associates) that occurred prior
to the sampling efforts.
High nutrient concentrations have resulted in widespread changes to the ecology of the
Everglades, including invasion of cattail. The proliferation of cattail in the Everglades is
attributed to increased phosphorus levels in the soil and increased water depth and duration of

flooding (Newman et. al. 1998). Monospecific stands of cattail have replaced the historic
sawgrass marsh ridge and slough landscape over nearly 12,500 hectares (30,888 acres) in the
Everglades (SFWMD 2012).
Vegetation maps provided in the following sections were produced by the SFWMD utilizing
color infrared aerial photography. Data sets were ground-truthed and vegetation types
delineated and classified using the Vegetation Classification for South Florida Natural Areas
(Rutchey et al. 2006).
Major plant communities in WCA 2A now consist of remnant tree islands, open water sloughs,
large expanses of sawgrass, and sawgrass intermixed with dense cattail stands. Remaining tree
islands are found primarily at higher ground level elevations, located in the northwest corner of
WCA 2A. Remnant tree islands, dominated primarily by Carolina willow, are found scattered
throughout the central and southern sections of WCA 2A. Cattail distribution in WCA 2 reflects
4,400 acres in which cattails represent more than 50% of the vegetation coverage and 24,000
acres of mixed or scattered cattail (<50% coverage) present in the northeast portion of WCA 2A
(USACE 2009).
Several studies conducted within WCA 2A show that cattail out-compete sawgrass in their
ability to absorb excess nutrients with increased cattail production during years of high nutrient
inflows (Toth, 1988; Davis, 1991). Cattail is considered a high nutrient status species that is
opportunistic and highly competitive, relative to sawgrass, in nutrient-enriched situations (Toth,
1988; Davis, 1991). Davis (1991) concluded that both sawgrass and cattail increased annual
production in response to elevated nutrient concentrations, but that cattail differed in its ability
to increase plant production during years of high nutrient supply.
The community structure and species diversity of Everglades vegetation located north of I-75
(WCA 3A North) is very different from the wetland plant communities found south of I-75 (WCA
3A South). Improvements made to the Miami Canal and the impoundment of WCA 3A by
levees have over-drained the north end of WCA 3A and shortened its natural hydroperiod.
These hydrological changes have increased the frequency of severe peat fires that have
resulted in loss of tree islands, aquatic slough, and wet prairie habitat that were once
characteristic of the area. Today, northern WCA 3A is largely dominated by sawgrass and lacks
the natural structural diversity of plant communities seen in southern WCA 3A.
Over-drainage of the northwestern portion of WCA 3A has allowed the invasion of a number of
terrestrial species such as saltbush, dog fennel (Eupatorium sp.), and broomsedge (Andropogon

glomeratus). Melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia) has become well-established in the
southeastern corner of WCA 3A, and is spreading to the north and west.
Vegetation located in the central and southern portion of WCA 3A represents some of the best
examples of original Everglades habitat left in South Florida. This region of the Everglades
appears to have changed the least since the 1950s, and contains a mosaic of tree islands, wet
prairies, sawgrass stands, and aquatic sloughs.
A comparison of vegetation in WCA 3 vegetation maps from 1995 to 2004 (SFWMD 2011)
indicate an increase in sawgrass/shrub by 48 percent (9,566 acres to 14,179 acres, 30 percent
increase in broadleaf marsh (2,775 acres to 3,593 acres), while floating marsh decreased by 37
percent (8,948 acres to 5,632 acres) (See Figure 3-16). Most significant may be the trend in
cattail coverage which increased 38% within WCA 3, representing a state change from historic
ridge and slough patterns (SFWMD 2011 and 2013) (Figure 3-17).

3.7.4 HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA
The vegetation community structure was historically dense sawgrass with scattered wetland
tolerant shrubs and sloughs (Davis, 1943); however, anthropogenic alterations of the
hydropattern have caused significant shifts in the plant community structure (Cornwell and
Hutchinson, 1974). Wet prairie and slough vegetative habitats are present in the northeast and
southwest reaches. Carolina willow is encroaching into the marsh along the Holey Land’s
western and southern boundaries.
Cattails are also prevalent throughout the Holey Land. The ground elevation within Holey Land
varies as much as four feet. This elevation range is primarily the result of muck fires burning
away organic soil during extreme dry periods. Extended high water levels in Holey Land can
drown out typical marsh species in these deep pockets, creating an opening in the landscape
susceptible to invasion by cattail (Newman et al. 1998). The FWCC performs cattail monitoring
in Holey Land (SFWMD, 2011). The results of the 2011 survey estimate that 18% (6,300 acres)
of the area is covered by cattail. This indicates an increase in estimated cattail coverage from
2010 (which was 10% of the area); however, it is still significantly less than what was estimated
in 2004 at 27% coverage of the area.

Aquatic macroinvertebrates form a vital link between the algal and detrital food web base of
freshwater wetlands and the fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and wading birds that feed upon
them. Important macroinvertebrates of the freshwater aquatic community include crayfish
(Procambarus alleni), riverine grass shrimp (Palaemonetes paludosus), amphipods (Hyallela
aztecus), Florida apple snail (Pomacea paludosa), Seminole ramshorn (Planorbella duryi), and
numerous species of aquatic insects (USACE 1999a).

Small freshwater marsh fishes are also important processors of algae, plankton, macrophytes,
and macroinvertebrates. Marsh fishes provide an important food source for wading birds,
amphibians, and reptiles. Common small freshwater marsh species include the golden
topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), Florida flagfish
(Jordenella floridae), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna),
bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), oscar (Astronotus ocellatus), eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia
holbrookii), and small sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) (USACE 1999a). The density and distribution of
marsh fish populations fluctuates with seasonal changes in water levels. Populations of marsh
fishes increase during extended periods of continuous flooding during the wet season. As marsh
surface waters recede during the dry season, marsh fishes become concentrated in areas that
hold water through the dry season, such as alligator holes, limestone solution holes, and
longer-hydroperiod marshes and sloughs. Concentrated dry season assemblages of marsh
fishes are more susceptible to predation and provide an important food source for wading birds
(USACE 1999a).
Numerous sport and larger predatory fishes occur in deeper canals and sloughs. Common
species include largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus),
redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), Florida gar
(Lepisosteus platyrhincus), threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), gizzard shad (Dorosoma
cepedianum), yellow bullhead (Ameiurus natilis), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), bowfin (Amia
calva), and tilapia (Tilapia spp.) (USACE 1999a). Larger fish are an important food source for
raptors and other birds of prey, wading birds, alligators, otters, raccoons, and mink.
The freshwater wetland complex supports a diverse assemblage of reptiles and amphibians.
Common amphibians include the greater siren (Siren lacertina), Everglades dwarf siren
(Pseudobranchus striatus), two-toed amphiuma (Amphiuma means), pig frog (Rana grylio),
southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), Florida cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), squirrel tree frog (Hyla squirela), and green tree frog (Hyla
cinerea) (USACE 1999). Amphibians represent an important forage base for wading birds,
alligators, and larger predatory fishes (USACE 1999a).
Common reptiles of freshwater wetlands include the American alligator (Alligator
mississippiensis), snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), striped mud turtle (Kinosternon bauri),
mud turtle (Kinosternon subrubrum), cooter (Chrysemys floridana), Florida chicken turtle
(Deirochelys reticularia), Florida softshell turtle (Trionys ferox), water snake (Natrix sipidon),
green water snake (Natrix cyclopion), mud snake (Francia abacura), and Florida cottonmouth
(Agkistrodon piscivorus) (USACE 1999a). The alligator was historically most abundant in the
peripheral Everglades marshes and freshwater mangrove habitats, but is now most abundant in

canals and the deeper slough habitats of the central Everglades, the STAs, WCAs and the Holey
Lands. Drainage of peripheral wetlands and increasing salinity in mangrove wetlands as a result
of decreased freshwater flows has limited the occurrence of alligators in these habitats
(Mazzotti and Brandt 1994).
The freshwater wetlands of the STAs, WCAs and the Holey Land are noted for their abundance
and diversity of colonial wading birds. Common wading birds include the white ibis (Eudocimus
albus), glossy ibis (Plegadus falcenellus), great egret (Casmerodius albus), great blue heron
(Ardea herodius), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), snowy
egret (Egretta thula), green-backed heron (Butorides striatus), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis),
black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), yellow-crowned night heron (Nycticorax
violacea), roseate spoonbill (Ajaia ajaja), and wood stork (Mycteria americana) (USACE 1999a).
The Everglades National Park (ENP) historically supported the largest number of nests in the
Greater Everglades, but in recent decades the majority of nesting has occurred further inland in
the WCAs. In 2012 an estimated 24,191 nests (92% of all south Florida nests) were initiated
either in the WCAs or ENP. This estimate is 40% lower than the decadal average and 66% lower
than in 2009 when a record high of 73,096 nests was recorded. Most other regions of south
Florida experienced similar declines in nest numbers during 2012. (Cook and Kobza 2012).
Wading bird populations in the Everglades are dynamic, changing constantly and are influenced
by many other aspects (Russell et al. 2002). However, the most influential aspect is perhaps
human habitat alteration; particularly those that change the natural hydrological conditions.
Food availability is consider the most important factor limiting populations of wading birds in
the Everglades (Frederick & Spalding 1994); however hydrology is the factor that ultimately
determines the availability of food. The concept of too much/too little or just the right amount
of water and the too late/too early or just at the right time seem to be of particular importance
for wading birds. (Cook and Kobza 2012).
Mammals that are well-adapted to the aquatic and wetland conditions of the freshwater marsh
complex include the rice rat (Oryzomys palustris natator), round-tailed muskrat, and river otter
(Lutra canadensis). Additional mammals that may utilize freshwater wetlands on a temporary
basis include the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Florida panther (Puma concolor
coryi), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Additional information on Greater
Everglades fauna is also contained within the South Florida Environmental Reports which are
published annually by the SFWMD:

Project site

The A-1 project site contains habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species. The previous
farming activities on the site may have deterred some species from utilizing the site; however,
since the site has been undisturbed for several years, the amount of wildlife utilization has
since increased. A list of fish and wildlife species observed on the project site is shown in Table

Affected Environment

Stormwater Treatment Areas

The STAs are becoming known as havens for birds and wildlife. During the 109th National
Christmas Bird Count conducted in January 2009, a multi-agency team documented 92,600
birds; a total of 112 species at STA 5. These species includes limpkin, roseate spoonbill, wood
stork, bald eagle, Everglades snail kite, purple gallinule, black-necked stilts, sandhill crane, and
some rare birds such as short-tailed hawk and Cassin’s kingbird. Thus, the constructed wetland
systems provide abundant breeding and foraging habitats to birds and other wildlife.

3.8.1.4

Water Conservation Areas 2A and 3A and Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area

The WCAs and Holey Land as a whole contain a number of important species whose existence,
population numbers, and sustainability are markedly influenced by water levels. The American
alligator, a keystone Everglades species, has rebounded in terms of population numbers since
the 1960s when the reptile was placed on the endangered species list by the USFWS. Alligators,
it is believed, play an important ecological function by maintaining "gator holes", or
depressions, in the muck which are thought to provide refuge for aquatic organisms during
times of drought and concentrates food sources for wading birds. High water during periods of
nest construction, which occurs from June to early July (Woodward, et al., 1989), decreases the
availability of nesting sites. If conditions become too dry, either naturally or through water
management practices, water levels may fall too low to maintain gator holes, forcing the animal
to seek other areas to survive.
Other important reptile species commonly encountered within the WCAs and Holey Land
include a number of species of turtles, lizards, and snakes. Turtle species include the snapping
turtle, striped mud turtle, mud turtle, cooter, Florida chicken turtle, and Florida soft-shell turtle.
Lizards such as the green anole are found in the central Everglades, and several species of
skinks occur more commonly in terrestrial habitats. Numerous snakes inhabit the wetland and
terrestrial environments. Drier habitats support such species as the Florida brown snake,
southern ringneck snake, southern black racer, scarlet snake, and two rattlesnake species. The
eastern indigo snake, a federally-listed threatened species, and the Florida pine snake, a state
species of special concern, may also exist in drier areas. Wetter habitats support more aquatic
species such as the water snake, the green water snake, mud snake, eastern garter snake,
ribbon snake, rat snake, and the Florida cottonmouth (McDiarmid and Pritchard, 1978).
Important amphibians known to occur in South Florida include the Everglades bullfrog, Florida
cricket frog, southern leopard frog, southern chorus frog, and various tree frogs common to

tree islands and cypress forests. Salamanders inhabit the densely vegetated, still or slowmoving waters of the sawgrass marshes and wet prairies. They include the greater siren and
the Everglades dwarf siren. Toads such as the eastern narrow-mouth toad also occur within the
WCAs.
Colonial wading birds utilize the WCAs and Holey Land as both feeding and breeding habitat.
The most common species utilizing the WCAs include the white ibis, great egrets, snowy egrets,
cattle egrets, great blue herons, tricolored herons, little blue herons, green herons, blackcrowned night herons, yellow-crowned night herons, wood storks, and glossy ibis, with
populations varying widely in relationship to seasonal water level fluctuations. Historically,
white ibis has been the most abundant colonial wading bird species within the WCAs with the
great egret as the second (Frederick and Collopy, 1988). The WCAs and Holey Land support
additional aquatic avifauna, such as the limpkin, two species of bitterns, the anhinga, as well as
a number of resident and migratory waterfowl.
The Everglades fish community is composed of a variety of forage fish important in the diet of
many wading birds, sport fish, native species, and exotics introduced partly through
aquaculture practices and the aquarium trade. Forage species include the Florida flagfish,
bluefin killifish, least killifish, shiners, mosquito fish, and sailfin molly.
The WCAs provide a valuable sport fishery for South Florida. Many of the canals, notably along
US 41, I-75, and in the L-35B and L-67A, provide valuable recreational fishing for largemouth
bass, sunfish, oscar, gar, bowfin, catfish and other species. Generally, Everglades sportfish are
harvested from the borrow canals that surround the marsh. As water levels in the canal and
marsh rise, fish populations disperse into the interior marsh and reproduce with minimum
competition and predation. As water levels recede, fish concentrate into the deeper waters of
the surrounding canals, where they become available as prey for wildlife and fishermen.
Several game and non-game wildlife species occur within the wetland systems in the WCAs and
Holey Land including: white-tailed deer, common snipe, and marsh rabbit. Blue-winged teal,
mottled ducks, and other game waterfowl are found in the sloughs. Feral hogs may also be
present in drier areas or on tree islands.

Eastern indigo snakes were reported in the project area from 2006 – 2011. Figure 3-18 is based
on the FWS’s GIS database and shows the locations of eastern indigo snake reported from
within the A-1 project site and the surrounding EAA. Currently, the former agricultural lands
have converted back to wetland vegetation. Since the eastern indigo snake is typically found in
upland areas, it is anticipated that eastern indigo snakes may be found in and around the levees
and berms. In the sugar cane fields of the former A-I Reservoir project site, eastern indigo
snakes have been observed (including one mortality) during earthmoving and other
construction-related activities.
The project site is located within a USFWS Audubon crested caracara consultation area. The
USFWS SLOPES defines the primary protection zone for the species as 985 feet outward from a
nesting tree with a secondary zone 6,600 feet from an active nesting tree. There are no known
nest sites located within 6,600 feet of the project site, as the nearest nest, documented in
2007, is over 20 miles northwest. The nearest documented occurrence was 12.6 miles
southwest of the project area. (Figure 3-19).
The freshwater wetlands serve as foraging habitat for the wood stork. Although the nearest
active wood stork colony is located over 25 miles away, wood stork are observed on the site
(Figure 3-21).
Within the project area, there has been no panther focus area (based on telemetry point
density) designated. However, within a 10 mile buffer area, 19,688 acres have been identified
as a primary panther zone and 101,350 acres have been identified as secondary panther zone
(USFWS GIS database, 2012). Therefore, it is anticipated that panthers may hunt on the project
site, but it is unlikely that they would use these areas for any extended length of time because
of the lack of suitable long-term panther habitat (URS 2007). In addition, the site borders the
eastern extent of the panther’s secondary zone (Figure 3-22). No Florida panthers have been
sighted on the property; however, they have been documented in the area (Figure 3-23).

3.8.2.3

Stormwater Treatment Areas 2 and 3/4

The eastern extent of STA 2 is within the core foraging area of four wood stork colonies, and
the wood storks have been documented to utilize the wetlands within the both STAs. The
southeast corner of STA 3/4 also falls within the 18.6 mile buffer area of a wood stork colony.
The levees and berms may provide habitat for the eastern indigo snake. Alligators are present
within both STAs. Although it was originally anticipated that the Everglades snail kites would
only forage in the STAs, there have been documented reports that the snail kites nested within
STA 3/4 in 2011 and have begun nesting in STA 1E (USFWS GIS database, 2012).

Species Descriptions
American Alligator

The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a large, carnivorous reptile related to
crocodiles that inhabits freshwater lakes, ponds, marshes, sloughs, swamps, canals and,
occasionally, brackish waters throughout the southeastern United States. It is commonly seen
on canal banks throughout the EAA and in the WCAs.
In 1985, alligators were down-listed in Florida from “threatened” to status of “threatened due
to similarity of appearance” because of its similarity to the endangered American crocodile
(Crocodylus acutus). A distinguishing characteristic from the American crocodile, a close
relative, is that only the upper teeth are visible with the alligator’s mouth closed, while both the
upper and lower teeth are visible on the American crocodile. The listing “threatened due to
similarity of appearance” is defined for species that are not currently biologically threatened
but that are believed likely to become endangered in the future (50 CFR Part 17). Therefore,
no coordination is needed for this species.

3.8.2.5.2

Eastern Indigo Snake

The eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon corais couperi) is federally listed as threatened. It is a
large, black, non-venomous snake that reaches lengths up to of 265 cm (Ashton and Ashton
1981). Its historical range extended throughout Florida and the coastal plains of Mississippi,
Alabama, and Georgia (USFWS 1999).
The eastern indigo snakes preferred habitats are uplands (flatwoods, dry prairies, tropical
hardwood hammocks, and coastal dunes). They are not usually found in Everglades wetlands
(Steiner and others 1983), but can be found on the edges of freshwater marshes and in
agricultural fields (USFWS 1999). They are extremely susceptible to desiccation and cold. In
dry, cold habitats (Georgia, Alabama, and the Florida panhandle), eastern indigo snakes depend
on the holes of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), which provide protection from cold

Affected Environment

and dry conditions (Layne and Steiner 1996). Throughout the warmer environment of
peninsular Florida, eastern indigo snakes may exist in any terrestrial habitats with low urban
development (USFWS 1999). They frequently use natural holes, gopher tortoise burrows, trash
piles and the like even in warmer south Florida. They use a variety of food sources including
fish, frogs, toads, lizards, turtles and their eggs, small alligators, birds and small mammals
(USFWS, 1999).
Initially, the population decline of eastern indigo snakes was from over-collecting for the pet
trade (43 FR 4028), but current major threats to the eastern indigo snake include loss and
fragmentation of habitat from increased development (USFWS 1999). Other threats to the
eastern indigo snake associated with development include increased mortality from vehicular
collisions, domestic pets, and people, and pesticides (USFWS 1999).
Eastern indigo snakes range over large areas and use various habitats throughout the year, with
most activity occurring in the summer and fall (Smith 1987; Moler 1985a). Adult males have
larger home ranges than adult females and juveniles; their ranges average 554 acres (Moler
1985b). In contrast, a gravid female may use from 3.5 to 106 acres (Smith 1987). In Florida,
home ranges for females and males range from 5 to 371 acres and 4 to 805 acres, respectively
(Smith 2003). At the Archbold Biological Station (ABS), average home range size for females was
determined to be 47 acre and overlapping male home ranges to be 185 acre (Layne and Steiner
1996).

States, Mexico, and Central America to Panama. In Florida, the most abundant populations of
crested caracara are in Glades, Desoto, Highlands, Okeechobee, and Osceola counties, all of
which are located north and west of Lake Okeechobee (USFWS 1999). Caracaras are most

commonly found in dry or wet prairies with occasional cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto) or
scattered wooded vegetation. Prey include insects and other small invertebrates, small
mammals, reptiles, and fish. Because of changes in land use, the crested caracara also now
uses improved or semi-improved pastures (USFWS 1999). The primary threat to the crested
caracara is in the conversion from dried prairies to agriculture and development. The project
site is located within a USFWS crested caracara consultation area. See Figure 3-19 for the
nearest documented occurrence of the Audubon’s crested caracara in relation to the project

Affected Environment

Everglade Snail Kite

The endangered Everglade snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) is a medium sized raptor
that feeds almost entirely on apple snails (Pomacea paludosa) which are found in palustrine
emergent, long hydroperiod wetlands (USFWS, 1999). The snail kite’s foraging habitat is
restricted to clear, calm waters of freshwater marshes and shallow vegetated littoral zones of
lakes in South and Central Florida including Palm Beach and Hendry Counties. Snail kites
require small trees or shrubs near foraging areas as nest sites and shallow inundated areas to
sustain their food source, apple snail.
Apple snails inhabit a wide range of ecosystems from swamps, ditches and ponds to lakes and
rivers. Apple snails eat, feed, breed, and lay eggs on emergent vegetation in waterbodies that
are flooded continuously for longer than 1 year (USFWS 1999). Changes in water regimes and
depth and duration of inundation are important characteristics for wetland vegetation that
supports snail kite nesting and foraging habitat, Florida apple snails, and all aspects of snail kite
and apple snail life history. Rapid and/or large increases in water depth may detrimentally
affect desirable vegetation, and can flood out Florida apple snail eggs, leading to reductions in
apple snail populations and reduced snail kite foraging (USFWS 2006).
Designated critical habitat for the snail kite exists on the western side of Lake Okeechobee and
portions of the EPA, including WCA 1, WCA 2 and WCA 3A. Snail kites are also found in Holey
Land. Wood storks and snail kites have overlapping ranges, but different feeding mechanisms
and require different hydrologic conditions for optimum feeding. Historically, both have
survived with the hydrologic variability characteristic of the natural system. The reduced
heterogeneity and extent of natural area of the present system make the snail kites more
vulnerable to natural and human-caused threats (USFWS, 1999).
Loss and degradation of habitat are the primary threat to snail kites. Water levels, duration,
and quality are primary concerns in Everglade snail kite conservation. Water levels must allow
for appropriate nesting sites, durations of water levels must be sufficient to support apple snail
populations, and water quality must be such that invasive species do not take over Everglade
snail kite foraging habitat (USFWS 1999). The project site, the STAs and WCAs are all within
Everglade snail kite USFWS consultation area. The nearest nest to the project area, recorded in
2011, was located approximately 3 miles from the A-1 project site (Figure 3-20). The most
recent nests, recorded in 2012, were located 14.1 miles to the west and 22.3 miles to the east
(WCA 1).

3.8.2.5.5

Affected Environment

Wood Stork

The endangered wood storks (Mycteria Americana) are tall, long-legged wading birds that
utilize a variety of freshwater and estuarine wetlands (USFWS 1999) including shallow
freshwater wetlands, canals, and ditches to catch prey. Historically, breeding colonies existed
in coastal states from Texas to South Carolina, but today breeding colonies are limited to
Georgia, Florida, and coastal South Carolina (USFWS 1999). Their non-breeding season range
extends throughout the continental United States.
The timing, duration, and quantity of water affect wood stork distribution for two reasons:
shallow waters with high prey densities are needed for feeding; and they prefer nesting sites
surrounded by deep water. The primary prey of wood storks is small fish. During feeding,
wood storks immerse their bill, partly open, in water and snap it shut when it contacts a prey
item (Kahl 1964, as cited in USFWS 1999). This feeding behavior, known as tactolocation or
grope feeding, requires high prey concentrations found after drying events that concentrate
fish to smaller areas. Nesting colonies of wood storks are usually established in stands of
medium to tall trees, such as cypress stands or mangrove forests, surrounded by deeper water
marshes (Palmer 1962; Rogers and others 1996; and Ogden 1991, as cited in USFWS 1999).
These areas provide protection from terrestrial predators. Core foraging areas include an 18.6mile radius around breeding colonies (USFWS SLOPES). The nearest active colony reported in
2009 is located 21.2 miles from the A-1 project site (Figure 3-21). Documented in 2011, the
most recent active colony is 25.0 miles south of A-1 project site (USFWS GIS database, 2012).

Florida Panther

The Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), a medium-sized tawny-colored long-tailed puma, is
one of the most federally listed endangered land mammal. At one time, the panther’s range
extended through Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Southern Tennessee,
South Carolina, and Florida. Today, the only existing population is found in a two million acre
area in central and South Florida with population estimates of only 80 total individuals, 30 to 50
adults and approximately 30 subadults (USFWS 1999). The Big Cypress Swamps/Everglades has
the only known breeding panther population (USFWS 1999).
The Florida panther, a subspecies of the mountain lion, is Florida’s designated state mammal.
Male panthers weigh 102 to 154 pounds and reach 7 feet in length, while the smaller females
weigh 50 to 108 pounds and reach 6 feet in length (Roelke 1990). Panther’s preferred habitats
are hardwood hammocks and pine flatwoods, but they can also be found in wetlands and
disturbed habitat (USFWS 1999). The panther diet includes feral hogs (Sus scrofa), white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus)
(Maehr et. al. 1990).
Habitat loss and fragmentation from development are the largest threat to panthers and have
lead to inbreeding, reduced prey availability, and mortality from vehicle strikes. An individual
panther range may extend on average 200 square miles for males and 74 square miles for
females (Land 1994). The panther’s wide-range recovery plan cites three conditions necessary
for the survival and recovery of the species: (1) protection and enhancement of existing
populations, habitats, and prey resources; (2) improving genetic health and population viability;
and (3) re-establishing a minimum of two more reproducing populations within the historical
range.
Panther telemetry data from 1981 to 2005 show panthers in the EAA, including areas directly
adjacent to the project site and in WCA 3A (USFWS 2006). Based on the USFWS’ GIS Database,
Figure 3-22 depicts the panther telemetry data from 1997 through 2011.

Endangered Species
Whooping Crane

The whooping crane is the tallest bird in North America, standing nearly five feet tall with a
wing span of seven to eight feet. Adult whooping cranes are solid white with a red crown on
their head, long black legs, and a long “S” shaped neck. Whooping crane chicks have a
cinnamon brown body color; however, by the age of four months they will begin to gain adultA-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

like white feathers. The diet of whooping cranes primarily consists of aquatic invertebrates
(insects, crustaceans, and mollusks), small vertebrates (fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and
mammals), roots, acorns, and berries.
While courting, males will perform a dancing ritual that includes them jumping, flapping their
wings, and tossing objects into the air (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011). The nesting
season in Wood Buffalo National Park (located in Alberta and the Northwest Territories of
Canada) occurs between the months of April and May, while cranes in Florida breed between
the months of January and May. The clutch size for the whooping crane ranges from one to
three eggs (M. Folk pers comm. 2011). Eggs are incubated for 29-31 days with both parents
sharing the incubating duties. Breeding pairs will re-nest if the first clutch of eggs is destroyed
before mid-incubation. It is rare for more than one of the chicks from a single nest to survive.
Whooping crane chicks are able to fly (fledge) at 80 to 90 days old. Juvenile migratory cranes
become independent from their parents on their first migration north, while non-migratory
whooping cranes become independent before their parents’ next breeding season. Whooping
cranes mate for life, but will pick new partners if the previous partner is lost. Females produce
their first fertile eggs at four to seven years of age.

Habitat and Distribution
Whooping cranes have a very limited range and only inhabit shallow marshes and open
grasslands (Figure 3-23). The only natural whooping crane nesting population is located in
Wood Buffalo National Park. This population winters in and around Aransas National Wildlife
Refuge, which is located on the Texas Gulf Coast. There is a non-migratory population in
Central Florida that the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission introduced in 1993. The
introduction was stopped in 2008 due to survival and reproduction problems. During the
winter, migratory whooping cranes are led by an ultra-light aircraft from Wisconsin to Florida.
A new project to reintroduce non-migratory whooping cranes to Louisiana was begun in early
2011 (Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries 2011).

Threats
The main threat to the whooping crane is the alteration and degradation of their habitat in the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Pollution is also a threat to the whooping crane in Aransas, as
the boats and barges in the Intracoastal Waterway carry toxic chemicals that could cause
devastating effects to the species if spilled. Their extremely small range also puts them at risk
to suffer a population decline during natural disaster events. Other threats include illegal
hunting, collisions with cars, and increased predation by other species such as the black bear,
wolverine, gray wolf, red fox, lynx, and bald eagle (Lewis 1995). Also, in recent times, wind
farms and their associated power lines in the migratory corridor have become a major concern
(Canadian Wildlife Service and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2007).

Threatened Species
Florida Sandhill Crane

The Florida sandhill crane can reach a height of 47.2 inches (120 centimeters) with a wingspan
around 78.7 inches (200 centimeters) (Nesbitt 1996). This species is gray with a long neck and
legs, and a bald spot of red skin on the top of its head. The sandhill crane is unique in flight as it
can be seen flying with its neck stretched out completely.

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

Life History
The diet of the Florida sandhill crane primarily consists of grain, berries, seeds, insects, worms,
mice, small birds, snakes, lizards, and frogs. Florida sandhill cranes are a non-migratory species
that nests in freshwater ponds and marshes. This species is monogamous (breeds with one
mate). Courtship consists of dancing, which features jumping, running, and wing flapping
(International Crane Foundation, n.d.). Sandhill crane nests are built by both mates with grass,
moss, and sticks. Females lay two eggs that incubate for 32 days. Both male and female
participate in incubating the eggs (Nesbitt 1996). The offspring will begin traveling from the
nest with their parents just 24-hours after hatching. At ten months old, juveniles are able to
leave their parents (Nesbitt 1996). Bonding between pairs begins at two years old.

Habitat and Distribution
Florida sandhill cranes inhabit freshwater marshes, prairies, and pastures (Florida Natural Areas
Inventory 2001). They occur throughout peninsular Florida north to the Okefenokee Swamp in
southern Georgia; however, they are less common at the northernmost and southernmost
portions of this range (Figure 3-24). Florida’s Kissimmee and Desoto prairie regions are home
to the state’s most abundant populations (Meine and Archibald 1996).

Threats
Degradation or direct loss of habitat due to wetland drainage or conversion of prairie for
development or agricultural use is the primary threats facing Florida sandhill cranes. The range
of the Florida sandhill crane diminished in the southeastern United States during the 20th
century, with breeding populations disappearing from coastal Texas, Alabama, and southern
Louisiana due to degradation, habitat loss, and overhunting. (Meine and Archibald 1996).

Least tern

The least tern is the smallest tern in North America. Least terns can reach a length between
8.3-9.1 inches (21-23 centimeters) with a wingspan of 21-23 inches (53-58 centimeters)
(Thompson et al., 1997). Least terns have long pointed wings and a deeply forked tail. Other
physical characteristics include a yellow beak, gray back, white belly, and black cap.

Life History
The least tern’s diet primarily consists of fish, but they will also feed on small invertebrates.
(The Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2011). Male least terns have a unique courtship ritual. During
courting, the male will offer the female food in hopes of gaining her choice as a mate. Once the
two mates are together they will begin building the nest in shallow depressions in bare beach
sand. Least terns will also build nests on gravel rooftops. Least terns lay eggs between the
middle of April and the beginning of May. The eggs are camouflaged to help prevent predation.
Egg incubation lasts for 21 days. Young least terns are able to leave the nest three to four days
after hatching.

Habitat and Distribution
The least tern inhabits areas along the coasts of Florida including estuaries and bays, as well as
areas around rivers in the Great Plains (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001). In Florida, the
least tern can be found throughout most coastal areas (Figure 3-25). Outside of Florida, least
terns are found along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, mid Atlantic states, and down from Mexico to
northern Argentina (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001)

.

Threats
The least tern faces many threats as the human population increases along the coasts. The
main threat to the least tern population is habitat loss. Loss of habitat is often attributed to
coastal development. Coastal development causes damage to least tern habitat because of the
building on the coasts, human traffic on the beaches, and recreational activities. Increased
numbers of predators due to the larger amounts of available food and trash for scavenging are
also a threat to the least tern. Predators can cause destruction to breeding colonies while they
are nesting by destroying nests and eating chicks and eggs. Also, global climate change is an
impending threat to the least tern. Rising sea levels and more frequent strong storms may
damage and destroy least tern nests, as well as habitat. Spring tides can also cause flooding of
least tern nests. Other threats to the least tern include shoreline hardening, mechanical raking,
oil spills, response to oil spill events, and increased presence of domestic animals (Defeo et al.
2009).

Species of Special Concern

3.8.3.5.1

Florida mouse

The Florida mouse is a large member of the genus Podomys that can reach a length of eight
inches (20.3 centimeters) and a weight of 0.7 to 1.7 ounces (36.9-49 grams). This species has a
yellowish-brown upper body with orange colored sides and a white belly. It also has five
plantar tubercles (foot pads) on each foot, which is distinct to the species (Florida Natural Areas
Inventory 2001, Layne 1990, Layne 1992, Jones and Layne 1993).

Life History
The diet of the Florida mouse primarily consists of seeds, plants, fungi, and insects (Smithsonian
National Museum of Natural History, n.d.).The Florida mouse digs small burrows inside the
burrows of other species, primarily the gopher tortoise, where they will prepare a nest
(Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, n.d.). Reproduction occurs throughout the
year, but peaks in the fall and winter. The number of young per litter is typically between two
and four. Offspring are weaned at three to four weeks of age (Jones 1990, Layne 1990, Jones
and Lane 1993).

Habitat and Distribution
The Florida mouse inhabits xeric uplands (ecological communities with well drained soils) such
as sandhill and scrub (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001). Peripheral peninsular counties are
St. Johns, Clay, Putnam, Alachua, Suwannee, and Taylor counties in the north, south to Sarasota
County on the west coast (although not documented in Sarasota County in recent years), south
to Highlands County in central Florida, and, at least formerly, south to Dade County on the east
coast now south to near Boynton Beach (Figure 3-26) (Layne 1992; Jones and Layne 1993;

Figure 3-26 Florida Mouse Distribution

Threats
The Florida mouse exhibits narrow preferences for fire-maintained, xeric upland habitats
occurring on deep, well-drained soils, especially scrub and sandhill habitats (Jones and Layne
1993). Because of this narrow habitat specificity, the major threat to the Florida mouse is loss
and degradation of habitat caused by conversion to other uses (e.g. development and
agricultural use) and insufficient management (e.g., fire suppression) (Layne 1990, 1992). In
Highlands County, 64% of the species’ habitat was destroyed between 1940 and 1980, with an
additional 10% considered disturbed or degraded (Layne 1992).

Black skimmer

The black skimmer is a seabird with defining physical characteristics that make it easily
distinguishable from others. The key physical feature of the skimmer is its large red and black
bill. The bill begins to widen at the top and gradually becomes smaller as it forms a sharp tip at
the end of the bill. The lower part of the bill is longer than the top, which is important because
they use their bill to skim along the top of the water to catch fish, for which they are aptly
named. Skimmers can reach a height of 19.7 inches (50 centimeters) with a wingspan of 3 to

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

3.5 feet (.9-1.1 meters) (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011, E. Sachs pers. comm. 2011).
Skimmers have a black back, black wings with white edging, and a white belly and head.

Life History
The diet of the black skimmer primarily consists of fish. The skimmer has a unique style of
feeding that involves literally “skimming” the surface of the water with their lower bill. When
they contact a prey item, they quickly bend their head forward and snap the upper bill closed,
seizing their prey. Breeding occurs during the summer, generally between May and early
September (Katja Schulz, n.d.). Skimmers nest on the sand along beaches, sandbars, and
islands developed by dredged-up material. Nesting occurs in colonies consisting of one to
several hundred pairs of skimmers. Skimmers are protective of their nests and offspring and
will utilize group mobbing to protect the nests. Skimmers usually lay three to five eggs per nest
and eggs are incubated by both parents for approximately 23-25 days (The Cornell Lab of
Ornithology 2011). Each parent incubates the eggs for up to four hours at a time (Gochfield
and Burger, 1994). Once hatched, parents guard the offspring until they are able to fly at about
28-30 days old (Katja Schulz, n.d.).

Habitat and Distribution
The black skimmer inhabits coastal areas in Florida such as estuaries, beaches, and sandbars
(Figure 3-27). Skimmers can be found from the coasts of the northeastern U.S., down to
Mexico, and over to the Gulf Coast of Florida. Breeding range is from Southern California, down
to Ecuador.

Affected Environment

Figure 3-27 Black Skimmer Distribution

Threats:
The black skimmer faces many threats as the human population increases and spreads to
previously undeveloped coasts. Habitat loss due to coastal development is the main threat to
the species. People are relocating to the coasts at unprecedented levels causing increased
development and traffic on the beaches, as well as increased predators; all of which are
detrimental to skimmer habitat. Predators will feed on skimmer eggs and chicks and include
species such as raccoons, crows, opossums, feral hogs, and coyotes. Because skimmers nest on
the beach and are colonial they are extremely vulnerable to disturbance by people, pets, and
predators. Other threats include recreational activity, beach driving, shoreline hardening,
mechanical raking, oil spills, and increased presence of domestic animals, all of which may
prevent or disrupt nesting or result in the death or abandonment of eggs and young. Global
climate change is an impending threat to the black skimmer. Sea level rise may cause
destruction to primary nesting areas, resulting in a decreased population size.

Limpkin

The limpkin is a long-legged species of waterbird that has dark brown feathers with streaks of
white on the head and neck and absent on the rest of the body. Limpkins can grow up to 28
inches (71.1 centimeters) long, with a 42 inch (106.7 centimeters) wingspan, and weigh up to
46 ounces (1,304 grams) (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011). White blotches and triangular
marks can be found on the neck and upper body. The key physical feature of the limpkin is
their down-curved bill, which is used to feed on their primary prey, apple snails. Limpkins are
also known for their resounding calls, which are characterized as a high pitched “Kree-ow, Kraow” sound.

Life History
Limpkins feed primarily on apple snails, but they will also eat insects, worms, and mussels.
Limpkins will walk in shallow waters searching for apple snails and utilize their down-curved
bills to get the snail out of its shell. The limpkin nests in a variety of areas including vegetation
in marshes and freshwater, and in bushes or tree limbs that are up to 40 feet high (12.2 meters)
(The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011). The limpkin courtship ritual includes the male feeding
the female, imitating an adult feeding a juvenile. Nesting occurs between the months of
February and June. The female will lay between four to eight eggs in one nesting season and
incubate the eggs for approximately 27 days (The Cornell Lab of Ornithology 2011).

Habitat and Distribution
The limpkin inhabits shallows along rivers, streams, lakes, and in marshes, swamps and sloughs
in Florida (Figure 3-28). In the U.S., the Limpkin is found only in the Florida. Limpkins are fairly
widespread in peninsular Florida, but rarer in the Panhandle and Keys. Outside of the U.S., they
are found in the Caribbean, Central America, and most of South America east of the Andes
Mountains.

Threats
Historically, the limpkin was almost extirpated from Florida due to overhunting. New laws and
conservation efforts prevented this from happening and the population recovered. There are
still major threats to the limpkin population that include the decline of their primary prey, apple
snails. Due to habitat destruction and wetland drainage, heavy accumulations of non-native
vegetation (mainly hyacinths and cattails) in foraging areas prevents the limpkin from being
able to locate food. Other threats include pollution and an overabundance of nutrition in
wetlands (Crozier and Gawlik, 2002; Bryan 2002).

White Ibis

The white ibis is easily identified by its long red legs, all white plumage, red face, long decurved
red bill and black tipped wings. White ibises are medium-sized wading birds, weighing about
two pounds, with a 36-inch wingspan, and a length of 24 inches. White ibises inhabit shallow
coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps and feed on crayfish, crabs, insects, snakes,
frogs and fish (Kushlan and Bildstein 1992). Nesting occurs in trees, shrubs, and grass clumps
from ground level to a height of 50 feet. Nests are constructed of vegetation sticks, leaves
and/or roots. Females typically lay two to three eggs; eggs are incubated for 21 to 22 days. The
young are able to leave the nest at 9 to 16 days of age. Nestlings are independent at 40 to 50

days of age. Breeding season extends from March to August (FWC 2003c). Ibises are known for
frequent shifts in roost and colony sites.
The white ibis has been recorded breeding throughout the state of Florida; the center of
breeding abundance occurs in the Everglades, with breeding populations extending into Florida
Bay and the Keys (FWC 2003c). Aerial surveys have revealed 90 percent declines in south
Florida breeding pairs since the 1940s and 20 to 50 percent declines statewide during the past
decade. Because of this, the FWC listed the white ibis as a state listed species of special
concern (FWC 2003c). Population declines of the species are attributed to loss and degradation
of suitable habitat; however, large populations of white ibises remain.
The white ibis is a midsized member of the Family Threskiornithidae. This species is
approximately 22 inches (56 centimeters) long with a wingspan of approximately 37 inches (96
centimeters) (Frederick 1996). Adults are mostly white with black tipped wings, a red face, red
legs, and a very distinct downcurved, pink bill which is used to probe the ground for food while
foraging.

Life History
The diet of the white ibis primarily consists of crabs, crayfish, fish, snakes, frogs, and insects.
Ibis breed in large colonial groups along the coast and inland between February and October,
with the peak in the spring and summer. Nests are made of sticks, leaves, and roots, and can
be found both on the ground and as high as 50 feet (15.2 meters) up in trees. Females lay
between two and four eggs in one nesting and incubation can last up to 22 days with both
parents sharing incubation responsibility. Between the ages of 9 and 16 days, the young
become more mobile; however, the young generally remain in the nest until they are 28 to 35
days old.

Habitat and Distribution
White ibis prefer coastal marshes and wetlands, feeding in fresh, brackish, and saltwater
environments. They range from Baja California and Sinaloa, Mexico, east through south Texas,
Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, coastal North Carolina, south throughout the Greater Antilles, and
South America to Peru, and French Guiana. This species is found throughout most of Florida
(Figure 3-29).

Threats
The main threat to the white ibis is the loss of wetland habitat due to the human development
of coastal areas and their freshwater feeding areas. The alteration of wetlands, pollution, and
saltwater influxes are other habitat threats as these practices degrade the quality of wetlands
and decrease the availability of prey (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001, Bildstein et al. 1990,

Snowy Egret, Reddish Egret, Little Blue Heron and Tricolored Heron

The snowy egret, reddish egret, little blue heron and tricolored heron are listed by the FWC as a
species of special concern. Snowy egrets are medium sized herons, with entirely white
plumage, long slender black bills, long black legs and bright yellow feet (Parsons and Masters
2000). The snowy egret breeds in Florida from January through August, breeding mostly in
central and southern Florida in freshwater and saltwater marshes (FWC 2003c). The tricolored
heron occupies similar habitats; breeding occurs in February through August (FWC 2003c). The
tricolored heron is ornately colored; it is slate-blue on its head and upper body and has a
purplish chest with white under parts and fore-neck (Frederick 1997). The little blue heron is a
smaller-sized heron, dark overall with yellow-green legs, and a blue bill with a black tip (Rodgers

and Smith 1995). The little blue heron shows a preference for freshwater habitat; however, it
also inhabits saltwater marshes. Little blue herons breed later than tricolored herons or snowy
egrets; breeding occurs in April through September in Florida. The little blue heron is more
widely distributed throughout the state in comparison to the tricolored herons or snowy egrets.
Like the snowy egret, breeding populations are concentrated in central and southern Florida
(FWC 2003c).
Reddish egrets have two color morphs; white and dark. Dark morphs have gray bodies with
chestnut heads, blue legs and pink bills with black tips (Lowther and Paul 2002). The reddish
egret is the rarest heron in Florida and is entirely restricted to the Florida coast with
concentrations in Florida Bay and the Keys; two-thirds of the state’s breeding population. The
heron forages on shallow flats and sandbars for fish species, including killifish. In Florida Bay,
reddish egrets nest from November through May (FWC 2003c). Population declines of the
species are attributed to loss and degradation of suitable habitat. Target nest numbers for
snowy egrets and tricolored herons combined are 10,000 to 20,000 pairs. Nesting targets for
the snowy egret and tricolored heron have not been met in the WCAs and ENP since the
implementation of IOP in 2002. Nesting effort (number of nests) of these species from 2002 to
2008 is summarized as follows; 2000-2002: 8,614 pairs, 2001-2003: 8,088 pairs, 2002-2004:
8,079, 2003-2005: 4,085 pairs, 2004-2006: 6,410 pairs, 2005-2007: 4,400 pairs, 2006-2008
3,778 pairs(SFWMD 2009b). However, target numbers have not been met prior to the current
operating regime; 1998-2000: 2,788 pairs, 1999-2001 4,270 pairs. Little blue heron censuses
from aerial surveys are unreliable due to its dark plumage and tendency to nest in small,
isolated colonies (FWC 2003c).

3.8.3.5.6

Roseate Spoonbill

The roseate spoonbill is the only spoonbill endemic (native) to the Western Hemisphere (Bjork
and Powell 1996). This species can reach a length of 30-40 inches (76-102 centimeters) with a
wingspan of 50-53 inches (127-135 centimeters). It has pink wings and underparts (with some
red on the tops of the wings) with a white neck and back, and pinkish legs and feet. While the
species looks almost entirely pink in flight, they actually have no feathers at all on their heads.
The pink coloration comes from the organisms on which they feed, which are full of caroteniods
(organic pigment) (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, n.d.). As the name implies, the
roseate spoonbill also has a large, spoon-shaped bill, which it sweeps back and forth in shallow
water to capture prey.

July 2013

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

Life History
The specialized bill has sensitive nerve endings which help the birds search for food in shallow
water. The diet of the roseate spoonbill primarily consists of crayfish, shrimp, crabs, and small
fish. There is no sexual dimorphism (difference in form between individuals of different
genders in the same species) in roseate spoonbills. They nest in mixed colonies (near other
wading bird species) in mangroves or trees and though most breed on the coast, some nest
inland. Nesting habitats include coastal mangroves and dredged-made islands. (Florida Natural
Areas Inventory 2001). The female builds the nest while the male retrieves the nesting
materials. The female lays up to three whitish-colored eggs and both adults incubate the eggs
for up to 24 days (Smithsonian National Zoological Park, n.d.). The young remain in the nest for
approximately 35-42 days and are fed by both adults.

Habitat and Distribution
The roseate spoonbill is a resident breeder in South America, generally east of the Andes, and
coastal areas of Central America, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico (Dumas 2000).
Mangrove islands and occasionally dredge-spoil islands are the preferred nesting habitat for the
species. In Florida, the species is found in Florida Bay, Tampa Bay, and Brevard County (Figure

Threats
One historical threat to the roseate spoonbill was hunting for their feathers, though this
practice is now illegal which has allowed the population to rebound. Another threat to the
spoonbill is the availability of adequate food sources and habitat degradation. In the Florida
Bay, the increased fresh water flow from the Everglades may affect prey availability for the
spoonbill. Other threats include habitat loss and disturbance, pesticides, and illegal shootings
(Dumas 2000).

Gopher tortoise

The gopher tortoise is a moderate-sized, terrestrial turtle that averages 9-11 inches (23-28
centimeters) long. This species of tortoise has a brown, gray, or tan upper shell (carapace), a
yellow lower shell (plastron), and brown to dark gray skin (Florida Natural Areas Inventory
2001). Gopher tortoises have stumpy, elephant-like hind feet and flattened, shovel-like
forelimbs that are used for digging burrows.

Life History
Gopher tortoises dig deep burrows that average 15 feet long (4.6 meters) and 6.5 feet (two
meters) deep. These burrows provide protection from extreme temperatures, moisture loss,
predators, and serve as refuges for 350-400 other species. Because so many other animals
depend on the burrows (commensals), gopher tortoises are referred to as a keystone species.
Gopher tortoises generally forage within 160 feet (48.8 meters) of their burrows but have been
known to travel greater distances to meet their nutritional needs. Gopher tortoises feed on a
wide variety of plants including broadleaf grasses, wiregrass, grass-like asters, legumes,
blackberries, and the prickly pear cactus.
Gopher tortoises are slow to reach sexual maturity, have low reproductive potential, but they
have a long life span – 60 years or longer. Females reach sexual maturity between 10-20 years
of age. The breeding season is generally between March and October. Females lay five to nine
eggs between May and June. Nests are excavated in areas of abundant sunlight, especially in
the sand mound that is located in front of a burrow. Egg incubation lasts 80 to 90 days in
Florida. Hatchlings are capable of digging their own burrow, but may use other tortoises’
burrows instead (Gopher Tortoise Council 2000).

The primary threat to the gopher tortoise is habitat loss. Habitat alteration, such as
urbanization, generally occurs in the same high, dry habitats that the tortoise prefers. Lack of
appropriate land management (especially controlled burning) has also contributed to
population declines in areas where natural habitat remains. Other threats include road
mortality from vehicles and illegal human predation.

Gopher frog

The gopher frog is a stout-bodied frog that reaches a length of two to four inches (5.1-10.2
centimeters). This species has a cream to brown-colored body with irregular dark spots on its

sides and back, a large head, warty skin, rounded snout, short legs, and a light brown ridge
found behind its eyes (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001).

Life History
The diet of the gopher frog primarily consists of invertebrates and anurans (frogs and toads)
(Godley 1992). The breeding season differs by geographical location, as the North Florida
population breeds from February to June and the Central and South Florida population during
the summer. Gopher frogs will travel long distances (up to a mile or more) to breed in
temporary breeding ponds. Females lay eggs in shallow water in a single mass that can contain
3,000 to 7,000 eggs, which attach to vegetation when released. Once hatched, the tadpoles
metamorphose in three to seven months. Gopher frogs usually reach sexual maturity at two
years of age (Godley 1992, Palis 1998).
The call of a gopher frog is a deep guttural snore (the sound is developed in the back of the
mouth) and heavy rains at any season may stimulate choruses, with many of them calling at
once. Sometimes they call from underwater, so as not to attract predators, creating a noise
that is detected only by a hydrophone.

Habitat and Distribution
The gopher frog inhabits longleaf pine, xeric oak, and sandhills mostly, but also occurs in upland
pine forest, scrub, xeric hammock, mesic and scrubby flatwoods, dry prairie, mixed hardwoodpine communities, and a variety of disturbed habitats (Enge 1997). This species inhabits gopher
tortoise burrows, which is how its name originated. Gopher frogs can be found throughout
Florida (Map Data from: FNAI, museums, and gopher frog literature) (Figure 3-32).

Figure 3-32 Gopher Frog Distribution

Threats
The main threat to the gopher frog is the destruction of its habitat, especially breeding ponds.
Exclusion and suppression of fire from wetlands often leads to degradation of breeding ponds
through shrub encroachment, peat buildup, and increased evapotranspiration (evaporation of
surface water and release of water vapor) from plants shortening the hydroperiods (LaClaire
2001). Coverage of grassy emergent vegetation decreases and peat buildup may acidify the
water past tolerance levels of the gopher frog (Smith and Braswell 1994). Another threat to
gopher frog populations is the introduction of game and predaceous fish into formerly fish-free
wetlands during natural flooding events. The introduction of these fish causes increased
predation of the gopher frog’s eggs and tadpoles. The gopher frog also faces threats of disease,
such as contraction of the Anuraperkinsus mesomycetozoan (yeast-like) pathogen - an
infectious parasite.

3.8.3.5.9

Burrowing owl

The diet of the burrowing owl primarily consists of insects; however, they will also feed on
snakes, frogs, small lizards, birds, and rodents. Nesting season occurs between October and
May, with March being the primary time for laying eggs. Nesting occurs in burrows in the
ground that they dig. These burrows will be maintained and used again the following year
(Haug et al. 1993). Females lay up to eight eggs within a one-week period, and they will

Affected Environment

incubate the eggs for up to 28 days. Once the white-feathered juveniles are born, it takes two
weeks before they are ready and able to appear out of the burrow. Juveniles will begin learning
how to fly at four weeks, but will not be able to fly well until they are six weeks old. Juveniles
will stay with the parents until they are able to self-sustain at 12 weeks old. Burrowing owls are
different than other owls as they are active during the day time (diurnal) rather than at night
(nocturnal) during breeding season. During the non-breeding season, they become more
nocturnal.

Habitat and Distribution
Burrowing owls inhabit open prairies in Florida that have very little understory (floor)
vegetation. These areas include golf courses, airports, pastures, agricultural fields, and vacant
lots. The drainage of wetlands, although detrimental to many organisms, increases the areas of
habitat for the burrowing owl. The range of the burrowing owl is throughout the peninsular of
Florida in patches and localized areas. Burrowing owls can also be found in the Bahamas
(Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001).
Figure 3-33 Burrowing Owl Distribution

Threats
The burrowing owl faces many threats to its population. The main threat is the continued loss
of habitat. Threats to habitat include construction activities development and harassment by
humans and domesticated animals. Heavy floods can destroy burrows in the ground, which can

cause the destruction of eggs and young. Other threats include increased predation by ground
and aerial predators in the burrowing owl’s habitat, and vehicle strikes.

MIGRATORY BIRDS

The A-1 project site supports migratory birds. Migratory birds are of great ecological and
economic value to this country and to other countries. They contribute to biological diversity
and bring tremendous enjoyment to millions of Americans who study, watch, feed, or hunt
these birds throughout the United States and other countries. The United States has recognized
the critical importance of this shared resource by ratifying international, bilateral conventions
for the conservation of migratory birds. These migratory bird conventions impose substantive
obligations on the United States for the conservation of migratory birds and their habitats, and
through the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (Act), the United States has implemented these
migratory bird conventions with respect to the United States. Executive Order 13186 of January
10, 2001 directs executive departments and agencies to take certain actions to further
implement the Act. As stated in Executive Order 13186, each agency shall, to the extent
permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations and within budgetary limits,
(1) support the conservation intent of the migratory bird conventions and avoid or minimize
impacts on migratory bird resources, (2) restore and enhance the habitat of migratory birds, as
practicable, (3) prevent or abate the pollution or detrimental alteration of the environment for
the benefit of migratory birds, as practicable, (4) design migratory bird habitat and population
conservation principles, measures, and practices into agency plans and planning processes as
practicable and coordinate with other agencies and nonfederal partners, (5) ensure that agency
plans and actions promote programs of comprehensive migratory bird planning efforts, (6)
ensure environmental analysis of Federal Actions required by NEPA evaluate the effects of
actions on migratory birds with emphasis on species of special concern, (7) provide notice to
the USFWS in advance of conducting an action that is intended to take migratory birds, (8)
minimize the intentional take of species of concern, and (9) identify where unintentional take
reasonable attributable to agency actions is having or is likely to have a measurable negative
effect on migratory bird populations. For a complete list of the requirements in the Executive
Order, please refer to the Presidentail Documents, Federal Register, Volume 66, Number 11

CULTURAL, HISTORIC AND ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
PROJECT SITE

The A-1 project site has been the subject of multiple cultural resource investigations to
determine the presence of cultural, historical and archeological resources. In 2006, the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) reaffirmed the findings from the December 2002
determination that no historic or cultural resource sites eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historical Places (NRHP) were encountered on the A-1 project site and due to the
site being heavily impacted by sugar cane and sod cultivation practices, no additional cultural
resource investigations are necessary.
Most recently, the Florida State Bureau of Archaeological Research (BAR) on behalf of the
SFWMD, conducted a Phase I Cultural Resource Assessment Survey (CRAS) of 16,593 acres of
the EAA A-1 project area in July 2012, as part of the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP).
This CRAS was intended to locate, identify, delineate, and evaluate cultural resources in
advance of proposed landscape modification.
The CRAS recommended no further
archaeological work at the A-1 property at this time. (A Cultural Resource Assessment Survey of
the EAA A-1 Property, Palm Beach County, Florida, Bureau of Archeological Research, Division of
Historical Resources, Department of State, State of Florida, September 2012).
The EAA A-1 CRAS was undertaken to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) and Section 267 of the Florida Statutes. Section 106 of NHPA of 1966
(PL89-665, as amended) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects upon historic
properties of projects involving federal funding, federal permitting, or occurring on federal
lands. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 36, Chapter VIII, Part 800 (36 CFR 800)
contains the guidelines for fulfilling the provisions of Section 106. The study evaluated all
potential cultural resources in the project area for eligibility for the NRHP. Cultural resources
include archaeological, architectural, prehistoric, and historical sites and artifacts. Similarly,
Section 267 of the Florida Statutes requires that “each state agency of the executive branch
having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed state or state-assisted undertaking shall, in
accordance with state policy and prior to the approval of expenditure of any state funds on the
undertaking, consider the effect of the undertaking on any historic property that is included in,
or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places”.
The July 2012 BAR CRAS of the EAA A-1 project area identified no cultural resources that they
believed to be eligible or potentially edigible for listing in the NHRP. Investigations included
both archival research and fieldwork and were designed to determine the presence of cultural

resources. A search of archives in the Florida Master Site File (FMSF) revealed that there were
no known archaeological sites or historic proterties within the project area. Fieldwork consisted
of pedestrian walk-over survey with concurrent ground inspection and shovel testing to detect
possible subsurface archaeological resources. The field methodology was tailored to the area’s
unique environmental conditions. As with other survey methodologies in the EAA (Carr 1974;
Carr et al. 1996; Carr et al. 2000; Marks and Arbuthnot 2008; Smith 2007), investigations were
focused on potential tree island locations (extinct or extant) and other landscape anomalies
identified in modern and historic aerial imagery. Field crews found no cultural materials greater
than 50 years old in any of the shovel test pits. The remains of the Talisman Sugar Mill
(8PB15974), an agricultural facility that was constructed in 1962 and demolished in the late
1990s, were recorded.
The BAR concluded and the USACE agrees that the lack of significant (i.e. NRHP eligible) cultural
resources in the EAA A-1 project area is likely because the inhospitable pre-drainage
environment limited opportunities for extensive human occupation. Before drainage, the A-1
project site was in the Sawgrass Plains, a sparsely inhabited landscape that was covered in
sawgrass and typically submerged under 1.5 ft of water (McVoy et al. 2011). Additionally, any
archaeological sites, which may have been present, may have been destroyed through the
decades of soil subsidence due to drainage and agriculture work that resulted in severe
demucking. Some areas also likely lost soil due to oxidation and burning of dry muck due to
over-drainage (FWCC 2002:10–11).

3.9.2

DOWNSTREAM AREAS

Within the larger region of the Everglades, there are numerous recorded archeological sites
indicative of Native American habitation. Prior to European contact, the Everglades were a
populated area. Native Americans traveled via canoe and on foot through the saw grass and
inhabited many of the tree islands. The earliest known habitation sites date to the Early Archaic
Period (7,500 BC) when the Everglades were much drier. However, within the larger area of
south Florida, evidence of Paleo-Indian (12,000 to 7,500 BC) habitation has also been recorded
(i.e. Warm Mineral Springs (8SO18) and Little Salt Spring (8SO79) (Griffin 1988). Some of the
Early Archaic habitation sites have only recently been rediscovered as the result of managed
drainage programs in south Florida. As the climate warmed and water levels rose, many Native
Americans abandoned the lowest of the tree islands as they became submerged. This process
continued through what is known as the Middle Archaic, until climate conditions stabilized
around 3,000 BC at the start of the Late Archaic. Today many sites from both the Early and
Middle Archaic Periods are no longer submerged and may have been utilized by more recent
Periods.

Chapter 3

Affected Environment

After the Archaic Period, the region became incorporated into what is known as the Glades
region and remained inhabited until the European arrived in the 1500’s. Many of the tree
islands through this portion of the Everglades have sites associated to the Glades Period. This
Period has been broken down into successive stages starting with Glades I Period, which dates
from 500 BC to 750 AD, Glades Period II dating from 750 to 1,200 AD, and Glades Period III
dating from 1,200 AD to European contact in the 1,500s. Typical habitation sites through this
region are identified by middens, which are the remains of the accumulation and disposal of
daily life activities on these tree islands, or hammocks. Material remains may extend from the
surface to well over one meter in depth. Native American burials may also be found among
these hammocks.
The arrival of Europeans introduced Old World diseases to which the indigenous population has
little or no resistance; that and slave raising further reduced the Native American until their
populations were decimated. The Native American populations in the region remained at low
levels until the early 18th Century when the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida (Miccosukee
Tribe) and the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Seminole Tribe) moved into the area while fleeing the
U.S. Army and U.S. Governments’ forced relocation program. Many archeological sites
associated with both the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes are known to exist throughout the
region.
The USACE has evaluated the downstream areas for the presence of cultural resource sites
within STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2, and WCA 3. A review of the Florida Master Site Files’ digital
database has shown that there are no known cultural resource sites within STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA
2A and the upstream area WCA 1. The database has shown that WCA 2B contains three (3)
sites, one of which is potentially eligible to be listed on the NRHP. WCA 3A contains 75
potential sites. As stated in the final EIS for the Everglades Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP),
WCA 3A and 3B contains 109 reported archaeological sites – 18 of which were the subject of a
cultural resource assessment survey. The remaining 91 potential sites were identified based on
aerial analysis alone. There have been no significant studies produced as a result of any
investigations on the 18 confirmed sites other than identification.
To understand the effects of hydrologic changes on cultural resources within the WCAs, the
USACE is developing a predictive model to identify the effects on cultural resources, including
an assessment of water management changes in the WCAs. This effort will take multiple years
to complete and as such USACE will be implementing a Programmatic Agreement (PA) as
specified under ER 1105-2-100 Appendix C4(5)(d)(2) and 36 CFR 800.14b(1)(ii). The PA will
allow USACE to complete needed studies on cultural resources within the WCAs.

3.10 TRIBAL RIGHTS
3.10.1

OVERVIEW OF SEMINOLE TRIBE WATER SUPPLY SOURCES

The Seminole Tribe has surface water entitlement rights pursuant to the 1987 Water Rights
Compact (Compact) between the Seminole Tribe, State of Florida, and the SFWMD (Pub. L. No.
100-228, 101 Stat. 1566 and Chapter 87-292 Laws of Florida as codified in Section 285.165, F.S.)
The Compact contains a series of provisions regarding establishment of Tribal water rights.
Specifically, several "entitlements" to surface water were created. Additional documents
addressing the Water Rights Compact entitlement provisions have since been executed. These
documents include Agreements between the Seminole Tribe, SFWMD, and a SFWMD Final
Order.
According to the Compact, the surface water entitlement for the Big Cypress Reservation is
based on the percentage of water available within the South Hendry County / L-28 Gap Water
Use Basin as the lands of the Big Cypress Reservation are proportional to the total land acreage
within the identified basin. The Compact does not address water supply for sustaining tribal
natural resources and customary usage rights. The specific volume of water associated with this
entitlement was quantified in the 1996 Compact Agreement [1996 Agreement (Appendix O)]
between the SFWMD and Seminole Tribe. The 1996 Agreement was precipitated by SFWMD
implementation of the Everglades Construction Project (ECP), as required by Section 373.4592,
Florida Statutes. Implementation of the ECP diverted surface water from the C-139 Basin and C139 Basin Annex for treatment, thereby removing a portion of the Seminole Tribe's Big Cypress
Reservation surface water entitlement from direct availability for Tribal use. The SFWMD
agreed in the 1996 Agreement to first quantify this entitlement volume and protect the
Compact right by providing replacement water supplies, as a secondary source, to offset the
partial diversion of the entitlement amount. A study was conducted that quantified the
Seminole Tribe's entitlement at 47,000 acre-feet per year to be distributed to the Reservation
in 12 equal monthly amounts of 3,917 acre-feet. The entitlement right is to be perfected
through the annual work plan process. Further, this entitlement volume is to be delivered
primarily from the original entitlement source, the North and West Feeder Canals. Only when
these volumes are insufficient, reliance on the secondary supply source, the G-409, is
appropriate. To accomplish this delivery hierarchy, as well as to appropriately deliver water to
the Big Cypress Reservation, an operational plan was developed and has been consistently
implemented since 2003.

EXISTING WATER FLOW

Water supply deliveries to the Big Cypress Reservation are made from the North and West
Feeder Canal systems via the G-409 pump station located just west of the northwest corner of
WCA 3A. Sources of water for this pump station include Lake Okeechobee (delivered via the G404 pump station), STA 3/4, STA-5, STA-6, Rotenberger and Holey Land WMAs, EAA Runoff, and
WCA 3A. Supplemental flows to the Big Cypress Reservation, when demand is not met by the
primary supply, are provided from the Miami Canal via G404 and G409. Existing conditions for
flows into STA Flow-ways 5-1, 5-2, 5-3, 6-1, and 6-2 are provided from the C139 and C139
Annex Basins. The inflows are currently distributed into the STAs via the L-2/L-3 canal system by
impounding water at G-407 in the vicinity of confusion corner (Figure 3-34). Inflows into the
STAs are treated before discharge into the STA-5/6 discharge canals. The treated flows are
directed to the WCA 3A via the L- 4 and Miami Canals. Any flow that cannot be accommodated
in the STAs is diverted through G406/G407 into the L-4, similar to past operations.

3.10.3

WCA 3A TRIBAL RIGHTS

The Miccosukee Tribe holds a perpetual leasehold to an 189,000-acre tract of land within the
northwest portion of WCA 3A (Figure 3-35). The purpose of the lease is to (1) preserve the
Leased Area in its natural state for the use and enjoyment of the Miccosukee Tribe and the
general public, (2) to preserve fresh water aquatic wildlife, their habitat, and (3) to assure
proper management of water resources. The Miccosukee Tribe is allowed to use this land for
the purposes of Traditional Cultural Practices (TCP), which include hunting, fishing, frogging,
subsistence agriculture, and other activities that are dependent on wet conditions.
The Seminole Tribe also has rights to lands within WCA 3A. In 1989, 14,720 acres in WCA 3A
were purchased from the Seminole Tribe with funds from the SFWMD and the Conservation
and Recreational Lands (CARL) Program. This tract was added as an amendment to the
Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area lease, which names the FWCC as a lead managing
agency. The Compact recognized the special status of the Seminole Tribe by acknowledging
rights and obligations substantially different from those of other Floridian citizens. The
Seminole Tribe has retained non-exclusive rights to utilize the 14,720 acres of land in WCA 3A
to hunt, trap, fish and frog. The Seminole Tribe also has full rights of access to the lands in WCA
3A. This amendment has a perpetual flowage easement granted to the SFWMD for the flowage
and storage of water.
Public Law 93-440 states that members of the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes shall be
permitted, subject to reasonable regulations established by the Secretary, to continue their

3.11 RECREATIONAL RESOURCES
Recreational opportunities are based on a variety of resources, including the waterbodies
within the area and several extensive tracts of publicly owned lands. The recreational lands are
primarily the existing STAs, which are managed by SFWMD for water quality purposes, or
Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), which are managed by FWCC for public use (primarily
hunting and fishing). FWCC also manages hunting within the STAs with a cooperative
agreement with SFWMD. The STAs are highly managed and as such public access is limited with
no motorized uses allowed within the STAs. Public access, including a variety of motorized uses
is permitted in the WMA areas. Due to consistent water levels and managed vegetation, the
STAs are abundant in wildlife and are highly desired hunting destinations. The many levees
within the STAs allow hiking, biking and limited vehicle access whereas the WMAs are vast

without internal levees and are accessed with airboats and tracked vehicles. Overall the STAs
and WMAs offer the public a variety of recreational activities that can include hunting, fishing,
camping, wildlife observation, interpretation, hiking, bicycling, canoeing, and air boating. The
recreational areas within the study area are discussed below.

3.11.1

PROJECT SITE

Currently the project site does not offer any recreational use as it is not open to the public.

3.11.2

STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS 2 AND 3/4

Hunting is permitted in STA 2 and STA 3/4 and bird watching is allowed in STA 3/4. Recreational
plans developed for the STAs ensure that permitted recreational uses are consistent with the
primary STA goal of improving water quality.
The STA 3/4 recreational facility, known as the Harold A. Campbell Public Use Area, is located
within the footprint of STA 3/4, between the Griffin Rock Pits and Cell 2B. The location of the
public use area minimizes public access past the STA’s water control structures and data
equipment. The Harold A. Campbell Public Use Area includes a vehicle barrier gate, road
improvements, a boat ramp, asphalt parking area, an information kiosk (sheltered),
landscaping, a multi-purpose bridge, and a composting toilet. The public has access to a 4-mile
loop trail during daylight hours on designated days. The boat ramp allows 7-day access during
daylight hours to the external canals of STA 3/4 and those canals along the south side of the L-5
levee for a total of 27 miles of fishable canals. FWCC manages waterfowl and alligator hunting
in STA 3/4 and STA 2. STA 2 provides access from US Highway 27 through to the WCA 2 and
allows fishing along this route. A boat ramp and parking area are located on the east at the
shared boundary of the WCA 2 for access into the L-6 Canal.

3.11.3

WATER CONSERVATION AREAS 2A AND 3A

The Everglades-Francis S. Taylor WMA includes WCAs 2A, 2B, and 3A and is located
immediately southeast and south of the EAA. The Everglades-Francis S. Taylor WMA is
separated from adjacent areas by water control levees and canals, and its hydrology is highly
managed. Its 671,831 acres of primarily Everglades marsh buffers ENP and Big Cypress National
Preserve from agriculture in the EAA. The main recreational activities within the WMA include
hunting, fishing, frogging and air-boating in the interior areas. The levees and canals also
provide opportunities for fishing, frogging, hiking, biking, and wildlife viewing. Common access
to the western area of WCA 2A and the L-6 Canal between the S6 and S7 pump stations is
through the southern portion of STA 2 across the sportsman’s crossing. Access to WCA 3 occurs

along the north and south boundaries at multiple locations, but the prime access is on the east
at Broward County’s Holiday Park. The Miccosukee Tribe and the Seminole Tribe also maintain
rights to land within WCA 3A. The Tribes have rights to use this land for the purposes of
hunting, fishing, frogging, subsistence agriculture, and other activities.

3.11.4

HOLEY LAND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA

Currently, state agencies (FWCC, SFWMD, and FDEP) are developing an updated management
plan to address goals and objectives for restoration of the Holey Land. Recreation includes
hunting, fishing, camping, frogging, hiking, and biking. The Holey Land Restoration project that
began in 1991 increased the hydroperiod in this WMA. In response, the primary recreational
use in the Holey Land changed from hunting deer and feral hog to fishing in perimeter canals
and hunting waterfowl (USACE and SFWMD 2006).

3.12 AESTHETICS
The A-1 project site is composed of lands that were historically used for sugar cane farming,
with the occasional rotational crop of rice or corn. The site is currently vacant and fallow; the
majority of the project lands were formerly part of the EAA A-1 Reservoir project, which was
partially constructed before construction was halted due to budgetary and other issues.
Construction was halted in 2006 and much of the land has reverted to natural wetland
characteristics since that time.
The visual landscape of the STAs and WCAs is overwhelmingly flat. Landscape features include
typical canals, levees and prairie wetland communities. The STAs and WCAs offer opportunities
for observation of migratory game birds during winter months. Although some of the
marshlands have been degraded in visual quality by over-flooding and loss of tree islands, other
areas, such as the south-central region of WCA 3A, still preserve good examples of original,
undisturbed Everglades’ communities, with a mosaic of tree islands, wet prairies, sawgrass
expanses, and deeper sloughs. From the elevated viewpoint of the Eastern Perimeter Levee
system, the view westward to the marshes is panoramic, though mostly homogenous.

3.13 FLOOD PROTECTION
Runoff from the EAA is collected and routed to the WCAs for flood control (SFWMD 2004). The
STAs and WCAs are integral components of the flood protection system in South Florida. STAs
work in conjunction with the WCAs to provide flood storage. Runoff from Everglades Tributary
Basins is directed first into the STAs, then discharged from the STAs and directed to the WCAs.
The flood storage capacity of the WCAs is essential to flood control in the EAA.

3.14 HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE
Although the project site is no longer in active agriculture use, the past farming activities could
have resulted in contamination on the site. Phase I and Phase II environmental site
assessments (ESAs) provide a comprehensive overview of the properties and identify point
sources including chemical storage and mixing areas, agrochemical and petroleum storage
tanks, refueling and maintenance areas, and residual agrochemicals and soil addenda in
cultivated areas.
The Phase I and Phase II ESAs identified five tracts of land with potential to contain
contaminated soil, groundwater, or surface water (Figure 3-36). These tracts are:

Woerner Farm 3 (Southern 1/3) – Tract No. 100-039
Talisman South Ranch (Eastern 1/3) – Tract #100-104
Talisman Mill – Tract
Cabassa Farm – Tract #100-105
Farm 21 (northern portion) – Tract #100-020

A description of each tract is described below:
Woerner Farm 3- Tract # 100-039
Tract #100-039 consists of approximately 966 acres of land; however, only approximately 330
acres of the property will be used within the project footprint, plus a small area to the
northwest of the FEB footprint that will be used for a construction yard. The northern 2/3 of
the property will be outside the project footprint and will serve as a buffer area. The norther
2/3 of Tract #100-039 is currently fallow land, but was historically used for production of
vegetables, turfgrass and sugar cane. As part of the previous abandoned EAA Reservoir
construction, the east side of the property was utilized as a construction yard and office
complex by the contractor. No exit assessment was performed at the time the contractor
vacated the property. The southern 1/3 of Tract #100-039 is within the project footprint and

Toxaphene Risk Assessment – October 2005

Three point source areas of concern, including a pump station, a pesticide storage shed, and a
pesticide spill area were identified on the eastern portion of the project and required additional
assessments and/or corrective actions (Figure 3-37). In 2005, over 1,880 tons of toxaphene
impacted soils were excavated from a pesticide spill area. A limited soil excavation of pesticide
and petroleum impacted soils was conducted at the former shed on the Woerner tract. In
addition 130 tons of petroleum impacted soils were excavated from the main pump station.
Concurrence from completion of the remedial activites was obtained from FDEP on all of these
point source areas.
In addition to the point source areas, toxaphene was identified throughout the entirety of Tract
#100-039 at concentrations that pose a potential ecological risk. An Environmental Risk
Assessment (ERA) was prepared and USFWS reviewed the ERA and recommended that SFWMD
either conduct corrective action to remove the contaminated soils or avoid inclusion of this
tract within the former EAA reservoir boundary. The majority of the portion of Tract 100-039
within the project footprint was scraped of surficial soils during the abandoned EAA reservoir
construction and the toxaphene impacted soils may have been largely removed by the scraping.
The Woerner Farm 3 site was resampled in 2012 to determine the levels of toxaphene. Four
out of the five samples exhibited an average of 60-70% degradation in toxaphene
concentrations since 2000, while the fifth sample site exhibited 15% less toxaphene
concentrations. Additional sampling is required on this tract to verify that toxaphene
concentrations in the remaining soils are below ecological risk thresholds and to verify the
disposition of the scraped soils.

Talisman South Ranch (Eastern 1/3) –Tract #100-104
This property consists of approximately 20,525 acres that has been used for the cultivation of
sugar cane since the mid-1960s; however, only an approximate 6,052 acre portion of the
property is within the current project footprint.
Phase I and Phase II ESAs were completed in 1998 for the Talisman South Ranch, including both
Tract #100-104 and Tract #100-029 (Talisman Mill). No sampling was conducted as part of the
1998 Phase II ESA for the Talisman South Ranch to evaluate residual agrochemical impacts
within the cultivated areas. The Phase I and Phase II ESA’s identified only one point source area
within the A-1 FEB project footprint that required remediation. This point source area (T-SHED)
was remediated and a Site Rehabilitation Completion Order (SRCO) was issued by FDEP. Some
contaminated soils containing arsenic concentrations above the FDEP residential cleanup target

level, but below the commercial cleanup target level were allowed to remain in place. An
institutional control (deed restriction) was recorded on this area preventing use of this area for
residential or other sensitive purposes. The point source area location is shown on Figure 3-37.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Tract #100-104 by SFWMD, the District conducted follow-up
site inspections on the property in 2007 and in 2009, when an agricultural lease on the property
expired and the tenant vacated the property. No additional issues were identified during these
assessments.
Additionally, SFWMD has recently conducted soil sampling within previously cultivated areas to
identify whether any residual agrochemicals are present. Copper was identified in only one of
fifteen composite samples at concentrations exceeding the USFWS Interim Screening Level (ISL)
of 85 mg/kg. However, the average copper concentration is below the USFWS ISL and the
ecological risk associated with copper is believed to be low. Additional soil samples indicate
that copper was detected at concentrations that exceed 85 mg/kg in 30% of the samples
collected; however the exceedances represent less than 6% of the total project area. Arsenic
was also detected in the cultivated areas across the entirety of the site at concentrations
exceeding the FDEP residential SCTL, but below the commercial SCTL and the ecological risk
threshold. Arsenic is ubiquitous throughout the EAA at similar or higher concentrations and
may be associated with farming activities or natural background.
Talisman Mill – Tract #100-029
Tract #100-029 encompasses 530.7 acres and includes the former sugar mill and associated
wastewater ponds. The northern portion of the property is improved with a series of bermed
infiltration ponds and water management canals. These areas were formerly utilized for sugar
cane production, until creation of the infiltration ponds. The southern portion of the property
was formerly developed as a sugar mill. Improvements to this area of the property included a
sugar mill, associated offices, warehouses, above ground storage tanks, a fleet fueling area, a
scalehouse, a cane washing area and other related improvements. The sugar mill and ancillary
structures were demolished under the direction of Conestoga Rovers and Associates (CRA) in
1999. Prior to mill demolition, all hazardous materials were removed and properly disposed
off-site. All of the petroleum storage tanks were cleaned and removed.
A Phase I and Phase II ESA was completed on both Tract #100-029 and Tract #100-104 in 1998.
The Phase I ESA identified 27 separate potential point source areas within Tract #100-029 and
all of these areas were investigated as part of the Phase II ESA. Areas of concern at the mill site
included numerous leaking petroleum storage tanks, pesticide and/or arsenic impacted soils in

the sediments of two drainage canals, an ash pit, and a water storage retention area, and
metals-impacted soils adjacent to several building slabs.
Contaminated soil and/or groundwater were identified in 19 of these areas, which were
subsequently remediated by the property owner. The assessment and remediation of these
point source areas was documented in a number of different reports prepared by PSI dating
from 2000 to 2003. Upon completion of the remediation of all of the point source areas, FDEP
issued a single SRCO for the entirety of Tract #100-029.
Contaminated soil exceeding the FDEP residential soil cleanup target levels (SCTLs), but below
the commercial SCTLs and ecological risk thresholds was allowed to remain in place throughout
the tract. Additionally, contaminated soils exceeding the commercial SCTLs and ecological risk
thresholds were consolidated in three small areas within the mill and were capped with 2 feet
of clean soil to prevent future exposure of the soil to wildlife or people. The locations of these
capped areas are shown on Figure 3-38. These areas should not be disturbed during
construction, but should pose no significant risk during or after project construction, if left
undisturbed. A deed restriction was placed on the entirety of Tract #100-029 to prevent its use
for residential or other sensitive purposes. Additionally, the deed restriction prohibits
disturbance of the cap in the previously mentioned contaminated soil consolidation areas.
In summary, all of the physical assessment and remediation intended by SFWMD has been
completed on all of the point source areas within Tract #100-029 and all of the technical
documents relating to the cleanup have been reviewed and accepted by FDEP. No additional
assessment, corrective actions, or closures are required on this property.

Cabassa Farm –Tract #100-105
The Cabassa Farm property consists of approximately 8,846 acres. This property was
historically used for the cultivation of sugarcane while the far southeast portion used for rice
cultivation. A Phase I and Phase II ESAs were conducted in February and March 1999,
respectively. The Phase I and Phase II ESAs identified three point source areas of concern that
required additional assessment and/or corrective actions including an equipment maintenance
area, a cane loading/equipment staging area, and a permanent pump station (C-1-7).
The pump station was assessed and remediated, as document in a 2002 Site Rehabilitation
Completion Report. An SRCO was subsequently issued for the pump station by FDEP.
Additionally, an emergency response cleanup and assessment was conducted at another pump
station on the Cabassa property in 2001, which was also granted closure and SRCO by FDEP.
A Contamination Ecological Risk Assessment and Corrective Action Report was prepared in
January 2002 for this property, which summarized the assessment and remediation activities
associated with the areas of concern. As part of the report, a number of composite soil samples
were collected from the cultivated aeas, as sampling of the cultivated areas was not included in
the 1999 Phase II ESA. Relatively low levels of copper, zinc, and organochlorine pesticides were
detercted in the cultivated area soil samples. The results of the ERA concluded that the residual
concentrations of pesticides, copper, and zinc were not a threat to representative fish and
wildlife species. FDEP concurred with SFWMD’s recommendation for No further Action (NFA)
for the equipment maintenance area and the cane loading/equipment staging area and the
USFWS provided concurrence that the residual agrochemical concentrations in the cultivated
crop area did not pose a significant ecological risk.
An abandoned AST was identified during construction of the EAA reservoir on Tract #100-105,
which was subsequently removed. A tank closure assessment was performed which did not
identify any soil or groundwater contamination and an SRCO was subsequently issued by FDEP.
An exit assessment was performed on Tract #100-105 in 2009, when the agricultural lease on
this property expired and the property was vacated by the tenant. Six soil samples were
collected to compare the current concentrations to the pre-lease conditions. The report
concluded that the agricultural lease operations did not adversely impact the property. USFWS
and FDEP both provided concurrence with this report.
No additional assessment, corrective actions, or closures are required on this property.

Farm 21 - Tract #100-020
Tract 49100-020 (Farm 21) is a 3,441 acre parcel that was formerly operated by Okeelanta for
sugar cane cultivation. However, only a small 206.9-acre strip on the north side of this tract is
included within the A-1 FEB project footprint. A Phase I-II ESA was prepared for Tract #100-020
in 1999. No point source concerns were noted within the portion of Farm 21 that is within the
current project footprint; however, numerous concerns were identified to the south, outside
the project footprint. Since no concerns were identified on the portion of the property that is
within the project footprint, no soil or groundwater samples were collected in this area.
A Contamination Assessment, Ecological Risk Assessment, and Corrective Action Report for STA3/4 was prepared in 2002, which included Tract #100-020, as well as the Cabassa Farm (Tract
100-105) to the north. This assessment included the collection of four composite soil samples
from Tract #100-020. No significant impacts were detected. The Ecological Risk Assessment,
which is discussed above for Tract 100-105 also covered Tract #100-020 and concluded that
there were no significant ecological risks associated with residual agrochemical impacts on this
tract. In summary, no additional assessment, corrective actions, or closures are required on
this property.
Corrective Actions on the A1 Property:
Numerous environmental reports addressing assessment and corrective action activities have
been prepared for each of these tracts. All of these reports are discussed in the A-1 Flow
Equalization Basin Summary Environmental Report, dated September 10, 2012, prepared by
Professional Service Industries, Inc. (PSI). The Summary Environmental Report also includes a
discussion of regulatory review and concurrence on each tract. Information on these reports
can be found at the SFWMD’s FTP directory at:
ftp://ftp.sfwmd.gov/pub/febeis/A1_summary_report/
FDEP provides primary oversight for point source spills or releases while the United States Fish
and Wildlife (USFWS) provides primary oversight for ecological risks. All of the potential point
sources within all five tracts have been investigated, remediated as necessary, and have been
granted closure by the FDEP by letter dated April 14, 2013 (Appendix J). The USFWS has
provided concurrence that no significant ecological risks associated with residual agrochemicals
are present on Tracts #100-105 and #100-020. The USFWS issued separate concurrence on the
entire A-1 FEB project site by letter dated April 17, 2013 (Appendix J), pending confirmation on
remediation of toxaphene impacted soils from the lower 1/3 of the Woerner Farm 3 property
and with the understanding that the SFWMD will implement a USFWS-approved start-up

monitoring plan for copper which includes surface water, periphyton, and apple snails should
they occur onsite.

3.15 CLIMATE
The subtropical climate of South Florida, with its distinct wet and dry seasons, high rate of
evapotranspiration, and climatic extremes of floods, droughts, and hurricanes, represents a
major physical driving force that sustains the Everglades while creating water supply and flood
control issues in the agricultural and urban segments.
Seasonal rainfall patterns in South Florida resemble the wet and dry season patterns of the
humid tropics more than the winter and summer patterns of temperate latitudes. Of the 53
inches of rain that South Florida receives on average annually, 75 percent falls during the wet
season months of May through October. During the wet season, thunderstorms that result
from easterly trade winds and land-sea convection patterns occur almost daily. Wet season
rainfall follows a bimodal pattern with peaks during May through June and September through
October. Tropical storms and hurricanes also provide major contributions to wet season rainfall
with a high level of interannual variability and low level of predictability. During the dry season
(November through April), rainfall is governed by large-scale winter weather fronts that pass
through the region approximately weekly. However, due to the variability of climate patterns
(La Nina and El Nino), dry periods may occur during the wet season and wet periods may occur
during the dry season. High evapotranspiration rates in South Florida roughly equal annual
precipitation. Recorded annual rainfall in South Florida has varied from 37 to 106 inches, and
interannual extremes in rainfall result in frequent years of flood and drought.
Greenhouse gasses produced on the project site as a result of past rock mining and agriculture
are primarily carbon dioxide, while other gasses include methane, nitorous oxide, and
chloroflourocarbons. According to EPA’s 2009 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and
Sinks: 1990-2007, “Executive Summary,” “the primary greenhouse gas emitted by human
activities in the United States was CO2 [carbon dioxide], representing approximately 85.4
percent of total greenhouse gas emissions” (EPA 2009). The carbon dioxide produced on the A1 project site is prodiced from onsite hauling, offsite hauling by truck and rail, and rock quarry
equipment.

3.16 COST
The SFWMD has incurred costs with the previous construction from the EAA A-1 Reservoir.
These are defined as sunk costs (costs already incurred) for the land and initial earthwork that

was conducted and is currently $180,000,000. The SFWMD also conducts routine vegetative
maintenance and maintains measures that prohibit public access on the site.

3.17 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Under Executive Order 12898, Federal agencies are responsible for identifying and addressing
potential disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects on
minority and low-income populations. Minority persons are those who identify themselves as
Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or multiracial (with at least one race designated as a
minority race under Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidelines (CEQ 1997). Persons
whose income is below the Federal poverty threshold are designated as low income.
Disproportionately high and adverse human health effects occur when the risk or rate of
exposure to an environmental hazard for a minority or low-income population is significant (as
defined by the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA]) and appreciably exceeds the risk or
exposure rate for the general population or for another appropriate comparison group (CEQ
1997). A disproportionately high environmental impact that is significant (as defined by NEPA)
refers to an impact or risk of an impact on the natural or physical environment in a low-income
or minority community that appreciably exceeds the environmental impact on the larger
community. Such effects may include ecological, cultural, human health, economic, or social
impacts. An adverse environmental impact is an impact that is determined to be both harmful
and significant (as defined by NEPA).
For the environmental justice analysis for this EIS, the project area was examined. The project
area is composed of the EAA, which is composed mainly of agricultural lands.

3.18 NATURAL OR DEPLEATABLE RESOURCES
The A-1 project site has been previously utilized for sugar cane and sod farming, but currently
the site is not being farmed. Remnant agricultural and remnant infrastructure still exists
throughout the site including agricultural ditches and degraded roads. As a result of permitted
construction activities to construction the A-1 Reservoir, the SFWMD has excavated rock
material on the project site. Limestone, composed of the mineral calcite, is the primary rock
formation which is appropriate for use in building materials and as aggregate for road beds.

4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
4.1

INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides a discussion of the potential environmental effects, which can be either
positive or negative, that could result from implementation of the Alternatives. A detailed
description of the alternatives is provided in Chapter 2. The evaluation of the effects was based
on results of modeling simulations (as described below), current information including scientific
literature, direct observation, project design reports, reasonable scientific judgment, the
scoping process, and other environmental impact statement (EIS) documents for similar
projects. The No Action Alternative considers the environmental conditions in the affected
regions without the Proposed Action. However, the modeling analysis does include other
planned restoration projects anticipated to be fully or partially in operation by 2015-2020 [C-43
West Reservoir, C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area (STA), Site 1 Impoundment,
Broward Water Preserve Area (C-11 and C-9 Impoundments), C-111 Spreader Canal project, and
the Loxahatchee River Watershed Restoration Plan].
Environmental impacts include both direct and indirect effects. Under the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, direct effects are “caused by the action and occur at
the same time and place,” while indirect effects are “caused by the action and are later in time
or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect effects may include
growth inducing effects and other effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use,
population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural
systems, including ecosystems” (40 CFR 1508.8). Potential impacts of this project in concert
with other reasonably foreseeable projects (cumulative effects) is discussed in Section 4.19,
unavoidable adverse impacts, effects to the resources that cannot or would not be reversed in
a foreseeable amount of time (irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources), any
conflicts and controversy associated with this project, and environmental commitments.

4.2

MODELING EFFORTS

The objective of the modeling efforts was to evaluate the effects on hydrology, water quality,
and the downstream environment. The results of the modeling efforts that describe the overall
water management is described in Section 4.5.1, surface water hydrology including surface
ponding and hydroperiod in Section 4.5.2, groundwater in Section 4.5.3, and water quality in
Section 4.6.

Three models were integrated into this EIS: 1) the South Florida Water Management Model
[SFWMM or 2x2 (SFWMD, 2005)]; 2) the Dynamic Model for Stormwater Treatment Areas
(DMSTA) Version 2 (Walker and Kadlec, 2005); and 3) the Regional Simulation Model (RSM)
(SFWMD, 2005). See Figure 4-1 for the approximate spatial extent of each of the three models
used in this EIS. The Model Documentation Reports for SFWMM, DMSTA and RSM describe the
methods and assumptions in detail and are provided in Appendix E. Performance measure
graphics for the alternatives are provided within Section 4. These three models represent the
best available tools for simulating hydrology and water quality. Each model has been
developed specifically for the Everglades region, and has been developed and refined over a
period of several years.
Figure 4-1 Approximate Model Domains

4.2.1 SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT MODEL
The SFWMM (or 2x2) is a regional, hydrologic computer model specifically developed and
applied to simulate the unique hydrology of the south Florida system and its regional
management. Use of the SFWMM in this EIS involved application of the model to estimate the
volume and timing of surface water flows discharged from source basins contributing inflows to

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

existing STAs and proposed project features associated with the alternatives described below,
with eventual discharge into the Everglades Protection Area (EPA).
The SFWMM is a coupled surface water-groundwater model which incorporates overland flow,
canal routing, unsaturated zone accounting and two-dimensional single layer aquifer flow. The
model simulates the major components of the hydrologic cycle in south Florida including
rainfall, evapotranspiration, infiltration, overland and groundwater flow, canal flow, canal
groundwater seepage, levee seepage and groundwater pumping. The model has been
exclusively developed for the south Florida region and has been calibrated and verified using
water level and discharge measurements at hundreds of locations distributed throughout the
region within the model boundaries. In addition to simulating the natural hydrology in south
Florida, the model also simulates the management processes that satisfy policy-based rules to
meet flood control, water supply and environmental needs. It can incorporate current or
proposed water management control structures and current or proposed operational rules. The
SFWMM simulates hydrology on a daily basis using climatic data for the 1965-2005 period of
record which includes many droughts and wet periods.
The SFWMM simulation RS_BASE2 used in this EIS provided the modeled hydrologic estimates
for inclusion in the DMSTA water quality modeling effort described below. The intent of the
SFWMM simulation RS_BASE2 is to represent a projection of the south Florida system
hydrology as it would be in the future condition (circa 2015-2020). This projection is dependent
on several assumptions, including anticipated completion of current and planned projects,
system operating protocols and projections of future consumptive use and environmental
demands. Although the entire south Florida regional system is modeled by the SFWMM, the
modeling results for this EIS focused on the basin hydrology in and in the vicinity of the
Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) specifically related to basins that contribute flow to
Everglades STAs that discharge into the EPA. The period of simulation (or selected period of
record) of RS_BASE2 is January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2005. For the purposes of this EIS,
SFWMM simulation RS_BASE2 provides hydrologic estimates of the areas identified in Figure 41. A detailed description of the south Florida system-wide assumptions and projects that were
incorporated into the RS_BASE2 scenario is provided in the SFWMM Model Documentation
Report provided in detail in Appendix E.
For each basin, daily flow time series were provided from the SFWMM output. These daily flow
time series provide the basis for the generation of inputs to the DMSTA model. The SFWMM
daily flows were post-processed using methods that are consistent with previous DMSTA
modeling efforts (Gary Goforth, Inc., 2009). Essentially, SFWMM post-processing requires the
merging of historical phosphorus concentration data from contributing source basins with the
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

SFWMM daily flows to generate inflow datasets for DMSTA. During this process, some aspects
of the SFWMM-estimated hydrology are recalculated or rescaled to more closely approximate
observed historical data. Specific post-processing details are provided in the Model
Documentation Report provided in Appendix E.
For this EIS, the inflow datasets for DMSTA that were prepared by post-processing SFWMM
daily flows were utilized for all EIS alternatives. Any changes as a result of alternative project
features and their operations were formulated and evaluated as part of the DMSTA water
quality modeling effort. To be clear, SFWMM was not utilized to formulate or evaluate
alternatives; this was accomplished by the DMSTA and RSM modeling efforts described below.
As a planning tool, the SFWMM was applied to estimate regional-scale hydrologic responses to
proposed modifications to the water management system in south Florida. Results from the
regional scale investigation were then used for more detailed modeling and investigation at a
sub-regional scale, which in turn provided the bases for detailed evaluation of specific
alternatives. Therefore, SFWMM results are equivalent for all EIS alternatives.

4.2.2 DYNAMIC MODEL FOR STORMWATER TREATMENT AREAS
The DMSTA was used to simulate EAA surface water routing, and estimate the phosphorus
removal performance of the STAs and Flow Equalization Basins (FEBs) in the alternatives.
DMSTA was developed for the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) (Walker and Kadlec, 2005; http://wwwalker.net/dmsta/).
DMSTA was developed and calibrated to information specific to south Florida and to predict
phosphorus removal performance of Everglades STAs and storage reservoirs, and has been
commonly used since 2001 by state and federal agencies for STA design and evaluation. The
2005 version of DMSTA was calibrated to data from 35 fully functional STA treatment cells with
vegetation communities of various types. The model provides detailed output on the water
and phosphorus balances of individual treatment cells and entire STAs, regional networks of
STAs and storage reservoirs.
Model input requirements include daily values for flow, phosphorus concentration, rainfall,
evapotranspiration (ET), depth (optional input or simulated value) and releases (optional input
or simulated), treatment area configuration, cell size, flow path width, vegetation type,
estimates of hydraulic mixing, outflow hydraulics, and seepage estimates. Phosphorus removal
rates (settling rates) and other phosphorus cycling parameters can be either user-defined or
calculated within DMSTA based on calibration data sets. DMSTA assumes that specified
vegetation types (emergent, submerged, periphyton) will be maintained over the 40-year

A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

hydrologic period used as a basis for design, with some allowance for down time required for
maintenance.
Some level of forecast error may result when applying any model, reflecting the limitations of
the calibration datasets (data range, measurement error, short duration, etc.). One limitation
of DMSTA is that the model may not reproduce phosphorus loading spikes observed in some
STA cells following periods of extended dry-out. Careful management of treatment cell water
depths and operating the STA in conjunction with an FEB may be two options to minimize the
frequency and duration of such conditions. DMSTA may forecast outflow concentrations below
values observed in the field following extreme drought conditions if management measures are
unsuccessful at maintaining sufficient water levels. To ensure a conservative analysis, annual
values less than 12 parts per billion (ppb) simulated by DMSTA were replaced with a value of 12
ppb in both this EIS and the Restoration Strategies Regional Water Quality Plan.
DMSTA is the best available tool for simulating phosphorus removal performance of existing or
planned storage reservoirs and STAs. DMSTA is configured to allow integration with the
SFWMD’s regional hydrologic models, such as the SFWMM (SFWMD, 2005) and can be
configured to simulate complex regional networks of STAs and reservoirs. DMSTA’s spreadsheet
interface and relatively limited input data requirements allow the development and evaluation
of various alternatives (Walker and Kadlec, 2011). For this EIS, DMSTA results are summarized
for the water years (Water Years 1965 – 2005 or May 1, 1965 – April 30, 2005) that are
contained with the SFWMM period simulation (January 1, 1965 – December 31, 2005), which is
used as input for the RSM.
DMSTA Results
The phosphorus removal performance of Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 was projected using
DMSTA. DMSTA provides simulated inflow and outflow volumes, and total phosphorus
concentrations and loads for the FEBs and STAs. DMSTA also provides water depths within the
project area and the FEBs and STAs. These results were used, in part, to determine effects on
water resources, vegetation, fish and wildlife, and threatened and endangered species in the
project site, and in STA 2, and STA 3/4. However, DMSTA results alone are not sufficient for
evaluating environmental effects within Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A, WCA 3A and Holey
Land Wildlife Management Area (Holey Land). Therefore, DMSTA-simulated daily flows were
provided as boundary flows to Glades and Lower East Coast Service Area (LECSA) RSM for
further analysis in order to understand effects of the alternatives on areas downstream of the
STAs. In some areas, DMSTA flows were combined with SFWMM flows (not simulated within
DMSTA) and provided as input to the Glades LECSA RSM. See the DMSTA modeling report
provided in Appendix E for more information.

4.2.3 REGIONAL SIMULATION MODEL
The Glades and LECSA RSM model (also referred to as the Glades-LECSA model) is an
application of the RSM developed by the SFWMD. RSM was used to project the hydrologic
conditions downstream of the STAs. The Glades-LECSA model represents the most recent
generation of integrated surface and groundwater flow models developed specifically to
address the complexity of south Florida’s hydrologic system. The model also has capabilities to
predict the outcomes of implementing structural and operational changes to the water
management system in south Florida. The Glades-LECSA model domain includes all WCAs,
Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve and the Lower East Coast Service Areas
south of the C-51 Canal in Palm Beach County. The Glades-LECSA model was used in this EIS to
evaluate the hydrologic impacts of the EIS alternatives within the affected environment.
The RSM is an implicit, finite volume, continuous, distributed and integrated surface-water and
groundwater model. It simulates the one-dimensional canal/stream flow and two-dimensional
overland and groundwater flow in arbitrarily shaped areas using a variable triangular mesh. The
overland and groundwater flow components are fully coupled for a more realistic
representation of the hydrology in south Florida. It has physically based formulations for the
hydrologic processes which include evapotranspiration, infiltration, levee seepage, and canal
and structure flows. The model uses the diffusive wave approximation of Saint-Venant’s
equation to simulate canal and overland flows. The Manning’s equation is used to simulate
overland flow. The Glades-LECSA model mesh consists of 5,794 triangular cells with an average
cell size of approximately one square mile. The domain takes into consideration the need for
having higher spatial resolution in areas where steep hydraulic gradients and prominent
physical features (e.g., levees) exist. The mesh resolution is the finest in the natural areas,
especially WCA 3B, which has the smallest average cell area (0.41 square miles) and finest
resolution. The mesh is designed to conform to all important flow controlling features, such as
roads and levees within the model domain. A one-day time step was used for the calibration
and validation of the model. The model has been stringently calibrated with goodness of fit (for
bias and root mean squared error) comparable to the SFWMM. The model results show that
the Glades-LECSA model is capable of simulating, with an acceptable error tolerance, the stage
and other stage dependent variables such as flow, flow vectors, ponding depth and
hydroperiods within the model domain.
The Glades-LECSA model used as a baseline in this EIS reflects the south Florida system
hydrology as it would be in the future condition without any of the EIS alternatives, or in the No
Action Alternative. It is comparable to the SFWMM model (described above) in that it includes

projects and operations circa 2015-2020. It also includes the recently implemented Everglades
Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP) schedule in WCA 3A. The period of simulation of the GladesLECSA model is January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2005. For simulation of the EIS alternatives,
the Glades-LECSA model boundary conditions at the northern model boundary are a
combination of output from the SFWMM and DMSTA for each of the four alternatives. In other
words, outflows from the EIS alternatives, as simulated by DMSTA, are combined with relevant
SFWMM boundary conditions (not simulated by DMSTA) and provided as input to the GladesLECSA model.
Glades LECSA RSM Results
Glades LECSA RSM simulates daily components of the hydrologic cycle (canal and structure
flows, infiltration, levee seepage, evapotranspiration, etc.) resulting from daily precipitation
and climate variables for the period of January 1, 1965 to December 31, 2005. Using Glades
LECSA RSM, the influence of implementing the Action Alternatives and their resultant
infrastructure changes and water management practices on the region’s water resources can
be evaluated over a 41-year period of meteorological conditions (1965-2005). The Glades LECSA
RSM simulation used a baseline for this EIS represents the south Florida system hydrology as it
would be in the 2015-2020 condition without any of the EIS alternatives.
Performance measure graphics are outputs of Glades LECSA RSM and were utilized for this EIS
to assist in the evaluation of the effects of the EIS alternatives on WCA 2A and WCA 3A. These
graphics identify the potential downstream effects to surface water hydrology, which in turn
were considered in the evaluation of effects to soil; geology; water supply; surface water
management; water quality; vegetation; and threatened and endangered species; fish and
wildlife. See the RSM modeling results provided in Appendix E for more information.

LAND USE

Pursuant to grant agreement FB-4 entitled Cooperative Agreement Among the United States
Department of the Interior and the Nature Conservancy and The South Florida Water
Management District (Cooperative Agreement), lands acquired for public ownership under the
Cooperative Agreement, including the A-1 project site will be used and managed for purposes
of restoration in the Everglades ecosystem . Any proposed change in land use of Compartment
A-1 may not be implemented until the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)/DOI: 1) reviews
the proposal; 2) determines that it meets the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, and any other applicable statutes; and 3) approves the proposal. The
Cooperative Agreement also includes a provision for dispute resolution. The USFWS/DOI
approved an interim land use change for the A-1 project site on July 12, 2006, for utilization of
the site as the A-1 Reservoir.

Environmental Effects

4.3.1 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE
If the site were to remain fallow or return to agricultural use, it would no longer be used for
restoration purposes pursuant to the Farm Bill and the Cooperative Agreement. Therefore, any
proposed land use of the site would need to be evaluated by the USFWS/DOI pursuant to the
terms of the Cooperative Agreement. The land uses for STAs 2 and 3/4 would not change. The
STAs would continue to be utilized for water quality purposes, and they would continue to
support ancillary recreational uses such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing. The land uses
in WCA 2A, WCA 3A, and the Holey Land also would not change. WCA 2A and WCA 3A would
continue to store flood waters for beneficial municipal, urban, and agricultural uses and would
continue to provide flood protection, water supply storage, and environmental resource
protection while Holey Land would continue to provide environmental resource protection.

4.3.2 ACTION ALTERNATIVES
4.3.2.1

Project site

Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would utilize the A-1 site in combination with STA 2 and STA 3/4 to
ensure that water leaving the STA discharge points meets the WQBEL prior to discharge into
the EPA. Each of the Action Alternatives would only accept existing water from Lake
Okeechobee. Unlike the previous A-1 Reservoir project, the Shallow FEB, Deep FEB, and the
STA are designed to store water from Lake Okeechobee that is currently budgeted to be
discharged south. The change in the purpose of the projects would require the lands to be
used for water quality purposes rather than water storage purposes. Therefore, each of the
Action Alternatives would require approval for a land use change from the USFWS/DOI.

4.3.2.2

Stormwater Treatment Areas

Under the Action Alternatives, the land use for STA 2 (including Compartment B) and STA 3/4
would not change. Operations of the STAs would continue in order to provide water quality
improvement in discharges to the EPA. Land use would continue to be classified as
public/institutional or conservation and would continue to support ancillary recreational uses
such as hunting, fishing, and wildlife viewing.

4.3.2.3

WCAs and Holey Land

Under the Action Alternatives, there would be no changes in the land uses for WCA 2A, WCA
3A, and the Holey Land.

GEOLOGY, TOPOGRAPHY AND SOILS

4.4.1 GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY
4.4.1.1

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, surficial geology of the project site, the STAs, the WCAs, or
Holey Land is not anticipated to change. The project area would likely remain undisturbed or be
converted back to active agriculture. In the future, soils are expected to continue to subside
within the project area due to oxidation and lack of new sediment deposition within the project
area. As soil subsides, the topography is expected to lower slightly. No changes to topography
are expected for the STAs, the WCAs, or Holey Land under the No Action Alternative since the
land use and surface water operations within these areas are not expected to change.

4.4.1.2

Action Alternatives

With all the action alternatives, there would be minor geologic impacts within the project area
from the removal of surface cover (e.g. vegetation and soil), of the caprock from blasting, and
removal of limestone to obtain material for construction of levees, canals and roads. The depth
of the caprock varies from less than 1 to 4 feet; and averages a depth of approximately 2 feet
across the project site. Seepage and borrow canals would be constructed with all three of the
Action Alternatives and portions of existing canals and ditches would require fill to provide
elevations consistent with the adjacent wetlands for Alternatives 2 (Shallow FEB) and 3 (Deep
FEB).
Alternatives 2 and 4 would result in conversion of relatively flat, uniform agricultural lands to an
FEB or STA with shallow water (4 feet maximum operating depth) and exterior levees up to 10
feet above existing grade (generally 7 to 9 feet North American Vertical Datum 1988).
Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) would require internal levees to be constructed to enable the
conveyance of flows to the north end of the project site. Alternative 4 (STA) would also require
additional internal levees to be constructed to delineate STA treatment cells and flow-paths.
Alternative 3 is an FEB with deep water (12.5 feet maximum operating depth) and exterior
levees up to 25 feet above existing grade. For Alternative 3 (Deep FEB), additional blasting or
fracturing of the caprock would be required both to construct the higher levee walls and to
construct an associated pump station. The seepage buffer on the east, west, and north of the
project site would have a 150-foot wide strip at existing grade.

Environmental Effects

No changes to geology or topography are expected are expected within the STAs, the WCAs, or
Holey Land through implementation of any of the action alternatives as additional features,
land use, and operations are not expected to change.

4.4.2 SOILS
4.4.2.1

No Action

Under the No Action Alternative it is expected that the project site would remain fallow or
return to agriculture. Currently, direct rainfall is the dominant source of water for the project
site. Under the No Action Alternative, dryout conditions and the resultant loss of soil due to
oxidation would persist and possibly increase in frequency dependent upon future climatic
conditions. With re-wetting, the oxidized soil releases phosphorus and other nutrients into the
overlying water column thereby increasing the nutrient concentrations in runoff from the site.
In addition to impacts on nutrient concentrations, it is expected that the continued loss of soil
due to oxidation during dry conditions will result in a slightly lower topography in the project
site in the future.
Under the No Action Alternative, STAs 2 and 3/4 will continue to face substantial management
challenges caused by regional hydrologic conditions. As discussed in previous chapters,
insufficient rainfall during the dry season can cause extreme low water conditions that expose
wetland soils and result in the oxidation of organic material and the release nutrients. These
conditions hinder the treatment performance of the STAs and threaten to delay or prevent the
attainment of the Water Quality Based Effluent Limit (WQBEL).
If STA discharges exceed the WQBEL as projected under the No Action Alternative, the excess
phosphorus discharged downstream will increase soil phosphorus concentrations in the WCAs.
The current pattern of soil phosphorus enrichment near the major inflow points would remain
and the gradient of elevated nutrient levels would continue to expand over time into the
interior of the marsh. Soil characterization studies of the phosphorus gradient in WCA 2A have
shown a roughly proportional increase in concentration of phosphorus near the major surface
water inflow points concentrations at the major inflow points to the WCAs (DeBusk et al, 2001).
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no affect to soils in the Holey Land.

4.4.2.2

Action Alternatives

During construction of levees, the muck soils would be removed and stockpiled on site to
access the limestone. Following construction of the interior and exterior levees, excess muck

Environmental Effects

would be redistributed over the previously scraped areas and in limited areas, back-sloped
against the exterior face of the eastern and western interior levees. Alternatives 2 and 4 are
expected to encourage vegetation establishment and wetland ecological function due to the
shallow nature of the water levels. Muck soils would likely increase as a layer of fine sediments
containing a high level of organic debris and nutrients would likely settle from the overlying
water and cover the bottom. The soils within the project site are anticipated to remain hydric
and retain muck properties or revert to muck properties post-construction. Alternative 3, the
Deep FEB, is expected to contain less organic debris and nutrients since rooted vegetation
would not be present.
The FEBs proposed in Alternatives 2 and 3 have the potential to benefit soils within STA 2 and
STA 3/4 by maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of dryout conditions.
Decreasing the frequency of dryout conditions will reduce the potential for soil oxidation and
the resulting release of phosphorus and other nutrients from the soil. The probability of
experiencing dryout conditions in STA 2 and STA 3/4 is greater under Alternative 4 (STA), as it
would not operate to maintain the minimum water levels in the STAs.
Lower phosphorus concentrations coming from the STA 2 and STA 3/4 would reduce the rate of
soil phosphorus accumulation in WCA soils. Over time, reductions in soil total phosphorus (TP)
will help facilitate the restoration of impacted areas near the inflow points to WCA 2A and WCA
3A creating conditions more conducive to historic Everglades vegetative communities. The
overall soil classification (histosol) and structure (muck) is not expected to change.
Alternatives 2 and 3 (FEBs) would have no effect on the soils in the Holey Land. Alternative 4
would require the construction of a discharge canal from the proposed STA to the L-5 Canal,
which would disturb soils on the eastern portion of Holey Land adjacent to Cells 3A and 3B
within STA 3/4. The remaining soils within Holey Land would remain undisturbed.

If agricultural activities were to resume on the A-1 project site, water would continue to enter

the water would continue to flow from the existing agricultural ditches to the STA 3/4 seepage
canal.
There should be no changes to the surface water management within the STAs, WCAs, or Holey
Land under the No Action Alternative.

4.5.1.2
4.5.1.2.1

Action Alternatives
Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)

The Shallow FEB will be operated in series with (upstream of) STA 2 and STA 3/4. Inflows would
be conveyed to the Shallow FEB from the Miami Canal via the existing pump station G-372 and
from the North New River Canal via existing pump station G-370. After inflows are conveyed to
the north end of the Shallow FEB, the water would sheet flow from north to south. An internal
collection canal would be constructed to assist in conveying water out of the Shallow FEB back
to the North New River Canal when the water deliveries are needed. Two operable water
control structures will be constructed to control FEB water levels and flows into and out of the
FEB; one at the existing pump station G-370 at the North New River Canal and one east of the
existing pump station G-372 within the west levee of the FEB to collect runoff from the Miami
Canal. To send water to STA 3/4, operable water control structures may also be constructed to
allow discharges to be conveyed via gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. To send water
to STA 2, water would be pumped from the North New River Canal by the G-434 and G-435
pump stations. As stated in Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2, the majority of the shallow FEB outflows
(approximately 80%) would be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining flows
(approximately 20%) would be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B). Thus, out of the
approximately 834,000 acre-feet of water per year that flows south to STA 2 and STA 3/4,
667,200 acre-feet per year would be conveyed to STA 3/4 while 166,800 acre-feet per year
would be conveyed to STA 2. No changes to the structural components of the water
management systems would be required for water inflows into STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA
3A, or Holey Land.

4.5.1.2.2

Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)

The Deep FEB is operated in series with (upstream of) STA 2 and STA 3/4. The Deep FEB would
receive water from the Miami Canal via existing pump station G-372, and from the North New
River Canal via existing pump station G-370 and the new inflow pump station. Outflows would
be conveyed back to the North New River Canal when water deliveries are needed. Operable
water control structures may also be constructed to allow FEB discharges to be conveyed via
gravity directly to the STA 3/4 inflow canal. The majority of the Deep FEB outflows

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

(approximately 60%) would be directed to STA 3/4 for treatment while the remaining flows
(approximately 40%) would be conveyed to STA 2 (including Compartment B). Thus, out of the
approximately 834,000 acre-feet of water per year that flows south to STA 2 and STA 3/4,
667,200 acre-feet per year would be conveyed to STA 3/4 while 166,800 acre-feet per year
would be conveyed to STA 2. No changes to the structural components of the water
management systems would be required for water inflows into STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA
3A, or Holey Land.

4.5.1.2.3

Alternative 4 (STA)

The STA would operate in parallel with STA 2 and STA 3/4 (i.e. would provide additional STA
acreage, but would not deliver water from this A-1 STA to STA 2 or STA 3/4). The proposed A-1
STA would utilize the existing STA 3/4 inflow pump stations (G-370 and G-372) to convey
stormwater runoff to the proposed STA. Flows would be distributed to the STA cells [33%
emerged aquatic vegetation (EAV) and 67% submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)] via water
control structures and conveyed north-to-south in internal collection canals. In order to operate
the new STA, the STA discharge canal would need to be connected to the L-5 Canal, which
would require the proposed discharge canal to be constructed within a small portion of the
perimeter of the Holey Land. This would enable the delivery of discharges from the proposed A1 STA to WCA 2A and/or WCA 3A via existing infrastructure, and would not alter the existing
operations of STA 2, STA 3/4 and the North New River and Miami Canals. No changes to the
structural components of the water management systems would be required for water inflows
into STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, and WCA 3A.

4.5.2 SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
As described in Section 4.2, data obtained from the modeling efforts were used to estimate the
volume and timing of surface water flows discharged from source basins contributing inflows to
existing STAs and proposed project features associated with the Alternatives, with eventual
discharge into the EPA. The source basins and their average annual flow volumes simulated by
the SFWMM and post-processed as described above are provided in Table 4-1.

No Action
Project Site

Under the No Action Alternative, the surface water hydrology at the project site would likely
remain rainfall driven if the area remains fallow. The wetlands would continue to experience
seasonal ponding and the water levels in the ditches and canals would fluctuate depending on
rainfall. During the rainy season, the scraped wetlands typically contain water depths between
6 and 12 inches of water while the scrub/shrub wetlands and exotic scrub/shrub wetlands
typically contain water depths greater than 12 inches of water. During the dry season, no
standing water is present. The canals are approximately 12 feet in depth while the canals are 6
feet in depth. Stormwater would continue to run off the lands into existing agricultural ditches
and to the STA 3/4 seepage canal. If the project site was converted back to active agriculture,
drainage improvements would likely be necessary to convey stormwater to the North New
River Canal.

4.5.2.1.2

STA 2 and STA 3/4

Under the No Action Alternative, the surface water hydrology of STA 2 and STA 3/4 would
continue to function as it does today and continue to operate under the existing operational
plans. Agricultural and/or urban stormwater runoff primarily from the S-2, S-5A, S-6 and S-7
basins collected by the Hillsboro and North New River Canals would continue to be pumped
directly into STA 2, while agricultural and/or urban stormwater runoff from the S-2, S-3, S-7, S-8
and C-139 basins collected by the North New River and Miami Canals would continue to be
pumped directly into STA 3/4 for treatment. STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to receive peak
stormwater flows and continue to experience dryout conditions that occur as a result of
extreme hydrologic conditions that exist in south Florida. These conditions adversely impact the

phosphorus removal performance of the STAs. Wet season conditions would likely continue to
result in longer than optimal durations of greater than optimal water depths.
STA 2 and STA 3/4 are currently operated to encourage the growth and establishment of
wetland plants within the STAs to optimize the uptake of phosphorus from stormwater passing
through the cells. Maintaining minimum water stages improves the STA’s phosphorus
treatment performance by keeping the STAs hydrated and ensuring the viability of EAV and
SAV, and regulating inflows to minimize high hydraulic loading rates. As stated in the
Operations Plan dated December 2010 and August 2007 for STA 2 and STA 3/4, respectively,
the treatment cells within the STA are recommended to be operated at target depths under
normal operations:
•

•

Minimum Depth: To the maximum extent practicable, a minimum static water level
of 0.5 feet above the ground elevation should be maintained to avoid drying out the
treatment cell, subject to available water from the upstream watershed.
Maximum Depth: To the maximum extent practicable, a maximum static water level
of 4.0 feet above the ground elevation should not be exceeded to avoid damage to
the levees and marsh vegetation.

Table 4-2 provides the average annual inflow, diversion, and outflow volumes for STA 3/4 and
STA 2 for the No Action Alternative. Out of the approximately 834,000 acre-feet of water per
year that flows south to STA 2 and STA 3/4, 805,000 acre-feet of water per year enters STA 2
and STA 3/4 while 29,000 acre-feet per year from these basins and 27,000 acre-feet per year of
Urban Water Supply are diverted around or bypass the STAs. Water diversions consist of the
delivery of water to the WCAs without treatment by the STAs, usually during extreme storm
events to maintain flood control. Conversely, urban water supplies are the deliveries of water
to the canals passing through the WCAs without treatment by the STAs during dry periods, but
delivered to the coast to maintain freshwater gradient in the coastal wells. Figures 4-2 and 4-3
are ponding depth hydrographs based on DMSTA modeling for STA 2 and STA 3/4, respectively,
for the No Action Alternative. Figure 4-4 shows ponding depth duration curves for STA 2 and

WCA 2A

Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 2A receives approximately

include treated flows from STA 2 and STA 3/4, STA 2 and STA 3/4 diversion flows and urban
water supply flows. The amount of urban water supplies discharged from the WCAs is offset by
the same volume of water from Lake Okeechobee. A gauge location map is provided in Figure

Figure 4-10 provides average annual ponding depths for WCA 2A and WCA 3A while Figure 4-11
provides average annual hydroperiod distribution for WCA 2A and WCA 3A. The ponding
depths and hydroperiod durations in WCA 2A and WCA 3A under the No Action Alternatives will
be used to identify potential changes in the WCAs for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4.
In WCA 2A, the average annual ponding depths range from 0 feet to over 3 feet above the
surface level. However, the majority of WCA 2A contains water depths between 0.5 feet and
2.0 feet. Three cells contain water depths between 0 feet and 0.5 feet above the surface, three
cells contain water depths between 2 and 3 feet above the surface, while two cells in the
southern portion contains water depths above 3 feet. In WCA 2A, the majority of the cells
contain surface water between 300 and 365 days of the year. Eight cells contain standing water
for 240-300 days out of the year, while one cell contains water above the surface for 120-180
days out of the year.

WCA 3A

Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 3A receives approximately
400,000 acre-feet per year via the S-150 structure and the S-8 pump station. These WCA 3A
inflows include treated flows from STA 3/4, STA 3/4 diversion flows and urban water supply
flows. Performance measure graphics were generated for several gauge locations within WCA
3A and for the entire area. A gauge location map is provided in Figure 4-5.
Five monitoring sites were chosen to depict the changes in ponding depths within WCA 3A (3ANW, 3A-NE, 3A-3, 3A-4, and 3A-28). Hydrographs of daily ponding depths (feet of surface
water) and duration curves of ponding depths (days of surface water inundation on average per
year) are provided for the WCA gauge locations. Changes in these hydrographs will be used to
identify any potential effects of the Alternatives in later sections (Section 4.5.2.2.4). Water
levels in WCA 3A over the period of record simulated by RSM at each gauge location is
described below.
3A-NW: A ponding depth hydrograph and ponding depth duration curve for 3A-NW are
provided in Figures 4-12 and 4-13, respectively, for all Alternatives. Under the No Action

In WCA 3A, the average annual ponding depths range from 0 feet to over 3 feet above the
surface (Figure 4-10). The northern portion of WCA 3A is dryer (depths range between 0 and
0.5 feet) while the water levels increase as it travels south, with depths ranging between 1-2
feet above the surface. Along the southeastern border of WCA 3A, water depths are the
deepest and range between 2-3 feet. Two cells in this area contain water depths above three
feet.
WCA 3A contains water between 60 and 365 days of the year (Figure 4-11). The hydroperiod is
dryer along the northern perimeter of the area and range between 120-240 days of the year,
with one cell between 60-120 days of hydroperiod per year. The hydroperiod increases in the
southern portion of WCA 3A, with durations between 300-365 days of the year.

Action Alternatives
Project Site

Construction and operation of all three Action Alternatives (Shallow FEB, Deep FEB, and STA)
would affect surface water hydrology within the project site. Post construction, water from the
North New River Canal and the Miami Canal would be pumped into the A-1 project site, which
would be either the Shallow FEB, Deep FEB or the A-1 STA, and would be contained within
levees and managed at various depths, unique to each Alternative. For Alternatives 2 (Shallow
FEB) and 3 (Deep FEB), water released from the project site would enter either STA 2 or STA 3/4
before being released into the WCA 2A or 3A. For Alternative 4 (A-1 STA), water released from
the project site would directly enter WCA 2A or WCA 3A. A summary of DMSTA-simulated
inflow and outflow volumes on the A-1 project site for all Alternatives as compared to the No
Action Alternative is provided in Table 4-3.
The Deep FEB has the greatest Average Annual volume of inflows because it provides the
greatest storage capacity, so it has the ability to temporarily store more runoff per year on
average than the Shallow FEB or the STA. This would be a benefit during storm events if the
additional capacity is needed. The Shallow FEB, Deep FEB, and the STA each lose approximately

Figure 4-26 provides ponding depth hydrographs for the project site for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4.
Figure 4-27 provides ponding depth duration curves for the project site for Alternatives 2, 3,
and 4. Figures 4-28, 4-29, and 4-30 show the monthly depths for the project site with median,
quartile, and 10% to 90% percentiles for Alternative 2, Alternative 3, and Alternative 4,
respectively.
Under Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) water inflows and outflows on the project site would
increase compared to the No Action Alternative, which has no water entering the site. An
average of 274,000 acre-feet per year of water would enter the site, while 272,000 acre-feet
per year would exit the site. The Shallow FEB would be operated at inflow water depths
ranging from 0 to 4 feet and would be inundated with water depths greater than 1.5 feet for 60
percent of the time (Figures 4-26 and 4-27). For six months of the year, the site would average
around 1 foot, varying from 0.3 feet to over three feet, while water depths would average from
2 to 3.5 feet during the rainy season (Figure 4-28). As compared to the No Action Alternative,
Alternative 2 would increase the ponding stages on the site up to four feet under a managed
operation plan (Figure 4-26).
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) would result in the highest water inflows and outflows on the project
site. This alternative could retain more water than the other Alternatives during a storm event
due to the deeper capacity. Approximately 336,000 acre-feet per year of water would enter
the site, while 333,000 acre-feet per year would exit the site. The Deep FEB would be operated
at inflow water depths ranging from 0-12.5 feet and would be inundated with water depths
greater than 1.75 feet for 60 percent of the time, greater than 6 feet for 20 percent of the time,
and greater than 10 feet for 10 percent of the time (Figures 4-26, 4-27). For five months of the
year, the site would average around 2 feet, varying from 0.3 feet to almost six feet, while water
depths would average from 2 to 6 feet during the rainy season (Figure 4-29). Alternative 3

would increase the ponding stages on the site up to 12.5 feet under a managed operation plan
(Figure 4-26).
Alternative 4 (STA) would result in an increase in water inflows and outflows on the project site
compared to the No Action Alternative. Due to the need to operate the site to maintain STA
vegetation, the site would also require surface water diversions. Approximately 252,000 acrefeet per year of water would enter the site, while 250,000 acre-feet per year would exit the
site. Due to the necessary diversion of 5,000 acre-feet per year, Alternative 4 only has outflows
of 245,000 acre-feet of water per year. Similar to Alternative 2, Alternative 4 would result in
water depths at the project site ranging from 0 to 4 feet and the site would be inundated with
water at depths of 1.5 feet or more for 60 percent of the time (Figures 4-26 and 4-27). For five
months of the year, the site would average around 1.5 feet, varying from 0.5 feet to almost 2.5
feet, while water depths would average from 1.5 to 2.5 feet during the rainy season (Figure 430). As compared to the No Action Alternative, Alternative 4 would increase the ponding stages
on the site up to 4 feet under a managed operation plan (Figure 4-26).

STA 2 and STA 3/4

A summary is provided of STA 2 and STA 3/4 inflow and outflow volumes, water diversions
(water routed around the STAs into the WCA due to high water events), and urban water supply
(water routed around the STAs during low water events) in Table 4-4. For the Alternatives 2, 3,
and 4, which reflect the increased inflows and outflows of the project site as modeled, rainfall
and evapotranspiration for the project site are simulated by the DMSTA model, which does not
result in runoff from the site. Instead runoff is stored within the FEB or STA facilities and is
eventually discharged from the project site with other FEB or STA discharges. For the No Action
Alternative, where no discharge from the site is expected, rainfall and evapotranspiration are
simulated by the 2x2 model, which results in runoff from the project site. This results in slight
variation in the calculations which are explained below.
Values from the bottom seven rows (STA 2, STA 3/4 and A-1 STA) of Table 4-4 are used to
compare alternatives. For the No Action Alternative, central flow-path runoff is distributed to
STA 2 and STA 3/4 consistent with existing conditions. At times, when conditions do not allow
for the STAs to treat all runoff water prior to discharge, diversion to the WCAs may occur
without treatment. A reduction in the diversion volumes in Table 4-4 means that less
untreated runoff is sent to the WCAs.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 all result in less STA diversion, although some STA diversion is still
expected to occur as there will continue to be some flows that will exceed the physical capacity
of the STA inflow structures or result in substantial damage to the STAs. Water diversions in the
dry season, referred to as urban water supplies, are not affected by any Alternative. Under the
No Action Alternative, the ‘Inflow and Diversion’ row in Table 4-4 is consistent with the Total
Source Basin Flow Volume from Table 4-1. The change from the ‘Inflow and Diversion’ row and
the ‘Outflow and Diversion’ row, from 834,000 to 831,000 (a 3,000 acre-feet per year or 0.3%
difference) can be attributed to seepage, evaporation and effects from the modeling analysis.
Change across the rows from the No Action Alternative to Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 will be due to
factors
such
as
runoff
reduction,
diversion/urban
water
supply,
and
rainfall/evapotranspiration/seepage.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 each result in different volume of water being diverted and different
evapotranspiration and seepage rates. The resultant decreases in inflow and outflow volumes
(to STA 2, STA 3/4, and the A-1 STA) summarized in Table 4-4 are due mainly to the following
two reasons: 1) the project site has external levees and act as an impoundment and surface
water runoff is not being exported as aggressively from the project site as compared to the No
Action Alterative since water levels within the project site are not being managed for

agricultural production; and 2) simulated water levels within an FEB or STA are substantially
greater than water levels under the No Action Alternative and will result in greater
evapotranspiration losses from the project site as compared to the No Action Alternative.
Therefore, the volume of water as shown in the outflows, diversions, and urban water supply
varies.

Compared to the No Action Alternative, average daily depths within STA 3/4 and STA 2 for each
Action Alternative are described below:
Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB):
As compared to the No Action Alternative, the Shallow FEB would increase inflows into STA 2 by
72,000 acre-feet per year and outflows by 84,000 acre-feet per year, while diversions are
decreased by 12,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4). Figures 4-33 and 4-34 provide ponding
depth hydrographs for STA 2 and STA 3/4, respectively, for Alternative 2. The Shallow FEB
would slightly decrease the peak stages and raise the low water stages in STA 2.
For STA 3/4, the Shallow FEB would decrease inflows 103,000 acre-feet per year and outflows
by 103,000 acre-feet per year, while diversions are decreased by 6,000 acre-feet per year (Table

of high water elevations are lowered.

For STA 3/4, the Deep FEB would decrease inflows by 97,000 acre-feet per year and outflows by
98,000 acre-feet per year, while decreasing diversions by 11,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4).
The Deep FEB would lower the peak water stages in STA 3/4 approximately one foot as the high

Alternative 4 (STA):
As compared to the No Action alternative, utilization of the A-1 STA would decrease inflows
into STA 2 by 48,000 acre-feet per year and outflows by 48,000 acre-feet per feet, while
diversions are decreased by 12,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4). Figure 4-37 and Figure 4-38
provide ponding depth hydrographs and ponding depth duration curve for STA 2 and STA 3/4,
respectively. The A-1 STA would decrease the peak stages in STA 2 and STA 3/4 as excess water
would be shared among the STAs (STA 2, STA 3/4, and the project site STA). However, the need
to maintain water levels in the A-1 STA would limit the ability to preferentially route water to
STA 2 to maintain water levels resulting is more frequent low water stages in STA 2.
For STA 3/4, utilization of the A-1 STA would decrease inflows 229,000 acre-feet per year and
outflows by 226,000 acre-feet per year (Table 4-4). Diversions would also be decreased 7,000
acre-feet per year for STA 3/4. For STA 3/4, the STA would lower the peak water stages, and
decrease the low water stages resulting in lower water tables during the dry seasons. The lower
water elevations during the dry season are due to the STA requiring water to maintain its
wetland vegetation. Figure 4-39 and Figure 4-40 provide ponding depth hydrographs and
ponding depth duration curve for STA 3/4 for Alternative 4.

The ability of DMSTA to accurately predict the duration and severity of STA dryout is limited.
Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the number of dryout events simulated to be
eliminated/created within STA 2 and STA 3/4 by the different alternatives. It can be conceived
that Alternatives 2 and 3 would result in less frequent dryout conditions in STA 2 and STA 3/4
since these alternatives send water in an advantageous manner to the existing STA. As for the
A-1 STA Alternative, dry-outs in the existing STAs could actually increase with Alternative 4 due
the operations of the proposed STA, which would need a portion of water currently sent to the
existing STAs to keep it hydrated during dry periods. Dryouts are considered deleterious to STA
performance because with rewetting there may be an undesirable release of phosphorus.

4.5.2.2.3

WCA 2A

WCA 2A inflows include treated flows from STA 2 and STA 3/4, STA 2 and STA 3/4 diversion
flows and urban water supply flows. The total outflows from STA 2 and STA 3/4 including
diversions and urban water supply is 858,000 acre-feet per year under the No Action
Alternative. Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 2A would receive
approximately 458,000 acre-feet per year of inflows via the L-6 Canal and the S-7 pump station
for the No Action Alternative. All of the action alternatives produced ponding and hydroperiods
very similar to the No Action Alternative, with only some minor variations (Table 4.5).

Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 result in 10,000; 14,000; and 13,000 acre-feet less water per year
entering into WCA 2A. This reduction is mainly due to operating a 15,000 acre FEB or STA as
compared to the No Action Alternative, which retains water without any discharge to the
surrounding area.

from STA 3/4 (109,000 acre-feet less per year). This change is seen in the downstream areas as
Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) delivers approximately 10,000 acre-feet per year less flow via the L6 Canal and S-7 pump station to WCA 2A, producing very slightly deeper ponding and slightly
longer hydroperiods in localized areas in northwest WCA 2A as compared to the No Action
Alternative. Alternative 2 results in approximately 600 acres of WCA 2A (0.6 percent)
experiencing hydroperiods 17 days per year longer than the No Action Alternative (Figure 4-43).

WCA 3A

WCA 3A inflows include treated flows from STA 3/4, STA 3/4 diversion flows and urban water
supply flows. WCA-3A receives water from Lake Okeechobee, WCA 2 and the EAA via the North
New River and Miami Canals with the majority of the inflows delivered from WCA 2A through
the S-11 spillways. Another large source of water entering into WCA 3A is from STA 3/4 and STA
5, which enter through the S-8 and G-404 pump stations, and the S-150 and G-357 culverts, all
of which are located at the northern boundary of WCA 3A.
Based on the results of the Glades LECSA RSM modeling, WCA 3A would receive approximately
401,000 acre-feet per year of inflows for the No Action Alternative, while Alternatives 2, 3, and
4 result in 25,000; 24,000; and 28,000 acre-feet per year less water than the No Action
Alternative (Table 4.6). This reduction is mainly due to operating a 15,000 acre FEB or STA as
compared to the No Action Alternative where the project site retains water without any
discharge to the surrounding area. Performance measure graphics were generated for several
gauge locations within WCA 3A and for the entire area.

downstream areas as Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) produces slightly shorter hydroperiods in an
area in WCA 3A adjacent to the northern reach of the Miami Canal in comparison to the No

hydroperiods 14 – 30 days per year shorter than the No Action Alternative (Figure 4-50).

Environmental Effects

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

No impacts to the surface water hydrology are anticipated to occur for the Action Alternatives
since the action alternatives would not increase or decrease surface water in the Holey Land.
As a result, no changes to Holey Land ponding depths are anticipated to occur.

No Action Alternative
Project Site

The two principal aquifers in and around the project site – the surficial aquifer system, and the
Floridan aquifer system – would not be affected by the No Action Alternative. Under the No
Action Alternative, the groundwater hydrology in and around the project site would remain as
it is today, as described in Chapter 3. The groundwater hydrology of the STAs, the WCAs, and
Holey Land would remain as it is currently.

4.5.3.2

Action Alternatives

The two principal aquifers in and around the project site – the surficial aquifer system, and the
Floridan aquifer system – would be minimally, if at all, affected by the Action Alternatives. The
Floridan aquifer system is divided into the Upper Floridan and Lower Floridan, by an
intermediate confining unit, which restricts communication between these two layers.
Therefore, the Lower Floridan would not be affected by any of the Action Alternatives.
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in the construction and operation of a Shallow FEB, Deep
FEB or STA that may inundate 15,000 acres with water depths ranging from approximately 1 to
12.5 feet. Under these conditions, water within the project site would be in direct contact with
the groundwater through the surface soils and may be lost to the surficial aquifer system.
However, due to the proposed seepage collection and return systems proposed for all of the
Action Alternatives, the contribution of seepage that would occur would have a minimal effect
on groundwater. Expected contributions to seepage from Alternative 2, 3 and 4 are expected to
be equivalent.
No impacts to the groundwater hydrology of the STAs, WCAs, or Holey Land are anticipated to
occur for the Action Alternatives as operational changes are not proposed and water levels
within the STAs would remain approximately the same as described in Chapter 3.

4.5.4 STA PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL
4.5.4.1

No Action Alternative

Under the No Action Alternative, STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to experience dry-outs.
Between Water Years 2002 and 2012, STA 2 (which became operational in WY2000)
experienced dryout conditions in at least five (5) water years, with approximate durations
ranging from 1 to 5 months. STA 3/4, which became operational in WY2004, experienced
dryout conditions one time since Water Year 2005, with a duration of less than one month. If
similar weather conditions occur, it is anticipated that similar frequency of dry outs would occur
in the future.

4.5.4.2

Action Alternatives

The primary objective of the Action Alternatives is to attenuate and temporarily store peak
stormwater flows to assist STA 2 and STA 3/4 with the achievement of the WQBEL. Minimizing
the potential for STA dryout is an additional benefit. The ability of DMSTA to accurately predict
the duration and severity of STA dryout is limited. One assumption in the DMSTA modeling and
STA operation is that the treatment cell is not allowed to dryout. Therefore, the DMSTA results
do not quantify the number of dryout events simulated to be eliminated. In general, as
additional STA acreage is added (as in Alternative 4), the potential risk of STA dryout, and
associated impacts to phosphorus removal performance within existing and new STAs,
increases, whereas, when additional storage is added (as in Alternative 2 and 3), the potential
for dryout within existing STAs decreases.
Additionally, the dryout within STA 3/4 that occurred in 2011 may not have been avoided with
the Action Alternatives in place due to the hydrologic conditions that occurred during early
2011. However, the damaging conditions that resulted from the rapid re-filling of STA 3/4
would have likely been prevented, as this is the type of event that an FEB (Alternatives 2 and 3)
is intended to address. The rapid re-filling of STA 3/4 resulted in peat pop-ups, rapid flux of
phosphorus into the water column and overwhelming stress on the vegetative communities
within the STA. With the FEB Alternatives (Alternative 2 and 3) in place, stormwater flows
would have been directed first to the FEB for storage and attenuation, and then distributed to
STA 3/4, ultimately providing short- and long-term performance benefit to the STA.
Florida’s Everglades total phosphorus criterion rule specifies a definition of impacted as being
where soil TP exceeds 500 milligrams TP per kilogram of soil; therefore, if the TP concentrations
in the soils are below 500 milligrams per kilograms, these soils would be considered
unimpacted. Lower phosphorus concentrations discharged from STA 2 and STA 3/4 would

reduce the rate of soil phosphorus accumulation in the WCA soils. Over time, reductions in soil
total phosphorus will help facilitate the restoration of impacted areas near the inflow points to
WCA 2A and WCA 3A, creating conditions more conducive to historic Everglades vegetation
communities.

4.6

WATER QUALITY

The water quality (phosphorus) modeling of EIS alternatives was conducted using DMSTA.
Average annual flow volumes and TP loads and TP concentrations summarized by source basin
are provided in Table 4-7. Water quality improvements (i.e. reductions in TP concentrations)
are anticipated to occur such that both STA 3/4 and STA 2 are projected to discharge at the
WQBEL with Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. These improvements in STA discharges would result in
improvements at WCA 2A and WCA 3A inflows which would subsequently lead to
improvements in water quality within WCA 2A and WCA 3A. Each STA is required to discharge
at the WQBEL, which is based on a long-term discharge of 13 ppb flow-weighted (Section
1.3.1.2), after all the corrective actions identified in the consent orders associated with the
NMDES and EFA permits have been completed in 2025. DMSTA projections of STA outflow
concentration, such as those in Table 4-8, are interpreted in this context. Modeling uncertainty
for DMSTA results is estimated at + or - 15% of the predicted long-term flow-weighted mean for
each STA (USEPA 2010, Attachment H), without accounting for uncertainty in the assumed
future flows and loads.

4.6.1 NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE
4.6.1.1

Project Site

Under the No Action Alternative, and if the area remains fallow, the water quality of the project
site would likely remain as it is today as described in Section 3.6. The project site would
continue to experience periods of dryout, which would lead to additional soil oxidation and
release of nutrients upon rewetting. If the lands are converted back to active agriculture, it is
expected that the stormwater runoff from the project site would likely contain relatively high
levels of nutrients (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen from particulate matter and fertilizers) as
with other agricultural lands in the EAA, though farming practices would follow best
management practices in place for the area.

4.6.1.2

STA 3/4 and STA 2

Under the No Action Alternative, STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to receive peak stormwater
flows and continue to experience dryout conditions that occur as a result of extreme hydrologic
conditions that exist in south Florida. High flows resulting from storm events would likely
continue to result in water depth durations that are longer and deeper than optimal, excessive
hydraulic loading rates and phosphorus loading rates to the STAs, or diversion of untreated
water around the STAs into the EPA. Extreme dry conditions would likely continue to result in
periods of dryout causing additional soil oxidation and nutrient release. As a result,
achievement of the WQBEL at discharges from both STAs would likely not occur. For the No
Action Alternative, the outflow TP concentration for STA 2 (including Compartment B) is
projected to be 13 ppb, based on the results of DMSTA modeling. This improvement, compared
to the information provided in Section 3.6.2 (STA 2 historic outflow of 22 ppb, Table 3-1), is
mainly due to the addition of 7,000 acres of treatment area (Compartment B) in 2012. The
DMSTA-simulated outflow TP concentration of STA 3/4 is 18 ppb for the No Action Alternative,
which is consistent with the information provided in Section 3.6.2. Under the No Action
Alternative, the WQBEL would not be met at STA 3/4. Table 4-8 provides DMSTA-simulated

Under the No Action Alternative, the water quality of WCA 2A would improve from the
conditions described in Chapter 3, due to the phosphorus reductions that would occur with the
additional 7,000 acres of treatment area at STA 2 (Compartment B). Compartment B
construction was completed in December 2011 and was flow capable in April 2012. Water
quality improvements at the STA 2 discharge may be seen as early as in Water Year (WY) 2012.

4.6.2 ACTION ALTERNATIVES
4.6.2.1

Project Site

Because the shallow FEB and the STA alternatives both operate by channeling water through
shallow marshes, these two alternatives would reduce both TP loads and concentrations on the
project site. The STA most efficiently removes the TP loads and concentrations as it would
contain managed cells with both emergent and submerged wetland vegetation cells. The
shallow FEB also provides benefits of phosphorus removal; however, its operation is not
designed to optimize phosphorus removal on the project site. Therefore, the ability to remove
phosphorus on the project site is limited for the Shallow FEB. The Deep FEB would not contain
submerged or emergent wetland plant species that remove phosphorus and therefore, would
not be expected to provide the reductions in phosphorus loads and concentrations that would
be provided by the Shallow FEB and STA alternatives. A summary of DMSTA-simulated project
site inflow and outflow volumes, inflow and outflow TP loads and inflow and outflow TP
concentrations for all alternatives is provided in Table 4-11.

annual values less than 12 ppb were replaced with a value of 12 ppb.
The project purpose is to meet the WQBEL in water at the STA 2 and STA 3/4 discharge points
as it enters into the EPA. If the WQBEL is met at both STAs, and the STAs are able to adequately
treat wet season flows, then future loading of excess phosphorus into the Everglades will be
prevented. The WQBEL applied at the STA discharge is based on 13 ppb long-term as a flow
weighted mean (which is equivalent to the 10 ppb long-term geometric mean criterion in the
EPA marsh). The DMSTA modeling presented is interpreted against the objective of meeting
the WQBEL: 13 ppb or below for STAs 2 and 3/4. With the addition of 7,000 acres of treatment
area at STA 2 as a result of Compartment B, as modeled all four alternatives would meet the
WQBEL at STA 2. However, the WQBEL is required to be met for both STA 2 and STA 3/4. All of
the three Action Alternatives are projected to meet the WQBEL for both STAs.

A summary of WCA 2A inflow volumes, inflow and outflow TP loads and inflow and outflow TP

concentration of WCA 2A inflows decreases by 3 ppb and the TP load in WCA 2A inflows
decreases by 1.4 metric tons per year (16 percent) when compared to the No Action
Alternative. For Alternative 3, the TP concentration of WCA 2A inflows decreases by 4 ppb and
the TP load of WCA 2A inflows decrease by 2.2 metric tons per year (26 percent) when
compared to the No Action Alternative. For Alternative 4, the TP concentration of WCA 2A

For all three Action Alternatives, the water quality of WCA 3A would improve as compared to

for the Action Alternatives.

VEGETATION

4.7.1 GENERAL VEGETATION
4.7.1.1

No Action Alternative

4.7.1.1.1

Project Site

The vegetation at the site would continue to be dominated by weedy and invasive species. The
187 acres of higher quality depressional wetlands that were present in 2005 are now in a
degraded condition with 90% nuisance and exotic species such as Elephant grass (Pennisetum
purpureum) and castor bean. A continued expansion of these nuisance species and degradation
of wetlands at the site would be expected if the site were to remain fallow. If agricultural
activities would resume, the existing vegetation on the site would be replaced with agricultural
plants (crop species such as sugar cane or sod farm).

4.7.1.1.2

STA 2 and STA 3/4

Under the No Action Alternative, the vegetative community types in STA 2 and STA 3/4, which
contains a mixture of EAV (Typha spp.) and SAV (Chara and Najas), would not change. Under
the No Action alternative, impacts to vegetation resulting from increased hydraulic and nutrient
loading rates and extended dry-out periods would occur as described in Section 3.7.2.

4.7.1.1.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

It is anticipated the No Action Alternative would allow the nuisance cattail vegetation to
continue to dominate and proliferate in the areas within the phosphorus enrichment gradients
downstream of inflow points as described in Chapter 3. In WCA 2A, cattail coverage increased
from 13,517 acres in 1991 to 23,010 acres in 1995 and to 29,178 acres in 2003 as determined
by aerial imagery interpretation. In WCA 3, cattail coverage increased from 49,102 acres in
1995 to 79,936 acres in 2004. The aerial extent of cattail expansion may continue to increase;
however with the recent expanded treatment area of STA 2, the rate of expansion in WCA 2A
may be reduced. This is indicated by a prior vegetation mapping effort in which the average

expansion was reduced from 2,375 acres per year during the first period to 771 acres per year
for the second. In the vegetation transects of WCA 2A, for the past few water years, cattail has
dominated the sites nearest the northern G-339 discharge point with a mixture of cattail and
sawgrass at 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) downstream to sawgrass dominant sites 1.2 miles (2
kilometers) downstream or greater.

4.7.1.1.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

No change to the vegetation in community structure in the Holey Land is expected under the
No Action Alternative.

4.7.1.2

Action Alternatives

4.7.1.2.1

Project Site

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Hydrologic conditions at the site with the Shallow FEB, coupled with vegetation management,
would favor the establishment of native marsh vegetation. The primary goal of vegetation
management is to establish and maintain healthy EAV dominated communities, a community of
plant species that have roots anchored to the bottom of the marsh and leaves that grow up
through the water and emerge above the surface. The vegetative community structure that is
anticipated within the A-1 Shallow FEB includes EAV with native plant species such as sawgrass
(Cladium jamaicense), Carolina willow (Salix caroliniana), bulrush (Scirpus californicus), pickerel
weed (Pontederia cordata), duck potato (Sagittaria lancifollia), muskgrass (Chara sp.), Illinois
pondweed (Potamogeton illinoensis), coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum), and cattail (Typha
spp.). The wetlands created would be protected from further development, managed to
eliminate undesirable vegetation, and would provide improved functionality in perpetuity for
the system. In addition, it is assumed in the DMSTA modeling that this EAV wetland vegetation
would provide a greater phosphorus removal benefit than a Deep FEB.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Due to the variable hydrology of the Deep FEB (approximately 1 foot to 12 feet) and anticipated
water depth above 4 feet for 30 percent of the time, it is not anticipated that this feature would
support stable vegetative communities. The Deep FEB would act more like a reservoir due to
the inability for a stable plant community to develop.
Alternative 4 (STA)

A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

4-73

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

Under the STA alternative the project site would support vegetation similar to what is found in
the existing STAs 2 and 3/4 with both EAV and SAV. The dominant SAV species include Chara,
which is commonly called muskgrass, and Najas, which is water-nymph. The dominant EAV is
cattail. Existing undesirable vegetation at the site would be replaced with vegetation similar to
what is found in existing STAs as per the SFWMD planting guidelines for STAs.

4.7.1.2.2

STA 2 and STA 3/4

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) and Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
With the Shallow and Deep FEB alternatives, the impacts to vegetation from heavy hydraulic
loading rates and extended dry-out periods would be reduced. The FEB would attenuate
stormwater runoff from the basins and deliver it in a more advantegous manner to STA 2 and
STA 3/4. This steadier flow would help optimize the performance of the existing STAs.
Alternative 4 (STA)
The STA alternative would lessen impacts from heavy hydraulic loading rates, although to a
lesser extent than either the proposed FEB alternatives. Extended dry-out periods with STAs 2
and 3/4 are anticipated to remain as described in Chapter 3 and the phosphorus removal
efficiency of these STAs reduced as a result.

4.7.1.2.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
The Shallow FEB showed reductions in phosphorus concentrations in inflows entering WCA 2A
and WCA 3A from the EAA. The expected result is a reduction in cattail proliferation and
expansion within the areas downstream of inflow point S-7 in WCA 2A, and inflow points from
the S-11 spillways and S-8 and G-404 pump structures in WCA 3A. Also, open water areas may
increase, providing habitat for the periphyton communities that are essential to the Everglades.
These reductions represent an incremental step towards achieving the overall EPA marsh
criterion of 10 ppb, which would help to restore the natural balance of native Everglades flora
and fauna.
Changes to vegetation from the slightly altered hydroperiods in isolated areas of WCA 2A and
WCA 3A are not anticipated. In WCA 2A, the RSM model predicted slightly greater hydroperiods
(17 days longer) in sparse areas in northwest WCA 2A. In WCA 3A the RSM model predicted
slightly shorter hydroperiods (14-30 days less) in already disturbed areas along a narrow stretch
north of the Miami Canal in WCA 3A. Despite this slight decrease in hydroperiod, there is no
difference in hydroperiod classes in this area between the no action and the shallow FEB.
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

4-74

July 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

Hydroperiod classes in the affected area range primarily from 240 to 300 days (8 to 10 months),
followed by a few cells at 180 to 240 days (6 to 8 months), and two shorter hydroperiod cells at
the very northeast portion of the affected area. An edge effect from the Miami Canal in this
area is apparent and the majority of this area is already heavily impacted by cattails with
shrubs.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Anticipated vegetative responses from reductions in phosphorus are equivalent to those
described for the Shallow FEB alternative above. The RSM model predicted very minor changes
in hydroperiod within WCA 3A and WCA 2A with the Deep FEB alternative. These slight
decreases in hydroperiod (14 to 30 days) are located in the very northeast of the Miami Canal,
an area that experiences an edge effect from the Miami Canal and the majority of which is
already heavily impacted by cattails with shrubs. The very localized hydroperiod increases (15
to 18 days longer) in WCA 2A are not considered significant enough to shift vegetation in the
area since this WCA is almost entirely already innundated for 300 or more days per year.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Anticipated vegetative responses from reductions in phosphorus are equivalent to those
described for the Shallow FEB alternative above. There were no RSM modeled changes to
hydroperiod or ponding depth with the STA alternative. There would however be a new
upstream water demand to keep the STA hydrated which is not considered in the modeling
effort or quantified.

4.7.1.2.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

No impacts to vegetation within Holey Land would occur with Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) and
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) since no changes to the vegetation community is proposed.
Alternative 4 (STA) would cause direct impacts to vegetation in Holey Land to construct a
conveyance discharge canal located within the Holey Land boundary adjacent to the project site
along the northern portion of the east border of Holey Land. Alternative 4 would impact
approximately 250 acres of wetlands withn Holey Land to construct the new discharge canal,
which would allow treated discharges from the A-1 STA to be conveyed to the L-5 Canal.
According to the 2005 Florida Natural Areas Inventory survey, this area is primarily a cattail
monoculture wetland (SFWMD 2012- 2012 SFER Volume III Appendix 5-4).

Project site

Under the No Action Alternative there would be no additional discharges to waters of the
United States, including wetlands; however, the wetlands would experience other effects. The
A-1 project site would either remain in its existing condition or be utilized for agricultural
purposes. If the site were to remain undisturbed, the vegetation at the site would continue to
be dominated by weedy and invasive species. The 187 acres of true depressional wetlands that
were present in 2005 are now in a degraded condition with 90% nuisance and exotic species
such as Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and castor bean. A continued expansion of
these undesirable species and degradation of wetlands at the site would be expected. If the
agricultural activities would resume on the project site, the wetlands would be cleared of
vegetation, and pumping would drain the water off of the lands. The existing wetland
vegetation would be replaced with agricultural plants, such as sugar cane or sod.

4.7.2.1.2

STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A, Holey Land

STA 2 and STA 3/4 would continue to be managed for either EAV or SAV and open water areas.
Therefore, there no changes anticipated in the wetland vegetation within the STAs. Although
the existing STAs provide phosphorus treatment to the WCAs, there would be a continued
degradation to downstream wetlands and dense cattail areas expansion with the no action
alternative due to the WQBEL not being met. Cattail is considered a high nutrient status species
that is opportunistic and highly competitive, relative to sawgrass, in nutrient-enriched
situations (Toth, 1988; Davis, 1991). This is demonstrated by Figure 3-15 in Section 3.7.3, which
shows that cattail coverage increased 38% within WCA 3 from 1995 to 2004. Similar effects are
anticipated for WCA 2. Several studies conducted within WCA 2A show that cattail outcompete sawgrass in their ability to absorb excess nutrients with increased cattail production
during years of high nutrient inflows (Toth, 1988; Davis, 1991). Davis (1991) concluded that
both sawgrass and cattail increased annual production in response to elevated nutrient
concentrations, but that cattail differed in its ability to increase plant production during years of
high nutrient supply. Therefore, continued input of phosphorus into the WCAs above the
WQBEL is anticipated to continue to degrade wetland vegetation and increase cattail
expansion.

Project site

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Construction of the Shallow FEB would fill and excavate 435.9 acres of wetlands and surface
waters. Of the 435.9 acres of impacts, 280.1 acres of wetlands would be filled to construct the
levee, 112.8 acres of waters of the U.S. would be filled to raise the elevation of canals and
ditches to the adjacent wetland elevation, and 75.8 acres of canal would be excavated. The
Shallow FEB would be operated at an average depth of 1.5 feet and the maximum depth is 4
feet. Emergent aquatic wetland vegetation is expected to be maintained or grow within the
Shallow FEB. Therefore, approximately 10, 820.3 acres of wetlands will be inundated with
water up, with maximum levels of four feet in depth after a severe storm event such as a
hurricane or tropical storm.
The construction features causing permanent wetland impacts include interior and exterior
perimeter levees, a collection canal and inflow and out flow structures. Wetland conditions
would occur within the Shallow FEB after construction is complete and operation of the FEB
begins.
Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
Construction of a Deep FEB would result in 576.6 acres of unavoidable adverse impacts to
wetlands and waters of the U.S. as a result of levee and canal fill, canal excavation, and
excavation of freshwater wetlands. Of the 576.6 acres of impacts, 533.6 acres of wetlands
would be filled to construct the levee and 43.0 acres of canal would be excavated. Alternative 3
would not require fill in canals or ditches. The Deep FEB would be operated at an average
depth of six feet and the maximum depth is 12 feet. During times of deeper water depths, no
rooted wetland vegetation is expected to be maintained or grow within the Deep FEB. During
times when the inundation would be greater than four feet during parts of the year, emergent
marsh habitat at the site would have a less optimal hydrology during those times when the
water levels are greater than four feet. The remainder of time when water levels are below
four feet, it is anticipated that either submerged aquatic or emergent marsh vegetation would
be present. There would be about 10,820 acres of wetlands that would be flooded as a result
of this alternative.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Construction of an STA would result in impacts to 986.4 acres of wetlands and waters of the
United States to include 353.6 acres of fill to construct the levee, 112.8 acres of fill to raise the

elevation of canals and ditches, 270 acres of canal excavation, and 250 acres of excavation and
fill within Holey Land Wildlife Management Area. Wetland impacts within the Holey Land
Wildlife Management Area are required to construct a new discharge canal to allow treated
discharges from the A-1 STA to be conveyed to the L-5 Canal. Therefore, 125 acres of wetlands
would be excavated to create the canal and 125 acres of wetlands would be filled to create the
berms on either side of the canal. The STA would be operated at an average depth of 1.25 to
1.5 feet and the maximum depth is 4 feet. The impacts would be due to construction of interior
and exterior levees, interior cell/flowway earthwork to bring areas to appropriate elevations
and construction of internal and external water control structures. Emergent and submerged
aquatic vegetation is expected to be maintained or grow within the STA. Similar to the shallow
FEB, approximately 10,820 acres of wetlands will be inundated with water up to four feet.

4.7.2.2.2

STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A, Holey Land

There are no impacts to downstream wetlands with any of the action alternatives. Improved

Project site

Under the No Action Alternative, no significant change would likely result to fish and wildlife
populations on the project site if the site were to remain fallow. The project site would
continue to provide habitat to wildlife utilizing the property. However, it is anticipated that
exotic plant species would continue to encroach on the site. The increase in exotic plant
species may reduce the wildlife utilization in the future as the dominance of exotic plant species
as elephant grass and castor bean lowers the function and value of the wetlands. If the site
were to return to agricultural use, the fish and wildlife populations on the site are expected to
be reduced as the agricultural activities may disturb nesting and foraging.

Currently, the STAs provide high quality habitat for fish and wildlife species as described in

Colonial wading birds utilize the WCAs as both feeding and breeding habitat. The most
common species utilizing the WCAs include the white ibis, great egrets, snowy egrets, cattle
egrets, great blue herons, tricolored herons, little blue herons, green herons, black-crowned
night herons, yellow-crowned night herons, wood storks, and glossy ibis, with populations
varying widely in relationship to seasonal water level fluctuations. Current trends in water
quality within the WCAs impact fish and other aquatic wildlife populations directly and
indirectly by altering the vegetation, which affects foraging habitat of wetland dependent
species. As nutrient loadings to surface water within the WCAs decrease, water quality should
continue to improve. Under the No Action Alternative it is expected that STA discharges would
not meet the WQBEL and water quality and the aquatic habitat within the WCAs would
continue to decline.

4.8.1.1.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Similar to WCAs, Holey Land provides aquatic habitat to a wide variety of fish and wildlife
species. Under the No Action Alternative, the wildlife species use is not expected to change in
the Holey Land.

4.8.1.2
4.8.1.2.1

Action Alternatives
Project Site

Construction of a Shallow FEB and an STA would improve the fish and wildlife usage on the
project site. The site conditions would change from low quality wetlands with several areas
containing a dominance of exotic plant species to a wetland containing native plant species and
depths of water up to four feet. Exotic plant species would be removed and the site
maintained in perpetuity. Existing STAs are evidence that water depth up to four feet in the
impoundment provides abundant habitat for a diverse array of wildlife species.
Although the Deep FEB would provide more aquatic habitat than the existing site conditions,
the Deep FEB would provide less functional aquatic habitat than the Shallow FEB or STA. Many
of the wading birds require shallow water depths to capture prey fish that utilize emergent
vegetation. The deeper water depths of the Deep FEB would preclude emergent vegetation
from establishing and foraging habitat for the shallow water dependent species, which include
several State-listed birds, such as the Florida sandhill crane, limpkin, snowy egret, little blue
heron, tricolored heron, white ibis, and roseate spoonbill.

STA 2 and STA 3/4

The Shallow and Seep FEB alternatives would improve fish and wildlife habitat as the FEBs
would operate in a manner as to avoid dryout in the STAs. The STAs would maintain a more
steady state of water depths as the FEBs would provide water when the STAs require. In
addition, there would be less impact to nesting birds in the STAs with the two FEB alternatives.
As described in Section 3.8.3.1, the STAs contain habitat for several State-listed birds, such as
the Florida sandhill crane, limpkin, snowy egret, little blue heron, tricolored heron, white ibis,
and roseate spoonbill. In addition, the Florida burrowing owl, the least tern, and black necked
stilts are known to nest within or near the STAs. Per email from Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) on April 23, 2013, the reddish egret is not expected to utilize
the STAs. Currently, if the STAs dry out, these birds could nest in the dry lands. As the areas
are re-flooded, there is the potential for the sudden increases in water depths to flood the
nesting birds. The FEB alternatives would assist the STA and avoid dryouts.
There would be no change to wildlife usage in STA 2 and STA 3/4 if the STA Alternative were
constructed.

4.8.1.2.3

WCA 2A and WCA 3A

Overall wildlife habitat benefits are expected to occur in WCA 2A and WCA 3A with the
construction of the Action Alternatives. Specifically, improved water quality within STA 2 and
STA 3/4 would decrease the phosphorus loading entering into the WCAs, which would help to
restore the vegetation communities within the WCAs over the long-term. Currently, annual
average flow-weighted TP concentrations in WCA 2A and WCA 3A for water year 2011 are 18
and 20 ppb, respectively (SFWMD, 2011, Chapter 3A.). As seen in WCA 2A, increased TP loads
entering the WCA have contributed to dense monotypic stands of cattail vegetation at the
areas where water enters the WCA. The monotypic and dense growth patterns of invasive
vegetation support less diverse fish and wildlife than native vegetation. Less dense vegetation
can establish more ideal foraging habitat for many predatory bird and fish species by providing
greater access to prey. This in turn can make WCAs more ideal nesting locations. Therefore, a
reduction in TP entering the WCAs would likely improve foraging and nesting habitat for fish
and wildlife species.

4.8.1.2.4

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

The construction of the Shallow FEB or the Deep FEB is not expected to affect wildlife usage in
the Holey Land since the FEB Alternatives would have no effect on the water entering the Holey
Land. With the STA Alternative, a conveyance discharge canal would be constructed within the

Northern portion of the eastern boundary of the Holey Land. The area is currently cattail, but
would be converted to a canal. Therefore, the construction of the STA would convert a portion
of cattail wetlands to a canal with floating aquatic vegetation, which would impact the species
currently utilizing the cattail marsh.

4.8.2 FEDERALLY LISTED THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES
The following sections document potential impacts to federally-listed threatened and
endangered species, species of special concern (SSC), and designated critical habitat that could
occur from the No Action Alternative and Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The impact analysis
includes listed species that have the potential to occur within the project footprint, the STAs
directly affected by the proposed project (STA 2 and STA 3/4), and the downstream secondary
project-affected regions (WCA 2A and WCA 3A).
Direct impacts are defined as impacts that occur within the footprints of the proposed project
site during or as a direct result of construction and operation activities. Indirect impacts are
defined as impacts that occur outside of the footprints of the proposed project but are still
within the affected regions, or that occur within the footprints of the downstream STAs and
WCAs. Due to the potential for adverse impacts to fish and wildlife, in particular threatened or
endangered species and their habitat, the operational and monitoring plans for the proposed
project are of particular importance to USFWS.
The Action Alternatives provide the opportunity for minor to major changes in the
hydropatterns of the WCAs dependent upon the ability to provide improved treatment capacity
of STA 2 and STA 3/4. With the No Action Alternative, a regional trend towards improvements
in water quality, quantity, and timing may occur from planned restoration projects in the
Everglades. Overall, this is anticipated to improve habitat within the project primary and
secondary affected regions as defined in Chapter 3. The Proposed Action (Alternative 2, Shallow
FEB) is expected to further increase these improvements. The extent of the enhancements with
the No Action and Action Alternatives would depend on the manner in, and extent to which,
the treatment capacity provided by existing and anticipated features is used in the context of
other regional water management infrastructure and system operations made possible by the
presence of any additional treatment or storage capacity.
The Proposed Action is not intended to propose, direct, or otherwise mandate specific changes
in Central and Southern Florida (C&SF) System project operations identified in existing
operations manuals (i.e., Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule or WCA Regulation Schedule),
as determined in the future for restoration-related purposes. The effects on listed species

discussed below are based on wildlife surveys, field observations, literature, reasonable
scientific judgment, SFWMM, DMSTA, and SSDM results.
The USACE is currently preparing a separate biological assessment (BA) in accordance with
Section 7(c) of the Endangered Species Act comparing the construction and operation of the A1 Shallow FEB as described in the applicant’s preferred alternative (Alternative 2) to the existing
conditions in the affected regions. This BA also provides the USACE’s final effects determination
for listed species and critical habitat, and will be included as an Appendix in the final EIS. The BA
evaluated the effects by comparing the Applicant’s Preferred Alternative (Alternative 2) to the
No Action Alternative (Alternative 1).

4.8.2.1

American alligator

The American alligator is found within freshwater and brackish aquatic habitats in south
Florida. American alligators were not observed on the A-1 project site during the field visits to
the site, but are commonly found in and on canal banks within the EAA. Although the American
alligator is not actually threatened or endangered it is listed due to the similarity in appearance
to the threatened American crocodile. No consultation is required for the alligator.

4.8.2.2

Eastern indigo snake

Upland and dry habitats (flatwoods, dry prairies, tropical hardwood hammocks, and coastal
dunes) are the preferred habitats of eastern indigo snakes (USFWS 1999). While drier, upland
habitat is limited in the project-affected regions, these species may also forage along the edges
of freshwater marshes and in agricultural fields and along their banks within the EAA. This
species also utilizes gopher tortoise burrows, so potential gopher tortoise habitat was
considered in determining potential effects of the Action Alternatives on the eastern indigo
snake. In addition to gopher tortoise burrows, the eastern indigo snakes use natural and manmade holes and burrows for refugia. Eastern indigo snakes were found on the project site
during construction activities for the A-1 Reservoir.

4.8.2.2.1

No Action

No direct impact on the eastern indigo snake is expected with the No Action Alternative. The
site would either remain undisturbed or agricultural activities could resume. If agricultural
activities continue on the site, approximately 10,820.3 acres of wetlands within the A-1 project
site would remain undisturbed or be utilized for agriculture. The Eastern indigo snakes use
agricultural fields as habitat and depending on the particular type of agricultural use, these

Environmental Effects

areas may provide habitat that support a higher density of snakes found in natural upland
habitat.
Indirect impacts could be attributed to soil subsidence. Wetter conditions are expected in the
EAA by 2050 because of soil subsistence. Subsidence could therefore cause conditions in the
EAA to be less favorable for the eastern indigo snake, which prefers drier, upland habitats.
However, eastern indigo snakes may still utilize these areas as habitat.

4.8.2.2.2

Action Alternatives

Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 are anticipated to have a direct impact on the eastern indigo
snake. Construction of the Action Alternatives would result in the conversion of 10,820.3 acres
of wetlands to an above ground impoundment containing either 4 feet of water or 12 feet of
water. Disturbed wetlands may be used by eastern indigo snakes, but are not preferred
habitat. The eastern indigo snakes may forage along the edges of the FEBs or the STA during
drier periods, but conditions within the impoundments would generally not be suitable because
these areas would be permanently inundated.
Construction activities may also result in eastern indigo snakes leaving the area, abandoning
den sites, and possibly losing foraging and mating opportunities. In addition, construction
activities associated with the earth-moving equipment may increase the likelihood of Eastern
indigo snakes being adversely impacted. Heavy machinery, which would be re-contouring
ground levels, removing and relocating berms, and constructing roads, may unearth eastern
indigo snakes and cause inadvertent impacts to occur. The applicant would require the
construction workers to be aware of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat, and be informed
how to identify the snake if found. The eastern Indigo Snake Construction Precautions would be
required to be adhered during all construction activities.
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives to the eastern indigo snake could occur with all
Action Alternatives from increased traffic and post construction activities. Increased traffic
could increase the likelihood of direct mortality along roads in the area. The post-construction
activities associated with the proposed FEBs and the STA that may cause impacts to the eastern
indigo snake include maintenance of the roads, levees, pump stations, and cells (including
vegetation management methods such as mowing, herbicide application, and physical
removal). In addition, indirect impacts may occur to the eastern indigo snake due to the
potential inundation of snake habitat during rehydration of the cells in the event the cells
become dry after initial flooding. Protective measures alerting the contractor of the potential
presence of this species and its protected status would also be used during the construction to
avoid direct takes of the species. Indirect effects from changing the water elevations in

downstream areas (STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, and WCA 3A) are not anticipated to cause an
unacceptable adverse effect to the eastern indigo snake as.

4.8.2.3

Audubon’s crested caracara

The Audubon’s crested caracara nests primarily in cabbage palm trees and forages in vegetated
areas less than one-foot in height. The USFWS Standard Local Operating Procedures for
Endangered Species (SLOPES) defines the primary protection zone for this species as 985 feet
outward from a nesting tree. The secondary zone is 6,600 feet outward from an active nesting
tree. The project site is located within a USFWS consultation area for the crested caracara;
however, no juvenile gathering areas are located within these areas. During field surveys, no
Audubon’s crested caracaras were observed on the project site. In addition, there are no
cabbage palm trees located on the project site.

4.8.2.3.1

No Action

No direct or indirect impacts to caracara are anticipated under the No Action Alternative.
Caracaras prefer dry and wet prairies with scattered cabbage palms but have adapted well to
improved pasture (USFWS 2004). Although the existing vegetative communities within the
project site may provide some foraging habitat for caracara, it is primarily fallow cropland with
taller, woody vegetation that is not preferred for foraging as the current vegetative coverage is
greater than 1 foot in height. The vegetative communities would remain as is (no effect) or
would return to active agriculture (moderately improved foraging habitat).

4.8.2.3.2

Action Alternatives

No direct impacts to caracara are anticipated with construction of Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The
exotic vegetation in the wetlands is above 1 foot high and thereby does not provide suitable
foraging habitat. The Audubon’s crested caracara generally does not forage in vegetation
greater than 1 foot in height.
The project site is located within a USFWS consultation area for the crested caracara but
outside known juvenile gathering areas. The Species Conservation Guidelines for Crested
Caracara (USFWS 2004) state that no effect from the project is anticipated on the caracara if
on-site surveys of suitable habitat within the consultation area do not detect caracara nests.
The site does not contain palm trees; therefore, the site is not expected to provide suitable
nesting activity. No known nest sites are located within 6,600 feet of the project site.

A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

4-84

July 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives to the caracara include an increase in traffic
volume and changes to downstream habitats. Caracaras frequently prey on wildlife struck by
vehicles. An increase in traffic would likely increase road kills, thereby increasing the risk of
caracaras being struck by vehicles while preying on dead animal carcasses. However, the
increase in traffic is expected to be minimal.
There would be no effects to the Audubon’s crested caracara within the STA 2 and STA 3/4 as
the STAs so not provide suitable foraging habitat. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would improve water
quality in WCA 2A and WCA-3A by reducing phosphorus loads and concentrations, thereby
maintaining the existing crested caracara foraging habitat by decreasing the rate of cattail
expansion and that of other invasive plants. The indirect effect on the caracara would be that
native wet prairie vegetation used for foraging would remain for a greater period of time.
The increases in water levels within WCA 2A and WCA 3A are minor. For alternative 2, WCA 2A
would experience hydroperiod to extend 17 days longer per year than the No Action
Alternative, 15-18 day longer for Alternative 3, and no change in Alternative 4. For WCA 3A, the
hydroperiod would be 14-30 days shorter per year for Alternatives 2 and 3, and no change to
the hydroperiod for Alternative 4. Therefore, access to prey availability would not change in
the WCAs.
No changes in the Holey Lands are expected to occur as a result of Alternatives 2 and 3;
therefore, they would have no effect on the Audubon’s crested caracara. Construction of
Alternative 4 (STA) would convert cattail wetland to a canal. Since the wetlands are not foraging
habitat, the construction of the STA would also have no effect on the caracara.

4.8.2.4

Everglade snail kite

The project site, STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA-2A, WCA-3A, and the Holey Land are all within USFWS
consultation area for the Everglade snail kite. In addition, WCA- 2A and WCA 3A are located
within designated critical habitat for the Everglade snail kite. Everglade snail kite nesting or
foraging was not observed on the project site.
In Florida, Everglade snail kites forage almost exclusively on apple snails that are found in
freshwater marshes and shallow vegetated littoral zones of lakes. Therefore, this evaluation
focuses on both potential impacts to the snail kite itself and the apple snail, its most important
prey item.

4.8.2.4.1

Environmental Effects

No Action

No direct impacts to snail kites, apple snails, or designated snail kite critical habitat would be
expected with the No Action Alternative. Marsh and scrub wetlands on the project site may be
converted back to agricultural lands. Although apple snail populations may occur within
remnant natural wetlands, ditches, and canals, no apple snail egg casings were observed in the
surveys on the project site, which indicates it is unlikely that Everglade snail kite currently use
this area for foraging.

4.8.2.4.2

Action Alternatives

The potential for direct impacts to snail kites exists from construction of Alternatives 2, 3, and
4. With these alternatives, approximately 10,820.3 acres of freshwater wetlands and waters of
the United States would be converted to aquatic habitats containing a variety of EAV, SAV,
and/or FAV plant species. Relatively clear and open marshes and littoral zones with low-profile
marshes (10 feet or less in depth) are ideal foraging habitat for the Everglade snail kite (USFWS
1999). Therefore, the construction of the deep FEB would offer the least benefits to the snail
kite. The wetland systems that would be created as a result of the shallow FEB and the STA
would provide better habitat for apple snails and the Everglades snail kite. During normal
operations, the SAV and EAV cells would be operated at target depths of less than 4 feet of
water, which is suitable foraging habitat for the snail kite.
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives would likely vary by alternative and include
increased traffic levels as well as changes in hydrology and vegetation in affected regions,
primarily the WCAs. The three main parameters considered in the evaluation of potential
indirect impacts with the Action Alternatives are traffic, the cycle and duration of dry-down
events, and changes in vegetation, each of which are described below.
Traffic: Increased traffic could result in a higher risk of direct mortality. Even though snail kites
do not typically forage along roadways, they have been often observed foraging along levees in
stormwater treatment areas. Slower traffic would not be expected to cause an unacceptable
adverse effect since snail kites can easily avoid slower moving vehicles. Snail kites have been
known to nest near levee roads. These nests are typically easy to identify and traffic restriction
can be applied to limit nest disturbance.
Dry Down Events: Apple snails need EAV to thrive. Both apple snail and snail kite population
success are directly affected by depth and duration of marsh flooding (Johnson et al. 2007). The
following are the hydrologic parameters/criteria that were considered in evaluating potential
impacts to snail kites and apple snails:
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

4-86

July 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

• Dry-down periods with a 1- to 2-month period were considered optimal for apple snails, while
greater than a 2-month dry-down was considered unfavorable;
• A dry-down period between March and April was considered unfavorable as this time period
was documented by Darby (1997, 2003) to be a peak in apple snail egg cluster production;
• Dry-down events occurring in a 3- to 5-year cycle were considered optimum snail kite habitat;
and
• Dry-down events occurring in a 2- to 3-year cycle (slightly drier than optimum) or occurring in
a 5- to 6-year cycle (slightly wetter than optimum) were considered marginal snail kite habitat.
Alternatives 2 (Shallow FEB) and Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) are designed to minimize the drydown events in the STAs (STA 2 and STA 3/4) so the FEBs would improve conditions for the
Everglades snail kites utilizing the STAs. Alternative 3 (STA) offers the least amount of benefits
within STA 2 and STA 3/4 since the intent of the proposed STA would not operate to prevent
dry-downs events.
Changes in the water levels within WCA 2A and WCA 3A are minor. As compared to the No
Action Alternative, the hydroperiod within WCA 2A would experience wet conditions 17 days
longer per year with Alternative 2, 15-18 day longer for Alternative 3, and no change in
Alternative 4. Alternatives 2 and 3 would benefit the Everglades snail kite, while Alternative 4
would not cause any additional impacts. For WCA 3A, the hydroperiod would be 14-30 days
shorter per year for Alternatives 2 and 3, and no change to the hydroperiod for Alternative 4.
Therefore, Alternatives 2 and 3 (the FEB alternatives) would reduce the available foraging areas
slightly while Alternative 4 would have no change.
Vegetation: Because the Action Alternatives would decreases phosphorus loads and
concentrations within the WCAs, all of the alternatives would not contribute to the cattail
expansion within the WCAs. By meeting the water quality criteria for phosphorus in the EPA,
improvements to the Everglades snail kite foraging habitat are anticipated. Everglade snail
kites forage by either still-hunting from a perch or by flying above the water surface and visually
locating prey. Relatively clear and open marshes and littoral zones with low profile marshes (3
meters or less in depth) and shallow open water are ideal foraging habitat for the Everglade
snail kite (USFWS 1999). Increased levels of phosphorus in Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades
have resulted in dense stands of emergent invasive vegetation that has replaced the foraging
habitat for the Everglade snail kite. A decrease in cattail coverage is considered beneficial to
the Everglade snail kite and its designated critical habitat.

Environmental Effects

Wood Stork

Wood stork foraging and nesting habitat occurs on the project site, STAs 2 and 3/4, and WCAs
2A and 3A. Wood storks were observed on the project site.

4.8.2.5.1

No Action

Direct impacts from the No Action Alternative include decreasing the amount of preferred
aquatic foraging habitat for wood storks from the conversion of 10,820.3 acres of freshwater
wetlands to active agriculture. Atypical sod and sugar cane fields would still provide foraging
habitat, but would be of a lower quality than the freshwater marsh and wetland scrub habitat
that exists there currently.
Indirect impacts are not anticipated under the No Action Alternative. STA 2 and 3/4 are
intended to be operated under their current operational plans and discharges into WCA 2A and
WCA 3A would continue.

4.8.2.5.2

Action Alternatives

Anticipated direct impacts from construction of the Shallow FEB and STA would likely increase
the preferred aquatic foraging habitat available to the wood stork from the conversion of
10,820.3 acres of low quality wetlands to flooded cells with EAV and SAV, which may include
areas over open water and appropriate water depths for foraging. This conversion would result
in beneficial effects for wood storks by replacing lower-quality foraging habitat with higher
quality shallow, inundated wetlands. Existing agricultural canals and ponds within the project
site would be filled to create wetland habitat, but deeper canals (conveyance and collector
canals) would continue to be in use and available to the wood stork. The construction of the
Deep FEB would not provide wood stork foraging habitat as the water depths are too deep to
support foraging (over 18-inches of water depths).
Indirect impacts from the Action Alternatives would likely occur and would include impacts
associated with changes to hydrology and vegetation in affected regions from altered
hydroperiods and phosphorus levels. Overall regional improvements to foraging and nesting
habitat, as a result of improved vegetative communities and fish and wildlife habitat are
anticipated. However, effects within the STAs may vary for the Action Alternatives.
The FEB alternatives (Alternatives 2 and 3) would reduce the frequency of dry-downs within
STA2 and STA 3/4. Therefore, the FEBs would improve wood stork foraging habitat within the
STAs. Alternative 4 (STA) would not operate to reduce the potential for dry-downs within the

Environmental Effects

existing STAs; therefore, Alternative 4 would have no effect on the wood stork foraging habitat
within STAs 2 and 3/4.
An overall anticipated regional trend toward restored water quality is expected to improve
vegetative communities, water quality, and fish and wildlife habitat in WCA 2A and WCA 3A. It
is anticipated that this improvement would likewise enhance wood stork foraging habitat and
access to prey items in these areas. Wood storks typically forage in water depths 18 inches or
shallower. The Action Alternatives would not change the average high and low water levels
during the wet or dry seasons to be either deeper or shallower than 18 inches compared to
existing conditions.

4.8.2.6

Florida panther

Panther telemetry data from 1981 to 2005 show panthers in the EAA, including areas directly
adjacent to the project site and in WCA 3A (USFWS 2006). Figure 3-14 describes Panther
telemetry data from 1997 through 2006 (URS 2007c) while Figure 3-15 indicates recent
occurrences in the area (FWS database). Panthers may hunt on the project site, but it is
unlikely that they would use these areas for any extended length of time because of the lack of
suitable long-term panther habitat (URS 2007). Panthers were not observed on the project site
during the field surveys.

4.8.2.6.1

No Action

No anticipated direct impacts in the form of mortality, injury, or loss of habitat to the Florida
panther would occur with active agriculture resuming on the project site because the project
site is not considered preferred habitat for the Florida panther. Although panthers may traverse
through the project site, they are not expected to use these areas for an extended period
because of a lack of suitable, long-term habitat. Conversion of wetlands to active agriculture
would reduce suitable habitat for feral hogs and white-tailed deer, two prey items for the
panther. Although this habitat is not ideal for panther foraging, this conversion would decrease
the hunting ability of the panther within the A-1 project site and would result in an indirect
effect through decreased prey availability.

4.8.2.6.2

Action Alternatives

Direct impacts to panthers from the construction of Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would likely occur
from conversion of 10,820.3 acres of freshwater wetlands to deeper water wetland areas with
EAV and SAV, thereby reducing potential ranging, resting, and foraging habitat on the A-1
project site. In addition to becoming permanently inundated, the build-out areas would not be
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

4-89

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

as accessible to the Florida panther because of the network of canals and ditches, leading
panthers to travel longer distances to cross these portions of the EAA. Nevertheless, panthers
would still be able to traverse through these lands or use them for resting after they are
converted to the Shallow FEB or STA, but would not be able to utilize the land if they are
converted to the Deep FEB. All Action Alternatives would reduce potential habitat for feral hogs
and white-tailed deer in on the project site, two prey items for the panther. Although this
habitat is not ideal for panther foraging, the conversion could decrease the hunting ability of
the panther, resulting in an indirect impact similar to the No Action Alternative. In addition,
construction of the build-out areas would contribute to the cumulative effect of other
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) and large-scale environmental restoration
projects, causing panthers to travel longer distances through portions of the EAA.
Indirect impacts on panthers include increased traffic levels, increased noise disturbance and
reduction in value of panther habitat adjacent to the project due to habitat fragmentation. In
past years, several road kills have occurred on CR 835/833 as a result of vehicles entering in and
off the project boundaries. However, the project construction would result in increased traffic
consisting of heavy equipment and employee vehicles. All vehicles would be required to obey
posted speed limits for off road and for improved road travel. Impacts associated with
construction traffic would be localized due to construction occurring in phases such that
panthers can avoid the areas that are under construction. Additionally, all entrances would be
secured with gates to control access. Noise levels would also be localized as the different
phases are under construction.
With Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, slight changes to the hydrological conditions in WCA 2A and WCA
3A are anticipated, but these changes are not anticipated to impact the Florida panther. The
project site is not located within the primary or secondary zone of the Florida panther, but is
located within the consultation areas. Indirect impacts are also not anticipated in the Holey
Lands.

4.8.3 STATE LISTED THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES
4.8.3.1

No Action Alternative

The current site conditions do not support habitat for the Gopher tortoise (Gopherus
polyphemus), Florida gopher frog (Rana areolata aseopus) or the Florida mouse (Podomys
floridanus) as these species prefer a dry, xeric upland habitats. The agricultural fields may
currently provide nesting and foraging habitat for the Florida burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia
floridana) as they nest in agricultural areas. There would be no change to any state listed
threatened or endangered species on the project site under the No Action Alternative.

Environmental Effects

Action Alternatives

The Shallow FEB and STA alternative would improve foraging and nesting habitat for the state
listed wading birds. When water levels are greater than 4-feet in depth, the Deep FEB would
not provide foraging or nesting habitat as water levels are too deep for even long-legged
species of birds. All of the Action Alternatives would provide foraging habitat for the black
skimmer (Rynchops niger); however the Shallow FEB and the STA alternatives may also provide
areas of nesting. The levees in all of the Action Alternatives would provide nesting habitat for
the burrowing owl as they nest in the ground in areas with little understory vegetation.
Additionally, the levees would provide ground nesting habitat for least tern colonies. Each of
the Action Alternatives would not provide habitat for the Gopher tortoise, gopher frog, and the
Florida mouse, as site conditions would be too wet. Prior to and during construction activities,
the SFWMD will conduct wildlife surveys to include both federal and state-listed species to
document the wildlife utilizing the site. The SFWMD will notify the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission if any burrowing owls are detected during construction activities.

4.8.4 MIGRATORY BIRDS
Migratory birds are expected to utilize the A-1 project site, in particular black-necked stilts
(Himantopus mexicanus), least terns, killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and burrowing owls . An
Avian Protection Plan (APP) is a voluntary set of guidelines to reduce impacts to nesting
migratory birds as a result of flooding. In the event that conditions become favorable for
nesting, the Avian Protection Plan for Black-necked Stilts and Burrowing Owls Nesting in the
Everglades Agricultural Area Stormwater Treatment Areas will be implemented for Alternative
4 (STA) (SFWMD 2008). For the STA alternative, an APP plan is appropriate as they are less
dense and potentially open water areas within the SAV cells. These typical STA conditions are
more conducive to ground nesters. This will not be the case for the shallow FEB alternative
which is anticipated to remain more densely vegetated once the project is complete. Due to
the uncertainty of whether ground nesters currently or in the future will utilize the A-1 project
site for nesting, the SFWMD does not recommend implementing an APP at this time for the FEB
Alternatives, as this will significantly impact operational intent and flexibility of the facility.
The SFWMD is proposing to conduct its standard Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird
Treaty Act training prior to construction and monitor for black-neck stilts, burrowing owls and
other ground nesting birds during construction and the two-year period in which the facility will
be undergoing operational testing and monitoring. During the two-year period when the
facility is in operational testing, surveys will be conducted regularly to confirm presence or

CULTURAL, HISTORIC AND ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Historic properties may be determined to be eligible to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) if it meets at least one of the four following criteria:
A) That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
B) That are associated with the lives of a person significant in our past; or
C) That embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represents the work of a master, or that posses high artistic value, or represent a significant
and distinguishable entry whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D) That has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

Historic properties may also be determined to be eligible based on “traditionally” cultural
significance, or TCPs, which incorporates abstract believes and customs, and practices of a living
community that have been passed down through generations,
Adverse effects to cultural resources include but not limited to altering, directly or indirectly,
any of the characteristics that qualify the property for inclusion in the NRHP in a manner that
would diminish the integrity of the properties location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, or association. Examples of adverse effects are physical damage or destruction,
modification to the setting, or alteration of the integrity and character of the physical or
abstract features, and/or criteria that contribute to its historic significance.

highly disturbed landscape. The A-1 site has been the subject of multiple investigations to
determine the presence of cultural, historical and archeological resources. In 2002, the SHPO
concurred that the A-1 project site does not require any additional cultural resource
investigations since no cultural resource sites were encountered and the site has been heavily
affected by sugar cane and sod cultivation practices. The most recent Phase I Cultural Resource
Assessment Survey (CRAS) was conducted in July 2012 by the State Bureau of Archaeological
Research (BAR) on behalf of the SFWMD. No sites eligible or potentially eligible to the NRHP
were found in the project area. The CRAS conclusions recommended no further archaeological
work at the A-1 property at this time. (A Cultural Resource Assessment Survey of the EAA A-1
Property, Palm Beach County, Florida, Bureau of Archeological Research, Division of Historical
Resources, Department of State, State of Florida, September 2012). By letter dated March 7,
2013, SHPO stated that it is unlikely that any historic or archaeological resources will be
adversely impacted by the proposed project.

4.9.2.2

Downstream areas

There are no known cultural resources within STA 2, STA 3/4, and WCA 2A. Therefore, there
would be no effect on historic properties or cultural resources within these areas.
WCA 2B contains three (3) potential cultural resource sites, one of which is potentially eligible
to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, while WCA 3A and 3B contains 109
reported archaeological sites. Currently discussed in Chapter 3, these sites have not had
extensive surveys and very little archaeological work has been done to understand how
operational changes affect cultural resources within the WCAs. Until further analysis is
completed on the effects of changing water levels within the WCAs, the USACE can only base
our determination on the premise that if such impacts associated with changes to the
hydrologic pattern have already impacted resources in the WCAs, then current proposed
changes would have no effect on historic properties since the changes to inflows into the WCAs
as a result of Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 are within the historical variation of water depths and
durations for these areas. Therefore, none of the Action Alternatives would adversely affect
cultural resources within WCA 2B, WCA 3A, and WCA 3B. In addition, the Action Alternatives
would not diminish, modify, or alter the Everglades Restoration Transition Plan Human Remains
Policy and Programmatic Agreement. However, until additional surveys are conducted within
the WCAs, little will be known about the effects of changing water levels on the cultural
resources in the area.

The Seminole Tribe has surface water entitlement rights pursuant to the 1987 Water Rights
Compact (Compact) between the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the State of Florida, and the
SFWMD (Pub. L. No. 100-228, 101 Stat. 1566 and Chapter 87-292 Laws of Florida as codified in
Section 285.165, F.S.). According to the Compact, the surface water entitlement for the Big
Cypress Reservation is based on the percentage of water available within the South Hendry
County / L-28 Gap Water Use Basin as the lands of the Reservation are proportional to the total
land acreage within the identified Basin.
The Entitlement Technical Report established a quantity of 47,000 acre-feet/year (65 cubic feet
per second) as the surface water entitlement amount for the Seminole Tribe of Florida’s Big
Cypress Reservation. This quantity of water was required to be delivered in 12 equal monthly
amounts of 3,917 acre-feet (Final Order 1998). The Seminole Tribe has requested that
supplemental water supply be delivered to the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation and the
Big Cypress National Preserve and its Addition lands. Since the project purpose for this EIS is to
achieve the WQBEL at the STA 2 and STA 3/4 discharge points in the Central Flowpath of the
Everglades Protection Area utilizing existing water deliveries from Lake Okeechobee, additional
supplemental water deliveries to the Seminole Tribe’s land are not accomplished with the A-1
project. The entitlement volume is to be delivered primarily from the original entitlement
source, the North and West Feeder Canal. When these volumes are insufficient, the Seminole
Tribe relies on the secondary supply source, the G-409 pump station. Sources of water to G-409
include Lake Okeechobee, STA 3/4, STA 5/6, and Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area. The
Action Alternatives will not change the existing operational plan for the G-409 pump station,
and therefore, the Action Alternatives will have no impact on water supply for the Seminole
Tribe of Florida’s Big Cypress Reservation.
During the regional modeling for this EIS, SFWMD incorporated the delivery of surface water
entitlement volumes that are consistent with the most current Work Plans. As shown in the
Figure 4-53 below, the annual average irrigation supplies (and sources) and shortages for the
Seminole Tribe’s Big Cypress Reservation are equivalent for all Alternatives (i.e. there is no
change from the No Action Alternative). For all Alternatives, approximately 17,000 acre-feet of
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

water is provided by Lake Okeechobee, 6,000 acre-feet is from Rotenberger Wildlife
Management Area, and 3,000 acre-feet originates from local sources (e.g. East/West Feeder
Canal S-190). All Alternatives, including the No Action Alternative, are not able to deliver
approximately 7 percent (2,000 acre-feet) of the total entitlement volume for supplemental
irrigation water in addition to falling short of the Tribe’s request for supplemental water. The
inability to deliver this approximately 7 percent of the Tribe’s total entitlement volume for
supplemental irrigation water is not attributable to any effect of construction of any A-1
Alternative. However, as stated above, when the volume of water is insufficient to provide
water from the primary supply sources, real-time operations ensures that the Seminole Tribe
receives their water entitlements through secondary supply sources.

PROPOSED WATER FLOW

The A-1 FEB is located to the east of the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation and is
projected to receive inflows from Lake Okeechobee and basin runoff via G-370 on the North
New River Canal and via G-372 on the Miami Canal as STA-3/4 receives those flows today.
There would be no changes in the timing, magnitude and nature of water flows into the Big
Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation.
The map depicted below shows surface water entitlement flows going into Big Cypress
Seminole Indian Reservation (Figure 4-54). The Seminole Tribe’s current entitlement deliveries
will not be changed when the A-1 FEB is operational. A-1 FEB operations will have no effect on
how water currently flows into Big Cypress Indian Reservation.

Environmental Effects

WCA TRIBAL RIGHTS

Both the Seminole Tribe and the Miccosukee Tribe have full rights to access lands within WCA
3A to continue their TCP usage and occupancy of Federal or Federally acquired lands and
waters within WCA 3A, which include hunting, fishing, trapping on a subsistence basis and
Traditional Cultural Practices. Religious activities traditionally include the planting and
harvesting of corn and the ceremonial Green Corn Dance conducted on tree islands.
Subsistence activities include gathering of medicinal plants and natural building materials,
hunting, and fishing; while commercial activities include frogging, conducting airboat and other
guided tours, and providing recreational and tourism facilities within the Everglades.
The Action Alternatives would not alter, modify, or effect the Seminole Tribe or the Miccosukee
Tribe’s rights within WCA 3A. Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) would result 14-30 days per year
shorter hydroperiod in 11,000 acres of WCA 3A, Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) results in 14-30 days
per year shorter hydroperiod in 1,000 acres, while Alternative 4 (STA) results in no change in
ponding and hydroperiod in WCA 3A. The areas simulated to experience the effects are
adjacent to the northern reach of the Miami Canal along the east side of the canal, while the
Seminole Tribe’s WCA 3A Easement is located west of the Miami Canal. The reduction in high
water levels within WCA 3A is anticipated to improve environmental conditions for many of the
tree islands, plants, and animals that the Tribes rely on to practice traditional and commercial
activities.

4.11 RECREATIONAL RESOURCES
4.11.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

There would be no changes to recreational resources as a result of the No Action Alternative.
Currently there is no authorized recreational use occurring on the A-1 site. It is possible that
the SFWMD could issue new leases for agricultural use of these lands, which would result in
future active production of sugar cane and other crops, limiting any recreational use on the site.

4.11.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

An FEB is a unique feature with a specific project purpose and function as described in Chapter
2. To date the South Florida Water Management District has not constructed nor operated a
Shallow or Deep FEB. As a result, immediately following completion of construction, the
project would enter an initial flooding and optimization period. During this period, various
operation and management approaches would be evaluated in an attempt to maximize the
project’s ability to achieve its intended purposes. Until the initial flooding and optimization

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

period is completed, explicit recreation for each of the action alternatives has not been defined
and may be limited. Ultimately, the recreational opportunities afforded would need to be
consistent with the project purpose and the project’s operational plan; however, the intent is
to offer the maximum amount of recreational opportunities that are determined to be
consistent with the project purpose.
Once the initial flooding and optimization period is complete, the recreational plan for the
project will be developed to maximize recreational opportunities compatible with the project
purpose. Typical recreational activities considered are hiking, biking, wildlife viewing, hunting,
and fishing. If applicable, public use activities will be incorporated using a phased approach and
public access points will be configured with facilities to support recreational activities. When
deciding which activities the SFWMD may allow, the project purpose is primary; considerations
include how recreational activities affect water quality and the health and function of the
vegetation community structure, as well as how water depths vary over time.

4.11.2.1

Project site

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) and Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
As discussed above, once the Shallow or Deep FEB is constructed there would be a flooding and
optimization period. In this time period passive recreational activities would be allowed. Once
the flooding and optimization phase is complete, a recreational plan for the project would be
developed to maximize recreational opportunities compatible with the project purpose.
Alternative 4 (STA)
Under the STA alternative, recreational activities would be consistent with recreational
opportunities allowed in the other existing STAs (e.g., hiking, biking, wildlife viewing, hunting,
and fishing). Opportunities for all these typical activities would generally increase, in
comparison to the no action alternative, if the STA alternative were implemented. Many
waterfowl and wading birds take advantage of other STAs in the region for nesting and
foraging.

4.11.2.2

STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A and WCA 3A

None of the action alternatives would have direct effects on existing recreational opportunities
within STA 2, STA 3/4, and WCA-2A and WCA-3A.
Indirect effects associated with the Action Alternatives include the potential for temporary
disturbance to recreational users in STA 2 and STA 3/4 while the construction of the project is
ongoing. These disturbance effects would be limited to the adjacent portions of the STA and
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Environmental Effects

the WMAs, and would cease when construction is completed. In addition, modeling results
establish that changes in flows and stages within WCA 2A and WCA 3A are very limited, and it is
unlikely that these changes are of a sufficient magnitude or duration to adversely influence
water related recreation in those areas.

4.11.2.3

Holey Land Wildlife Management Area

Effects to the Holy Land could occur due to construction of a discharge canal adjacent to the
existing STA 3/4 Cells 3A and 3B from the STA alternative to the L-5 canal. These direct impacts
to the Holy Land could cause temporary disturbance to recreational users while construction is
ongoing.

4.12 AESTHETICS
4.12.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

The existing aesthetic character of the A-1 project site is similar to the EAA as a whole, as
described in Section 3.12. The landscape is flat and has a predominantly uniform and organized
appearance. The prior construction activities on the site have created differences in site
conditions in various areas on the project site. Areas that have been scraped down exhibit
natural aesthetics with functioning wetland systems, while areas that have stockpiles of rock,
gravel, and much offer poor aesthetics for the area. Other low quality aesthetic areas of the
site contain wetlands dominated by exotic plant species. Under the No Action Alternative
(Alternative 1), the aesthetics would be converting those various areas to agricultural lands if
the site would resume agricultural activities.

4.12.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in construction and operation of new
impoundments that would cover approximately 15,000 acres that would be inundated on a
permanent basis. This long-term operating condition would change the visual character of the
landscape in the immediate vicinity of the proposed project. This direct effect at and near the
project site would be the primary aesthetic impact of the proposed project.
Based on the nature of the sources of change, potential aesthetic effects from the Action
Alternatives would be the same. Any of the Action Alternatives would involve an initial period
when construction would be evident to people within viewing range of the project sites. Views
of construction equipment, dust plumes, exposed excavations, and partially completed culverts
and other structures would be visible to residents and workers who pass near the construction

Environmental Effects

sites in the course of their regular activities, and to motorists traveling on roads adjacent to the
project sites. These views would be temporary in nature.
Once the project is in operation, the long-term appearance of the project site for Alternatives 2
(Shallow FEB) would consists of expansive emergent vegetation and Alternative 4 (STA) would
consist of expansive emergent and submerged vegetation. Alternative 2 (deep FEB) would
consist of expansive open water areas. All of the alternatives would provide views of the
aquatic systems bordered by a variety of constructed features, including levees; roads along the
tops of the levees; and water control structures, culverts, and pump stations spaced at varying
intervals. However, the constructed features (e.g., levees, roads, water control structures, etc.)
will be noticeable by those passing by the site. The view of the aquatic habitats would be
noticeable to those on the levee system. Although the future condition with the project would
result in less overall visual diversity, the presence of additional water area would likely be
perceived as a positive change or of more visual interest when compared with the current
condition (Hettinger 2005, as cited in URS 2007a,b). On balance, the long-term aesthetic change
resulting from the project would not be a significant adverse impact.

4.13 FLOOD PROTECTION
4.13.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

Under the No Action Alternative the existing level of flood protection would be maintained as it
currently is today with no impacts to the project site, STA 2, STA 3/4, WCA 2A, WCA 3A or Holey
Land.

4.13.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

4.13.2.1

Project Site

None of the Action Alternatives are expected to impact the existing level of flood protection
within the C&SF System.
Both the shallow FEB and the STA alternatives are a closed system with the only hydraulic
inputs being water delivered by pumps or direct rainfall. Based on Design Criteria
Memorandum one (DCM-1), and a Levee Breach Analysis conducted for the Shallow FEB, the
Shallow FEB alternative has been designated a low hazard potential classification. Inundation
mapping performed during the analysis has shown at maximum water level a levee breach
would not reach the travel lanes of U.S. 27 or overtop the north STA 3/4 levee; therefore, there
is no impact to the existing level of flood protection service. Since the levee height and
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

maximum water depths for the STA alternative are similar to the shallow FEB, no flood
protection impacts are anticipated with the STA alternative. In the event of a levee breach, a
potential for damage exists for adjacent private property to the north and west of the project
site.
The Deep FEB alternative is classified as a high hazard potential based on the criteria outlined in
DCM-1. A seepage cutoff wall would be required within the perimeter embankment as well as
a perimeter seepage canal to reduce and capture seepage from the Deep FEB. In the event of a
levee breach additional conveyance would be required on the west side of U.S. 27 to allow for
flood waters to get away and not impact the travel lanes or overtop STA 3/4. Adjacent private
agriculture property would experience damage to the north and west of the project site if a
breach or overtopping of the Deep FEB levees were to occur.

4.13.2.2

STAs 2 and 3/4, WCAs 2A and 3A, and Holey Land Wildlife
Management Area

No impacts to the existing level of flood protection in STAs 2 and 3/4, WCAs 2A and 3A, and
Holey Land would be expected with the Action Alternatives.

4.14 HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE
4.14.1

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

The current land use within the A-1 project site is inactive agricultural lands. Under the No
Action Alternative, the land use would remain primarily fallow agricultural lands; however,
agricultural activities may become active. There would be the potential for release of
petroleum or agricultural chemicals in these areas with active agricultural land use.
Additionally, large areas of the property have been scraped of the soil and the soil has been
stockpiled in berms and discrete stockpiles throughout the property. These stockpiles
represent an increased potential for erosion into adjacent waterways.

4.14.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

Current areas of known contamination are described in Chapter 3 of this document. One area
where the project may encounter contaminant concentrations exceeding ecological risk
thresholds with Alternatives 2 (Shallow FEB), Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) and Alternative 4 (STA) is
the southern portion of Tract #100-039 (Woerner Farm 3), where toxaphene impacted soils
were previously identified. Tract #100-039 consists of approximately 966 acres of land;
however, only approximately 330 acres of the property will be used within project footprint,
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

4-101

July 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

plus a small area to the northwest of the project footprint that will be used for a construction
yard. This southern portion of Tract #100-039 within the project footprint has been scraped of
soil and part of the seepage ditch that was constructed for the EAA reservoir. Additional
sampling is required on this tract to verify that toxaphene concentrations in the remaining soils
are below ecological risk thresholds and to verify the disposition of the scraped soils.
Therefore, this area will be sampled prior to project construction. Any contaminated soils
exceeding the threshold will be removed and relocated outside the project footprint.
Tract #100-104 (Talisman South Ranch) contains areas with elevated levels of copper and
arsenic. This area completed remediation of all of the point source areas. The known areas
within Tract #100-029 (Talisman Mill) where contaminated soils have been consolidated and
capped will be within the A-1 FEB footprint. These areas will not be disturbed during
construction. Construction of a reservoir over these areas was previously evaluated by FDEP,
which concluded that these areas would not impact the project and the capped areas prevent
exposure to wildlife or people, as long as the cap remains in place above the contaminated
soils.
The USFWS has provided concurrence that no significant ecological risks associated with
residual agrochemicals are present on Tracts #100-105 and #100-020. The USFWS issued
separate concurrence on the entire A-1 FEB project site by letter dated April 17, 2013
(Appendix J), pending confirmation on remediation of toxaphene impacted soils from the lower
1/3 of the Woerner Farm 3 property and with the understanding that the SFWMD will
implement a USFWS-approved start-up monitoring plan for copper which includes surface
water, periphyton, and apple snails should they occur onsite.
A Site Rehabilitation Completion Order was issued by FDEP on July 21, 2006 under FDEP Facility
ID number 50/8514728.
Due to the ubiquitous nature of arsenic throughout the EAA, all Action Alternatives could result
in the generation of excess soils which contain arsenic at concentrations exceeding the FDEP
residential soil cleanup target levels (SCTLs), but below commercial SCTLs or ecological risk
thresholds. As these levels are below the ecological risk threshold, use of these soils on-site will
result in a low ecological impact. It is currently anticipated that all soils will remain on site and
utilized in construction of the levees. If excess soils are disposed off-site, they will be utilized in
compliance with state and federal requirements and regulations.
The Action Alternatives would include the use of heavy equipment for construction of the
proposed project and associated structures. Operation of this equipment may result in the
release of petroleum products, such as fuel and hydraulic fluid. Fueling areas may experience
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

4-102

July 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

spills when equipment and tanks are filled or possible spills from fuel tank leaks. The use of
equipment could result in the release of hazardous and toxic materials or waste into the project
area. However, Best Management Practices (BMP) would be implemented during construction
to reduce the risk of release of hazardous or toxic materials or waste.

4.15 CLIMATE
Implementation of the No Action and the Action Alternatives would have no measureable
effect on the climate in south Florida.

4.16 COSTS
No Action and Action Alternatives
For the purposes of this EIS, cost estimates for each alternative are a rough order of magnitude
based on the primary components that comprise each alternative. Therefore costs are
confined to the build alternatives themselves for the project footprint. Since no construction is
anticipated downstream in STA 2 and STA 3/4 or in WCA 2A and WCA 3A with any of the
alternatives, a cost analysis is not applicable in these areas.
The cost estimate for each alternative is based on the alternative description of major
components as outlined in Chapter 2, Section 2.4 Description of Alternatives. There is a certain
amount of sunk costs (costs already incurred) within each alternative associated with the
previous construction from the EAA A-1 Reservoir. These are defined as sunk costs for the land
and initial earthwork that was conducted. Table 4-15 contains each of the Alternatives listing
total cost, sunk costs and estimated new construction costs. Of the alternatives (2, 3 and 4) that
are projected to meet the WQBEL at both STA 2 and STA 3/4), Alternative 2 is the least
expensive.
The difference in construction cost between the Shallow and Deep FEBs results from the
needed additional excavation for the Deep FEB for an inflow pump station and fill material for
larger levees, as well as the seepage cutoff wall and additional protection features needed for
flood protection (see also Section 4.13.2.1). The STA would require additional levees to
separate the EAV and SAV cells; as well as a new discharge canal within Holey Land.

4.17 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice, as fair treatment
and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin or income
with respect to development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws,
regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no group of people should bear a
disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial,
governmental, or commercial operations, or the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal
programs and policies. Meaningful involvement means that potentially affected community
residents have an appropriate opportunity to participate in decision making about a proposed
activity that will affect their environment and/or health (EPA website at
www.epa.gov/region4/ej).
In accordance with Executive Order 12898, the Federal government reviews the effects of their
programs and action on minorities and low income communities. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health
or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and
low-income populations. The following potential environmental justice issues have been
identified for a water storage facility in the EAA:
•

Displacement of minority or low income inhabitants of land within the footprints of land
purchases required for each of the project alternatives.

•

Flooding or related environmental issues that would impact minority groups or low
income class groups as a result of change in conveyance of water.

•

Loss of jobs for low income and minority workers as a result of implementing the
project.

The scope of analysis for the A-1 project site includes the EAA, STA 2 and STA 3/4, WCA 2A and
WCA 3A, and Holey Lands. These areas do not contain residential communities. The closest
areas with minority or low income communities are north of the EAA, Belle Glade and South
Bay, which are 14 and 13 miles north (upstream) of the project site, respectively (Figure 4-55).

Figure 4-55 Environmental Justice Areas of Interest

According to the United States Census Bureau data of 2011, Belle Glade contains 21,815 people
residing in the city. The racial makeup of Belle Glade is 4.7% White, 27.0% Hispanic or Latino
origin, 62.7% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.5% Asian, and 5.4% some other race.
There are 6,324 households in Belle Glade with a median household income of $28,406 per
year. About 38.4% of the population is below the poverty line, of which 47.4% are under the
age of 18 and 28.8% are over the age of 65. The US Census data states the per capita income is
$4,995, which is the lowest ranked city/town in the state of Florida (887 out of 887). The zip
code in Belle Glades is 33430.
Also according to the United States Census Bureau data of 2011, South Bay contains 4,901
people residing in the city. The racial makeup of South Bay is 10.0% White, 23.3% Hispanic or
Latino, 64.2% Black or African American, 0.4% Asian, 0.6% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific

Islander, and 3.3% from some other races. There are 779 households in South Bay with a
median household income of $25,663 per year. About 42.9% of the population is below the
poverty line, of which 54.9% are under the age of 18 and 36.5% are over the age of 65. The
2010 US Census data states the per capita income is $9,126, which is ranked (866 out of 887).
The zip code in South Bay is 33493.
The Action Alternatives would not have a disproportionately high and adverse human health or
environmental effects on minority or low income populations. Displacement of minority or
low-income inhabitants will not occur with any Alternative as the lands do not support housing.
In addition, land that has historically been used for agriculture would be used water quality
purposes on the A-1 project site. Therefore, there would be a loss in agricultural lands and a
loss of agricultural jobs. Recreational benefits are a potential use for each of the Action
Alternatives. Socioeconomic development activities resulting from construction of the project
include but are not limited to construction symposiums, contract opportunity assistance for
small business involvement and job cross training for local residents. These all act to make the
area more attractive to visitors and in turn, may provide jobs and subsistence for low income
and minority populations of the area. Belle Glade and South Bay will not be affected by
flooding or other environmental factors such as dust, offensive odors, or water pollution as the
areas are located north of the project site. The project would discharge waters into an STA,
which is designed to accept flood waters. The STA will in turn, discharge the treated water into
WCAs. The SFWMD will implement measures to control dust during construction activities
through the use of best management practices.

4.18 NATURAL OR DEPLETABLE RESOURCES
4.18.1

NO ACTION

The No Action Alternative is anticipated to have an increase in the generation of agricultural or
mineral resources. The A-1 project site could be utilized for agricultural use or rock mining.

4.18.2

ACTION ALTERNATIVES

There are rock mining and/or agricultural resources that would be unavailable for exploitation
as a result of construction of the Action Alternatives. Limestone and/or rock material is a
common available resource in the region. The impact of the proposed project upon rock
mining or agricultural resources is very minor. No other significant vegetable or mineral
resource is known to exist.

4.19 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
Evidence is increasing that the most severe environmental consequences do not result from the
direct impacts of any particular action, but from the combination of impacts of multiple,
independent actions over time. Section 1508.7 of the CEQ regulations defines a cumulative
impact as:
“the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of
the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes
such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but
collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.”
Principles of cumulative effects analysis, as described in the CEQ guide Considering Cumulative
Effects under the National Environmental Policy Act, are presented in Table 4-16.
Table 4-16. Principles of Cumulative Impacts Analysis
Cumulative impacts are caused by the aggregate of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.
Cumulative impacts are the total impacts, including both direct and indirect impacts, on a given resource,
ecosystem, and human community of all actions taken, no matter who (federal, nonfederal, or private) has taken
the actions.
Cumulative impacts need to be analyzed in terms of the specific resource, ecosystem, and human community
being affected.
It is not practical to analyze the cumulative impacts of an action on the universe; the list of environmental impacts
must focus on those that are truly meaningful.
Cumulative impacts on a given resource, ecosystem, and human community are rarely aligned with political or
administrative boundaries.
Cumulative impacts could result from the accumulation of similar impacts or the synergistic interaction of different
impacts.
Cumulative impacts could last for many years beyond the life of the action that caused the impacts.
Each affected resource, ecosystem, and human community must be analyzed in terms of the capacity to
accommodate additional impacts, based on its own time and space parameters.
Source: CEQ, 2013.

4.19.1 SIGNIFICANCE
In accordance with CEQ regulations and implementing guidance, cumulative effects are
evaluated in terms of their significance. The term significant, as defined in 40 CFR 1508.27, part
of the CEQ regulations for implementing NEPA, requires considerations of both context and
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

4-107

July 2013

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

intensity. Context means that the significance of an action must be analyzed in several settings,
such as society as a whole, the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality.
Significance varies with the setting of the proposed action. For instance, in the case of a sitespecific action, significance would usually depend on the effects on the locale rather than on
the world as a whole. Both short- and long-term effects are relevant to the consideration of the
significance of an effect. Intensity refers to the severity, or degree, of effect. Factors that have
been used to define the intensity of effects include the magnitude, geographic extent, duration,
and frequency of the effects. The following terms are used to describe the degree of direct and
indirect effects, whether they are adverse or beneficial:
•

No Effect or Minor Effect - the effect is either non-detectable (no effect) or slight
but detectable (minor)

•

Moderate – the effect is readily apparent.

•

Major – the effect is severely adverse or exceptionally beneficial.

Adverse effects can be reduced in intensity by mitigation. Mitigation in this context refers to
measures taken to avoid, minimize, or offset adverse effects. For example, dust emissions
generated during road building operations, whether directly caused by the movement of heavy
equipment or indirectly caused by unvegetated soils exposed to wind, have the potential to
cause a major effect that decreases as distance from the work increases. When BMPs are
implemented, usually in response to local or county ordinances, the BMPs mitigate the effect of
the dust by controlling fugitive dust emissions and reducing the intensity (magnitude,

PAST, PRESENT, AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ACTIONS
AFFECTING RESOURCES WITHIN THE STUDY AREA

Prior to drainage and compartmentalization, the Everglades were a shallow wetland conveying
water from Lake Okeechobee to the southern coast of Florida. The Everglades Drainage
District, encompassing 7,150 square miles, was created in 1907 by Florida Governor Napoleon
Bonaparte Broward for the purpose of drainage and reclamation of the Everglades (Light and
Dineen 1994). In the early 1900s, the Everglades Drainage District constructed several canals
that impacted Lake Okeechobee and the Greater Everglades. By 1917, the West Palm Beach,
Hillsboro, North New River and Miami Canals had been constructed (Allison et al., 1948). By
1931, the outlet from Lake Okeechobee to the Caloosahatchee River was improved, and the
completion of the St. Lucie Canal east to the Atlantic Ocean provided another way of controlling
lake levels. The Bolles and Cross canals became connectors to the four major canals south of

Lake Okeechobee bringing the total miles of canal excavated to 440 (Light and Dineen 1994).
The Everglades Drainage District also constructed 47 miles of levees around the southern rim of
Lake Okeechobee during this time (Allison et al., 1948). Within a similar time frame (19151928) the construction of Tamiami Trail was completed which linked Miami with Naples on the
west coast. Hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 shifted attention from Everglades drainage to
controlling flooding around Lake Okeechobee. In 1930, the Corps became a major participant
with the state (i.e., Okeechobee Flood Control District) in controlling flooding around Lake
Okeechobee. Florida agreed to share a portion of the costs to increase discharges from the
lake, improve canal works, and reconstruct and enlarge the levees around it (Light and Dineen
1994). The effect of levees on the agricultural area south of Lake Okeechobee was dramatic
and sugarcane production was doubled in 10 years between 1931 and 1941 (Clarke, 1977).
Drainage of the Everglades and the linkage of the east and west coast, promoted urban growth
in south Florida and the population escalated from 22,961 in 1900 to 228,454 by 1930 (Dietrich
1978). During the 1930s and into the 1940s, construction was abandoned and maintenance
ceased on Everglades Drainage District works (Light and Dineen 1994).
Although modifications to Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades began in the early 1900s, the
greatest influence on the alteration of flow was the C&SF Flood Control Project, which was
originally authorized by Congress in 1948. The C&SF project was designed to lower water levels
east of the eastern protective levee by 4 to 5 feet. Increased flood protection coupled with
lowering of the water table east of the levee had a dramatic effect on urbanization and
development and acted as a catalyst for a population explosion in south Florida. Between 1952
and 1954 the eastern perimeter levee along the WCAs was constructed from Palm Beach to
Dade County in order to stop sheet flow from the Everglades toward the urbanizing eastern
coastal areas (Light and Dineen 1994). Between 1954 and 1959 additional levees (L-1, L-2, L-3,
L-4, L-5, L-6, and L-7) were constructed to partition the EAA from the remainder of the
Everglades and the old Everglades Drainage District Canals (West Palm Beach, Hillsboro, North
New River, and Miami) were deepened within the EAA to provide better flood conveyance from
the agricultural area into the WCAs (Light and Dineen 1994).
Between 1960 to 1963 substantial portions of the C&SF Flood Control project were completed.
Construction of the levees surrounding WCA 3 was completed by 1963 with L-67A dividing WCA
3 into two compartments, WCA 3A and WCA 3B (Light and Dineen 1994). S-151 and S-31 were
also constructed during this time period. These two structures improved the discharge capacity
of the Miami Canal to coastal communities (Cooper and Roy, 1991), further exacerbating the
unnatural drainage of northern WCA 3A. In combination with the northern levees of WCA 3A
(L-4 and L-5), the Miami Canal has substantially impacted historical sheetflow and natural
wetland hydroperiods. As a result, during wet periods, the natural capability of WCA 3A to
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Environmental Effects

store water is lost and the Miami Canal effectively over-drains the area. These hydrologic
changes have increased the frequency of severe peat fires and have also resulted in the loss of
ridge and slough topography that was once characteristic of the area. Northern WCA 3A has
become largely dominated by sawgrass, cattail and scattered shrubs and lacks the structural
diversity of plant communities seen in central and western WCA 3A.
Completion of the L-29 levee in 1962 led to ponding in the southern portions of WCA 3A.
Exacerbating this problem were the major canal systems (i.e. Miami Canal, L-67A) which
accelerate the flow of water from north to south within WCA 3A, drying the north while further
ponding the south (Zaffke 1983), especially along the L-67 A and L-29. As a result of this
ponding, extended hydroperiods and increased water depths led to changes in vegetation
communities in which wet prairies were displaced by aquatic slough communities (Zaffke 1983,
Tanner et al. 1987). In addition, many tree islands within southern WCA 3A were lost due to
increased water depths (Craighead 1971), with many of the remaining islands showing signs of
stress. Wood and Tanner (1990) documented the trend in southern WCA 3A toward deep
water lily dominated sloughs due to impoundment within the southern end of WCA 3A.
Four control structures located along the L-29 were constructed between 1960 and 1963 (S12A, S-12B, S-12C, and S-12 D). These structures were used to regulate discharge from WCA 3A
and effectively limited water releases to only the western part of Shark River Slough (Light and
Dineen 1994). Construction of the L-67 C and the extension of L-67 south of Tamiami Trail were
completed between 1965 and 1973 in order to facilitate water delivery from WCA 3A to ENP.
Completion of the L-67 A and C canal and levee system intercepted water that would otherwise
flow to WCA 3B. With its impoundment, WCA 3B became isolated from the rest of the
Everglades with inflows and outflows limited to rainfall and levee seepage. Within WCA 3B, the
ridge and slough landscape has become severely compromised by the virtual elimination of
overland sheetflow and has largely turned into a sawgrass monoculture where relatively few
sloughs or tree islands remain. Loss of sheetflow to WCA 3B has also accelerated soil loss
reducing elevations of the remaining tree islands in WCA 3B, making them vulnerable to high
water stages. With the construction of WCA 3A, WCA3B and the extension of the L-67, flows to
ENP became subject to water supply deficits during the dry season and excesses during the wet
season, resulting in a decline in ecological quality. By 1973 the C&SF project in the Everglades
was essentially complete.
Among the first Congressional actions to offset adverse impacts to ENP by improving the supply
and distribution of water, was the Flood Control Act of 1968, which provided for modifications
to the C&SF Project through the implementation of the ENP South Dade Conveyance System
(SDCS). Additional Congressional actions ensued, including the ENP Protection and Expansion

Chapter 4

Environmental Effects

Act of 1989, which expanded ENP to incorporate the Northeast Shark River Slough and the East
Everglades into the Park’s boundary for protection and restoration of the natural hydrologic
conditions within ENP. This Act also provided authorization for development of the Modified
Water Deliveries (MWD) to ENP project. The goal of the MWD Project was to improve water
deliveries into ENP and, to the extent practicable, take steps to restore the natural hydrologic
conditions within ENP. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000 established
CERP to provide for the restoration, protection and preservation of the water resources of
central and southern Florida, including the Everglades and Florida Bay (USACE 1999).
CERP contains 68 components that include approximately 217,000 acres of new reservoirs and
wetlands-based water treatment areas. A number of operational components have also been
identified in CERP and will, in most cases, occur in conjunction with related construction
features. The operational features in CERP include: a modified Lake Okeechobee regulation
schedule; environmental water supply deliveries to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie Estuaries’
modifications to the regulation schedules for WCAs 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, and the current rainfall
delivery formula for ENP; modified Holey Land Wildlife Management Area Operation Plan;
Modified Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area Operations Plan; a modification for coastal
well field operations in the Lower East Coast (LEC); LEC utility water conservation; and
operational modifications to the southern portion of L-31 and C-111. These features will result
in significant environmental benefits to the CERP project area, improving the quantity, quality,
timing and delivery of water to the natural system. Construction has begun on the first
generation of CERP project modifications already authorized by Congress. Second generation
of CERP projects is awaiting Congressional authorization. However, none of these projects will
alter water flow or water quality within the study area.
Non-CERP projects that are considered reasonably foreseeable, which may affect resources
within the study area, include projects under the Restoration Strategies Regional Water Quality
Preliminary Plan (SFWMD 2012) for either the Western, Central or Eastern Flowpaths. The
Restoration Strategies Regional Water Quality Preliminary Plan describes resulting projects
developed to address water quality concerns associated with discharges from the STAs to the
EPA to achieve water quality standards established for the Everglades. Overall, the SFWMD is
implementing a technical plan to complete eight projects that will create more than 6,500 acres
of new STAs, 110,000 acre feet of additional water storage through construction of FEBs, and
800 acres of earthwork within the existing STAs to maximize effective treatment area. Design
and construction of the treatment and storage projects will be completed in three phases over
a 12 year timeframe, with completion set for 2024.

The C&SF Project has numerous water management structures consisting of culverts, spillways,
and pump stations that have specified operating criteria for managing or regulating water levels
for Congressionally-authorized project purposes. Regulation schedules have been, and will
continue to be, designed to balance multiple, and often competing, project purposes and
objectives. Managing for better performance of one objective often lessens the effectiveness
of performance of competing objectives. For example, for Lake Okeechobee, higher regulation
schedules tend to benefit water supply, but may increase the risk to public health and safety,
and can harm the ecology of the lake. Lower lake schedules may produce lake levels more
desirable for the lake ecology and improved flood protection, but reduce water supply
potential.
Since April 2008, Lake Okeechobee has been operated in accordance with the 2008 Lake
Okeechobee Regulation Schedule (2008 LORS). Prior to the 2008 LORS, Lake Okeechobee
operations were managed under the “Water Supply and Environment (WSE) Regulation
Schedule” since July 2000. The 2008 LORS operational study was initiated to address high lake
levels, high estuarine discharges, estuary ecosystem conditions, and lake ecology conditions
that occurred during the 2003 to 2005 time period. The study considered the back-to-back
historically significant 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons’ effects on the recognized structural
integrity issues of HHD along with effects to other project purposes. The 2008 LORS was
identified to be effective at decreasing the risk to public health and safety, reducing the number
of high-volume discharges to the estuaries, and providing critical flexibility to perform water
management operations. When it was approved, LORS 2008 was identified as an interim
schedule. A subsequent schedule would be considered after the modifications to the Herbert
Hoover Dike were completed.
In addition to CERP and non-CERP projects previously specified, another current project
includes the Everglades Restoration Transition Plan (ERTP) for WCA 3A, ENP, and the SDCS,
which has replaced the Interim Operational Plan (IOP) for protection of the Cape Sable seaside
sparrow (CSSS). From July 2002 through October 2012, WCA 3A was regulated according to a
seasonally varying 8.75 to 10.75 feet, NGVD regulation schedule and the Rainfall Plan (initiated
in 1985), as per IOP. The primary objective in implementing IOP was to adhere to a 1999
USFWS Jeopardy Opinion to reduce damaging high water levels within CSSS habitat west of
Shark River Slough (i.e. CSSS-A). The purpose of IOP was to provide an improved opportunity for
CSSS nesting by maintaining water levels below ground level for a minimum of 60 consecutive
days between March 1 and July 15, corresponding to the CSSS breeding season. In addition, a
secondary purpose of IOP was to allow CSSS habitat to recover from prolonged flooding during
the mid-1990s. The ERTP superseded the IOP in October 2012 and is intended to define water
management operating criteria for the C&SF project features and constructed features of the

MWD and Canal-111 South Dade Projects until a Combined Operational Plan (COP) is
implemented. ERTP objectives include improving conditions in WCA 3A for the endangered
Everglade snail kite, wood stork and wading bird species while maintaining protection for the
endangered CSSS and Congressionally-authorized purposes of the C&SF Project.
In November 2011, the USACE initiated an expedited planning process referred to as the
Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP). The goal of CEPP is to implement a suite of
restoration projects in the central Everglades to prepare for congressional authorization, as part
of the CERP. CEPP would evaluate and develop incremental project components that focus
restoration on more natural flows into and through the central and southern Everglades. The
project objectives include capturing water currently being discharged to northern estuaries and
re-direct south to benefit the Everglades. This would be accomplished by re-establishing the
hydroperiods and hydropatterns that characterize the River of Grass project by (1) increasing
storage, treatment, and conveyance of water south of Lake Okeechobee, (2) removing and/or
plugging canals and levees within the central Everglades, and (3) retaining water within ENP
and protect urban and agricultural areas to the east from flooding, Implementation of CEPP
would allow more water to be directed south to the central Everglades, Everglades National
Park and Florida Bay while protecting coastal estuaries projects on land already in public
ownership
Relationship with Central Everglades Planning Project
CEPP will be implemented by the USACE with the SFWMD as the non-federal sponsor. While
implementation of CEPP would allow more water to be directed south to the central
Everglades, the A-1 Shallow FEB would only accept water that is currently being discharged
south from Lake Okeechobee and would not capture water that would is currently being
discharged from Lake Okeechobee to tide. Furthermore, the A-1 Shallow FEB project is not a
project component of CEPP as it is proposed to be constructed and operated solely by the
SFWMD.
CEPP recognizes the SFWMD’s plans on the A-1 parcel and considers the operation of the A-1
Shallow FEB in the planning process. CEPP assumes that the SFWMD’s A-1 Shallow FEB will be
constructed separately from the CEPP projects, will be constructed prior to the CEPP projects,
and would be operated as an FEB regardless of whether the CEPP project received
Congressional approval. Therefore, the SFWMD’s A-1 Shallow FEB is included in the baseline
condition of the alternatives analysis referred to as the CEPP Future Without Project.

Integrated Operations of the FEB (parcels A-1 and A-2)
The screening conducted for CEPP storage and treatment options, to deliver “new” water to the
Everglades, resulted in the identification of a 28,000 acre FEB as the option that reasonably
maximizes benefits while minimizing costs. This configuration proposes a shallow FEB on the A2 footprint that would operate in conjunction with the SFWMD’s A-1 Shallow FEB project (See
Figure 4-56). The maximum operating depth within the proposed CEPP FEB design is 4 feet.
The Recommended Option is projected to provide approximately 200,000 ac-ft per year
(average annual value) of additional flow (which is currently being discharged to tide via the St.
Lucie Canal and Caloosahatchee River) to the Everglades.
The SFWMD’s A-1 Shallow FEB was designed to accept existing EAA runoff and current Lake
Okeechobee releases in order to provide water to STA 2 and STA 3/4 in an optimized way. The
SFWMD’s A-1 Shallow FEB is not proposed to be continually operated at four feet at all times,
although this would normally occur during the wet season. Therefore, the A-1 FEB will have
capacity to accept and treat additional water from Lake Okeechobee during off-peak times,
such as the dry season. CEPP formulation considers potential benefits from using the available
capacity in the A-1 FEB, STA 3/4 and STA 2 during the dry season for additional water storage.

For the A-2 FEB, a new divide structure would be proposed to be constructed at the northwest
corner of the A-1 Shallow FEB. When in operation, the new divide structure could allow for a
transfer of water between the A-1 and the A-2 FEBs enabling them to operate in conjunction

4.19.3 DETAIL OF ANALYSES
As stated in the CEQ regulations (1501.1):
“following scoping, the preparing agency should determine the scope
(Sec. 1508.25) and the significant issues to be analyzed in depth in the
environmental effect statement. Identify and eliminate from detailed
study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by
prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3), narrowing the discussion of
these issues in the statement to a brief presentation of why they will not
have a significant effect on the human environment or providing a
reference to their coverage elsewhere.”
As described in Chapter 1, following scoping, issues that were not believed to be significant
were eliminated from detailed study. These topics include Essential Fish Habitat, Air Quality,
Noise Pollution, Transportation, and Water Supply/Drinking Water. Issues, or resource
categories, not eliminated from detailed study included: Land Use, Geology, Topography and
Soils; Hydrology (Overall Water Management, Surface Water Hydrology; Groundwater
Hydrology, STA Phosphorus Removal); Water Quality; Vegetation (General Vegetation and
Wetlands); Fish and Wildlife (Overall Fish and Wildlife, Federally Listed Threatened or
Endangered Species, State Listed Threatened or Endangered Species, Migratory Birds); Cultural,
Historic, and Archaeological resources; Tribal Rights; Recreational Resources, Aesthetics; Flood
Protections; Hazardous and Toxic Waste; Climate; Costs; Environmental Justice, and Natural or
Depletable Resources.
In accordance with CEQ guidance (CEQ, 1997), this analysis of cumulative effects is focused on
those resource categories determined to be significant. Identification of the resource
categories for which there may be significant cumulative effects began with defining the direct
and indirect effects of the current action on the resources categories (see Sections 4.3 through
4.18). The resource categories were then considered in terms of their importance nationally,
regionally, and locally. After consideration of the direct and indirect impacts of the current
project and the above described reasonably foreseeable projects and considering comments

Although geology, groundwater hydrology, fish and wildlife values, migratory birds, aesthetics;
flood protection, hazardous and toxic waste, climate; costs, and environmental justice were
considered in detail for direct and indirect effects, they are not part of the cumulative effects
analysis in this section. This decision was based on the factors described above, including the
degree and significance of the direct and indirect effects, the resources, ecosystems, and
human communities that may be affected, and the relative importance of the issues. Table 417 describes the potential cumulative effects as a result of past, present, proposed, and future

Increased freshwater flows to Florida Bay would aid to lower salinity levels, benefiting
mangrove communities and seagrass beds.

analysis of the A-2 project. While additional water would be routed south and stored on the
Effect
A-1 Site, the A-2 Site, and within STA 2 and STA 3/4, meeting water quality at the STA
discharge points would be a requirement of existing permits. While anthropogenic effects on
water quality are unlikely to be eliminated, water quality is expected to slowly improve over
existing and recent past conditions.
Cultural Resources
Flood and water control projects, conversion of wetlands into agriculture and urban
Past Actions development have had adverse unmitigated effects to cultural resources either directly or

Environmental Effects

Ongoing efforts have been made by Federal and state agencies to implement projects to
improve hydrology within the project area, thereby stabilizing the tree islands which are
known to have a high potential for cultural resources. Investigations mandated in the
Programmatic Agreement for ERTP are in the process of being completed.
• There are no known cultural resources within the A-1 Site. Therefore, there are no
impacts to cultural resources expected.
Proposed
• The minor change in hydroperiod within the WCAs is expected to be so minor that no
Action
effect is expected by the proposed project’s impacts on cultural resources sites eligible
for listing with the NHPA.
• Continued improvement to hydroperiods and sheetflow within WCA 3A, 3B and ENP
could reduce soil oxidation, which could stabilize the environment, and this in turn could
stabilize tree islands containing cultural resources. Investigations mandated in the
Programmatic Agreement for ERTP are in the process of being completed and will
Future
determine the effects of fluctuating water on subsurface historic properties.
Actions • While the effects of CEPP, and specifically the A-2 project have been evaluated, a final
determination of effects on cultural resources is not complete. Consultation with
stakeholders, including the State Historic Preservation Office, Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation, Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of
Florida is currently ongoing.
Cumulative effects to historic properties and culturally significant sites will be potentially
Cumulative
major long-term adverse effects. Mitigation measures for effects to historic properties could

reduce the cumulative effect to be minor long-term adverse effects.

4.20 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES
Under NEPA guidelines, the EIS analysis includes a discussion on irreversible and irretrievable
commitment of resources as it pertains to the Action Alternatives. An irreversible commitment
of resources refers to effects to the resources that cannot be reversed or that would not be
reversed in a foreseeable amount of time. An example would be when a species becomes
extinct. Irretrievable commitment of resources describes a resource that is lost for a period of
time or as long as the action exists. For example, fishing productivity would be lost in an area
closed to be converted to oil exploration for as long as the oil exploration remains.
Action Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in the conversion of 10,820.3 acres of wetlands to
manipulated wetlands. Existing wetlands that are located in areas where placement of fill
would occur (construction of levees and filling canals) would be irreversibly lost; however, land,
including wetlands within the impoundments, would be converted or would remain wetland or
waters. Temporary, and possibly permanent, displacement would occur for some natural and
human resources during construction operations.

4.21 IMPACT COMPARISON AND CONCLUSIONS
The environmental effects of the alternatives were evaluated and compared with the No Action
Alternative. Many of the environmental effects were similar for each of the Action Alternatives,
which are evaluated in detail in Chapter 4 and summarized in Section 4.21 (Table 4-16).
However, changes to the affected environment are seen in land use, soils/total phosphorus
removal, surface water, water quality, and wetland impacts as a result of the Alternatives. In
this evaluation, a cost benefit analysis was recognized between the alternatives and is an aid in
evaluating the environmental consequences. The differences in the affected environmental
factors, including the cost benefit analysis, are summarized below.
LAND USE
Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would require the A-1 project site to be used primarily for water quality
purposes. Because the lands are required to be used to conduct restoration activities in the
Everglades ecosystem pursuant to the Farm Bill and the Cooperating Agreement, each of the
action alternatives would require approval for an interim land use change from USFWS/DOI.
SOILS/TP CONCENTRATIONS
Lower phosphorus concentrations discharged from the STA 2 and STA 3/4 would reduce the
rate of soil phosphorus accumulation in WCA soils. Over time, reductions in soil total
phosphorus will help facilitate the restoration of impacted areas near the inflow points to WCA
2A and WCA 3A creating conditions more conducive to historic Everglades vegetative
communities. The FEBs proposed in Alternatives 2 and 3 have the potential to benefit soils
within STA 2 and STA 3/4 by maintaining minimum water levels and reducing the frequency of
dryout conditions. The probability of experiencing dryout conditions in STA 2 and STA 3/4 is
greatest under Alternative 4 (STA). In general, as additional STA acreage is added (as in
Alternative 4), the potential risk of STA dryout, and associated impacts to phosphorus removal
performance within existing and new STAs, increases, whereas, when additional storage is
added (as in Alternative 2 and 3), the potential for dryout within existing STAs decreases.
HYDROPERIOD ANALYSIS
Alternative 2 has the least change in hydroperiod in WCA 2A, while Alternative 3 has the least
change in hydroperiod in WCA 3A. Alternative 4 has no change in the hydroperiod in either
WCA. The hydroperiod changes that are simulated to occur are for all the Action Alternatives
are limited to a small percentage of area within WCA-2A (0.6 – 3.1%) and WCA-3A (0.2 – 2.2%).
The minor differences in WCA-2A hydroperiods for Alternatives 2 and 3 occur mainly due to a
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Environmental Effects

shift in the location of WCA-2A inflows from S-7 to the L-6 Canal, however the total inflow
volumes to WCA-2A are approximately equivalent. The hydroperiod changes that occur in WCA3A are most likely due to the different structural and operational characteristics related to the
facilities (Shallow FEB, Deep FEB, STA) evaluated within the project site.
WATER QUALITY
The purpose of the project is to assist STA 2 and STA 3/4 in meeting the WQBEL at discharges
from the STAs into the Everglades Protection Area. The No Action Alternative does not meet
the project purpose since STA 3/4 would not meet the WQBEL at the STA outflow. Alternatives
2, 3, and 4 are projected to meet the WQBEL at outflows from both STAs.
The WQBEL requires that STA discharges shall not exceed: 1) 13 ppb as an annual flowweighted mean in more than three out of five water years on a rolling basis; and 2) 19 ppb as
an annual flow-weighted mean in any water year.

WETLANDS
Natural wetlands will be permanently altered within the boundaries of the project site as
unavoidable adverse wetland and surface water impacts would occur due to placement of fill
and excavation. Jurisdictional wetland impacts for levee fill vary between each alternative since
each project would require specific width, heights, and location of levees. Jurisdictional
wetland impacts for levee fill are greatest with Alternative 3 because the taller levees require a
wider base. Jurisdictional wetland impacts for Alternative 4 require external and internal
levees. Alternative 4 also requires excavation and fill in Holey Lands to construct a canal and
with berms/levees. The Shallow FEB has the lowest wetland impacts of the Action Alternatives.

COST
Each of the alternatives would require approval for a land use change. The No Action
Alternative does not meet the project purpose since STA 3/4 would not meet the WQBEL at the
STA outflow. However, Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would meet the WQBEL for STAs 2 and 3/4.
Although meeting the WQBEL, the probability of experiencing dryout conditions in STA 2 and
STA 3/4 is greatest under Alternative 4 (STA) while Alternatives 2 and 3 offer the greatest
benefit to reducing dryout conditions. Alternative 2 would result in the least amount of
wetland impacts. In weighing the merits and drawbacks of the various alternatives, a cost
benefit analysis was also considered in this evaluation since the project is funded with tax-payer
dollars and the impacts to the public could assist in determining an important qualitative
consideration.
Of the Alternatives that are projected to meet the WQBEL at the outflow from both STA 2 and
STA 3/4, Alternative 2 is the least expensive. Alternative 3 required additional excavation for
the Deep FEB for an inflow pump station and fill material for larger levees, as well as the
seepage cutoff wall and additional protection features needed for flood protection. This

require additional levees to separate the EAV and SAV cells, as well as a new discharge canal
within Holey Land.

The current and reasonably foreseeable actions’ direct and indirect effects on most of these
resource categories were predicted to have no effect or to have a minor degree of effect, or at
most a moderate degree of effect. The only major degree of effect was associated with listed
species. None of these effects were significant. Most were relatively limited in extent, with the
categories’ effects confined within the boundaries of the action. The primary exception to this
was environmental justice, and for that resource category the current and reasonably
foreseeable actions were expected to have a minor, beneficial, and non-disproportionate
effect. Finally, although all of these resource categories generated interest during scoping and
comments on the Draft AEIS, this factor alone was not sufficient to elevate any of the
categories to the level of the significant cumulative impact issues.

COMPENSATORY MITIGATION

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

5.0 MITIGATION
As defined by the Council on Environmental Quality, Title 40 Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) §1508.20, mitigation requirements include the following:
• Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;
• Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its
implementation;
• Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected
environment;
• Reducing or eliminating the impacts over time by preservation and maintenance
operations during the life of the action; and
• Compensating for the impacts by replacing or providing substitute resources or
environments.
Under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404(b)(1) guidelines implemented through 40
CFR Part 230, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) shall be required to
avoid and minimize impacts to waters of the United States (US), then provide compensatory
mitigation for unavoidable adverse impacts. Mitigation measures for the Action
Alternatives were identified as best management practices (BMPs) and compensatory
mitigation, which are discussed in the following sections.

5.1

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS

5.1.1 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
During construction activities for all Action Alternatives, the SFWMD would implement
standard construction BMPs to avoid affecting the surrounding environments. Standard
construction BMPs include, but are not limited to:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Installing siltation fences to prevent erosion and to provide turbidity barriers to
minimize suspended solids in the water column;
Downstream turbidity shall be monitored to ensure state turbidity standards (29
nephelometric turbidity units) are not exceeded;
Watering construction sites and roads to reduce dust generation;
Suspending surface-disturbing activities such as grading during periods of particularly
high winds;
Maintaining construction equipment according to the manufacturer’s specifications;
Transporting demolition debris to a landfill or otherwise disposed of in accordance with
federal, state, and local requirements;

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

7.

Prior to construction, dewatering permits shall be issued by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) under Chapter 373 F.S. The permit would include
requirements for the construction contractor to submit a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan, which includes turbidity control and monitoring plans; and
8. Although not anticipated for any of the Action Alternatives, if relocation of utility lines is
needed, the SFWMD shall coordinate formally with Florida Power and Light once the
design process is complete.

5.1.2 THREATENED OR ENDANGERED SPECIES AND SPECIES OF CONCERN
Although specific details will be developed as consultation occurs between the US Amy
Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), it is anticipated
that at a minimum, the following measures shall be incorporated during project
construction to minimize effects on any threatened or endangered species that may occur
in the construction site: a) Standard Protection Measures for the Eastern Indigo Snake
(2004); b) Habitat Guidelines for the Wood Stork in the Southeast Region (2009); and c)
Everglades Snail Kite Management Guidelines (2009).

5.1.3 HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC WASTE
Under the No Action Alternative, the land may be leased or sold for agricultural use. If
agricultural activities would commence on the project site, there is the potential for release
of petroleum or agricultural chemicals, which would be subject to regulation under the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection. During previous construction activities for
the A-1 Reservoir, the SFWMD partially remediated a tract of land north of the project site,
referred to as the Woerner Tract, by excavating contaminated soils with elevated levels of
toxaphene. Portions of the Woerner Track still contain elevated levels of toxaphene.
However, under all of the Action Alternatives, those areas of known soil contamination have
been excluded from the project footprint so no mitigative measures are required.
For Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, there would be no dumping of oil, fuel, or hazardous wastes in
the work area and safe and sanitary measures for disposal of solid wastes would be
required. A spill prevention plan shall also be required.

5.2

WETLAND IMPACTS

In accordance with the CWA Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines 40 CFR Part 230, wetland and
aquatic resource impacts are first avoided, then minimized to the maximum extent
practicable. Section 404 of the CWA requires compensatory mitigation to replace aquatic
resource functions unavoidably lost or adversely affected by authorized activities.

Compensatory Mitigation

Mitigation must meet the requirements of the 2008 Mitigation Rule, 40 CFR Part 230 and 33
CFR Parts 325 and 332. The following sections discuss the project’s impacts to wetlands and
the compensatory mitigation proposed.

5.2.1 SITE CONDITIONS
The A-1 project site contains 16,517.9 acres of land of which 14,656.9 acres are wetlands
and 1,861.0 acres are uplands. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 will involve the placement of fill
material within wetlands to construct levees, berms, pump stations. The alternatives also
propose to excavate soils to remove stockpiled material and fill interior ditches and canals
to achieve designed elevations. The impacts to waters of the US for each alternative are
described below. The calculations of the impacts were revised since the draft EIS as the
project designs were further refined.

5.2.2 DIRECT IMPACTS
The wetland impacts for each alternative are summarized on Table 5.1:

Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under the No Action Alternative, the site could either remain undisturbed or the SFWMD
could lease or possibly sell the property to allow agricultural activities to resume. If the site
were to remain undisturbed, there would be no impacts to wetlands or waters of the US;
therefore, there would be no compensatory mitigation requirements. If the agricultural
activities would resume on the project site, the wetlands would be cleared of vegetation,

Compensatory Mitigation

and pumping would drain the water off of the lands. Although the work associated with the
agricultural activites would result in an overall loss of wetlands, the agricultural activities
are exempt under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

5.2.2.2

Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)

The direct impacts associated with Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) result in 435.9 acres of
wetlands and waters of the US as a result of levee and canal fill, as well as canal excavation.
Of the 435.9 acres of impacts, 280.1 acres of wetlands would be filled to construct the levee
and backslope muck piles, 112.8 acres of canals and ditches would be filled to raise the
elevation of the ditch/canal to be consistent with the adjacent wetlands, and 43.0 acres of
freshwater marsh wetlands would be excavated to construct a canal. The impacts to 112.8
acres of canals and ditches would be an improvement to the wetland habitat as the fill
would be placed in the canal/ditch to raise the canal bottom up to surrounding wetland
elevation. The SFWMD has revised the designs in response to comments received from the
Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission and incorporated areas within the interior FEB to have
sloped levees with a wider base. Although the internal levee slope design increases wetland
impacts by additional 101.8 acres of fresheater marsh, the sloped levee would create
transitional littoral zones and allow wildlife species the ability to vacate the area easier as
waters rise. The existing muck piles would be backsloped along the interior levee in two
areas to create a maximum of 30:1 (H:V) slope.

5.2.2.3

Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)

The direct impacts associated with Alternative 3 (Deep FEB) result in 576.6 acres of
wetlands and waters of the US as a result of levee fill as well as canal excavation. Of the
576.6 acres of impacts, 533.6 acres of wetlands would be filled to construct the levee and
43.0 acres of canal would be excavated. In addition, 10,820 acres of the deep FEB footprint
will be flooded more frequently compared to the Shallow FEB or the STA resulting in
adverse impacts to wetlands. Alternative 3 would not require fill in canals or ditches.

5.2.2.4

Alternative 4 (STA)

The direct impacts associated with Alternative 4 (STA) result in 986.4 acres wetlands and
waters of the US as a result of levee and canal fill, canal excavation, and excavation/fill of
freshwater wetlands. Of the 986.4 acres of impacts, 353.6 acres of wetlands would be filled
to construct the levee, 112.8 acres of canals and ditches would be filled, 270 acres of canals
would be excavated, and 250 acres of freshwater wetlands would be impacted (125 acres of
excavation to dig the canal and 125 acres of fill to build the levee adjacent to the canal) to
construct a canal connection within the Holey Land Wildlife Management Area.

Compensatory Mitigation

COMPENSATORY WETLAND MITIGATION

The SFWMD provided a compensatory wetland mitigation plan for their preferred
alternative, the Shallow FEB, which includes hydrologic and vegetation benefits within the
footprint of the project (Appendix C). Although each alternative would vary in degree of onsite ecological benefits, it is anticipated that the hydrology and the vegetation community
within the footprint of the project would change by retaining additional water on the site.
The SFWMD is proposing to receive credit for providing and retaining the hydrology within
the project footprint and improving the aquatic habitat. Although the attenuation of water
within the footprint is expected to decrease soil loss due to oxidation and reduce water
column total phosphorous from the No Action Alternative, the various depth of water and
differing operation plans would result in different site conditions between the Alternatives.
Each Alternative would contain different wetland communities, each supporting different
wetland dependent birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and animal species. Therefore,
each Action Alternative would have different aquatic function and values.
Under Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, the SFWMD would remove exotic vegetation as maintenance
once the proposed project is constructed. Routine maintenance of the levees, as well as any
wetland areas within the project footprint would also be performed. Reporting
maintenance activities, as well as monitoring the vegetation is included in the South Florida
Environmental Report (SFER), which is produced annually and provided to the USACE and all
interested parties.
Hydrologic monitoring and water quality monitoring shall also be conducted as part of
normal operations. The monitoring shall be consistent with permit compliance for the
constructed project and for operational improvements. This information is also reported on
an annual basis in the SFER.

5.3.1 Alternative 1 (No Action)
In the event agricultural activities would resume, the area would be drained and there
would be a loss of hydrology on the project site. The natural wetland vegetation would be
removed and the site would be planted with agricultural vegetation, possibly sugar cane or
sod. Therefore, no compensatory mitigation is needed for the No Action Alternative.

5.3.2 Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB)
Under Alternative 2, the four wetland communities would be converted from the existing
condition, as described in Section 3.7.1, to a freshwater marsh consisting primarily of cattail

5-5

Chapter 5

Compensatory Mitigation

(Typha domingensis). Other native species expected within the shallow FEB may consist of
emergent aquatic vegetation (EAV) such as sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), Carolina willow
(Salix caroliniana), bulrush (Scirpus spp), pickerel weed (Pontederia cordata), duck potato
(Sagittaria lancifolia), and Illinois pondweed (Potamogeton illinoensis).
The Shallow FEB would contain water depths ranging from 0 to 4 feet, and is expected to be
inundated with approximately 1.5 feet or more of water for 60% of the time. The monthly
water depths average between 1 and 3.5 feet. The Shallow FEB would be operated in a
manner to ensure STA 2 and STA 3/4 contains appropriate water levels. The Shallow FEB
would be operated to take up to 4 feet of water and continue to store the excess water
even if the water levels remain high for a period of time. During this period of time of high
water events, the freshwater marsh wetland community within the Shallow FEB is expected
to be inundated with water that negatively affects the vegetation. Conversely, as water will
be pumped from the Shallow FEB to supply water STA 2 and STA 3/4, the Shallow FEB will
most likely dry earlier than the existing STAs and may not contain standing water during the
dry periods. During this time, it is anticipated that the freshwater marsh wetland
community within the Shallow FEB would be negatively affected by the drought. Therefore,
the ecological benefit or “lift” of both hydrology and vegetation will be affected by the
changes and may not be as beneficial as a typical restoration project.

5.3.3 Alternative 3 (Deep FEB)
For the deep FEB, the four wetland communities would be converted from the existing
condition, as described in the No Action Alternative, to a vegetation community consisting
mainly of freshwater floating aquatic vegetation (FAV) species, similar to those found in the
canals and ditches.
Alternative 3 would contain water depths ranging from 0 to 12.5 feet, and is expected to be
inundated with approximately 1.5 feet or more of water for 60% of the time. The monthly
water depths average between 2 and 5 feet. Due to the greater depth capacity, this
Alternative may hold additional water during excess rain events. Similar to the Shallow FEB,
the Deep FEB will also be operated in a manner that ensures the STAs 2 and 3/4 receive
preferential quantities of water to ensure more consistent water levels in the STAs. The
Deep FEB would be operated to take up to 12 feet of water and continue to store the excess
water even if the water levels remain high for a period of time. During this period of time of
high water events, the freshwater marsh wetland community within the Deep FEB is
expected to be inundated with water that negatively affects the vegetation. Conversely, as
water will be pumped from the Deep FEB to supply water STA 2 and STA 3/4, the Deep FEB
will most likely dry earlier than the existing STAs and may not contain standing water during

Compensatory Mitigation

the dry periods. During this time, it is anticipated that the freshwater marsh wetland
community within the Deep FEB would be negatively affected by the drought. Similar to the
Shallow FEB, the anticipated lift may not be as beneficial as a typical restoration project.

5.3.4 Alternative 4 (STA)
The STA would have a maximum operating depth of 4 feet. For the STA alternative, the four
wetland communities would be converted from the existing condition, as described
inSection 3.7.1, to two types of wetland communities: EAV and submerged aquatic
vegetation (SAV). The STA would be designed to route water through specified EAV cells or
SAV cells, each with a specific operating depth to support the wetland community. EAV
cells would be operated at target depths between 1.25 and 1.5 feet of water, while the SAV
cells would be operated at target depths between 1.5 and 2.0 feet of water during normal
operations. The vegetation community expected in the EAV cells consist of sawgrass
(Cladium jamaicense), Carolina willow (Salix caroliniana), bulrush (Scirpus spp), pickerel
weed (Pontederia cordata), duck potato (Sagittaria lancifolia), and Illinois pondweed
(Potamogeton illinoensis), while the vegetation found in the SAV cells would include native
plant species similar to the EAV but may also contain coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum),
muskgrass (Chara spp.), pondweeds [Potamogeton spp. (esp. P. illinoensis, P. pusillus)], and
Southern naiad (Najas quadalupensis).
Alternative 4 would contain water depths ranging from 0 to 4 feet, and is expected to be
inundated with approximately 1.5 feet or more of water for 60% of the time. The proposed
STA would contain average monthly water depths between 1.5 and 2.5 feet. The STA would
be operated as an additional STA and would not be utilized to store excess water or provide
water preferentially to STA 2 or STA 3/4 to ensure more consistent water levels in those
STAs. As seen in the existing STAs, the emergent and submerged cells are heavily utilized by
a variety of wildlife species including wading birds, ducks, hawks, fish, amphibians, and
alligators.

5.4

UMAM ASSESSMENT

The USACE utilizes Uniform Mitigation Assessment Methodology (UMAM) to determine the
function and value of the wetlands. The SFWMD has performed a preliminary UMAM
assessment and submitted their UMAM proposal for the pre- and post-project conditions
for review. The UMAM specifically assessed the construction and operation of the
SFWMD’s preferred alternative, the shallow FEB. If another alternative is selected as the
least environmentally damaging practical alternative, the SFWMD will provide a separate
UMAM assessment for the other alternative. However, the USACE is providing an

estimated UMAM score for the other alternatives (Deep FEB and STA) for purposes of this
Environmental Impacts Statement (EIS).

5.4.1 ALTERNATIVE 2 (SHALLOW FEB)
The impacts from the Shallow FEB project would result in a loss of 280.1 acres of wetlands
as a result of fill to construct the levees, 43.0 acres of wetland impact for canal excavation,
and 112.8 acres of fill in canals. The post project site conditions within the Shallow FEB
would improve the aquatic function and value from the existing site conditions. By
providing hydrology to the wetlands and improving elevations, the low quality wetlands on
the site would be improved. Wetland impacts resulting from construction of the Shallow
FEB would result in the loss of 205.1 functional capacity units while the improvements to
the wetlands within the interior of the shallow FEB is expected to result in a gain of 1,729.4
functional capacity units (FCUs). Overall, the project may result in a net gain of 1,524.3
functional capacity units. See Table 5-2 and Table 5-3 below for a breakdown of the
impacts and the credits.
As a result of comment on the draft EIS, the cooperating agencies reviewed the UMAM
scores for the Shallow FEB and commented on the water environment and the risk, and the
scores have been revised accordingly. The UMAM sheets are included in this Final EIS as
Attachment 2 (UMAM Mitigation Sheets).
The wetlands within the Shallow FEB meet USEPA’s Guiding Principles for Constructed
Treatment Wetlands, which states “in general, wetlands constructed or restored for the
primary purpose of treating wastewater will not be recognized as compensatory mitigation
to offset wetland losses” (Appendix C) because the purpose of the wetlands is not for water
quality treatment, but storage of water which would be provided to the STAs that actually
treat the water. Although it is recognized that the wetlands within the Shallow FEB would
offer some ancillary treatment benefits, their purpose is water storage. The USACE does
not have any remaining concerns with the mitigation plan for the Shallow FEB. The USACE
agrees that the Shallow FEB would provide wetland benefits and the loss of wetland
function and value is offset.

Ledger System:
The UMAM assessment for Alternative 2 (Shallow FEB) results in a surplus of credits. The
surplus of credits demonstrates that the project results in an overall benefit to the
environment as compared to the existing site conditions. The SFWMD has requested to
utilize the remaining credits to offset any unavoidable wetland impacts for future SFWMD’s
Restoration Strategies projects. The remaining credits would be tracked under a ledger
system. The identified Functional Capacity Units surplus is approximately 1,524.3 credits for
the Shallow FEB (Table 5-6). If another alternative were selected, the SFWMD would also
propose to utilize any excess credits for future SFWMD Restoration Strategy projects. For
this discussion, the Shallow FEB alternative is discussed.

The Shallow FEB Alternative would provide significantly more mitigation credit than is
needed to offset the impacts from construction. The USACE has evaluated whether it is
appropriate to utilize the excess functional capacity units from the Shallow FEB Alternative
as compensatory mitigation to offset wetland impacts for future projects. The Shallow FEB
will be operated as a water storage site to enhance the operation of the STAs. The shallow
FEB will accept water during storm events, and supply water to the existing STAs during the
dry season. The USACE recognizes that the Shallow FEB would be susceptible to more
drastic changes in water elevations and will sacrificially experience dry-out conditions in
favor of STA 2 and STA 3/4. These changes in hydrology will cause the wetland community
to change between marsh wetlands and wet prairie wetlands, with dryer dry periods. The
USACE recognizes that this is a great benefit for water quality purposes within the EPA and
an improvement to the current site conditions on the project site. However, the effects
from changes in hydrology on the wetlands at the project site may not make appropriate
mitigation to offset future impacts for other projects, especially if there is dissimilar
vegetation or hydroperiod as this would be out of kind. This option would be evaluated on a
case by case basis for each future project.

5.4.2 ALTERNATIVE 3 (DEEP FEB)
The construction of the Deep FEB would result in impacts to 576.6 acres of waters of the US,
including 533.6 acres of wetland impacts as a result of fill in freshwater wetlands and 43.0
acres of wetland impacts as a result of canal excavation, as well as the permanent impact to
the interior wetlands from water depths that no longer function as wetlands. The
construction of the Deep FEB alone would require 318.5 FCUs to be offset (Table 5-4). The
Deep FEB would offer little wetland benefits on the project site because the reservoir would
have depths greater than 4 feet of water 30% of the time, which would flood any rooted
vegetation and greatly reduce wetland function and value. Additionally, the Deep FEB is
anticipated to exhibit longer durations of water at deeper water depths, which is expected
to encourage floating aquatic vegetation to establish. The site may not exhibit

characteristics of a wetland but rather an open water pond or lake. Rooted wetland
vegetation that may establish within the Deep FEB during low water levels would die off,
resulting in difficulty in reestablishment between the flood/dry cycles. The poor habitat
provided within the reservoir would not be an appropriate mitigation to offset the wetland
impacts of the project. The USACE would require that the applicant provide an alternative
compensatory mitigation plan, possibly purchasing credits at a federally approved
mitigation bank or mitigation at another appropriate offsite location.

5.4.3 ALTERNATIVE 4 (STA)
The impacts from the STA Alternative would result in a loss of 353.6 acres of wetlands as a
result of fill to construct the levees, 270.0 acres of wetland impact for canal excavation,
112.8 acres of fill in canals, and 250 acres of excavation and fill of wetlands within the Holey
Land. The impacts resulting from construction of the STA will result in a loss of 477.2
functional capacity units. See Table 5-5 below for a breakdown of the impacts. The
SFWMD has not provided a separate compensatory mitigation plan for Alternative 4. The
post-project site conditions within the A-1 STA would improve the aquatic function and
value from the existing site conditions. However, the STA, once operated, would no longer
be considered a water of the US as it would be operated under a NPDES permit. Also, the
use of constructed treatment wetlands as compensatory mitigation conflicts with USEPA’s
Guiding Principles for Constructed Treatment Wetlands, which states “in general, wetlands
constructed or restored for the primary purpose of treating wastewater will not be
recognized as compensatory mitigation to offset wetland losses” (Appendix C). As such,
STAs are not typically utilized as compensatory mitigation. However, some exceptions have
been permitted by the USACE in cases where the STA itself is for environmental restoration
purposes and the losses are offset only for atypical wetlands. In this instance, the exception
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

would not apply since the atypical wetlands have reverted back to a more natural wetland
type and agricultural vegetation does not exist in the wetlands. If the SFWMD were to
propose environmental benefits within the interior of the STA as their compensatory
mitigation plan, further coordination with the USEPA would be required.

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

6.0 COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
Coordination with and evaluation of required compliance with specific federal acts,
executive orders, and other policies for the various alternatives was achieved, in part, by
coordinating this document with appropriate agencies and the public. This section
documents compliance with all applicable federal statutes, executive orders, and
policies.

6.1

CLEAN AIR ACT OF 1970, AS AMENDED

The initial Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 and was dramatically revised and expanded
in 1990, giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) broader authority to
implement and enforce regulations that reduce acid rain, urban air pollution, and toxic
air emissions. As described in Chapter 8, air quality permits may be required for pump
stations. The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) will apply for these
permits, which the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the
USEPA will review, if necessary. The Proposed Action complies with this statute.

6.2

CLEAN WATER ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 became commonly
known as the Clean Water Act (CWA) with its amendment in 1977. The act established
the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United
States. The Proposed Action would assist existing stormwater treatment areas (STAs) in
making progress towards achieving water quality goals for total phosphorus in the
Everglades Protection Area (EPA). As described in Chapter 8, the construction of the
shallow FEB, deep FEB or Reservoir, or STA alternatives would require a CWA, Section
404 Dredge and Fill Permit issued by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The
applicability of Section 404 triggers Section 401 Water Quality Certification of the CWA.
A Section 404 permit application has been submitted to USACE.
In addition, the STAs also require, and have been issued a Section 402, National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit by Florida DEP. This permit requires
compliance with applicable state water quality standards.
The Proposed Action complies with the CWA of 1972, as amended.

6.3

COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1972

The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, provides the national policy to
preserve, protect, develop, and restore the nation’s coastal zones and was established
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
Final Environmental Impact Statement

6-1

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

to encourage states to better manage their coastal resource. The statute assists coastal
states in developing state coastal management programs and achieving a balance
between competing uses of coastal resources. The statute requires that federal actions
that may affect any land or water use of the coastal zone be “consistent” with the
enforceable policies of a coastal state’s or territory’s federally approved coastal
management program. The Proposed Action is consistent with the Florida Coastal
Management Program. No comments on the Notice of Intent (NOI) for this
environmental impact statement (EIS) have been submitted by the Florida State
Clearinghouse.

6.4

ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OF 1973

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 replaced the Endangered Species Conservation Act
of 1969 and provides protections for species that are threatened or endangered
throughout all or a significant portion of their geographic range and the habitats that
those species use. In the ESA, “endangered” species are defined as in danger of
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, “threatened” species are
likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a
significant portion of its range, and “species of special concern” might need
concentrated conservation actions. The EIS assesses effects to all federal and state listed
species that are expected to occur in the project-affected area, described in Chapter 3.
Coordination for threatened and endangered species was initiated with USFWS on
December 10, 2012. Per agreement between USACE and USFWS, the biological
assessment (BA) for the project site will determine the effects to listed species by
comparing the baseline condition defined as the projects that have been previously
consulted with the USFWS to the changes resulting from the construction and operation
of the applicant’s preferred alternative. A biological opinion will be obtained from
USFWS before USACE issues the record of decision (ROD) and makes a permit decision
on the Section 404 permit application. The USACE’ decision will comply with the ESA.

6.5

ESTUARY PROTECTION ACT OF 1968

The Estuary Protection Act emphasizes the values of estuaries and the need to conserve
these natural resources. The Act authorized an inventory and studies of U.S. estuaries to
determine whether these areas should be acquired by the federal government for
protection, and authorized cost-sharing between the federal and state governments for
management of estuary resources.
Water management in Lake Okeechobee periodically involves releasing large quantities
of water into these estuaries, resulting in changes in salinity and in dissolved oxygen

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

content, increased turbidity, and nutrification within the estuaries. None of the action
alternatives would change freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee to the Northern
Estuaries, which include the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee Estuaries and the Indian River
Lagoon. Therefore, all of the action alternatives would not change the frequency,
duration, or timing of lake releases. The alternatives discussed within this document
would not adversely affect estuaries nor increase the frequency and/or duration of
releases to the estuaries. The project complies with this statute.

6.6

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11990, PROTECTION OF WETLANDS

Executive Order 11990 requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, the
adverse impacts associated with destruction or modification of wetlands. The action
complies with the goals of this executive order.

6.7

EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988, FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT

Executive Order 11988 requires federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, the
long and short-term adverse impacts associated with occupancy and modification of
floodplains. It further directs federal agencies to avoid direct and indirect support of
floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative. The project is in the
base floodplain (100-year flood) and has been evaluated in accordance with this
executive order. The action is in compliance.

6.8

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866, REGULATORY PLANNING AND REVIEW

Executive Order 12866 aims to improve the process of planning and reviewing of
regulations and to make it more efficient. Its objective is to re-establish the federal
government’s primary position in the regulatory decision-making process and to make
the process more accessible to the public. This Executive Order is intended only to
improve the internal management of the Federal Government. The action is in
compliance.

6.9

EXECUTIVE ORDER 12875, ENHANCING THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL
PARTNERSHIP

The purpose of Executive Order 12875 is to enhance intergovernmental consultation
and collaboration on federal matters and to prevent the federal government from
imposing unfunded regulations on state, local, and tribal governments. It prohibits
federal agencies from putting into effect any regulations that are not required by
statute unless the affected state, local, and tribal governments are provided funds by
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

Chapter 6

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

the federal government. However, this executive order only applies to those regulations
which the federal government has the power to waiver. It requires federal agencies to
provide the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a representation of all
consultations and collaborations that occur between the agency and the affected
governments. This executive order also requires that the federal agency allow time for
state, local, and tribal governments to participate in the development of such
regulations. The agency shall take into account any application provided by the affected
government to waiver regulatory requirements in order to provide flexibility to the
affected government as long as these are in compliance with the federal policy
objectives. The action is in compliance.

6.10 EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Executive Order 12898 requires federal agencies to identify and address, as appropriate,
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.
Executive Order 12898 requires the Federal government to review the effects of their
programs and actions on minorities and low income communities. As described in
Chapter 4, the effects of the Proposed Action would not be disproportionate toward any
minority or low-income populations. The action complies with the goals of this
Executive Order.

6.11 EXECUTIVE ORDER 13112, INVASIVE SPECIES
Executive Order 13112 requires federal agencies to, among other tasks, prevent the
introduction of invasive species, monitor invasive species populations, restore native
species and habitat where invasions have occurred, and promote public education. The
proposed Action Alternatives would reduce total phosphorus loading, which should
reduce the proliferation of invasive cattails in the EPA. This action complies with this
executive order.

6.12 FARMLAND PROTECTION POLICY ACT OF 1981
The purpose of the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) is to “minimize the extent to
which Federal programs contribute to the unnecessary conversion of farmland to
nonagricultural uses...” The act specifically targets the urban sprawl resulting from the
conversion, and the associated wastes of resources and energy. This project has been
coordinated with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and complies with
this statute.

6.13 FISH AND WILDLIFE COORDINATION ACT OF 1958
The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) requires that fish and wildlife receive
equal consideration as other project components for proposed water resource
development projects and that appropriate mitigation for impacts be provided. This
statute is implemented through consultation with the USFWS.
As described in Chapter 7, the Department of Interior (DOI) and the USFWMD are
cooperating agencies in developing this EIS. An ongoing consultation process between
the USACE and the USFWS has involved regular communication and exchange of input
between the agencies through monthly interagency coordination meetings, public
scoping meetings, and correspondence. A final record of the USFWS determination is
included in the Final EIS in Appendix L.

6.14 MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION ACT
The 1996 amendments to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act (MSFCMA) mandated NMFS and the Fisheries Management Council
include the identification and protection of essential fish habitat (EFH) in all federal
fishery management plans. NMFS implements and enforces the MSFCMA through
consultation with federal agencies required for any federally funded, permitted, or
proposed work that may affect EFH. As documented in Chapter 3, no EFH exists within
the footprint of the project or within an extended distance of the proposed project. As a
result, consultation with NMFS was not initiated. The Proposed Action complies with
this statute.

6.15 MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED
The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits the taking of marine mammals in U.S.
waters and by U.S. citizens on the high seas, and also prohibits importation of marine
mammals and marine mammal products into the United States. The only marine
mammal known to enter waterways within the EAA is the West Indian manatee. The
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) Interagency Manatee Task Force
showed that manatees navigated through the Okeechobee Waterway and accessed the
EAA canals through the gates at the S- 351, S-352 and S-354 structures (CERP
Interagency Manatee Task Force, 2006). (The task force is made up of representatives
from USFWS, FWC, USACE, USGS, the National Park Service, the Miami-Dade
Department of Environmental Resources Management, and private researchers.)
Subsequently, manatee barriers have been installed at these control structures;

therefore, manatees are not expected within canals adjacent to the project. The
Proposed Action complies with the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

6.16 MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT OF 1918, AS AMENDED, AND THE
MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION ACT
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918, as amended, prohibits pursuing, hunting,
taking, capturing, killing, or selling migratory birds, as identified in the Act, through
international conventions between the United States and Great Britain, Mexico, Japan,
Canada, and Russia. The Migratory Bird Conservation Act establishes a Migratory Bird
Conservation Commission that makes decisions acquiring lands or waterbodies
identified by the Secretary of the Interior as necessary for the conservation of migratory
birds.
Many wading birds, including the wood stork, use the project area for foraging. Wading
birds were observed feeding in the footprint of the proposed project, but no nesting
activity was observed during the site visits in October and November 2012. Foraging
habitat within the project site is marginal because of past land-use practices and
encroachment by exotic plant species. It is anticipated that the construction of a shallow
FEB or a STA would improve foraging habitat within the STA expansion, but the
construction of the deep FEB would not improve foraging habitat due to the deep water
depths. No migratory birds or their nests will be adversely affected by the Proposed
Action. This action complies with these statutes.

6.17 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF 1969
The purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is “To declare a national
policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his
environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the
environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the
understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation;
and to establish a Council on Environmental Quality” (42 USC Section 4321). It
encourages public participation and comment, and it ensures that all branches of
government consider environmental consequences of federal projects.
NEPA requires environmental impacts be considered within the federal decision-making
process. Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) established regulations for
implementing NEPA (under Title 40 CFR Section 1500). The USACE has its own
supplemental regulations for complying with NEPA (33 CFR 320) for its Civil Works
Program. These regulations call for the preparation of an EIS for authorization of any
A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin

major federal project that could have significant effects on the environment. The USACE
Jacksonville District Commander is the responsible official for NEPA actions within the
district. Ultimately, the decision whether to implement the Proposed Action, one of the
other Action Alternatives, or the No Action Alternative will be made at USACE
Headquarters in Washington DC. Any decision made will be in compliance with NEPA.
As stated above, NEPA requires environmental impacts be considered within the federal
decision-making process. The decision to grant an approval for a change in land use
under the Grant Agreement is a federal decision as contemplated by NEPA.
NEPA requires agencies to cooperate with other federal agencies and state and local
governments, and to involve public stakeholders or citizens. Chapter 8 and Appendix F
document the public involvement process completed as part of this EIS.

6.18 NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT OF 1966, AS AMENDED
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) was enacted to provide adequate
protection for historic resources, including archaeological sites. The National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP), National Historic Landmarks, and the posts of State Historic
Preservation Officers (SHPOs) were established under this act. NHPA requires federal
agencies to take into consideration the effects of their undertakings on cultural
resources that are listed in, eligible for, or nominated to the NRHP. Federal agencies
must consult with the SHPO and interested federally recognized Native American tribes.
Consultation with the Florida Department of State Division of Historical Resources was
initiated in 2006. A Phase 1 cultural resources survey report was prepared and
submitted to the SHPO. The SHPO found the report complete and sufficient in
accordance with Chapter 1A-46, FAC. Based on the report recommendations, SHPO
concluded that the construction of the A-1 Rreservoir would have no effect on any
historic properties eligible for listing on the NRHP (See Appendix F, SHPO letter dated
December 13, 2002).
In 2012, the SFWMD conducted a separate Phase 1 cultural resource assessment survey
of the A-1 project area. In the Cultural Resource Assesment Report, the Bureau of
Archeological Research concluded that there are no NRHP eligible sites in the project
area and did not recommend further archeological work at the A-1 project site. A copy
of the report is found in Appendix F. The SHPO is currently reviewing the CRAR to
determine if they concur with the Bureau of Archeological Research’s conclusions.

6.19 NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT
OF 1990
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatatriation Act of 1990 (25 USC 3001 et
seq.) establishes a means for American Indians to request the return or repatriation of
human remains and other cultural items presently held by Federal agencies or federally
assisted museums or institutions. The act also contains provisions regarding the
intentional excavation and removal of, inadvertent discovery of, and illegal trafficking in
American Indian human remains and cultural items. Major actions under this law
include: (a) establishing a review committee with monitoring and policymaking
responsibilities; (b) developing regulations for repatriation, including procedures for
identifying lineal descent or cultural affiliation needed for claims. (c) providing oversignt
of museum programs designed to meet the inventory requirements and deadlines of
this law; and (d) developing procedures to handle unexpected discoveries of graves or
grave goods during activities on Federal or tribal lands. All Federal agencies that
manage land or are responsible for archaeological collections obtained from their lands
or generated by their activities must comply with this act. USACE managers of ground
disturbing activities on Federal and tribal lands are to be aware of the statutory
provisions treating inadvertent discoveries of American Indian remains and cultural
objects. Regulations implementing the act are found at 43 CFR 10.

6.20 RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 1976, AS
AMENDED
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) provides guidance for hazardous
waste disposal and gives USEPA the authority to establish waste management laws and
regulations. RCRA’s primary goals are to protect human health and the environment
from the potential hazards of waste disposal, to conserve energy and natural resources,
to reduce the amount of waste generated, and to ensure that wastes are managed in an
environmentally sound manner. Chapter 3 discloses the results of investigations of
hazardous waste disposals in the project footprint. The proposed project would comply
with this statute.

6.21 SEMINOLE INDIAN CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1987
The Florida Indian (Seminole) Land Claims Settlement Act of 1987 directed the SFWMD
the State of Florida, and the Seminole Tribe to execute an agreement for the purposes
of resolving tribal land claims and settling the lawsuit filed by the Seminole Tribe of
Florida (Seminole Tribe), which involved certain land claims within the State.

Compliance with Environmental Requirements

Agreements to resolve tribal land claims were executed between the three parties,
which included conveyance of land and payment of consideration to the tribe, and
implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States and the Legislature of the
State of Florida. An agreement known as the Water Rights Compact (Compact) was
executed between the State of Florida, the SFWMD, and the Seminole Tribe. The
Compact specifically defined tribal water rights. This Compact was adopted into federal
and state law. It includes a series of provisions establishing the Seminole Tribe’s water
rights and creating several “entitlements” to surface water for each of the Tribe’s
reservations. This project would not alter the terms of the Compact.

6.22 SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL ACT OF 1965
The Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, as amended by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmenets of 1984 (42
USC 6901 et seq.) as amended, govern the transportation, treatment, storeage, and
disposal of hazardous waste and nonhazardous waste (that is, municipal solid waste).
Under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which amended the Solid
Waste Disposal Act of 1965, USEPA defines and identifies hazardous waste; establishes
standards for its transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal; and requires permits
for persons engaged in hazardous waste activities. Regulations imposed on a generator
or on a treatment, storage, or disposal facility vary according to the type and quantity of
hazardous waste generated, treated, stored, or disposed, and the methods of
treatment, storage, and disposal. The State of Florida has adopted by reference
portions of the Federal regulations into its Florida Administrative Code Rule 62-730.
Chapter 3 discloses the results of investigations of hazardous waste disposals in the
project footprint. The proposed project would comply with this statute.

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

As part of public involvement, information describing the EIS process and the proposed project
was distributed following NEPA guidelines. The public scoping process was initiated when the
Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS for the proposed A-1 Shallow Flow Equalization Basin
(FEB) was published on August 28, 2012 [(77 FR 51981, Document No. 2012-21186, page
51981-51983) (Appendix D)]. The NOI provided information on the purpose and need for the
Proposed Action, background, the alternatives to be evaluated, and the geographic locations of
the project sites. The NOI further provided the date, time, and location for the scoping meeting
and the point of contact information at U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to submit
comments and receive additional information.
Notification was sent on the USACE Corporate Communications e-notification list for Facebook,
YouTube, Twitter, and Flicker. A news release was published on August 29, 2012 that
requested input and comments on the project. The USACE also sent the public notice and
notice of intent to 598 interested parties who have requested to receive notifications on the
previous A-1 Reservoir mailing list, the list generated by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection (FDEP) for the A-1 Shallow FEB project, the Central Everglades
Planning Project (CEPP), the River of Grass project, and parties interested in the Everglades

Agricultural Area. The list includes a broad spectrum of interested parties encompassing private
individuals; local, county, state, and federal government and agencies; businesses; educational
institutions; elected officials at all levels; and special interest groups. Additionally, the public
scoping meeting and request for comments on the proposed project were announced on the
USACE Jacksonville District Web site at:
http://www.saj.usace.army.mil/Missions/Regulatory/PublicNotices.aspx.
In addition to posting information on the websites and mailings, the USACE conducted a
scoping meeting in West Palm Beach, Florida (Palm Beach County) on September 6, 2012 in an
effort to help identify significant issues and data gaps and to assist in evaluating the
alternatives, identifying other alternatives, and analyzing the potential impacts. The location
was selected on the basis of accessibility for the public throughout the primary regions affected
by the Proposed Action. Public stakeholders; representatives of federal, state, and local
agencies; and federally recognized Indian tribes were contacted through mail as part of the
scoping process. The mailing list was prepared using several lists of interested parties provided
by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD), the FDEP, and USACE.
As interested parties were identified, the list was updated continuously throughout
development of the EIS. Anyone who requested information on the EIS was added to the
mailing list. Persons who attended the public scoping meetings or other meetings were also
added to the list. USACE considered the results of the scoping process to develop a range of
alternative actions, including the No Action Alternative, to develop this EIS and aid in its permit
decision. The overall scoping process consisted of the following elements:
•

AGENCY AND PUBLIC COMMENTS

Comments were received as a result of the public scoping meeting and in response to the
USACE’s public notice. Comments were received verbally and written on comment cards at the
public scoping meeting, by email and by letter. The USACE considered the comments collected
during development of this EIS and all comments are included in the public administrative
record.

7.2.1 PUBLIC SCOPING MEETING – SEPTEMBER 6, 2012
Eighteen (18) people attended the scoping meeting in West Palm Beach (Table 7-1). Two
comments were received on comment cards, while five comments were made verbally (one of
which was also submitted on a comment card).

concerning the 1994 Recon Study Plan 6, and suggested pond apple slough
be restored south of Lake Okeechobee.
Verbal
Requested that a reservoir or deep FEB be evaluated as an alternative. The
alternative analysis should analyze the reservoir would have greater flow
attenuation that would have greater phosphorus reduction but would cost
more money.
Verbal
A question was asked about the difference between the A-1 and A-2 FEB.
The USACE provided a verbal response and clarified that the A1 FEB is
proposed by the SFWMD while the A-2 FEB is a separate project that is
part of the federal project, CEPP. CEPP is evaluating a separate A-2 FEB on
lands west of the A-1 project site as a federal Planning project. The EIS is
only for the SFWMD’s proposed project (the A-1 FEB) since they are
separate independent projects.
Verbal
The EIS process should compare the benefits with the cost as specified in
the White House document, Sustaining Environmental Capital: Protecting
Society and the Economy, a report completed in July 2011.

AGENCY COORDINATION

7.3.1 COOPERATING AGENCIES
The USACE invited the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the
Department of Interior (DOI), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to become a
cooperating agency on the EIS by letter dated October 9, 2012. The USEPA accepted
cooperating agency status on October 16, 2012, while the DOI accepted on October 30, 2012.
The USFWS agreed to assist with the development of the federally-listed threatened and
endangered species portion of the EIS. A separate interagency scoping meeting was deemed
not necessary and instead early agency involvement occurred during weekly phone conference
meetings and through the development of the content of the EIS.

7.3.2 U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
On February 22, 2013, the USACE consulted formally with the USFWS under the Endangered
Species Act and provide a Biological Assessment that analyzes the effects of the project on
federally listed threatened or endangered species. The USFWS provided a comment letter
dated March 27, 2013, requesting for information needed to complete the Biological Opinion.
The Corps provided the information by email on April 10, 2013.

7.3.3 STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICE
The Bureau of Archaeological Research conducted a Phase I archaeological survey of the 16,593
acre A-1 project site in September 2012. The survey was conducted to comply with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665, as amended) and Section 267 of
the Florida Statutes to consider the effects upon historic properties and historic properties
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The survey also evaluated all
potential cultural resources in the project area. The Cultural Resource Assessment Report for
the A-1 project site was completed on September 27, 2012, and provided to the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO), Division of Historical Resources. The SHPO reviewed the report
and the draft EIS and provided a letter dated March 7, 2013, that the project is unlikely to
adversely impact any historic or archaeological resources.

TRIBAL COORDINATION

The USACE notified the Seminole Tribe of Florida (Seminole Tribe) and the Miccosukee Tribe of
Indians of Florida (Miccosukee Tribe) of the NOI, public notice, and public scoping meeting. On
September 4, 2012, the Seminole Tribe requested by letter that the USACE formally invite the
Seminole Tribe to participate in the NEPA process as a cooperating agency on the EIS. The
USACE and the Seminole Tribe discussed the request by telephone on September 17 and met in
person on September 27, 2012, to discuss the process and consider all possibilities of being a
cooperating agency. After the meeting on September 27, the Seminole Tribe provided a letter
stating that the NEPA and the federal Trust responsibility of formal coordination could occur
concurrently, and outlined outstanding issues: Environmental concerns with water sources,
flow routes and operation, and impacts to tribal lands and usage rights; and cultural resource
concerns with the broader landscape of environmental restoration projects. The Seminole
Tribe stated that they would reconsider their request to be a cooperating agency on the EIS.
The Miccosukee Tribe did not provide any comments.
The USACE initiated Government-to-Government consultation with all federally recognized
Native American Indian Tribes with interests in the State of Florida, including the Seminole
Tribe, the Miccosukee Tribe, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, the Seminole Nation of
Oklahoma, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma, as well as the Tribal Historic
Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation on February 22, 2013
(Appendix J). Through personal discussions with the Miccosukee Tribe, the USACE was advised
that no comments will be provided. The USACE received comments from the Seminole Tribe on
the draft EIS and provided a written response (Appendix J). The USACE also incorporated the
Seminole Tribe’s comments in the final EIS.

Permits and Licenses

8.0 PERMITS AND LICENSES
This section summarizes the federal permits and licenses that will be required for the
action alternatives. The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) is
responsible for obtaining the required regulatory documents and approvals. Chapter 6
described compliance with environmental requirements, which includes many of the
same agencies and regulatory requirements as described below.

8.1 CLEAN WATER ACT, SECTION 404 PERMIT
The construction of the Shallow Flow Equalization Basin (FEB), Deep FEB or Stormwater
Treatment Area (STA) will require a Clean Water Act Section 404 Permit issued by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act,
discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States is subject to
Section 404 regulation. This environmental impact statement (EIS) has been prepared in
accordance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Council on
Environmental Quality Act (CEQ) regulations and will serve as the primary document to
aid the USACE in its decision to issue, issue with special conditions, or deny the Section
404 Permit for the proposed project. A permit application has been submitted to USACE.
Once a Record of Decision (ROD) has been finalized for the EIS and all NEPA
requirements completed, final agency action for the U.S. Department of the Army (DA)
404 permit decision will be made.

8.2 COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has the authority to administer
the federal Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) under the Coastal Zone
Management Act (CZMA). The purpose of the CZMP is to protect, preserve, develop,
restore, or enhance the coastal environment. States are required to develop coastal
management programs to protect and manage uses in the coastal zone. The Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) will determine CZMP consistency for
the proposed action.

8.3 SECTION 7 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
Under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), federal agencies are required to
consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and/or National Marine
Fisheries Service for activities that are funded, permitted, or carried out that may affect
federally listed species including designated critical habitat. This project would require a
Biological Opinion from the USFWS for the effects of the project on the threatened

Permits and Licenses

eastern indigo snake. The USACE is in formal consultation with the USFWS. The USFWS
will finalize the Biological Opinion prior to final agency action for the DA Section 404
permit decision.

8.4 CLEAN AIR ACT
Pump stations would be required for the action alternatives, which may require a
permit under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Final pump station designs will be in compliance
with the requirement. The SFWMD would apply for these permits during the
construction phases, which FDEP and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
would review for compliance with the requirements of the CAA.
The FDEP is responsible for Title V air permits, which regulate both major and minor
facilities based on emissions. In order to determine the applicable air permit for the
facility, there are three permitting thresholds to consider:
• Exempt from permitting: Station will consume less than 32,000 gallons per rolling
year. This is a self-implementing exemption.
• State General Permit: Station will consume less than 250,000 gallons per rolling year.
A General Permit can be obtained at least 30 days prior to operation and permit is
valid for 5 years.
• Title V Operation Permit: Station has the potential to emit more than 100 tons per
year of NOx. Title V Air Construction Permit must be issued prior to construction. It
takes about 6 to 8 months lead time to get permit and permit is valid for 5 years.
Final pump station designs will control the requirement. SFWMD will apply for the
appropriate permit during the construction phases of the project, which FDEP and
USEPA will review for compliance with the requirements of the CAA.

8.5 EVERGLADES FOREVER ACT PERMIT/SECTION 401 CERTIFICATION
Prior to issuance of a DA 404 permit, State Water Quality Certification (WQC) must be
provided. The FDEP will issue the WQC in the form of an Everglades Forever Act (EFA)
permit. Pursuant to Florida Statutes, Chapter 373.4592, Florida Legislature authorizes
FDEP to issue EFA permits to SFWMD for projects that are part of the Long-Term Plan.
EFA permits required for construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities are
issued for 5-year terms and renewed as appropriate. SFWMD has submitted an EFA
permit application to the FDEP for the Shallow FEB under file number 0313994-001 .

Permits and Licenses

8.6 NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM PERMIT FOR
OPERATIONS
The National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program
regulates point sources that discharge pollutants in waters of the United States. FDEP
administers Florida’s NPDES permits under Sections 403.088 and 403.0885 of Florida
Statute, from authority granted by USEPA. The issued NPDES permits anticipate
operation of the Shallow FEB and no modification would be required if the Shallow FEB
is authorized. If the STA alternative is authorized, the existing permits would need to be
modified once construction activites are completed.

8.7 NATIONAL POLLUTION DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM PERMIT FOR
CONSTRUCTION
An NPDES stormwater permit for construction under FAC Rule 62-621.300(4) is required
for all of the Action Alternatives. The selected contractor will apply for the NPDES
permit from FDEP and must provide a stormwater pollution prevention plan prior to
start of construction if one is required.

8.9 FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER 1996 FARM BILL, SECTION 390
The action alternatives will require the approval of the USFWS/DOI. Under Section 390
of the 1996 Farm Bill (Public Law 104-127, 110 Statue 1022, April 1996), funds were
provided to the Secretary of the Interior to fund or conduct restoration activities in the
Everglades ecosystem. Under Section 390, the Secretary of the Interior has the
responsibility to ensure that Section 390 funds are used for restoration purposes. The
project site lands were purchased with Section 390 funds and title was transferred to
the SFWMD pursuant to a Grant Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Framework
Agreement and Grant Agreement referenced in earlier chapters of this EIS, the SFWMD
must request and receive approval of the USFWS/DOI for any change in land use.
